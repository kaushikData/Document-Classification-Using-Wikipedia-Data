'''34th Street–Herald Square''' is an underground [[metro station|station]] complex on the [[BMT Broadway Line]] and the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]] of the [[New York City Subway]], and is the third-busiest station in the system with 39,672,507 passengers entering the station in 2017.&lt;ref name="2015-ridership"/&gt; It is located at [[Herald Square]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]] where [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas) intersect, and is served by the:
* '''[[D (New York City Subway service)|D]]''', '''[[F (New York City Subway service)|F]]''', '''[[N (New York City Subway service)|N]]''', and '''[[Q (New York City Subway service)|Q]]''' trains at all times

==Station layout==
{{NYCS Platform Layout 34th Street-Herald Square Station}}

This station complex has a long [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] above the platforms. Three staircases and two elevators lead to each of the two Broadway line platforms. Three pairs of escalators lead to the Sixth Avenue line platforms (two to the northbound one and one to the southbound one). There is a non-ADA-compliant ramp that leads to an intermediate level. This level has two sets of staircases leading to each of the Sixth Avenue platforms. The elevators to this level are at the north end of the mezzanine.

{{Midtown Manhattan subway cross section}}
===Exits===
At the north end of this mezzanine is the 35th Street exit, which contains a bank of turnstiles, token booth, and street stairs. Three staircases lead to all corners of Sixth Avenue and 35th Street except the southwest one. There is also a short passageway to either western corner of Broadway and 35th Street.&lt;ref name=MTA-PennStation-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Pennsylvania Station / Times Square|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M08_PennStation_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=December 11, 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this exit, the mezzanine has connections with the two entrances at Broadway/Sixth Avenue and 34th Street. The entrance on the west side is staffed full-time and has two staircases to 34th Street. The northwest staircase has an entrance to an underground [[Burger King]]. There is a long passageway containing a single street elevator that leads to [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] at [[33rd Street (PATH station)|33rd Street]]. The entrance on the east side of 34th Street is staffed part-time and when the token booth is closed, only two HEET turnstiles provide access to the mezzanine. This entrance has a passageway that connects to the 35th Street exit and has two pairs of exit-only turnstiles from the mezzanine.&lt;ref name=MTA-PennStation-2015/&gt;

There is another mezzanine at the south end of the Sixth Avenue level that has two staircases leading to each platform. It is directly underneath the PATH station mezzanine (two levels from street level) and has a passageway leading to the entrance at Broadway and 32nd Street. Outside of fare control, there is an entrance leading directly to the two basement levels of [[J. C. Penney]] in the [[Manhattan Mall]]. There are also escalators that lead to the front entrance of the mall. The entrance at Broadway and 32nd Street is unstaffed, has two street stairs, and one stair to each of the two Broadway platforms on the very south end. There are street stairs to either northern corner of Broadway and 32nd Street, as well as to the northeast corner of 6th Avenue and 32nd Street&lt;ref name=MTA-PennStation-2015/&gt;

===Passageways===
[[File:Herald Sq ramp vc.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Passageways in the station for transfers between the IND and BMT platforms]]
There are closed passageways (but not free transfers) to the adjacent [[42nd Street–Bryant Park (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|42nd Street–Bryant Park]] station to the north and to [[34th Street–Penn Station (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|34th Street–Penn Station]] on the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]].

{{anchor|Gimbels passageway}}There was once an out-of-system passageway to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] one block west. During the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway had high rates of crime, as did the rest of the city; the passageway similarly experienced high crime rates. The passageway, with only two exits–one at each end–was located under 33nd Street and was so named because it was next to the basements of the [[Gimbels]] department store and the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]]. This passageway was closed in the 1990s and passengers now must walk at street level to connect to the commuter railroads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2010/11/28/remembering-the-gimbels-tunnel/ Remembering the Gimbels tunnel], New York Post&lt;/ref&gt; A real estate developer, [[Vornado Realty Trust]], proposed in 2010 to reopen the passageway in exchange for variances to build office towers replacing existing structures in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nypost.com/2010/04/13/vornados-penn-tower-deal/ | title=Vornado’s Penn tower deal | publisher=New York Post | date=April 13, 2010 | accessdate=July 23, 2015 | author=Steve Cuozzo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pathway to [[Bryant Park]] was outside of fare control, but was intended to relieve passenger flow at the 42nd and 34th Street stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1940/05/04/1940_05_04_013_TNY_CARDS_000180572 | title=Underground | publisher=New Yorker | date=May 4, 1940 | accessdate=July 23, 2015 | author=E. J. KAHN AND HAROLD ROSS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the passageway became a gathering spot for homeless people and drug users. The passageway was closed on March 23, 1991 after a rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/23/nyregion/subway-path-boarded-shut-after-a-rape.html?pagewanted=1 | title=Subway Path Boarded Shut After a Rape | publisher=The New York Times | date=March 23, 1991 | accessdate=July 23, 2015 | author=Craig Wolff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renovations ===
On November 28, 1969, the turnstiles and exit gates at the northern end of the station were relocated, making four more staircases from the Broadway Line platforms available for transfers to the Sixth Avenue platforms. Previously, transfers could only be made from two staircases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24726178/daily_news/|title=Easier Transfer at 34th &amp; 6th|last=|first=|date=November 28, 1969|work=New York Daily News|access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This complex was overhauled in the late 1970s. The Transit Authority fixed the station's structure and renovated its appearance. The overhaul replaced the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting to the 1970s modern look wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. It also fixed staircases and platform edges. In the early 1990s, the station received another major repair, which included an upgrade for [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessibility]] and modernized wall tiling. The MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiling for the walls, installed new tiling on the floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, installing [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] safety threads along the platform edge, new signs, and new track-beds in both directions.

'''34th Street–Herald Square''' on the BMT Broadway Line is an express station that has four tracks and two [[island platform]]s. This level opened several years after the opening of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson station; the Sixth Avenue line platforms were built later.

Each platform has three staircases and one elevator to the main mezzanine on the north half and another staircase at the extreme south end to 32nd Street. North of the station are [[diamond crossover]]s in both directions that are used by '''N''' trains on weekdays when they operate express in Manhattan.

Because Queens-bound '''N''' trains switch from the express to the local track north of this station, trains are often held here until another train arrives on the opposite track. Depending on the schedule, they may not leave in the same order in which they arrived. This causes confusion among riders as they run back and forth on the northbound platform trying to catch the train that will leave first. This is also true at other stations where two services that run to the same destination stop at the same platform but do not stop on the same side of the platform, such as [[Franklin Avenue (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Franklin Avenue]] (southbound '''[[2 (New York City Subway service)|2]]''' and '''[[5 (New York City Subway service)|5]]''' trains), [[Canal Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Canal Street]] ('''[[A (New York City Subway service)|A]]''', '''[[C (New York City Subway service)|C]]''' and '''[[E (New York City Subway service)|E]]''' trains), [[59th Street–Columbus Circle (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|59th Street–Columbus Circle]] (southbound '''B''' and '''D''' trains), [[Queens Plaza (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Queens Plaza]] ('''E''', '''M''' and '''R''' trains) and [[Essex Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Essex Street]] (outbound '''[[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J/Z]]''' and '''M''' trains). ''[[The New York Times]]'' calls this ''The Subway Shuffle''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/video/2012/07/24/nyregion/100000001674657/the-subway-shuffle.html The Subway Shuffle]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, artist [[Christopher Janney]] installed "REACH New York, An Urban Musical Instrument."  The piece consists of green racks with sensors hanging along the platforms. Waving one's hands in front of the sensors creates a corresponding sound from the rack.

'''34th Street–Herald Square''' on the IND Sixth Avenue Line is an express station that has four tracks and two island platforms. The mezzanine elevators are at the north end of the station while the staircases to the Manhattan Mall entrance are at the south end. The platforms have numerous stairs and escalators leading to the main mezzanine. Stairs on both platforms lead to a non-accessible ramp leading to the mezzanine.

The platforms are not equal in length, as the northbound one is longer than the southbound one. North of this station are numerous crossovers and switches that allow trains from uptown to terminate here on the express tracks during construction and closures.

During construction on the IND portion of this station, contractors had to counter problems in their path. For one, the BMT and PATH platforms existed decades before this portion of the station was completed. Constructors had to dig deeper in order to pass the original platforms without interference, as well as avoiding wires and pipes.

Prior to the opening of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]] in November 1967, the express tracks only extended to [[bumper block]]s about {{Convert|140|feet|meters}} south of this station, though the tunnels extended for another {{Convert|260|feet|meters}} beyond that.

He wrote several books and gospel songs.

Howard was married to the former Mamie Jean Meador (1927-2013), a native of [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas|Arkadelphia]], [[Arkansas]], and the daughter of Ben and Willie Meador. In addition to son John and his wife Chrys (parents of [[Korie Robertson]], the spouse of the aforementioned Willie Robertson) the Howards had two daughters— Mary Howard Owen (whose husband is Mac) and Janice Howard Owen (with husband David). Alton and Jean Howard are interred with his primary family members, except for brother Jack Howard, at the Rocky Branch Cemetery in Union Parish.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tributes.com/show/Mamie-Jean-Meador-Howard-96000309|title=Mamie Jean Meador Howard|publisher=tributes.com|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dave Norris, the mayor of West Monroe since 1978, Howard was

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a great song writer -- he wrote very powerful music. Some years ago he gave me a copy of a hymnal in which he wrote many, if not all of the hymns. I've gone through, looked at it, and sung them numerous times. ...

'''AGAS - Antiglobalization Activists in Syria''' - is a Syrian-based collective of opponents to the neoliberal globalization. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the group uses the name al-Badil (البديل) which means the alternative.

AGAS was set up on January 1, 2003. Several of its leaders have spent years behind bars as [[Prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]].

By focusing not only political rights, but also on social and economic rights, AGAS distinguishes itself from a large part of the Syrian opposition.

Insisting on its independence, AGAS cooperates internationally with the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt]] and [[ATTAC]]. AGAS also participates in the [[World Social Forum]]. By labeling itself "[[Anti-globalization]]", rather than "[[Alter-globalization]]" AGAS distinguishes itself from ATTAC and other important parts of the movement.

The '''B&amp;O Railroad Headquarters Building''' is a historic [[office building]] at [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|2 North Charles Street]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. It is a 13-story,  220 foot [[skyscraper]] designed by the Boston and Baltimore-based architectural firm of [[J. Harleston Parker|Parker &amp; Thomas]], and constructed in 1904-1906.

==Architectural History==

"When the original [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire style]] headquarters on the corner of Baltimore and Calvert street was destroyed in the [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904, [[Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad]] executives decided to build a new 13 story steel-framed building two blocks west of the old site. The building's entrance is adorned by two sculptures: Mercury, the Roman god for commerce, and a figure named Progress of Industry, which holds a torch and a locomotive; Progress of Industry clearly invokes the company's position not only as an industry leader, but also the company's aspiration to be a vehicle of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baltimore Architecture: B&amp;O Railroad Headquarters Building|url=http://csit121.com/san181084/Project/buildings/BORailHQ.html#sthash.1ZQZsUev.ZI4NLR1P.dpbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed by the architectural firm of [[J. Harleston Parker|Parker and Thomas]] of Baltimore and Boston, assisted by Herbert D. Hale and [[Henry G. Morse]], and built by the construction firm of the brothers W. W. and E. A. Wells of Chicago. The same group had successfully teamed up a couple of years earlier on the [[Belvedere Hotel]], an eleven-story [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] building, about one mile up North Charles Street in the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]] area of downtown Baltimore.

"The 13-story office building, built in 1906, served as headquarters for the [[Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad]] for 75 years. The building's beauty and elegance of its marbled lobbies, ornate stairs and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] stained-glass windows became an instant landmark in downtown Baltimore and it symbolized the power and prestige of America's largest and oldest railroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B&amp;O Building Historic Restoration and Renovation|url=http://www.rcgarchitects.com/rcg-projects/commercial/B-and-O-building-historic-restoration-and-renovation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impressive building includes seven different kinds of marble imported from six countries representing four continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=.BlueStone Real Estate Capital Secures $48M Acquisition and Construction Loan for Iconic B&amp;O Building|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BlueStone+Real+Estate+Capital+Secures+$48M+Acquisition+and...-a0168060611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 3 floors of the exterior façade are clad in New Hampshire granite, while Bedford stone is utilized from the fourth floor and above. The trim is terra cotta tile. The building's H shape design provides for a large number of window offices. The ornate main lobby contains two white marble staircases, grand chandeliers and many decorative details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenwood Management Web Site|url=http://www.kenwoodmgt.com/property_bo_building.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the building neared completion in 1906, The Baltimore Sun ran a glowing piece under the headline, ''A Palace for B. and O. - Headquarters a Monument to City's Progressiveness'', "A model of architecture, with ornamentation and decorations, inside and out, of the richest and most up-to-date design, the new Baltimore and Ohio building, now nearing completion at the northwest corner of Baltimore and Charles Streets, opposite the new home of the Baltimore Sun, will be a lasting monument to Baltimore's progressiveness. Not only is it the largest office building in Maryland, and perhaps along the Atlantic Coast south of Philadelphia, but it ranks among the finest in the world in style and completeness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A PALAGE FOR B. AND O.: Headquarters A Monument To City's Progressiveness|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=June 24, 1906|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article went on to relate the tremendous skill of the craftsmen, the gigantic size of the structure, including 1,600 windows, and the great number of employees, who would work there, 1,000 in all, 500 of whom could be fed at any one time in the company dining room.

When the B&amp;O Headquarters Building was completed, it was the second tallest structure in Baltimore to the 16 story 249 foot [[One Calvert Plaza|Continental Trust Company Building]], two blocks away at 201 East Baltimore St., which was constructed in 1900-1901 to designs prepared by the Chicago skyscraper architect [[Daniel Burnham|D.H. Burnham and Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of tallest buildings in Baltimore]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current occupant of the building, The Hotel Monaco, rhapsodizes on its website, "The (B&amp;O) Headquarters opened its doors at midnight on September 12, 1906 to the dazzling spectacle of more than 5,000 electric lights that 'burst into fire and presented a grand spectacle', as reported by The (Baltimore) Sun. The newspaper went on to point out that Oscar G. Murray, B&amp;O Railroad president, chose to move into his office suite the next day, September 13. 'The structure is 13 stories high; Murray started in the railroad business on January 13, 1872; and he was elected the thirteenth president of the railroad,' furthered the news report. Of course, Murray's office number was 13 and his phone extension was the same.  Amusing anecdotes aside, the building is known for architectural greatness. The exterior is dignified and monumental, with beautiful carving and ornamental work showing off the craftsmanship of yesteryear. Perhaps one of the most compelling features is the building's statuary over the main entrance. Believed to predate the statuary at New York's [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and designed by John Evans &amp; Co. of Boston,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Public Library - John Evans &amp; Co. Collection |url=http://www.bpl.org/research/special/collections.htm#e |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705115712/http://www.bpl.org/research/special/collections.htm |archivedate=2013-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the figure of Mercury and an allegorical feature cradling a locomotive represent transportation and commerce."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Historical Look at Inner Harbor Hotels: The Monaco Baltimore -|url=http://www.monaco-baltimore.com/hotel/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The B&amp;O Railroad Headquarters Building lies within the Baltimore [[Business and Government Historic District]],  which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places|url=http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natreg/docs/All_Data.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2001 the City of Baltimore's Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Baltimore Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation|url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/BoardsandCommissions/HistoricalArchitecturalPreservation.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Maryland Historical Trust]] designated the B&amp;O Building one the city's ten most historically consequential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BlueStone Real Estate Capital Secures $48M Acquisition and Construction Loan for Iconic B&amp;O Building in Baltimore|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BlueStone+Real+Estate+Capital+Secures+$48M+Acquisition+and...-a0168060611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent real estate history==

The owner of the property, Baltimore and Charles Associates, went bankrupt in 2010 and the property was then subdivided into a "condominium regime" and Kimpton bought the hotel space and restaurant space for approximately $33 million and Kenwood Management Co. of Bethesda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenwood Management Company|url=http://www.kenwoodmgt.com/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  purchased the office space for $1.3 million.  Baltimore and Charles Associates, spent about $65 million to buy and renovate the B&amp;O Building from 2007 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kimpton buying part of B&amp;O Building|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-03-07/business/bs-bz-hotel-monaco-20110307_1_hotel-monaco-baltimore-b-o-building-baltimore-and-charles-associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philadelphia-based Arc Wheeler LLC, was the project's lead developer and at the time was also planning to redevelop the former McCormick &amp; Co. spice plant site at Conway and Light streets downtown, which fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baltimore’s B&amp;O Building could hit the auction block|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/print-edition/2010/11/05/baltimores-bo-building-could-hit-the.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original $48 million acquisition and construction loan for the B&amp;O Building was arranged by Philadelphia-based, BlueStone Real Estate Capital, a real estate investment bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BlueStone Real Estate Capital Secures $48M Acquisition and Construction Loan for Iconic B&amp;O Building in Baltimore|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BlueStone+Real+Estate+Capital+Secures+$48M+Acquisition+and...-a0168060611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect for the historic restoration and renovation project was RCG from Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCG Architects|url=http://www.rcgarchitects.com/rcg-projects/commercial/B-and-O-building-historic-restoration-and-renovation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration received an Award of Excellence by the Maryland Society of American Institute of Architects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maryland Society AIA|url=http://www.aiamd.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and numerous other awards for historic preservation.

==Current use==

Since 2009, following a 3-year renovation, the B&amp;O Headquarters Building has been a 202-room Hotel Monaco,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel Monaco Baltimore|url=http://www.monaco-baltimore.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Owens|first=Donna M.|title=Get a room: 5 hotels worth a visit with your Valentine|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/travel/bal-baltimore-hotels-valentines-day-pictures-20140124,0,1195.photogallery|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a [[Kimpton Hotels &amp; Restaurants|Kimpton property]], the largest boutique hotel chain in the U.S., and has housed the B&amp;O American Brasserie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B&amp;O American Brasserie|url=http://www.bandorestaurant.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has three floors of office space and BB&amp;T on the first floor.

The '''British International School of New York (BIS-NY)''' was established in 2006 at [[Waterside Plaza]], an upscale development on the [[East River]] in the [[Kips Bay]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hogwarts on the Hudson |first=Geoffrey |last=Gray |url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/16060/ |magazine=New York |date=19 February 2006 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student body is a mix of British [[expatriate]]s, American nationals and students from a mix of other countries, and includes both boys and girls. The school serves students from age three up to fourteen years old. Its facilities include a swimming pool, secured playground, gymnasium, and [[Smart Board]]s in every classroom. The school offers rolling admissions, so that children can enter the school throughout the year, as long as there is space available. This is particularly helpful for families who have been transferred internationally at short notice.

The school teaches a mix of the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|English National Curriculum]] blended with the methodology of the [[International Baccalaureate]]. French and Spanish are taught at every level of the school, with other languages available as after-school options. Individual music lessons are also offered in addition to the class lessons, and a summer camp is run through the months of June to August.

The school's enrollment has increased regularly, which has led to the school's continued expansion. Recently, the school opened a new building adjacent to the cafeteria which contains an office and two classrooms specifically designed to meet the needs of the older students as they head into [[middle school]]. From September 2018 the school launches its Upper School offering the acclaimed Cambridge International IGCSE and A-Level programme to its students.

The British International School of New York is the sister school of [[Abercorn School]] in [[London, England|London]], England.

== Clubs and extracurricular activities ==
The school has a debate team that participates in the English-speaking Union Big Apple Debate league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esuus.org/esu/programs/middle_school_debate/NYDL/|title=New York Debate League - English-Speaking Union of the United States|website=www.esuus.org|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most clubs run from 3:30pm-4:30pm on school days, though some clubs can run to 5:30 or 6:00. The clubs include Arabic, Ballet, Chess, Coding, Fencing, Global Chefs, Ice Skating, Karate, Mandarin, Robotics, Table Tennis and Yoga.

Some notable clubs of the school are Empire State of Sound (The school's show choir) and the school play. Which recent performances have included Peter Pan, Wizard of Oz, Bye Bye Birdie and Beauty and the Beast. With casts of up to 70 children from grades 3-8.

[[File:65 Liberty Street 9484.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Former headquarters of [[Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York]], the oldest Chamber of commerce in the [[United States]], established in 1768 during the British Colonial Period]]
A '''chamber of commerce''' (or '''board of trade''') is a form of [[business network]], for example, a local organization of [[business]]es whose goal is to further the interests of businesses. [[Business owner]]s in towns and cities form these local societies to advocate on behalf of the [[business sector|business community]]. Local businesses are members, and they elect a board of directors or executive council to set policy for the chamber. The board or council then hires a President, CEO or Executive Director, plus staffing appropriate to size, to run the organization.

The first chamber of commerce was founded in 1599 in [[Marseille, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cci.fr/web/organisation-du-reseau/histoire|title= 1599  Création à Marseille de la première Chambre de Commerce.|accessdate= 18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://marseille.tv/tourisme/histoire-de-marseille/|title= Le port de Marseille, qui possède la plus ancienne Chambre de Commerce de France (fondée en 1599), acquiert une notoriété Mondiale|accessdate= 18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marseilleinternationale.com/?q=1559 |title=Marseille, la Chambre, la plus vieille de France, crée en 1559 par Henri IV |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401025738/http://www.marseilleinternationale.com/?q=1559 |archivedate=1 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[André-Pierre Nouvion]], ''Origine et histoire des juridictions consulaires et des Chambres de Commerce et d'Industrie Françaises'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Another official chamber of commerce would follow 65 years later, probably{{vague|date=April 2017}} in [[Bruges]], then part of the [[Spanish Netherlands]].

The world's oldest English-speaking chamber of commerce is the [[Jersey]] Chamber founded in February 1768,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerseychamber.com/about-us |title=About Chamber |publisher=Jersey Chamber of Commerce}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same year the [[Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York|New York City Chamber]] was founded,&lt;ref name="Bishop1918"&gt;{{cite book|author= Joseph Bucklin Bishop|title= A chronicle of one hundred &amp; fifty years: the Chamber of commerce of the state of New York, 1768-1918|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=koZCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate= 8 February 2012|year= 1918|publisher= C. Scribner's sons|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest known existing chamber in the English-speaking world with continuous records, the [[Glasgow]] Chamber of Commerce,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgowchamberonline.org/page.asp?id=2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605111039/http://www.glasgowchamberonline.org/page.asp?id=2|date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1783. However, [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] Chamber of Commerce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hull-humber-chamber.co.uk/the-chamber/about-the-chamber.aspx |title= Hull Humber-chamber|publisher= hull-humber-chamber.co.uk |date= |accessdate= 28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the UK's oldest, followed by those of [[Leeds]] and of [[Belfast]] in [[Northern Ireland|present day Northern Ireland]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

As a non-governmental institution, a chamber of commerce has no direct role in the writing and passage of laws and regulations that affect businesses. It may however, [[lobbying|lobby]] in an attempt to get laws passed that are favorable to businesses.

==Characteristics==
Membership in an individual chamber can range from a few dozen to well over 800,000, as is the case with the [[Paris Île-de-France Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cci-paris-idf.fr/cci-region/contenus/expertise-services-local-action-paris-ile-de-france-regional-commerce-and-industry-your-side|title=Expertise, services, local action: the Paris Île-de-France Regional Commerce and Industry is by your side|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chamber organizations in China report even larger membership numbers. Chambers of commerce can range in scope from individual neighborhoods within a city or town up to an international chamber of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cipe.org/programs/ba/pdf/BA_VF_04-20-2007.pdf |title=Victor Fedotov, Organization and Legal Models of Chambers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=21 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106134935/http://www.cipe.org/programs/ba/pdf/BA_VF_04-20-2007.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, chambers do not operate in the same manner as the [[Better Business Bureau]] in that, while the BBB has the authority to bind its members under a formal operation doctrine (and, thus, can remove them if complaints arise regarding their services), the local chamber membership is either voluntary or required by law. In addition, Chambers represent the interests of businesses, while the BBB represents both the interests of businesses and the general public.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Some Chambers are partially funded by local government, others are non-profit, and some are a combination of the two. Chambers of commerce also can include [[economic development]] corporations or groups (though the latter can sometimes be a formal branch of a local government, the groups work together and may in some cases share office facilities) as well as tourism and visitor bureaus.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Some chambers have joined state, national (such as the United States Chamber of Commerce and the [[British Chambers of Commerce]]) and even international bodies (such as [[Eurochambres]], the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC), Worldchambers). Currently, there are about 13,000 chambers registered in the official Worldchambers Network registry, and the chamber of commerce network is the largest business network globally. This network is informal, with each local chamber incorporated and operating separately, rather than as a chapter of a national or state chamber.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Chamber models==

===Community, city and regional chambers===
Chambers of commerce in the United States can be considered community, city, regional, state, or nationwide ([[United States Chamber of Commerce]]). City Chambers work on the local level to bring the business community together to develop strong local networks, which can result in a business-to-business exchange. In most cases, city Chambers work with their local government, such as their mayor, their city council and local representatives to develop pro-business initiatives.&lt;ref name="Weir2007_121"/&gt;
There are also bilateral chambers of commerce that link the business environments of two countries (e.g. [[Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce]], Moldovan–American Chamber of Commerce).

===Community chambers===
Community chambers of commerce started{{when?|date=October 2017}} in the UK and later spread to in the US, becoming city chambers of commerce as communities developed and became larger. Community chambers of commerce are smaller and most{{quantify|date=October 2017}} have a limit on numbers of members.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url= http://www.todayschamber.com/community-chambers-of-commerce
|title= Community Chambers of Commerce|publisher= 
|accessdate= 1 October 2014
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===City chambers===
[[File:Marlborough Regional Chamber Of Commerce Exterior.jpg|thumb|240px|left|alt=The Marlborough Regional Chamber of Commerce in Marlborough, Massachusetts|The Marlborough Regional Chamber of Commerce in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]]]
City chambers of commerce have a long history in the US. The Charleston Chamber of Commerce is one of the oldest, dating back to colonial 1773.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Chamber of Commerce|title=U.S. Chamber of Commerce: The Early Years|url=https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_HistoryBook.pdf|website=U.S. Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Boston's Chamber of Commerce organized a seminal tax protest: [[Boston Tea Party|The Boston Tea Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United State Chamber of Commerce|title=U.S. Chamber of Commerce: The Early Years|url=https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_HistoryBook.pdf|website=U.S. Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 there were 2,800 chambers of commerce in the United States and 102 chambers representing U.S. businesses overseas.&lt;ref name="Weir2007_121"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Weir|title=Class in America: A-G|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7n2tJVd3YsC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=8 February 2012|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-33720-8|pages=121–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Association for Chamber of Commerce Executives (ACCE), there are approximately 3,000 chambers of commerce with at least one staff person and "thousands more established as strictly volunteer entities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acce.org/whatisachamber/ |title=What is a Chamber? |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State chambers===
State chambers of commerce are much different from local and regional chambers of commerce, as they work on state and sometimes federal issues impacting the business community. Just as the local chamber is critical to the local business community, state chambers serve a unique function, serving as a third party voice on important business legislation that impact the business community and are critical in shaping legislation in their respective state. State Chambers work with their Governor, state representatives, state senators, US congressional leaders and US Senators. In comparison with state trade associations, which serve as a voice and resource to a particular industry, state chambers are looked to as a respected voice, representing the entire business community to enhance and advocate for a better business environment.

===National and international chambers===
Understanding the National or International need for understanding and information is the key service that these level of chambers of commerce provide. These services are in most cases are at no fee or cost to their members, some of the resources offer personal and/or business services that may have a very low fee (Memberships to other association like the NRA etc.).

===Compulsory or public-law chambers===
Under the compulsory or public law model, [[Business|enterprises]] of certain sizes, types, or sectors are obliged to become members of the chamber. This model is common in [[European Union]] countries (e.g. France,&lt;ref&gt;[[André-Pierre Nouvion]], ''Chambres de commerce et d'industrie'' - Encyclopédie juridique [[Dalloz]] - Répertoire de droit commercial, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, [[Italy]], Spain, Austria), as well as Japan. Main tasks of the chambers are foreign trade promotion, vocational training, regional economic development, and general services to their members. The chambers were given responsibilities of public administration in various fields by the state which they exercise in order management. The chambers also have a consultative function; this means the chambers must be consulted whenever a new law related to industry or commerce is proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipe.org/programs/training/pdf/Chamber_Primer.pdf |title=Markus Pilgrim and Ralf Meier, Chamber Primer |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=21 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107031727/http://www.cipe.org/programs/training/pdf/Chamber_Primer.pdf |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the chambers of commerce and industry (''IHK - Industrie- und Handelskammer'') and the chambers of skilled crafts (''HwK - Handwerkskammer'') are public statutory bodies with self-administration under the inspectorate of the state ministry of economy. Enterprises are members by law according to the chamber act (''IHK-Gesetz'') of 1956. Because of this, such chambers are much bigger than chambers under private law. IHK Munich, the biggest German chamber of commerce, has 350,000 member companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IHK München|url=http://www.muenchen.ihk.de|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany also has compulsory chambers for "free occupations" such as architects, dentists, engineers, lawyers, notaries, physicians and pharmacists.

===Continental/private law chambers===
Under the private model, which exists in English-speaking countries like USA, [[Canada]] or the UK, but as well in [[Sweden]], [[Finland]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]], companies are not obligated to become chamber members.  However, companies often become members to develop their business contacts and, regarding the local chambers (the most common level of organization), to demonstrate a commitment to the local economy.  Though governments are not required to consult chambers on proposed laws, the chambers are often contacted given their local influence and membership numbers.

===Multilateral chambers===
A multilateral chamber is formed of companies (and sometimes individuals) from different countries with a common business interest towards or in a specific country. It can further be active in representing the interests of local and foreign investors in that specific country, achieved through promotion and proactivity regarding the general business environment. Multilateral chambers of commerce are independent entities strengthening business relations and interactions between all economic players, and their members may benefit from a broad range of activities that enhance the visibility and reputation of their business.

==Surveys==
In many countries Chambers of Commerce are a source of private sector information. The information is usually gathered by surveying Chamber members. The [[British Chambers of Commerce]] Quarterly Economic Survey is an example of a Chambers of Commerce survey that is used by official governmental departments as a guide to the performance of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economicsurvey.org.uk British Chambers of Commerce Quarterly Economic Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607224146/http://www.economicsurvey.org.uk/ |date=7 June 2014 }}.

'''David Hall''' (1714 – December 24, 1772) was an American printer and a business partner with [[Benjamin Franklin]] in [[Philadelphia]]. He took over Franklin's printing business and that of publishing the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' newspaper that Franklin had started. Hall formed his own printing firm in 1766 and did publishing for the government and printing of paper money.

== Early life ==
Hall was born in 1714 in [[Westfield, West Lothian|Westfield]] near [[Edinburgh, Scotland]]. His father was James Hall.{{sfn|Spencer|2012|p=503}}

== Career ==

Hall was apprenticed in 1729 for five years at the age of 15 to a printing firm in Scotland run by John Mosman and William Brown.{{r|APS}} Hall’s friend [[William Strahan (publisher)|William Strahan]] sent a letter to lawyer James Read of Philadelphia in January 1743 inquiring about opportunities for printers in the American colonies.{{sfn|Waldstreicher|2005|p=123}} Strahan first recommended Hall to his wife's cousin and described him as an honest hard working person.{{sfn|Waldstreicher|2005|p=123}} Read presented the letter to [[Benjamin Franklin]],{{sfn|Waldstreicher|2005|p=123}} who needed a journeyman printer.{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=110}} Franklin sent back a letter to Strahan on July 10 inviting Hall to come to Philadelphia for a job interview. In the letter Franklin said that if Hall didn't ultimately like the position offered, he would pay his expenses back to England. Franklin offered Hall 12 months of ''Good Work'' for the trouble of coming from England and trying the journeyman printer position.&lt;ref name=invite&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/?q=%22William%20Strahan%22%201743&amp;s=1111311111&amp;sa=&amp;r=2&amp;sr= |title= From Benjamin Franklin to William Strahan, 10 July 1743 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Founders Online |publisher=National Archives |access-date=April 29, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall accepted the offer and came to Philadelphia on June 19, 1744.{{r|APS}}

Hall adapted well to his new career and learned the skills of the printing trade. He became a professional in the eighteenth-century printing business which Franklin developed throughout Colonial America. Hall became very involved as a major participant in the printing business when he started working for Franklin in 1744.{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=110}}{{sfn|Lippincott|1917|p=272}} He became the foreman of Franklin's shop in 1746 and did all the editing and publishing of the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' newspaper that Franklin started.{{r|APS}} Franklin considered semiretirement in 1747, since Hall was an active partner.{{sfn|Waldstreicher|2005|p=123}} He made Hall an official partner on an eighteen-year contract in 1748 and went on to other interests for his full retirement.{{sfn|Donovan|1962|p=47}}{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=25}}{{sfn|Doren|1945|p=55}} The printing business became known as the Franklin and Hall firm.{{sfn|Spencer|2012|p=503}}{{sfn|Lemay|2014|p=81}}

Franklin completed the sale of his share of the printing business to Hall in February 1766.{{r|APS}} William Sellers became a journeyman printer for Hall and was a skillful printer. In May 1766 Hall made Sellers a partner in his business. The new firm of Hall and Sellers printed all of the official documents for the government of the [[Province of Pennsylvania]], including its paper money. Hall also had a book store connected to the printing shop that sold books and stationary that he produced.{{r|APS}}

== Personal ==
Hall married Mary Leacock (Laycock) on January 7, 1748 at [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] in Philadelphia. They had four children.{{sfn|Spencer|2012|p=503}}

== Memberships ==
Hall was a member of the St. Andrews Society and printed its documents. Hall was a member of the Union Library Company that later became part of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]]. In 1762 he was Master of a [[Freemasonry|Mason]] lodge in Philadelphia.{{r|APS}}

The [[American Philosophical Society]] made Hall a member on March 8, 1768. He did not participate except in 1771 when he was a member of a committee to set a selling price for its publication of its transactions, which he published.{{r|APS}}

== Contributions ==
Hall was a contributor to the [[Pennsylvania Hospital]], the [[College of Philadelphia]], the Philadelphia Contributorship fire insurance company,{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=58}} and the Philadelphia Silk Society.&lt;ref name=APS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/collections/view?docId=ead/Mss.B.H142.k-ead.xml; |title=David Hall: Printing partner of Benjamin Franklin|last1=Kany |first1=Robert Hurd |last2= |first2= |date=1963  |website=Manuscripts |publisher=American Philosophical Society |access-date=April 29, 2016 |quote= In February 1766 Franklin sold his share in the business to Hall. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''eWeek''|noerror}} &lt;!-- overrides Infobox magazine, which uppercase the initial --&gt;
'''''eWeek''''' (''Enterprise Newsweekly'', stylized as ''eWEEK'') is a technology and business [[magazine]], owned by [[QuinStreet]].  The magazine was acquired in 2012 by QuinStreet from the company Ziff-Davis, owner of the publication for all of its life up to that point, along with Baseline.com, ChannelInsider.com,  CIOInsight.com, and WebBuyersGuide.com.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/btob/quinstreet-acquires-ziff-davis-enterprise/285537/|title=QuinStreet acquires Ziff Davis Enterprise|last=Callahan|first=Sean|date=February 6, 2012|work=Ad Week|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''eWeek'' was started under the name ''PCWeek'' on February 28, 1984.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eweek.com/it-management/eweek-at-25-a-look-at-the-publication-s-audacious-beginnings-and-exciting-future|title=eWEEK at 25: A Look at the Publication's Audacious Beginnings and Exciting Future|work=eWEEK|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The magazine was called ''PCWeek'' all the way up until the year 2000, during which time it covered the rise of business computing in America; as ''eWeek'', it has increased its online presence and covers more kinds of worldwide technologies.

== History ==
''PCWeek'' was formed under the notion that computers could be used as business tools. The world of personal computing was changing as processing power grew exponentially.  This new computational ability made computers a new and very effective business tool, and soon enough all sorts of companies were buying IBM PCs.  ''PCWeek'' took advantage of this rising popularity by becoming the one stop source for all things business-computing oriented.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/30-years-ago-pc-week-chronicles-explosive-growth-of-ibm-compatible-pcs|title=30 Years Ago: PC Week Chronicles Explosive Growth of IBM-Compatible PCs|work=eWEEK|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important members of the team that started ''PCWeek'' were John Dodge, the first news editor, Lois Paul, the first features editor, and Sam Whitmore, the first reporter who later went on to become editor-in-chief.

Although ''PCWeek''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s official first publication was February 28, 1984, a "sample version" of the magazine was available at a [[COMDEX]] convention in 1983.  At the time, the concept of ''PCWeek'' was a "radical idea".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Few saw any real need for a "weekly news magazine about personal computers" that was business-oriented.  In addition, many magazines at the time already covered business computing, such as [[Datamation]] and [[Computerworld]].  There were also magazines dedicated to hobbyist machines, so it seemed there was no place for a weekly issue to fit in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Once the first few publications came out, it seemed like these initial suspicions had been correct.  The first month of weekly issues had only 22 pages of advertising on average, well below industry standard.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;citation pending&lt;/ref&gt;

After a rocky first few months, things began to turn around.  ''PCWeek'' began establishing itself as the best source for information on business computing.  The magazine started breaking big stories before anyone else would.  Such as news on a "new version of the Compaq", the "IBM PC AT", and the new "Intel 80286 processor".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The magazine also provided extensive reviews for PCs capable of helping to run businesses.  John Pallatto, a writer for ''PCWeek'' in its first year, produced a full "buyer's guide" on all DOS-compatible PCs on the market.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/pc-week-eweek-chronicler-of-the-pc-revolution-for-25-years|title=PC WEEK/eWEEK: Chronicler of the PC Revolution for 25 years|work=eWEEK|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the first year, ''PCWeek''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s numbers had skyrocketed.  The average number of advertising pages for the last month was 74.875.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The publication owed its resounding success to the increasing popularity of IBM PCs,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but also to their style of reporting.  Sam Whitmore describes it as "gritty, kick the door down, break your secret plans" and says that they had "so much fun spoiling people's days".  David Strom, the executive editor in charge of "reviews, opinion, and analysis" at the time identified their "direct contact with industry leaders" as part of why they were able to break such killer stories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''PCWeek's'' audience was also important to their success.  Early promotional publications from ''PCWeek'' show them describing their key audience as "volume buyers", that is, people and companies that would buy PCs in bulk for business purposes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  With this the magazine was able to show big computer companies that advertising in an issue of ''PCWeek'' was the best possible way to get their product seen by the biggest and most important buyers.

Following the turn-around success in its first couple of years, ''PCWeek'' only got better.  Important people involved in between ''PCWeek's'' initial success and change to ''eWeek'' were David Strom, Sam Whitmore, Mike Edelhart, [[Gina Smith (author)|Gina Smith]], Peter Coffee, Paul Bonner, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://strom.wordpress.com/2013/08/06/pcweek-2/|title=In tribute to PC Week’s original staffers|last=Strom|first=David|date=2013-08-06|website=David Strom's Web Informant|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team behind the magazine was getting better and better.  Jim Louderback, a lab director at ''PCWeek'' as of 1991, describes how they were able to "get a product in on Wednesday, [review it], and have it on the front page on Monday" and that "that was something we were the first to do".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The publication was "perfectly positioned" to be the source for all information on what PCs were worth looking at for business purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They broke stories spoiling products from [[IBM]], [[Lotus Development|Lotus]], and others as a result of incredible work by reporters like [[Gina Smith (author)|Gina Smith]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://strom.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/pc-week/|title=25 Years of PC Week|last=Strom|first=David|date=2009-11-01|website=David Strom's Web Informant|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to its name-change, ''PCWeek'' began building an online presence.  They were one of the first magazines to do so, and they had reviews about and coverage of the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] that were "ahead of the game".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The switch to the name ''eWeek'' and an even greater online presence was overseen by Eric Lundquist, editor-in-chief at the time.

Finally, in 2012, ''eWeek'' and other Ziff Davis assets were acquired by the company [[QuinStreet]], which now runs many tech-oriented publications.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Evolution ==
''PCWeek'' evolved as the whole PC Industry evolved.  The early success of the IBM PC and the [[VisiCalc|Visicalc]] and [[Lotus 1-2-3]] spreadsheet programs gave ''PCWeek'' the coverage they needed to get on their feet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The magazine also developed a very active audience of people telling the team at ''PCWeek'' "about their experiences, good and bad, as they worked with the products".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; So ''PCWeek'' was also able to evolve with feedback from their active readers.

In the 21st century, business PCs have gone from "supporting" businesses to "driving" them, and there's been an increasing need for "unbiased, expert testing of the technology".  ''eWeek'' has become much more oriented towards "Lab-based product evaluation" as a result of this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In terms of news, ''eWeek'' now covers all different sorts of tech, and they focus mainly on things like cloud computing, mobile technology, data center and infrastructure, security and enterprise applications, as well as IT careers and leadership information.&lt;ref name="prn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eweek-magazine-increases-investment-in-editorial--circulation-reveals-new-look-70806277.html|title=eWEEK Magazine Increases Investment in Editorial &amp; Circulation; Reveals New Look|date=April 7, 2003|work=PR Newswire|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''eWeek'' has stated their mission as hoping to provide technology decision-makers with a mix of breaking news, analysis, trends, and reviews to help them make educated IT buying decisions.&lt;ref name="prn" /&gt;

== Influence ==
''PCWeek'' had a key influence on the PC Industry that it covered.  The magazines success contributed to the success of business PCs just as the success of business PCs contributed to the success of ''PCWeek''.  Following the magazine's success, "Anybody who had anything to do with buying PC products in a corporate environment" sought after access to a ''PCWeek'' subscription.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; John Pallatto characterizes the rise of PCs in 1985 as a "social phenomenon", and says that "the most sought-after status symbol on Wall Street in 1985... was the key to unlock the power switch on an IBM PC AT".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is also said that "in those early days", ''PCWeek'' could help make a small startup "PC maker" or "software developer" successful with only "a few column inches of editorial".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The stories ''PCWeek'' covered were also important, and ended up having noticeable effects on the industry.  Each issue would break stories that would completely spoil the secret plans of some big tech company, resulting in faster adoption of new technologies as information was spread about them before they were even out.  One story from ''PCWeek'' that is well known is their coverage of "the famous 1994 flaw in the numerical processor in Intel's Pentium chip".  The news they broke on Intel's processor, along with other research, cause Intel to actually pull back and fix their chips before offering new ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another famous part of ''PCWeek'' was the fictional gossip columnist by the name of "Spencer F. Katt".   The column would cover all sorts of rumors and gossip about the PC Industry, and the character of Spencer F. Katt became a famous icon of the entire world of computing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2859">'''Enrollment Management''' is a term that is used frequently in higher education to describe well-planned strategies and tactics to shape the enrollment of an institution and meet established goals.  Plainly stated, enrollment management is an organizational concept and a systematic set of activities designed to enable educational institutions to exert more influence over their student enrollments. {{ref|hossler}}

Such practices often include marketing, admission policies, retention programs, and financial aid awarding. Strategies and tactics are informed by collection, analysis, and use of data to project successful outcomes. Activities that produce measurable improvements in yields are continued and/or expanded, while those activities that do not are discontinued or restructured. Competitive efforts to recruit students is a common emphasis of enrollment managers.

The numbers of universities and colleges instituting offices of "enrollment management" have increased in recent years. These offices serve to provide direction and coordination of efforts of multiple offices such as admissions, financial aid, registration, and other student services. Often these offices are part of an enrollment management division.

Some of the typical aims of enrollment management include:

* Improving yields at inquiry, application, and enrollment stages. {{ref|citation1}}
* Increasing net revenue, usually by improving the proportion of entering students capable of paying most or all of unsubsidized tuition ("full-pays") {{ref|quirk}}
* Increasing demographic diversity {{ref|citation2}}
* Improving retention rates 
* Increasing applicant pools

According to Matthew Quirk {{ref|quirk3}}:
:More-advanced enrollment managers also tend to focus as much on retaining admitted students as on deciding whom to recruit and accept. They smooth out administrative hassles, guarantee at-risk students the advising and academic help they need, and ensure that the different parts of the university's bureaucracy work together to get students out the door with a degree.

'''Eric Leslie Gandar Dower''' (1894 &amp;ndash; 4 October 1987) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist Party]] politician and businessman.

He was educated at [[Brighton College]], like his elder brother Leonard, and at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], and trained for the stage at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], touring with a number of theatre companies.

Gandar Dower established [[Aberdeen Airport]] and pioneered Scottish Air Lines between [[Aberdeen]] and [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Wick, Highland|Wick]], [[Thurso]], [[Kirkwall]], and [[Stromness]], as well as the first [[United Kingdom|British]]/[[Norway|Norwegian]] Air Line between [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Stavanger]] in 1937. 
He served as a Flight Lieutenant in the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] from 1940 to 1943. 

Following the War, he was elected as Conservative [[Member of Parliament]] for  [[Caithness and Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness and Sutherland]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] with a majority of just 6 in the tightest ever three-way marginal: just 61 votes separated him from the third-placed candidate, [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] parliamentary leader [[Archibald Sinclair]]. Sinclair had acted as [[Secretary of State for Air]] during [[World War II]] and could not spend much time in his constituency, Britain's northernmost mainland seat. 

Gandar Dower had based his 1945 election platform on serving as a wartime MP until the end of the conflict with [[Japan]]. His election address stated, "If I am returned I shall resign when Japan is beaten and stand again at the by-election which will follow, so that you can decide whether you wish me to continue as your representative in peace" and followed this up with an eve-of-poll "special message" stating, "Note - Gandar Dower, if elected, has pledged himself to resign at the end of the Japanese war and to stand again at the resultant by-election."''

In his victory speech at the declaration, he said, "Don't regard me as a Unionist. I am a member of the National Party until the end of the Japanese war, when you will then have a chance again to put me in or out."&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Tuesday, 19 Nov 1946; pg. 5; Issue 50612; col D &lt;/ref&gt;

After the war ended on 14 August 1945, Gandar Dower did not resign, but pledged to do so "later".&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Monday, 25 Feb 1946; pg. 2; Issue 50385; col C&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 14 February 1946, Gandar Dower announced that he would shortly be resigning his seat but later withdrew the resignation.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Friday, 15 Feb 1946; pg. 2; Issue 50377; col C&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 1946, Gandar Dower offered to resign in the New Year, citing the marriage of his Private Secretary as a reason, but he withdrew this resignation on 11 February, citing the "rumours and cross-rumours" in the press which had been caused by his announcement, and how they "have been damaging to the Unionist cause."&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, 28 Dec 1946; pg. 4; Issue 50644; col F ; The Times, Wednesday, 12 Feb 1947; pg. 4; Issue 50683; col E ; The Times, Monday, 17 Feb 1947; pg. 5; Issue 50687; col F&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 1947, ''The Times'' reported, "With the forthcoming fusion of the [[Caithness]] and [[Sutherland]] Conservative Associations it is certain that there will be no by-election in this constituency. Backed by the unanimous support of both associations, Mr. E.L. Gandar Dower, the Conservative MP for Caithness and Sutherland, will hold his seat probably until the next General Election."&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Monday, 30 Jun 1947; pg. 4; Issue 50800; col D&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 15 September 1948 meeting of his local Conservative Association, he attempted to bring matters to a head by calling on the association to renominate him as the Conservative candidate for a by-election that he now intended to trigger. He was overwhelmingly defeated, with only 8 members voting for him to follow through with this course of action and numerous members expressing their dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Thursday, 16 Sep 1948; pg. 3; Issue 51178; col C&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, he declared that he would be standing at the next general election as an Independent, and from 3 October 1948, he withdrew from the Conservative whip.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Monday, 4 Oct 1948; pg. 5; Issue 51193; col A&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 1948, the Caithness and Sutherland Conservatives selected [[David Robertson (UK politician)|David Robertson]] to replace Gandar Dower. In the event, Gandar Dower decided not to seek re-election at all, and he retired at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]].

Gandar Dower's brother, [[Alan Gandar Dower|Alan]], also served as a Conservative member of parliament, while another, [[Kenneth Gandar-Dower|Kenneth]], was a leading explorer and navigator.&lt;ref&gt;Malies, J. (2004) "Dower, Kenneth Cecil Gandar- (1908–1944)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; All used different versions of their surname: Gandar Dower, Dower and Gandar-Dower respectively.

Lauder, an executive at Estée Lauder, created the [[Clinique]] [[brand name]] and developed its [[product line]].&lt;ref name=pbdn&gt;{{cite news|first=Michelle|last=Dargan|title=Service to be Monday for Evelyn Lauder, beauty exec and pink ribbon co-creator|url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/service-to-be-monday-for-evelyn-lauder-beauty-1966283.html|work=[[Palm Beach Daily News]]|date=2011-11-13|accessdate=2011-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513210413/http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/service-to-be-monday-for-evelyn-lauder-beauty-1966283.html|archivedate=2012-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as the training director for Clinique and was the first person to wear the trademark white [[lab coat]], now worn by Clinique salespeople at cosmetic departments worldwide.&lt;ref name=pbdn/&gt;

==Breast cancer activist==
Lauder personally raised much of the $13.6 million that went to create the '''Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center''' at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], which opened in October 1992 and focuses on the treatment and diagnosis of breast cancer. She helped raise an additional $5 million to create an endowment to be used to fund [[clinical research]] there.&lt;ref name=NYT1995/&gt;

''Self'' magazine's first annual issue for [[National Breast Cancer Awareness Month]] came after an April 1991 lunch at the [[21 Club]], at which Lauder discussed ideas for articles about breast cancer with her friend [[Alexandra Penney]], who was then serving as editor of ''[[Self (magazine)|Self]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brozan, Nadine. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9D0CE7D8133FF932A1575AC0A967958260 "Chronicle"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 21, 1991. Accessed January 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Penney, Lauder established [[The Breast Cancer Research Foundation]] and formalized the [[pink ribbon]] as a symbol for [[breast cancer awareness]] as part of ''Self'' magazine's second annual Breast Cancer Awareness Month issue in 1992. Penney's inspiration to improve on the success of the magazine's first annual issue was to create a ribbon that would be placed in Estee Lauder's New York City stores. Lauder made the commitment to have the ribbons placed on the company's cosmetics counters across the United States.&lt;ref name=CNN2009&gt;Romans, Christine.

Accessed January 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1993, Lauder had overseen the creation of a new shade called Pink Ribbon that was part of her personal and corporate effort to raise breast cancer awareness. Her husband paid for the cost of registering The Breast Cancer Research Foundation in all 50 states. By the start of 1995, some $900,000 had been raised for the foundation, including $120,000 from the sale of Pink Ribbon lipstick and blusher and $190,000 from the sale of the [[Clinique]] Berry Kiss pink lipstick.&lt;ref name=NYT1995/&gt;

By October 2008, the Estée Lauder Companies estimated that the firm's Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign had raised $335 million towards research and distributed 80 million pink ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esteelauder.com/about/breast_cancer_awareness.tmpl Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207204700/http://www.esteelauder.com/about/breast_cancer_awareness.tmpl |date=2009-02-07 }}, [[Estée Lauder Companies]].

'''Ferdinand Julian Egeberg''' (23 November 1842 – 12 September 1921) was a Norwegian military officer, chamberlain and timber merchant. He is remembered for having founded the sports prize [[Egebergs Ærespris]], which was regarded as the highest achievement in Norwegian sport.

==Personal life==
Egeberg was born in [[Moss, Norway|Moss]]  in [[Østfold]], Norway. He was the son of merchant Peder Cappelen Egeberg and Hanna Wilhelmine Scheel.&lt;ref name=stoo&gt;{{cite book|title=Den kongelige norske Sankt Olavs Orden 1847-1947|first=O. Delphin|last=Amundsen|authorlink=Otto Delphin Amundsen|page=251|year=1947|publisher=Grøndahl|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a brother of [[Einar Westye Egeberg, Sr.]] and a grandson of [[Westye Egeberg]].&lt;ref name=snl-egeberg&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Egeberg|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Egeberg|editor=Henriksen, Petter|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delphin|last=Amundsen|page=251|year=1947|publisher=Grøndahl|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son [[Westye Parr Egeberg]] was a notable landowner. Through their daughter Esther Lucy Egeberg he was grandfather of painter and writer [[Ferdinand Finne]].&lt;ref name=snl-egeberg&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Egeberg|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Egeberg|editor=Henriksen, Petter|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]] in 1921, aged 78.&lt;ref name=stoo/&gt;

==Career==
Egeberg was a naval officer from 1863, and served in the British [[Royal Navy]] from 1865. He was [[first lieutenant]] [[à la suite]] from 1874, and discharged in 1875.&lt;ref name=stoo/&gt; Together with his brother Einar, he took over his family's [[Oslo|Christiania]]-based timber company [[Westye Egeberg &amp; Co]] in 1874, after the death of their father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Egeberg, Einar Westye|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=Bull, Edvard |editor-link=Edvard Bull, Sr. |editor2=[[Einar Jansen|Jansen, Einar]]|edition=1st|first=S.

He served as [[Chamberlain (office)|Cabinet Chamberlain]] ({{lang-sv|kabinettskammarherre}}) for [[Oscar II of Sweden]] from 1887 to 1905.&lt;ref name=stoo/&gt;

Egeberg was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] in 1891. He was a Commander, First Class of the Danish [[Order of the Dannebrog]], Knight Grand Officer of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]], Officer of the French [[Légion d'honneur]], Commander of the Spanish [[Order of Charles III]], Knight Grand Officer of the Spanish [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] and the Swedish [[Order of the Polar Star]], and recipient of 
[[King Oscar II]]'s Anniversary Medal.&lt;ref name=stoo/&gt;

==Egebergs Ærespris==
Upon his 75th birthday in 1917, Egeberg donated {{NOK|10,000|lk=yes}} to the sports association [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports|Norges Riksforbund for Idræt]]. The donation was basis for the sports prize ''[[Egebergs Ærespris|Kabinetskammerherre Egebergs ærespris for alsidig idrett]]''. According to the original statutes approved in 1920, the fund's interests should be used for a stauette given to a sportsperson who, during the last two years, had excelled in one sport and also showed eminent performances in another, completely different sport. Egeberg also funded a design competition for the trophy, won by sculptor [[Magnus Vigrestad]]. The statuette became regarded as the highest achievement in Norwegian sport at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3208">'''Flame treatment''' is the application of a gas flame to the surface of a material to improve [[adhesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aerogen flame treatment improves surface adhesion |publisher=[[Materials Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FarrisPozzoli2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farris|first1=Stefano|last2=Pozzoli|first2=Simone|last3=Biagioni|first3=Paolo|last4=Duó|first4=Lamberto|last5=Mancinelli|first5=Stefano|last6=Piergiovanni|first6=Luciano|title=The fundamentals of flame treatment for the surface activation of polyolefin polymers – A review|journal=Polymer|volume=51|issue=16|year=2010|pages=3591–3605|issn=0032-3861|doi=10.1016/j.polymer.2010.05.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polyolefin]]s, especially [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] bond poorly, because they consist of long non-[[Chemical polarity|polar]] molecules.  Without special treatment, adhesives, ink, and other coatings cannot be applied to these materials.  By rapidly applying intense heat to a surface, molecular chains are broken and polar functional groups are added.  Flame treatment also burns off dust, fibers, oils, and other surface contaminates.

Flame treatment is faster than corona treatment, but requires more complicated and expensive equipment.

==Process==
[[File:Blow Torch (3257353199).jpg|thumb|Flame from fuel premixed with air]]
Fuel gas is pre-mixed with air, and the resulting [[Flame#Color|flame]] is directed at the surface to be treated.  The flame has a light blue inner cone, called primary, and a dull blue outer cone, called secondary.  The hottest part of the flame is the primary, which may be up {{nowrap|to 1800 °C.}}  The tip of the inner cone (primary) contains an assortment of highly reactive chemicals, including unburned oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] [[Allotropes of oxygen#Atomic oxygen|atomic oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]] and [[Hydroxyl radical|hydroxyl (OH)]].

To treat a surface quickly and evenly, many gas jets, similar to the one on the right, are lined up in a long row on a single burner.  The material being treated is quickly passed directly in front of or under the inner cones.  The surface is in contact with the flame for less than a second.  The surface is treated quickly, without time for the material to melt.

The reactive [[chemical species]] in the gas flame break the long-chain molecules in the plastic material, and attach themselves to the break points, resulting in polar point charges on the surface.  On a microscopic scale, the surface also becomes rougher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The principle of flame treatment |publisher=Arcotec GmbH |url=http://www.arcotec.com/en/Flamme.htm |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32770">'''Fund governance''' refers to a system of checks and balances and work performed by the governing body (board) of an [[investment fund]] to ensure that the fund is operated in the best interests of the fund and its investors.&lt;ref name="SEC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ic-26520.htm|title=Investment Company Governance|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=16 January 2006 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of fund governance is to uphold the regulatory principles commonly known as the four pillars of investor protection that are typically promulgated through the investment fund regulation applicable in the jurisdiction of the fund.&lt;ref name="Shadab"/&gt; These principles vary by jurisdiction and in the US, the [[Investment Company Act of 1940|1940 Act]] generally ensure that: (i) The investment fund will be managed in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives, (ii) The assets of the investment fund will be kept safe, (iii) When investors redeem they will get their pro rata share of the investment fund’s assets, (iv) The investment fund will be managed for the benefit of the fund’s shareholders and not its service providers.&lt;ref name="SEC2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1999/spch279.htm|title=Maintaining the Pillars of Protection in the New Millennium|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=21 May 1999 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fund governance structures==
===Offshore investment funds===
Offshore investment funds are typically formed as companies in the [[Cayman Islands]] (85%).&lt;ref name="MourantOzannes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mourantozannes.com/media/452717/the-cayman-islands-a-guide-for-hedge-fund-managers.pdf|title=The Cayman Islands: A Guide for Hedge Fund Managers|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=April 2014 |publisher=[[Mourant Ozannes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ELTOMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eltoma-global.com/en/jurisdictions/cayman-islands/hedge-fund.html|title=Hedge Fund|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=April 2014 |publisher=[[Eltoma Global]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; When an investment fund is formed as a company, its governing body is its board of directors. In this context, fund governance is commonly referred to as “fund directorships” or “independent director services”.&lt;ref name="Hedgeweek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2013/06/04/185273/independent-directors-considerations-and-queries|title=Independent Directors: Considerations and Queries|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=27 January 2014 |work=[[Hedge Week]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offshore funds are commonly structured as a “[[Master-feeder|feeder]]” funds that will generally invest all monies received directly into a “[[Master-feeder|master]]” fund.&lt;ref name="HF Law"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.dmsoffshore.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/HFLR-Reprint-04_11_13-How-Can-Hedge-Fund-Managers-Use-Advisory-Committees-to-Manage-Conflicts-of-Interest-and-Mitigate-Operational-Risks-Part-1-and.pdf|title=How Can Hedge Fund Managers Use Advisory Committees to Manage Conflicts of Interest and Mitigate Operational Risks? (Part One of Two)|volume=6|issue=5|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=11 April 2011 |work=[[Hedge Fund Law Report]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Onshore investment funds===
Onshore investment fund are typically formed as [[limited partnership|limited partnerships (LPs)]] in the United States, most commonly in [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name="SSRN"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2265663|title=Are Hedge Funds Registered in Delaware Different?|date=December 2014 |publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds typically serve as the “master” fund to the offshore feeder fund.&lt;ref name="HF Law"/&gt;  The governing body (board) of the LP is its [[General partnership|general partner (GP)]] which is usually under the sole control and direction of the investment manager or fund sponsor. This structure is increasingly being challenged by institutional investors&lt;ref name="Gerald Kerner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hflawreport.com/issue/296|title=Indemnification Stanley Druckenmiller's Counsel Provides a Tutorial for Negotiating Exculpation, Indemnification, Redemption, Withdrawal and Amendment Provisions in Hedge Fund Governing Documents|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=5 February 2014 |work=[[Hedge Fund Law Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Druckenmiller"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-28/druckenmiller-lawyer-takes-on-hedge-funds-over-contracts|title=Druckenmiller Lawyer Takes On Hedge Funds Over Contracts|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=28 January 2014 |work=[[Bloomberg News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other stakeholders  to implement more independent governance and investor friendly mechanisms typically in the form of [[advisory boards]] or independent GPs or managing members.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Law"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bna.com/hedge-fund-governance-and-sec-enforcement-proceedings/|title=Hedge Fund Governance and SEC Enforcement Proceedings|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=21 October 2013 |publisher=Bloomberg BNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unit trusts===
Investment funds can also be formed as unit trusts with a board of trustees as its governing body.&lt;ref name="Unit Trust"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/uit.htm|title=Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=21 October 2013 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of governance==
The role of fund governance comprises both [[fiduciary duties]] and responsibilities owed by the governing body (board).&lt;ref name="Shadab"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2234482|author=Shadab, Houman B.|title=Hedge Fund Governance|date=19 November 2013 |publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fiduciary duties are prescribed by the applicable laws of the fund’s jurisdiction and are inviolable. Responsibilities are prescribed through contractual terms in the various fund documents.&lt;ref name="SEC1"/&gt; Fund governance responsibilities can vary widely between investment funds because fund documents are commonly negotiated between fund stakeholders based on their various (often competing) requirements and objectives. Although the objective of fund governance is investor protection, fiduciary duties typically require the board to act in the best interest of a fund taken as whole and not any particular investor.&lt;ref name="SEC2"/&gt;

==Key differences between fund governance and corporate governance==
Fund governance is often conflated with corporate governance. Although some principles and practices appear similar, there are important differences.&lt;ref name="AIMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aima.org/en/education/aimajournal/past-articles/index.cfm/jid/4898EC23-66AA-4065-8EAD6137DEBC8126|title=Corporate governance challenges for hedge fund boards|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=March 2014 |publisher=[[Alternative Investment Management Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notably:

===Legal structure===
Not all funds are formed as corporations and the legal form of the fund structure does not remove the need for sound fund governance.&lt;ref name="SEC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEC2"/&gt;

===Employees===
Unlike corporations, investment funds typically don't have any employees to manage or lead.&lt;ref name="AIMA"/&gt; Corporate directors have more authority and a more complex set of duties to execute, such as approving major corporate investment and financial policies, monitoring diverse accounting systems, and selecting and terminating top corporate executives. Compared to hedge funds, the regulatory and competitive issues facing each company are highly idiosyncratic.&lt;ref name="Clifford"&gt;{{Citation|author=Clifford, Christopher|date=2014|title=Hedge Fund Boards|publisher=University of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment funds operate by appointing service providers under service agreements with the fund and each service provider is governed by its own governing body independently of the fund.&lt;ref name="AIMA"/&gt;  This means that fund directors do not have any authority to direct the affairs of the service providers to the fund other than under the contractual responsibilities outlined in the service agreement.  Day-to-day managerial responsibilities are typically delegated to the investment manager and fund administrator. Compared to large corporations, hedge funds are relatively homogenous, and the duties of their directors are relatively limited and standardized. These factors should reduce the required time investment and increase the scalability of the director's human capital such that it can be employed efficiently across many funds.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

===Investors===
Corporations offer their shares publicly and widely typically with no qualification requirements.  Funds offer their shares privately on a restricted basis to sophisticated investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sophisticatedinvestor.asp Investopedia "Sophisticated Investor"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategy===
Corporations don’t have a rulebook (like an [[offering circular|offering memorandum]]) or delegated structure so corporate directors are responsible for formulating and implementing strategy to ensure the success of the corporation.  Corporate directors have a dual role of adviser and monitor, but this is not the case in a fund. Fund directors typically serve as a monitor since the fund is usually formed to pursue the investment objective defined by the investment manager as negotiated and agreed in the fund documents by its various stakeholders.  Fund directors will typically not have any responsibility for the investment strategy as the investment manager is not an employee of the fund unlike the CEO in a corporation.  Thus, “the advisory role of hedge fund directors is limited when compared to that of corporate directors.  For example, hedge fund directors do not advise the manager on portfolio strategy or security selection.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

==Growth of the professional fund governance firm==
Fund governance became a major fund servicing industry following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]] “spurred (by) several media reports arguing that professional directors must be too busy to provide the appropriate level of monitoring for their clients.”&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; Consequently, many fund governance firms proliferated in response to perceived demand for independent directors for hedge funds and the low barriers to entry evident in the industry. A ‘[[gold rush]]’ mentality developed worldwide after articles by the Financial Times&lt;ref name = "FT 20112011a"&gt;{{cite news| title= Cayman directors sit on hundreds of boards|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/913e31b6-114a-11e1-a95c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3fxldNH3L |accessdate=28 December 2014|work=FT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the New York Times&lt;ref name = "DealbookNY01072012b"&gt;{{cite news| title= Serving on Many Boards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/02/business/dealbook/serving-on-many-boards.html|accessdate=28 December 2014|work=DealBook}}&lt;/ref&gt; sensationalized fund directors in the Cayman Islands as having ‘hundreds’ of directorships.&lt;ref name = "FT 20112011b"&gt;{{cite news| title= Less is more for Cayman ‘jumbo-directors’|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0ef083c8-1157-11e1-a95c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3fxldNH3L |accessdate=28 December 2014|work=FT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "DealbookNY01072012"&gt;{{cite news| title= In Caymans, It’s Simple to Fill a Hedge Fund Board|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/in-caymans-its-simple-to-fill-a-hedge-fund-board/?_r=0 |accessdate=28 December 2014|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DealbookNY01072012b"/&gt; Serving as a fund director was portrayed as a [[sinecure]]  because anyone, anywhere in the world, could serve as a director on a Cayman Islands mutual fund (the FT articles were later critiqued by the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'').&lt;ref name="CJR"&gt;{{Citation|author=Chittum, Ryan|date=11 November 2011|title=FT Style Undermines A Good Investigation|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this critical media scrutiny, the [[Cayman Islands Monetary Authority]] implemented a number of reforms under the [[Cayman Islands Directors Registration and Licensing Law, 2014|Director Registration and Licensing Law, 2014]] which required all directors of Cayman Islands regulated mutual funds to become regulated.  As of 31 May 2015, the [[Cayman Islands Monetary Authority]] reported that there were 8,879 directors on Cayman Islands funds of which only 422 were based in the Cayman Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimoney.com.ky/ Cayman Islands Monetary Authority "CIMA"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional firms vs. proprietors==
Fund governance providers range from limited-resourced, proprietorships of part-time directors (or so-called ‘boutique’ firms) to fully resourced professional services firms of full-time directors, “organized similarly to large law or accounting firms”.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; In many parts of the world, serving as a fund director remains a [[cottage industry]]  where proponents argue that fund governance is different from the other services provided to the fund and not adaptable to the professional firm approach.  This mindset appears to be supported by the law in several jurisdictions that mandate that only “natural persons” provide director services.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; Opponents  of the proprietor approach argue that boards should not be “dominated by part-timers at a time when they need to be vigilant about avoiding future crises”&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; and that professional funds “would never buy legal services or management advice from people only willing to spare a few hours a month”.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

Professional fund governance firms are also referred to as Board Service Providers (BSPs).&lt;ref name="StandfordLaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://intranet.law.ox.ac.uk/ckfinder/userfiles/files/66_Stan_L_Rev_1051_BainbridgeHenderson.pdf|title=BOARDS-R-US: Reconceptualizing Corporate Boards|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=16 July 2015 |work=[[Stanford Law Review]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents argue that directors are independent service providers to a fund equivalent to its auditors, administrators and attorneys, all of whom use a professional firm approach and the same professional standards and expectations should also apply to fund governance.&lt;ref name="hedgeweek2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2014/12/19/215050/split-boards-favoured-fund-governance-intensifies|title=Split boards favoured as fund governance intensifies|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=19 December 2014 |work=Hedge Week }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.K. all professional investment funds are required by law to appoint a BSP as an Authorised Corporate Director.  In the United States of America, BSPs are not required by law, but the SEC does “require funds to explicitly authorize the independent directors to hire employees and to retain advisers and experts necessary to carry out their duties”&lt;ref name = "SECIV"&gt;{{cite article| title= Part IV Securities and Exchange Commission|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ic-26520.pdf |accessdate=15 July 2015|work=SEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-financial crisis and several spectacular fund governance failures, there has been much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the [[Stanford Law Review]], [[University of Kentucky]] and [[University of Cambridge]] among many others.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue “we know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole proprietorship, and for good reason. Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".&lt;ref name="StandfordLaw"/&gt;

Empirical and anecdotal evidence from other fund services providers such as legal, administration and audit also supports the professional firm approach and it continues to dominate the professional fund industry. As such professional fund governance firms have the “economies of scale to attract the best board members, introduce more rigorous training programs and develop the best proprietary knowledge”&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21612147-case-outsourcing-company-boards-replacing-board|title=Replacing the board|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=16 Aug 2015 |work=[[The Economist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  plus economies of scale and scope allow firms to increase quality and/or lower cost by finding efficiencies in production, spreading fixed costs across a larger asset base and investing in technology.&lt;ref name="StandfordLaw"/&gt; Independent researchers further argue that BSPs bring “collective expertise, from the ability to process huge quantities of information to specialist advice”&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1"/&gt; use the power of technology for business intelligence, process management and information access to make fast and accurate decisions.

==Notable fund governance scandals and failures==
===Bear Stearns===
The Bear Stearns case is widely regarded as the seminal case of legal counsel conflicts among hedge fund directors.  Investors in the funds lost approximately $1.6 billion and “the two supposedly independent directors appointed by Walkers to serve Cioffi’s two hedge funds were Scott Lennon and Michelle Wilson-Clarke”&lt;ref name="CohanNYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/the-other-offshore-disaster/|title=The Other Offshore Disaster|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=24 June 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; were found by the Cayman Islands court to be conflicted as they were employees of an affiliate of [[Walkers (law firm)|Walkers]].   In his judgment the Chief Justice of the Cayman Islands said “For reasons which I need not elaborate now (but would be prepared to if asked), I am led to an irresistible impression that the manner of the conduct of the directors, trustee and the lawyers advising them” — all Walkers employees — “over the resolutions for winding up was clandestine and suspicious and was certainly in breach of the strict prohibition — against such a resolution being taken during the pendancy of the investors’ petition for the removal of the directors."&lt;ref name="CohanNYTimes"/&gt;

===Sark Lark===
During the 1980s, Sark was notorious for the emergence of the so-called “nominee director” practice&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/25/offshore-secrets-sark-lark-britons|title=The 'Sark Lark' Britons scattered around the world|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=25 November 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |last1=Leigh|first1=David|last2=Frayman|first2=Harold|last3=Ball|first3=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. where the director is in name only and does not exercise his judgment independently but rather acts like an automaton under the control of another person.  
The most infamous example was in 1999, when Guinness world record holder and Sark resident Phil Crowshaw was found to have singlehandedly held 3,378 directorships registered in Sark, 1,312 registered directorships in England and more than 2,000 directorships registered in Dublin and Isle of Man.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/doors-open-to-reveal-secret-world-of-britains-offshore-tax-havens-1185984.html|title=Doors open to reveal secret world of Britain's offshore tax havens|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=20 November 1998 |work=[[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later disqualified as a director by courts in Guernsey and the U.K. yet he was only one of “a group of residents who between them held directorships of thousands of companies scattered far and wide”.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;  These individuals were engaged in “the totally unacceptable practice of renting out their names as company directors without any real knowledge of what the companies are up to.”&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;  
In response [[Jack Straw]], the [[Home Secretary]] commissioned Andrew Edwards, former UK Treasury director to investigate these practices among Britain’s offshore dependencies.&lt;ref name="Independent2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/stamping-out-the-sark-lark-1102707.html|title=Stamping out the Sark Lark|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=27 June 1999 |work=[[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265705/4109.pdf|title=Review of Financial Regulation in the Crown Dependencies|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=November 1998 |publisher=The Stationery Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the Edwards report called for various reforms including that “Guernsey, Alderney and Sark should introduce a system of licensing and registering directors and bring in a code of conduct governing the standards expected from directors and trustees.”  The Edwards report “also called for a limit to be set on the number of directorships held by individuals, suggesting a ceiling of five trading companies or 30 asset-holding (fund) companies”.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; The Sark Lark ignited the debate about director capacity and the backlash against independent directors in offshore jurisdictions.  It was the genesis of the now discredited notion that caps on directorships would improve director performance or the number of directorships held is a proxy for director performance.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20451176|title=Tax evasion flourishing with help from UK firms|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=25 November 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several jurisdictions arbitrarily introduced caps on director capacity based on the Edwards report. However, as recently as November, 2012, BBC reported that the Sark Lark was still thriving.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20495222|title=Cable to review 'sham' company directors|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=26 November 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weavering Capital===
{{see also|Grey Wolf (film)#Weavering Capital}}
The Weavering case was widely regarded as the seminal case on hedge fund directors’ duties and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/weavering-capital-boss-magnus-peterson-guilty-fraud|title=Weavering Capital boss found guilty of forgery and fraud|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=19 January 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |last1=Bowers|first1=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Weavering Macro Fixed Income Fund Limited was listed on the [[Irish Stock Exchange]] and its directors Stefan Peterson and Hans Ekstrom were considered independent and in good standing under the Irish Stock Exchange standards. However, they were later found guilty by a Cayman Islands Court of being negligent in carrying out their fiduciary duties, and were held liable for US $111 million in damages.&lt;ref name="Mondaq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mondaq.com/caymanislands/x/375498/Commodities+Derivatives+Stock+Exchanges/Cayman+Court+Of+Appeal+Reverses+US111+Million+Judgment+Against|title=Cayman Court Of Appeal Reverses US$111 Million Judgment Against Weavering Directors|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=18 February 2015 |publisher=Mondaq }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was reversed on appeal and currently pending appeal to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. The Weavering Capital Scandal became notorious because the Managing Director of the UK Management Company, Magnus Peterson, was jailed for 13 years on 8 counts of Fraud in 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financial-crime/11365885/Weavering-hedge-fund-founder-Magnus-Peterson-jailed-for-13-years-over-fraud.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the discovery that he had illegally used investors money to fund personal projects such as the ''[[Grey Wolf (Film)]]''.

==Fund governance standards==
===Reputational capital===
Successful fund governance firms have been criticized by their competitors in ‘boutique’ firms for having too many directorships or being “rubber stamp” directors.  However, independent empirical research has consistently revealed these allegations as counterfactual. Some studies&lt;ref name="Masulis"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Are All Inside Directors the Same|date=4 September 2012|publisher=SSRN|ssrn = 1108036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jof"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X13000470|title=Are All Inside Directors the Same|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=4 February 2013|journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=109|pages=63–82|doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.02.004|last1=Field|first1=Laura|last2=Lowry|first2=Michelle|last3=Mkrtchyan|first3=Anahit}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used the number of directorships held by a director as a proxy for the reputational capital of the director - arguing that reputational incentives are particularly pronounced for professional hedge fund directors, and that directors who sit on more boards and the boards of better performing funds should be of higher quality. Thus, hiring a director who can be credibly perceived as being more independent could provide valuable certification for the fund.&lt;ref name=Clifford/&gt; Busy professional directors are more common among funds that derive higher benefits from external certification and monitoring, and their departure from the board is associated with outflows of investor capital. This result is inconsistent with directors serving as uninformative (or most nefariously, pro-management) rubber-stamps and inconsistent with the theory that funds prefer rubber-stamp directors who face more time constraints, making them too busy to monitor the manager.&lt;ref name="AIMAgovernance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aima.org/en/education/aimajournal/past-articles/index.cfm/jid/C511D286-70DE-4849-9A75AA28A66354A7|title=How to run offshore management companies and funds with substance and corporate governance|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=1 September 2013|publisher=Alternative Investment Management Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting shares===
An inordinate amount of scrutiny has been placed on issue of board capacity and composition to improve board performance, but those factors may become irrelevant to boards acting in the best interests of investors if the voting shares are held by the manager.&lt;ref name="Schroders"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aima.org/en/education/aimajournal/past-articles/index.cfm/jid/C511D286-70DE-4849-9A75AA28A66354A7|title=Investment and Corporate Governace: Schroders' Policy|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Schroders}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a serious conflict arises with the manager the degree to which the board can effectively act in the best interests of the fund can be neutralized in these circumstances. The voting shares give the manager complete discretion over the appointment and removal of directors; therefore controlling board composition and the ability to veto any of its decisions.  If the investment manager is dissatisfied with any decision, he can simply exercise his right to remove the director(s) and replace them with someone more amendable to the manager’s wishes.&lt;ref name="AIMAgovernance"/&gt;

===Composition===
The board requires has the right mix of skills, talent and capacity to function effectively.  Proprietors and boutique firms by definition have limited resources and – by design – do not invest the time or money required to deliver the full range of resources provided by professional firms.&lt;ref name="CFA Asset Manager"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/contributed/Pages/asset_manager_code_of_professional_conduct.aspx|title=Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 July 2015|publisher=[[CFA Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the large fund governance firms become more dominant, it has become common for proprietors and other boutique firms to band together, pooling their resources to create a larger ‘virtual’  or ‘pseudo’ professional firm to offer greater scale and selection to compete with the large professional firms. These alliances are commonly marketed as ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards.&lt;ref name="MFA 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.managedfunds.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Final_2009_complete.pdf|title=Sound Practices for Hedge Fund Managers|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 July 2015|publisher=Managed Funds Associations}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these loose arrangements often lack the operating discipline and reputational investment of their large professional firm counterparts.&lt;ref name="HFSB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfsb.org/sites/10377/files/hedge_fund_standards_-_as_at_february_2012.pdf|title=The Hedge Fund Standards|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 August 2012|publisher=Hedge Fund Standards Board }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the arrangements create co-dependency for business referrals and actually create higher complexity and potential for conflicts of interests since and they are entered into primarily for commercial reasons, and not to act in the best interests of the fund.  It is not uncommon for these arrangements to result in a high level of duplication and dysfunction.&lt;ref name=HFSB/&gt;

===Split or mixed boards===
All directors owe the same [[fiduciary duties]] and directors each have [[joint and several liability]] so in reality ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards is a marketing aphorism and distinction without a difference.  Independent research&lt;ref name=Clifford/&gt; has found that professional firms of quality directors have large reputational investment with high incentive to perform well and consistently outperform proprietorships.  This research found that “directors from a top ten firm are almost twice as likely as directors from smaller firms to obtain a new directorship.”&lt;ref name=HFSB/&gt;  This implies that directors are even more likely to be hired when their firm has a larger client base, and thus more reputational capital to protect. The single firm focus is counterfactual to the risk analysis. Unquestionably the area of greatest risk within any fund is within its investment portfolio.  Enormous authority over the fund affairs is often entrusted to the investment manager as a single individual, from a single firm, yet it would be universally accepted to be counterproductive and inefficient to appoint another manager from a different firm to manage the same portfolio at the same time, or another auditor from different firm to audit the same fund at the same time.  It is not obvious, other than the aforementioned marketing reason, why any one believes that appointing directors from different firms is an effective mechanism for eliciting independent judgment and deliberation than those doing the deciding work for a (single) firm instead.&lt;ref name=Clifford/&gt;&lt;ref name=HFSB/&gt;

===Lead director===
Boards are small organizations but like all organizations they need effective leadership to succeed.  The SEC recommends fund boards to appoint a lead director and it has become an industry leading practice for many fund boards to appoint a lead director to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the board.  The lead director may schedule, set and prioritize board meeting agendas and make sure the board receives reports from management on essential matters.&lt;ref name="SECic-262520"/&gt;  The lead director may also be the chief contact for the board’s counsel or the fund's auditors (or other service providers).  If the lead director is an independent director, he or she may represent the other independent directors in discussions with the fund management. SEC also recommends directors employ staff.&lt;ref name=StandfordLaw/&gt;&lt;ref name="SECic-262520"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ic-26520.pdf|title=Investment Company Governance; Final Rule|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 August 2014 |publisher=Securities Exchange Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Henry Le Bœuf''' (1874 in [[Schaerbeek]] – 1935) was a Belgian [[banker]], [[patron of the arts]] and [[music lover]].

The stepson of [[Albert Thys]], whose daughter Louise he married, he left his name to the Main Hall of the 2,200-seat [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]] (established 1929), of which he promoted the foundation and funding. This room was built by the architect [[Victor Horta]].

Henry Le Boeuf occupied the castle of his father-in-law at [[Dalhem]] and contributed to the beautification of this locality by various urbanistic interventions still visible today: embellishments of houses and medieval ruins, restoration of the city hall (commemorative plaque sealed in the gable), construction of residences for artists and musicians in particular, paving of various streets.

His granddaughter Christine was co-founder, with her husband [[Hubert Nyssen]], of Éditions [[Actes Sud]].

'''Hit-and-run tactics''' is a [[Military tactics|tactical]] [[doctrine]] where the purpose of the [[combat]] involved is not to seize control of territory; instead, flexible noncommittal attacks are used to inflict damage on a target and immediately exit the area to avoid the enemy's defense and/or retaliation. Such [[Raid (military)|raids]] can also expose enemy defensive weaknesses and achieve a psychological effect on the enemy's [[morale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/12/us-libya-nato-idUSTRE73B3TU20110412 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130614205406/https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/12/us-libya-nato-idUSTRE73B3TU20110412 |title=NATO expects hit and run tactics by Gaddafi |publisher=Reuters |author=David Brunnstrom |date=2011-04-12 |accessdate=2013-06-15 |archivedate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/2744 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130614205727/http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/2744 |title=Renewed Fighting in Hosingow |publisher=Somalia Report |date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2013-06-15 |archivedate=2013-06-14 |author=Aweys Cadde |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hit-and-run tactics are used in [[guerrilla warfare]], militant [[resistance movement]]s, and [[terrorism]] where the enemy typically overmatches the attacking force to the point where sustained combat is to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130616073932/http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/611/Hit-And-Run_Tactics_Show_Insurgent_Weakness |url=http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/611/Hit-And-Run_Tactics_Show_Insurgent_Weakness |title=Hit-And-Run Tactics Shows Insurgent Weakness |accessdate=2013-06-15 |archivedate=2013-06-16 |publisher=Somalia Report |author=Abdifitah Ibrahim |date=2011-04-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tactics can also be used as part of more conventional warfare. Examples of the latter include [[commando]] or other [[special forces]] attacks or [[sortie]]s from a besieged castle. Hit-and-run tactics were also where the lightly armed and nearly unarmored [[horse archer]]s typical of the [[Eurasian steppe]] peoples excelled. This holds especially true for such troops that were not part of a large army (such as [[reconnaissance|scouting parties]]), but it was not unusual to see them employed in such a way even as part of a major force.

==Historical use==
The [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] victory over the [[Byzantine Empire]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] was preceded by hit-and-run attacks of Seljuk cavalry&lt;ref&gt;Haldon, pp. 565–1204.&lt;/ref&gt; which threw the Byzantine army into confusion, which proved fatal once it started to retreat. Similarly, the earlier [[Parthia]]n and [[Sassanid]] Persian horse archers paved the way for their [[cataphract]]s' attack that achieved the decisive victories at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] and [[Battle of Edessa]]. The use of hit-and-run tactics dates back even earlier to the nomadic [[Scythians]] of [[Central Asia]], who employed them against [[Darius the Great]]'s [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] and later against [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Macedon]]ian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Robert Brown Asprey|contribution=guerrilla warfare|title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2008|contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248353/guerrilla-warfare|accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab general [[Baibars]] also successfully used hit-and-run during the [[battle of Ain Jalut]], the first defeat of the quickly expanding Mongol Empire. Vastly outnumbered in North America, the French made effective use of hit-and-run raids during the various [[French and Indian Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Tucker, ''Almanac of American Military History, Volume 1'', pp.10–11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TO2mx314ST0C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=British+population+in+North+America+outnumbered+the+French+12+to+1.&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5YS5VO32J4q1UZzxgrgI&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=British%20population%20in%20North%20America%20outnumbered%20the%20French%2012%20to%201.&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Turkish War of Independence]], Turks fought against the Greek Army by hit-and-run tactics before a regular army was set up.&lt;ref&gt;Belleten, page 1087.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vietnam War]], [[Viet Cong]] forces used hit-and-run tactics to great effectiveness against anti-communist military forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/peoplescentury/episodes/guerrillawars/description.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130616074340/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/peoplescentury/episodes/guerrillawars/description.html |title=Guerrilla Wars |publisher=Public Broadcasting System |accessdate=2013-06-15 |archivedate=2013-06-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in [[Afghanistan]] by rebel forces during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2001-11-16/news/25320313_1_mountain-soldiers-al-qaeda-fighters-ali-jalali |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130616075742/http://articles.philly.com/2001-11-16/news/25320313_1_mountain-soldiers-al-qaeda-fighters-ali-jalali |title=Better gear and tactics give allied forces an edge |author=Tony Bridges |date=2001-11-16 |accessdate=2013-06-15 |archivedate=2013-06-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–13)|Iraqi insurgent]] groups have also used hit-and-run tactics as part of their tactics against [[Iraqi security forces]] and American-led coalition forces in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/imindef/publications/pointer/journals/2012/v38n2/feature4/_jcr_content/imindefPars/0003/file.res/C%3A%5Cfakepath%5C034-044-Pointer%20N38N2_A.pdf|title=The Evolution of Insurgency and its Impact on Conventional Armed Forces|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Singaporean Ministry of Defence]]|author=Lieutenant Colonel Tan Giam|accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvised fighting vehicles called "[[Technical (vehicle)|technicals]]" are often used in such operations.

== In economics==
The term "hit-and-run" is also used in [[economics]] to describe a firm that enters a market to take advantage of abnormal profits and then leave. These tactics can be seen in a [[contestable market]].

'''IEC 62682''' is a technical standard titled Management of alarms systems for the process industries.

==Scope==
The standard specifies principles and processes for the management of alarm systems based on distribute control systems and computer-based Human-Machine Interface (HMI) technology for the process industries. It covers alarms from all systems presented to the operator, which can include basic process control systems, annunciator panels, safety instrumented systems, fire and gas systems, and emergency response systems.
The practices are applicable to continuous, batch, and discrete processes. The process industry sector includes many types of manufacturing processes, such as refineries, petrochemical, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, and power.  

==The Standard==
The standard addresses all lifecycle phases (development, design, installation, and operation) for [[alarm management]] in the process industries. The standard defines the terminology and work processes recommended to effectively maintain an alarm system throughout the lifecycle.
The standard was written as an extension of the existing ISA 18.2-2009 standard which utilized numerous industry alarm management guidance documents in its development such as EEMUA 191. Ineffective alarm systems have often been cited as contributing factors in the investigation reports following major process incidents. The standard is intended to provide a methodology that will result in the improved safety of the process industries.

The '''International Women's Air &amp; Space Museum''', Inc. (IWASM) is a museum dedicated to the preservation of the history of women in [[aviation]] and [[Spaceflight|space]] and the documentation of their continuing contributions today and in the future. 

The museum began as a committee of the [[Ninety-Nines]] in order to collect historical artifacts and memorabilia of women pilots. In 1986, the International Women's Air &amp; Space Museum opened in [[Centerville, Ohio]] in the former home of one of the [[Wright brothers]]' uncles. [[Bernice Steadman]], an [[aviator]] and member of the [[Mercury 13]], was one of the museum's co-founders.&lt;ref name=dfpress&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually IWASM outgrew its Centerville home and needed to find a new location. In 1998 the museum relocated to [[Burke Lakefront Airport]] in [[Cleveland]] where it resides in the terminal building, namely the lobby and the west concourse. As the airport is a public building, the museum is accessible every day during operating hours and charges no admission fee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="780">The '''Israel Center for Social and Economic Progress''' is an independent pro-market public policy [[thinktank]] founded in 1983 by [[Daniel Doron]] to promote basic structural reform in [[Israel]]'s economy. Its British Friends include members of the Jewish-British community such as [[Gerald Ronson]] and [[Barry Townsley]]. The center has also received funding from [[Sam Zell]].

ICSEP was credited by then finance minister Binyamin Netanyahu as having provided “truly invaluable assistance" in helping bring about the country's 2005 capital market reform bill and additional tax reform.

'''Jacqueline Lee Kennedy Onassis''' (née '''Bouvier''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|uː|v|i|eɪ}}; July 28, 1929 – May 19, 1994) was an American book editor and socialite who was [[First Lady of the United States]] during the presidency of her husband, [[John F. Kennedy]], from January 1961 until [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|his assassination]] in November 1963.

Bouvier was born in [[Southampton, New York]] to [[Wall Street]] stockbroker [[John Vernou Bouvier III]] and his wife, [[Janet Lee Bouvier]], in 1929. In 1951, she graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[French literature]] from [[George Washington University]] and went on to work for the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]'' as an inquiring photographer.&lt;ref&gt;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b8/81/a9/b881a947fca72c742707305836e44c82.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Bouvier met then-[[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] John F. Kennedy at a dinner party in Washington. Following his election to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1952, the couple married on September 12, 1953, in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. They had four children, two of whom [[Kennedy curse|died in infancy]]. Following her husband's election to the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], Jacqueline Kennedy was known for her highly publicized restoration of the [[White House]] and emphasis on arts and culture, as well as for her style, elegance, and grace.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mimi.

Quote: "The prescience of her words is remarkable given the influence she ultimately had on fashion, interior decoration, and architectural preservation from the early 1960s until her death in 1994. A disappointing visit to the Executive Mansion when she was 11 left a deep impression, one she immediately acted upon when she knew she was to become first lady ..." Retrieved February 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 31 years old when her husband was inaugurated, she was the youngest First Lady since [[Frances Folsom Cleveland Preston|Frances Cleveland]]. She was also the first [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] to serve as First Lady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-catholic-white-house_us_59270d0ce4b0265790f5f76f|title=Melania Trump Will Be The First Catholic To Live At The White House Since JFK|last=Sieczkowski|first=Cavan|date=May 25, 2017|work=[[HuffPost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy was riding with the President in an open-air motorcade in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], when he was assassinated. Following [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|his funeral]], she and her children largely withdrew from public view. In 1968, she married Greek shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]]. Following Aristotle Onassis's death in 1975, she had a career as a publishing editor in [[New York City]]. She died on May 19, 1994 of [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], aged 64.

During her lifetime, Jacqueline Kennedy was regarded as an international fashion icon.&lt;ref name="Craughwell-Varda1999"&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|Ct_xAAAAMAAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=Looking for Jackie: American Fashion Icons|last=Craughwell-Varda|first=Kathleen|date=October 14, 1999|publisher=[[Sterling Publishing|Hearst Books]]|isbn=978-0-688-16726-4|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her famous ensemble of a [[Kennedy pink Chanel suit|pink Chanel suit]] and matching [[pillbox hat]] has become a symbol of her husband's assassination.&lt;ref name="FordMitchell2004"&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|Jmz__lna90kC|page=PA149|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=The Makeover in Movies: Before and After in Hollywood Films, 1941–2002|last1=Ford|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Mitchell|first2=Deborah C.|date=March 2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1721-6|page=149|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even after her death, she ranks as one of the most popular and recognizable First Ladies and was listed as one of [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll|Gallup's Most-Admired Men and Women]] of the 20th century in 1999.&lt;ref name="GallupWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/3415/most-admired-men-women-19481998.aspx|title=Gallup Most Admired Women, 1948–1998|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouvier spent her early childhood years in Manhattan and at [[Lasata]], the Bouviers' country estate in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton]] on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name=NYTobituary&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0728.html|title=Death of a First Lady ; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Dies of Cancer at 64|publisher=New York Times|date=May 20, 1994|first=Robert D.|last=McFadden}}&lt;/ref&gt; She idolized her father, who likewise favored her over her sister, calling his elder child "the most beautiful daughter a man ever had".&lt;ref name=Leaming(2014)6&gt;Leaming (2014), pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Tina Flaherty pointed out Jackie's early confidence in herself, seeing a link to her father's praise and positive attitude to her, and her sister Lee has stated that she would not have gained her "independence and individuality" had it not been for the relationship she had with their father and paternal grandfather.&lt;ref name=Tracy9&gt;Tracy, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-book-jackie-os-lessons/|title=New Book: Jackie O's Lessons|date=April 1, 2004|first=Bootie|last=Cosgrove-Mather}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age, Bouvier was an enthusiastic [[Equestrianism|equestrienne]] and successfully competed in the sport; horse-riding would remain a lifelong passion.&lt;ref name=Tracy9/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacqueline"&gt;{{cite web|last=Glueckstein |first=Fred |title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: Equestrienne |url=http://www.usef.org/_staffIframes/pressbox/images/magazine/pdf/93017f0de13379e1a77c8b63dfa9554f.pdf |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427152055/http://www.usef.org/_staffIframes/pressbox/images/magazine/pdf/93017f0de13379e1a77c8b63dfa9554f.pdf |archivedate=April 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also took ballet lessons, was an avid reader, and excelled at learning languages, with French being particularly emphasized in her upbringing.&lt;ref name="Tracy38"&gt;Tracy, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jacqueline Bouvier by David Berne, 1935.jpg|thumb|left|180px|upright|Six-year-old Bouvier in 1935]]In 1935, Bouvier was enrolled in Manhattan's [[Chapin School (Manhattan)|Chapin School]], which she attended for grades 1–6.&lt;ref name="Jacqueline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pottker, p. 74; Spoto, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; She was a bright student but often misbehaved; one of her teachers described her as "a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil".&lt;ref name=jfklibrary&gt;{{cite web|title=Life of Jacqueline B. Kennedy|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/Life-of-Jacqueline-B-Kennedy.aspx|work=The [[John F. Kennedy Library]]|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier's mother attributed her daughter's behavior to the way that she finished her assignments ahead of classmates and then acted out in boredom.&lt;ref name=Harris540&gt;Harris, pp. 540–541&lt;/ref&gt; Her behavior improved after the headmistress warned her that none of her positive qualities would matter if she did not behave.&lt;ref name="Harris540"/&gt;

The marriage of Bouvier's parents was strained by her father's alcoholism and extramarital affairs; the family had also struggled with financial difficulties following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].&lt;ref name=NYTobituary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, Ch. 1, "School Days"; Pottker, p. 99; Leaming, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; They separated in 1936 and divorced four years later, with the press publishing intimate details of the split.&lt;ref&gt;Leaming (2001), p. 5; Flaherty, Ch. 1, "School Days"&lt;/ref&gt; According to her cousin [[John H. Davis (author)|John H. Davis]], Bouvier was deeply affected by the divorce and subsequently had a "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own".&lt;ref name=NYTobituary/&gt; When her mother married [[Standard Oil]] heir [[Hugh D. Auchincloss|Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr.]],  Bouvier and her sister did not attend the ceremony, because it was arranged quickly and travel was restricted due to [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Tracy17"/&gt; Bouvier gained three step-siblings from Auchincloss' two previous marriages, Hugh "Yusha" Auchincloss III, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and [[Nina Gore Auchincloss]]; she formed the closest bond with Yusha, who became one of her most trusted confidants.&lt;ref name=Tracy17&gt;Tracy, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage later produced two more children, [[Janet Auchincloss Rutherfurd|Janet Jennings Auchincloss]] in 1945 and James Lee Auchincloss in 1947.

After the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood estate in [[McLean, Virginia]], became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, although they also spent time at his other estate, [[Hammersmith Farm]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and in their father's homes in New York City and Long Island.&lt;ref name=NYTobituary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pottker, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure.&lt;ref name=NYTobituary/&gt; He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Pottker, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic as well as being a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Pottker, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;

After six years at Chapin, Bouvier attended the [[Holton-Arms School]] in Northwest [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1942 to 1944, and [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]], from 1944 to 1947.&lt;ref name=Pottker7&gt;Pottker, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; She chose Miss Porter's because it was a boarding school that allowed her to distance herself from the Auchinclosses, and because the school placed an emphasis on college preparatory classes.&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; In her senior class yearbook, Bouvier was acknowledged for "her wit, her accomplishment as a horsewoman, and her unwillingness to become a housewife". Jacqueline later hired her childhood friend [[Nancy Tuckerman]] to be her [[White House Social Secretary|Social Secretary]] at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rebecca|last=Mead|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/11/jackies-juvenilia|title=Jackie's Juvenilia|work=The New Yorker|date=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated among the top students of her class and received the Maria McKinney Memorial Award for Excellence in Literature.&lt;ref name=Spoto63&gt;Spoto, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

=== College and early career ===
In the fall of 1947, Bouvier entered [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Pottker, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; She had wanted to attend [[Sarah Lawrence College]], closer to New York City, but her parents insisted that she choose the more geographically isolated Vassar.&lt;ref&gt;Pottker, pp. 113-114; Leaming, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier was an accomplished student who participated in the school's art and drama clubs and wrote for its newspaper.&lt;ref name=NYTobituary/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spoto67&gt;Spoto, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her dislike for the college, she did not take an active part in its social life and instead traveled back to Manhattan on the weekends.&lt;ref&gt;Pottker, p. 116; Leaming, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; She had made her [[High society (group)|society debut]] in the summer before entering college and became a frequent presence in New York social functions. Hearst columnist [[Igor Cassini]] dubbed her the "[[Debutante#United States|debutante]] of the year".&lt;ref&gt;Leaming, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier spent her junior year (1949–1950) in France—at the [[University of Grenoble]] in [[Grenoble]], and at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris—in a study-abroad program through [[Smith College]].&lt;ref&gt;Leaming, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning home, she transferred to [[George Washington University]] in Washington, D.C., graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[French literature]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="FirstLadies"&gt;{{cite web | title = First Lady Biography: Jackie Kennedy | url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=36 | work = First Ladies' Biographical Information | accessdate = February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years of her marriage to John F. Kennedy, she took continuing education classes in [[American history]] at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="FirstLadies" /&gt;

While attending George Washington, Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine; she had been selected over several hundred other women nationwide.&lt;ref name=prixdeparis&gt;Leaming (2014), pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt; The position entailed working for six months in the magazine's New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris.&lt;ref name=prixdeparis/&gt; Before beginning the job, Bouvier celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee's high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer.&lt;ref name=prixdeparis/&gt; The trip was the subject of her only autobiography, ''One Special Summer'', co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline's drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=One Special Summer|location=New York City|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|year=1974 | isbn = 978-0-440-06037-6 |last=Onassis |first=Jacqueline Kennedy |last2=Radziwill |first2=Lee Bouvier |authorlink2=Lee Radziwill}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her first day at ''Vogue'', the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer Barbara Leaming, the editor was concerned about Bouvier's marriage prospects; she was 22 years of age and was considered too old to be single in her social circles. Bouvier followed the advice, left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work.&lt;ref name="prixdeparis"/&gt;

Bouvier moved back to Merrywood and was hired as a part-time receptionist at the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. A week later, she approached editor Frank Waldrop and requested more challenging work; she was given the position of "Inquiring Camera Girl", despite Waldrop's initial concerns about her competence.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures for publication in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses.&lt;ref name=NYTobituary/&gt; In addition to the random "[[man on the street]]" vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest, such as six-year-old [[Tricia Nixon]]. Bouvier interviewed Tricia a few days after her father [[Richard Nixon]] was elected to the vice presidency in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 election]].&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, p. 79; Adler, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Bouvier was also briefly engaged to a young stockbroker, [[John G. W. Husted, Jr.]] After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in January 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Leaming (2014), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; She called off the engagement after three months, because she had found him "immature and boring" once she got to know him better.&lt;ref name=Spoto89&gt;Spoto, pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouvier and [[U.S. Representative]] [[John F. Kennedy]] belonged to the same social circle and were formally introduced by a mutual friend, journalist [[Charles L. Bartlett (journalist)|Charles L. Bartlett]], at a dinner party in May 1952.&lt;ref name=NYTobituary/&gt; Bouvier was attracted to Kennedy's physical appearance, charm, wit and wealth. The pair also shared the similarities of Catholicism, writing, enjoying reading and having previously lived abroad.&lt;ref name=O&gt;O'Brien, pp. 265–266&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was busy running for the [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1952|U.S. Senate in Massachusetts]]; the relationship grew more serious and he proposed to her after the November election. Bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been assigned to cover the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in London for ''The Washington Times-Herald''. After a month in Europe, she returned to the United States and accepted Kennedy's marriage proposal. She then resigned from her position at the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp. 548–549&lt;/ref&gt; Their engagement was officially announced on June 25, 1953.&lt;ref name="NYTEngagement"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/06/25/issue.html|title=Senator Kennedy to marry in fall|date=June 25, 1953|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=31|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alam, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

John Kennedy suffered from [[Addison's Disease]] and from chronic and at times debilitating back pain, which had been exacerbated by a war injury; in late 1954, he underwent a near-fatal spinal operation.&lt;ref name="Dallek"&gt;Dallek, Robert.

Kennedy|Robert]], who occupied it with his wife [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel]] and their growing family, and bought a townhouse on N Street in [[Georgetown, Washington, DC|Georgetown]].&lt;ref name=Pottker7 /&gt;

Jacqueline gave birth to a daughter [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]] on November 27, 1957.&lt;ref name="Reference1A" /&gt;  At the time, she and John Kennedy were campaigning for his re-election to the Senate, and they posed with their infant daughter for the cover of the April 21, 1958 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Leaming (2014), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|At first she had opposed the magazine's offer of the cover, not wanting the baby to be used to benefit her husband's political career, but changed her mind in exchange for a promise from her father-in-law that Jack would stop campaigning during the summer to go to Paris with her.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{which|date=July 2018}} They traveled together during the campaign, trying to narrow the geographical gap between them that had persisted for the first five years of the marriage. Soon enough, John Kennedy started to notice the value that his wife added to his congressional campaign. [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] remembered that "the size of the crowd was twice as big" when she accompanied her husband; he also recalled her as "always cheerful and obliging". John's mother [[Rose Kennedy|Rose]] observed Jacqueline as not being "a natural-born campaigner" due to her shyness and being uncomfortable with too much attention.&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, pp. 142–144&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1958, John Kennedy was reelected to a second term. He credited Jacqueline's visibility in both ads and stumping as vital assets in securing his victory, and he called her "simply invaluable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iagreetosee.com/portfolio/jackie-kennedys-campaign-ad-appearance-1960-presidential-election/|title=Jackie Kennedy's Campaign Ad Appearance, before the 1960 Presidential Election|publisher=iagreetosee.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt and Batcher, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1959, historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger]] visited the [[Kennedy Compound]] in [[Hyannis Port]] and had his first conversation with Jacqueline; he found her to have "tremendous awareness, an all-seeing eye and a ruthless judgment".&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Jack Kennedy traveled to 14 states, with Jacqueline taking long breaks from the trips so she could spend time with their daughter Caroline. She also counseled her husband on improving his wardrobe in preparation for his intended presidential campaign the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, she traveled to [[Louisiana]] to visit [[Edmund Reggie]] and to help her husband garner support in the state for his presidential bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/jfk_owes_credit_to_louisiana_f.html|title=JFK owes credit to Louisiana for winning 1960 presidential election|date=November 18, 2013|publisher=nola.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campaign for presidency ===
[[File:Jfk-appleton.jpg|thumb|left|Jacqueline with her husband as he campaigns for the presidency in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], March 1960]]
On January 3, 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency and launched his campaign nationwide. In the early months of the election year, Jacqueline Kennedy accompanied her husband to campaign events such as whistle-stops and dinners.&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant and decided to stay at home in Georgetown due to her previous high-risk pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Molly Meijer|last=Wertheime|title=Inventing a Voice: The Rhetoric of American First Ladies of the Twentieth Century|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy subsequently participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, ''Campaign Wife'', answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media.&lt;ref name=jfklibrary/&gt;

Despite not participating on the campaign trail, Jacqueline became the subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|last1=Mulvagh|first1=Jane|work=The Independent|date=May 20, 1994|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis-1437396.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women's magazines alongside film stars and named as one of the 12 best-dressed women of the world.&lt;ref name=Beasleyfashion&gt;Beasley, pp. 72–76&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press.&lt;ref name=Beasleyfashion/&gt; In order to downplay her wealthy background, Jacqueline stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.&lt;ref name=Beasleyfashion/&gt;

On July 13 at the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles, the Democratic Party nominated John Kennedy for President of the United States. Jacqueline did not attend the nomination due to her pregnancy, which had been publicly announced ten days earlier.&lt;ref name=Spoto155&gt;Spoto, pp. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt; From Hyannis Port, she watched the September 26, 1960 debate—which was the nation's first televised presidential debate—between her husband and Republican candidate [[Richard Nixon]], who was the incumbent Vice President. Marian Cannon, the wife of Arthur Schlesinger, watched the debate with her. Days after the debates, Jacqueline contacted Schlesinger and informed him that John wanted his aid along with that of [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] in preparing for the third debate on October 13; she wished for them to give her husband new ideas and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; On September 29, 1960, the Kennedys appeared together for a joint interview on ''[[Person to Person]]'', interviewed by [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]].&lt;ref name=Spoto155/&gt;

=== As First Lady ===

On November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref name=jfklibrary/&gt; A little over two weeks later on November 25, Jacqueline gave birth to the couple's first son, [[John F.

Her husband was sworn in as president on January 20, 1961.&lt;ref name=jfklibrary/&gt; As a presidential couple, the Kennedys differed from the Eisenhowers by their political affiliation, youth, and their relationship with the media. Historian [[Gil Troy]] has noted that in particular, they "emphasized vague appearances rather than specific accomplishments or passionate commitments" and therefore fit in well in the early 1960s' "cool, TV-oriented culture".&lt;ref name="Beasley, p. 76"&gt;Beasley, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion about Jacqueline's fashion choices continued during her years in the White House, and she became a trendsetter, hiring American designer [[Oleg Cassini]] to design her wardrobe.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, pp. 73– 74&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first presidential wife to hire a press secretary, Pamela Turnure, and carefully managed her contact with the media, usually shying away from making public statements, and strictly controlling the extent to which her children were photographed.&lt;ref name="firstladies1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/facinatingfacts.aspx |title=Little-known facts about our First Ladies |publisher=Firstladies.org |date= |accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bimage&gt;Beasley, pp. 78–83&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was portrayed by the media as the ideal woman, leading academic Maurine Beasley to observe that she "created an unrealistic media expectation for first ladies that would challenge her successors".&lt;ref name=bimage/&gt; Nevertheless, the First Lady attracted worldwide positive public attention and gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its [[Cold War]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;Schwalbe, pp. 111–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jacqueline stated that her priority as a First Lady was to take care of the President and their children, she also dedicated her time to the promotion of American arts and preservation of its history.&lt;ref name=jfklibrarytwo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Jacqueline-Kennedy-in-the-White-House.aspx|title=Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House|publisher= The John F.

Jacqueline had visited the White House on two occasions before she became First Lady, the first time as a grade-school tourist in 1941 and again as the guest of [[Mamie Eisenhower]] shortly before her husband's inauguration.&lt;ref name=jfklibrarytwo/&gt; She was dismayed to find that the mansion's rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance&lt;ref name=jfklibrarytwo/&gt; and made it her first major project as First Lady to restore its historical character. On her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator [[Sister Parish]]. She decided to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. The $50,000 that had been appropriated for this effort was almost immediately exhausted. Continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early American furniture expert [[Henry Francis du Pont|Henry du Pont]].&lt;ref name=jfklibrarytwo/&gt; To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration.&lt;ref name=jfklibrarytwo/&gt; Working with [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]], Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the [[White House Rose Garden]] and the East Garden, which was renamed the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]] after her husband's assassination. In addition, Kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in [[President's Park|Lafayette Square]] in Washington, D.C., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history.&lt;ref name=jfklibrarytwo/&gt; 
[[File:Charles Collingwood murrow27s boys.jpg|thumb|right|Jacqueline Kennedy with [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] during [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy|their televised tour]] of the restored [[White House]] in 1962.]]Prior to Kennedy's years as First Lady, furnishings and other items had been taken from the White House by presidents and their families when they departed; this led to the lack of original historical pieces in the mansion. To track down these missing furnishings and other historical pieces of interest, she personally wrote to possible donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428919/Jacqueline-Kennedy-Onassis|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own, and founded the [[White House Historical Association]], the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]], the position of a permanent [[Curator of the White House]], the [[White House Endowment Trust]], and the [[White House Acquisition Trust]].&lt;ref name="DesigningCamelot" /&gt; She was the first presidential spouse to hire a White House curator.&lt;ref name="firstladies1"/&gt;

On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline took American television viewers [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy|on a tour of the White House]] with Charles Collingwood of [[CBS News]]. In the tour she stated that "I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important ... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best."&lt;ref name="DesigningCamelot"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abbott, James |author2=Rice, Elaine |title=Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration|publisher= Thomson |year=1997 | isbn = 978-0-442-02532-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was watched by 56 million television viewers in the United States,&lt;ref name=jfklibrarytwo/&gt; and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] Trustees Award for it at the [[Emmy Awards]] in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by [[Lady Bird Johnson]]. Kennedy was the only First Lady to win an Emmy.&lt;ref name="firstladies1"/&gt;

Throughout her husband's presidency, Kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the President—more than any of the preceding First Ladies.&lt;ref name="FirstLadies"/&gt; Despite the initial worry that she might not have "political appeal", she proved popular among international dignitaries.&lt;ref name="Beasley, p. 76"/&gt; Before the Kennedys' first official visit to France in 1961, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn. After arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak French, as well as her extensive knowledge of French history.&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;Goodman, Sidey and Baldrige, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the visit, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine seemed delighted with the First Lady and noted, "There was also that fellow who came with her."

From France, the Kennedys traveled to Vienna, Austria, where [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]], when asked to shake the President's hand for a photo, stated, "I'd like to shake her hand first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Perry, Barbara A.|title=Jacqueline Kennedy: First Lady of the New Frontier|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2009 | isbn = 978-0-7006-1343-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khrushchev later sent her a puppy, significant for being the offspring of [[Soviet space dogs|Strelka]], the dog that had gone to space during a Soviet space mission.&lt;ref&gt;Meagher and Gragg, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of U.S. Ambassador to India [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], Kennedy undertook a tour of India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill in 1962, which was amply documented in photojournalism of the time as well as in Galbraith's journals and memoirs. She was gifted with a horse called Sardar by the President of Pakistan, [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]], as he had found out on his visit to the White House that he and the First Lady had a common interest in horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2011/03/jackie-kennedy-adopts-sardar-march-23-1962-051743|title=Jackie Kennedy adopts Sardar, March 23, 1962|date=March 23, 2011|publisher=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life'' magazine correspondent Anne Chamberlin wrote that Kennedy "conducted herself magnificently" although noting that her crowds were smaller than those that President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] attracted when they had previously visited these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/this-day-in-politics-march-12-1962-115982|title=Jacqueline Kennedy begins South Asia trip, March 12, 1962|first=Andrew|last=Glass|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these well-publicized trips during the three years of the Kennedy administration, she traveled to countries including Afghanistan, Austria, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EFDC103DE733A2575BC1A9639C946091D6CF|title=Ottawa Reacts to Mrs. Kennedy With 'Special Glow of Warmth'; Prime Minister Hails Her at Parliament -- Crowds Cheer Her at Horse Show and During Visit to Art Gallery|last=Long|first=Tania|date=May 1, 1961|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia, United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2015/03/24/2003614311|title=Pioneering aide to Jacqueline Kennedy dies|date=March 24, 2015|publisher=Taipei Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco, Turkey, and Venezuela.&lt;ref name="FirstLadies"/&gt; Unlike her husband, Kennedy was fluent in Spanish, which she used to address Latin American audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rabe|first1=Stephen G.|authorlink=Stephen G.

==== Death of infant son ====
{{main|Patrick Bouvier Kennedy}}
In early 1963, Jacqueline was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties. She spent most of the summer at a home she and the President had rented on Squaw Island, which was near the Kennedy compound on [[Cape Cod|Cape Cod, Massachusetts]]. On August 7 (five weeks ahead of her scheduled due date), she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy]], via emergency Caesarean section at nearby [[Otis Air Force Base]]. The infant's lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to [[Boston Children's Hospital]], where he died of [[hyaline membrane disease]] two days after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Beschloss, Michael. |title=Historical Conversations on Life with John F.

Warner Books: 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-446-52426-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacqueline had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston to be with their infant son and was present when he died.  On August 14, the President returned to Otis to take her home and gave an impromptu speech to thank nurses and airmen who had gathered in her suite. In appreciation, she presented hospital staff with framed and signed lithographs of the White House.&lt;ref name=VanityFair&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2013/07/icebergs-jfk-jackie-death-patrick |first=Thurston|last=Clarke|title=A Death in the First Family|date=July 1, 2013|publisher=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Lady was deeply affected by the infant's death&lt;ref name=Levingston2013 /&gt; and proceeded to enter a state of [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=Leaming120&gt;Leaming (2014), pp. 120–122&lt;/ref&gt; However, the loss of their child had a positive impact on the marriage and brought the couple closer together in their shared grief.&lt;ref name=Levingston2013&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/for-john-and-jackie-kennedy-the-death-of-a-son-may-have-brought-them-closer/2013/10/24/2506051e-369b-11e3-ae46-e4248e75c8ea_story.html|title=For John and Jackie Kennedy, the death of a son may have brought them closer|date=October 24, 2013|work=The Washington Post|first=Steven|last=Levingston|accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Schlesinger wrote that while President Kennedy always "regarded Jacqueline with genuine affection and pride," their marriage "never seemed more solid than in the later months of 1963".&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; Jacqueline's friend [[Aristotle Onassis]] was aware of her depression and invited her to his yacht to recuperate. President Kennedy initially had reservations, but he relented because he believed that it would be "good for her". The trip was widely disapproved of within the Kennedy administration, by much of the general public, and in Congress. The First Lady returned to the United States on October 17, 1963. She would later say she regretted being away as long as she was but had been "melancholy after the death of my baby".&lt;ref name=Leaming120/&gt;

[[File:John F. Kennedy motorcade, Dallas crop.png|thumb|right|The [[Presidential State Car (United States)|Presidential limousine]] minutes before the assassination]]
On November 21, 1963, the First Lady and the President left the White House for a political trip to Texas; this was the first time that she had joined her husband on such a trip in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Leaming (2014), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; After a breakfast on November 22, they took a very short flight on [[VC-137C SAM 26000|Air Force One]] from Fort Worth's [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth|Carswell Air Force Base]] to Dallas' [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]], accompanied by Texas Governor [[John Connally]] and his wife [[Nellie Connally|Nellie]].&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"&gt;Bugliosi, pp. 30, 34&lt;/ref&gt; The First Lady was wearing a [[Kennedy pink Chanel suit|bright pink Chanel suit]] and a [[pillbox hat]],&lt;ref name="Craughwell-Varda1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FordMitchell2004" /&gt; which had been personally selected by President Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Alam, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|9.5|mi|km|adj=on}} [[motorcade]] was to take them to the [[Dallas Market Center|Trade Mart]], where the president was scheduled to speak at a lunch. The First Lady was seated to her husband's left in the third row of seats in the [[SS-100-X|presidential limousine]], with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them. Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his wife followed in another car in the motorcade.

After the motorcade turned the corner onto Elm Street in [[Dealey Plaza]], the First Lady heard what she thought to be a motorcycle [[Back-fire|backfiring]] and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and one of the shots struck her husband in the head. Almost immediately, she began to climb onto the back of the limousine; Secret Service agent [[Clint Hill (Secret Service)|Clint Hill]] later told the [[Warren Commission]] that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for a piece of her husband's skull that had been blown off.&lt;ref name="cjhill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Clinton J.

As Hill stood on the back bumper, [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Ike Altgens]] snapped a photograph that was featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world.&lt;ref name=PotP&gt;Trask, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; She would later testify that she saw pictures "of me climbing out the back.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]], which is the repository for official papers of the Kennedy Administration.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by architect [[I.M. Pei]], it is situated next to the [[University of Massachusetts]] campus in Boston.

Despite having commissioned [[William Manchester|William Manchester's]] authorized account of President Kennedy's death, ''[[The Death of a President]]'', Jacqueline was subject to significant media attention in 1966–1967 when she and Robert Kennedy tried to block the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, Vol 2., p. 762&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; They sued publishers [[Harper &amp; Row]] in December 1966; the suit was settled the following year when Manchester removed passages that detailed President Kennedy's private life. White viewed the ordeal as validation of the measures the Kennedy family, Jacqueline in particular, were prepared to take to preserve President Kennedy's public image.

During the [[Vietnam War]] in November 1967, ''Life'' magazine dubbed Kennedy "America's unofficial roving ambassador" when she and [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|David Ormsby-Gore]], former British ambassador to the United States during the Kennedy administration, traveled to Cambodia, where they visited the religious complex of [[Angkor Wat]] with Chief of State [[Norodom Sihanouk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devata.org/2010/01/angkor-wat-dreams-jacqueline-kennedys-1967-visit-to-cambodia/ Jacqueline Kennedy Visits Angkor Wat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324002740/http://www.devata.org/2010/01/angkor-wat-dreams-jacqueline-kennedys-1967-visit-to-cambodia/ |date=March 24, 2010 }} November 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alam32&gt;Alam, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Milton Osbourne, her visit was "the start of the repair to Cambodian-US relations, which had been at a very low ebb".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/jacqueline-kennedys-charm-offensive|title=Jacqueline Kennedy's charm offensive|date=March 21, 2015|first=Harriet Fitch|last=Little|publisher=The Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also attended the [[Funeral of Martin Luther King, Jr.|funeral services of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in April 1968, despite her initial reluctancy due to the crowds and reminders of President Kennedy's death.&lt;ref&gt;Leaming (2014), pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with Robert F. Kennedy ===
After the assassination, Jacqueline relied heavily on her brother-in-law [[Robert F. Kennedy]]; she observed him to be the "least like his father" of the Kennedy brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the assassination, Bobby became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities as Attorney General required him to reduce attention.&lt;ref name=Spoto239&gt;Spoto, pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; He credited Jackie with convincing him to stay in politics, and she supported his 1964 run for United States Senator from New York.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer C. David Heymann, the two became romantically involved after her husband's death.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann (2009), pp. vii–ix&lt;/ref&gt;

The January 1968 [[Tet offensive]] in Vietnam resulted in a drop in President Johnson's poll numbers, and Robert Kennedy's advisors urged him to enter the upcoming presidential race. When [[Art Buchwald]] asked him if he intended to run, Robert replied, "That depends on what Jackie wants me to do".&lt;ref name="FlyntEisenbach"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;{{which|date=July 2018}} She met with him around this time and encouraged him to run after she had previously advised him to not follow Jack, but to "be yourself". Privately, she worried about his safety; she believed that Bobby was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was "so much hatred" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; She confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was "fatalistic" like her.&lt;ref name=FlyntEisenbach&gt;Flynt and Eisenbach, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her concerns, Jacqueline campaigned for her brother-in-law and supported him,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the Kennedy family would once again occupy the White House.&lt;ref name=FlyntEisenbach/&gt;

Just after midnight [[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]] on June 5, 1968, Robert Kennedy was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|mortally wounded]] by gunfire by [[Sirhan Sirhan]] minutes after he and a crowd of his supporters had been celebrating his victory in the California Democratic presidential primary.&lt;ref name="NYTjune61968"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/05/archives/kennedy-claims-victory-and-then-shots-ring-out.html|title=Kennedy claims victory; and then shots ring out|last=Morriss|first=John G.|date=June 6, 1968|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacqueline Kennedy rushed to [[Los Angeles]] from Manhattan to join his wife Ethel, her brother-in-law [[Ted Kennedy]], and the other Kennedy family members at his hospital bedside. Bobby Kennedy never regained consciousness and died 26 hours after the shooting.&lt;ref name="NYTsirhan"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0605.html |title=Kennedy is Dead, Victim of Assassin; Suspect, Arab Immigrant, Arraigned; Johnson Appoints Panel on Violence|last=Hill|first=Gladwin|date=June 6, 1968|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage to Aristotle Onassis ===
After Robert Kennedy's death, Jacqueline reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband's assassination nearly five years prior.&lt;ref&gt;Pottker, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; She came to fear for her life and those of her children, saying: "If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country".&lt;ref name="jfkjr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/19/us/john-f-kennedy-jr-heir-to-a-formidable-dynasty.html|title=John F. Kennedy Jr., Heir to a Formidable Dynasty| author = Seely, Katherine|date=July 19, 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 1968, Kennedy married her long-time friend [[Aristotle Onassis]], a wealthy Greek shipping magnate who was able to provide the privacy and security she sought for herself and her children.&lt;ref name="jfkjr" /&gt; The wedding took place on [[Skorpios]], Onassis' private Greek island in the [[Ionian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; After marrying Onassis, she took the legal name Jacqueline Onassis and consequently lost her right to Secret Service protection, which is an entitlement of a widow of a U.S. president. The marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity. The fact that Aristotle was divorced and his former wife [[Tina Onassis Niarchos|Athina Livanos]] was still living led to speculation that Jacqueline might be [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the Roman Catholic church, though that concern was explicitly dismissed by [[Archbishop of Boston|Boston's Archbishop]], Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]] as "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Talk on Jackie Kennedy|date=October 23, 1968|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&amp;dat=19681023&amp;id=MM5QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TMcMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4712,2143422}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was condemned by some as a "public sinner,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Catholics: The Cardinal and Jackie| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839610,00.html| work=Time|accessdate=May 12, 2014|date=November 1, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the target of [[paparazzi]] who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her "Jackie O".&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

During their marriage, the couple inhabited six different residences: her 15-room [[1040 Fifth Avenue|Fifth Avenue apartment]] in Manhattan, her horse farm in New Jersey, his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island Skorpios, his house in Athens, and his yacht ''[[Christina O]]. Kennedy ensured that her children continued a connection with the Kennedy family by having Ted Kennedy visit them often.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;{{which|date=July 2018}} She developed a close relationship with Ted, and from then on he was involved in her public appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle Onassis' health deteriorated rapidly following the death of his son [[Alexander Onassis|Alexander]] in a plane crash in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; He died of respiratory failure at age 69 in Paris on March 15, 1975. His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Kennedy eventually accepted a settlement of $26&amp;nbsp;million from [[Christina Onassis]]—Aristotle's daughter and sole heir— and waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years (1975–1990s) ==
After the death of her second husband, Jacqueline returned permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, [[Martha's Vineyard]], and the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at [[Viking Press]], a position that she held for two years.{{efn|Prior to her publishing employment, she had gained experience by being involved with several posthumous biographies of President Kennedy. The first of these was ''John F. Kennedy, President,'' by [[Hugh Sidey]], which was published the year after his death in 1964. Simon Michael Bessie, Sidey's editor at Atheneum, recalled her as having read galleys and submitted detailed notes on them. Despite this recollection, Sidey did not acknowledge her contribution in the book. The following year, she helped [[Ted Sorensen]] with his book ''Kennedy''. Sorensen told [[Greg Lawrence]] that after finishing the "first draft" of his "first big book", he gave Onassis the manuscript since he thought she would be helpful, and Onassis provided him with several comments on the book. Sorensen lauded her assistance in his memoir ''Counselor'', as he wrote that she had "proved to be a superb editor, correcting typographical errors, challenging mistaken assumptions, defending some of her husband's personnel decisions, suggesting useful clarifications, and repeatedly setting the record straight on matters not known to me".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, she attended the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]] and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors' gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Sabato, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, pp. 124–127&lt;/ref&gt; She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 following the false accusation by ''The New York Times'' that she held some responsibility for the company's publication of [[Jeffrey Archer]] novel ''[[Shall We Tell the President?]]'', which was set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and described an assassination plot against him.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at [[Faneuil Hall]] in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced that he was going to challenge incumbent president [[Jimmy Carter]] for the Democratic nomination for president.&lt;ref&gt;Leaming (2014), p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her resignation from Viking Press, Kennedy was hired by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], where she worked as an associate editor under an old friend, [[John Turner Sargent, Sr.]] Among the books she edited for the company are [[Larry Gonick]]'s ''[[The Cartoon History of the Universe]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; the English translation of the three volumes of [[Naghib Mahfuz]]'s ''[[Cairo Trilogy]]'' (with Martha Levin),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/lilly/mss/index.php?p=hutchinsinv|title=Hutchins mss.|work=indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and autobiographies of ballerina [[Gelsey Kirkland]],&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/fashion/02JACKIE.html|title=Once an Editor, Now the Subject|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackie O.: A Life in Books|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Jacqueline-Kennedys-Literary-Life|publisher=oprah.com|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fashion icon [[Diana Vreeland]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; She also encouraged [[Dorothy West]], her neighbor on Martha's Vineyard and the last surviving member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], to complete the novel ''The Wedding'' (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S.

[[File:Reagans with Jackie Kennedy.jpg|thumb|260px|Onassis in 1985 with the President and First Lady, [[Ronald Reagan|Ronald]] and [[Nancy Reagan]]]]

In addition to her work as an editor, Onassis participated in cultural and architectural preservation. In the 1970s, she led a historic preservation campaign to save from demolition and renovate [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Adler" /&gt; A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she was a major figure in protests against a planned skyscraper at [[Columbus Circle]] that would have cast large shadows on Central Park;&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eloquent Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis&amp;nbsp;– A Portrait in Her Own Words|volume=1| author = Adler, Bill | isbn = 978-0-06-073282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the project was cancelled. A later project proceeded despite protests: a large twin-towered skyscraper, the [[Time Warner Center]], was completed in 2003.

Onassis remained the subject of considerable press attention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-01-23/news/8902270699_1_mrs-onassis-wampanoag-indians-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis|title=Jackie Sues Indians In Martha's Vineyard Over A Beach|date=January 23, 1989|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notoriously involving the paparazzi photographer [[Ron Galella]], who followed her around and photographed her as she went about her day-to-day activities; he took candid photos of her without her permission.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFlLKoBOT4I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A32885&amp;page_number=3&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1%7ctitle=MoMA%7cwork=MoMA.org |title=The Collection |work=moma.org |accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ultimately obtained a restraining order against him, and the situation brought attention to the problem of paparazzi photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/02/nyregion/02folo.html|work= [[The New York Times]]|title=Ambush Photographer Leaves the Bushes|date=January 2, 2005| author = Fried, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980 until her death, Jacqueline maintained a close relationship with [[Maurice Tempelsman]], who was her companion and personal financial adviser; he was a Belgian-born industrialist and diamond merchant who was estranged from his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jbk.htm Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Onassis supported [[Bill Clinton]] and contributed money to his presidential campaign.&lt;ref name="LH135"/&gt; Following the election, she met with First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] and advised her on raising a child in the White House.&lt;ref name="NewYorker10132003"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/the-student|title=The Student: How Hillary Clinton set out to master the Senate|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=October 13, 2003|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoir ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]'', Clinton wrote that Onassis was "a source of inspiration and advice for me".&lt;ref name="LH135"&gt;Clinton, pp. 135–138&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic consultant [[Ann Lewis]] observed that Onassis had reached out to the Clintons "in a way she has not always acted toward leading Democrats in the past".&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes93"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930825&amp;slug=1717693|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reaches Out To President Clinton – She Ends Long Political Isolation|date=August 25, 1993|publisher=Seattle Times Newspaper|first=Kathy|last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1993, Jacqueline was thrown from her horse while participating in a [[fox hunt]] in [[Middleburg, Virginia]], and was taken to the hospital to be examined. A swollen [[lymph node]] was discovered in her groin, which was initially diagnosed by the doctor to be caused by an infection.&lt;ref name=death&gt;Leaming (2014), pp. 308–309&lt;/ref&gt; The fall from the horse contributed to her deteriorating health over the next six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/fall-while-foxhunting-marks-beginning-end-jackie-o-2D80555947|work=Today|title=A fall while foxhunting marks the beginning of the end of Jackie O|date=April 13, 2004|accessdate=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, Onassis developed new symptoms, including a stomach ache and swollen lymph nodes in her neck, and was diagnosed with [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=death/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytdeath&gt;{{cite news| last = Altman| first = Lawrence K.| title = Death of a first lady; No More Could Be Done, Mrs. Kennedy-Onassis Was Told|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/20/us/death-of-a-first-lady-no-more-could-be-done-mrs-onassis-was-told.html |date=May 20, 1994 |accessdate=June 24, 2011| work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began chemotherapy in January 1994 and publicly announced the diagnosis when she stated that the initial prognosis was good.&lt;ref name=death/&gt; She continued to work at Doubleday, but by March the cancer had spread to her spinal cord and brain, and by May to her liver.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytdeath/&gt; Onassis made her last trip home from [[New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center]] on May 18, 1994.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytdeath/&gt; The following night at 10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., she died in her sleep at age 64.&lt;ref name=nytdeath/&gt; John F.

[[File:Jacqueline Kennedy after State Dinner, 22 May 1962.jpg|left|thumb|Kennedy at a [[State dinner]] on May 22, 1962]]
Jacqueline Kennedy became a global fashion icon during her husband's presidency. After the 1960 election, she commissioned French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend [[Oleg Cassini]] to create an original wardrobe for her appearances as First Lady. From 1961 to 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan. In 1961, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president.&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt;

Kennedy preferred French couture, particularly the work of [[Coco Chanel|Chanel]], [[Cristóbal Balenciaga|Balenciaga]], and [[Hubert de Givenchy|Givenchy]], but was aware that in her role as First Lady, she would be expected to wear American designers' work.&lt;ref name=bowles&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowles |first1=Hamish |last2=John F.

She also suggested [[Ben Zuckerman]], another highly regarded tailor who regularly offered re-interpretations of Paris couture, and the [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] designer Stella Sloat, who occasionally offered Givenchy copies.&lt;ref name=bowles/&gt; Kennedy's first choice for her Inauguration Day coat was originally a purple wool Zuckerman model that was based on a [[Pierre Cardin]] design, but she instead settled on a fawn Cassini coat and wore the Zuckerman for a tour of the [[White House]] with Mamie Eisenhower.&lt;ref name=bowles/&gt;

In her role as First Lady, Kennedy preferred to wear clean-cut suits with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three-quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless [[A-line (clothing)|A-line]] dresses, above-the-elbow gloves, low-heel pumps, and [[pillbox hat]]s.&lt;ref name="fashion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Return of the Jackie Look&amp;nbsp;– Sort of Fashion from A-Line Dresses to Fitted Jackets |work = [[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1994/08/28/return-of-the-jackie-look-sort-of-fashion-from-a-line-dresses-to-fitted-jackets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed the "Jackie" look, these clothing items rapidly became fashion trends in the Western world. More than any other First Lady, her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and a large segment of young women.&lt;ref name="FirstLadies" /&gt; Her influential [[bouffant]] hairstyle, described as a "grown-up exaggeration of little girls' hair," was created by [[Mr. Kenneth]], who worked for her from 1954 until 1986.&lt;ref name=vf&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins| first=Amy Fine| title=It had to be Kenneth|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/06/kenneth-battelle-hairdresser-jackie-kennedy|accessdate=December 3, 2012|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=June 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, pp. 151–154&lt;/ref&gt;

In her years after the White House, Kennedy underwent a style change; her new looks consisted of wide-leg pantsuits, large lapel jackets, [[Bohemian style|gypsy skirts]], silk [[Hermès]] headscarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses. She often chose to wear brighter colors and patterns and even began wearing jeans in public.&lt;ref name="LIFE"&gt;{{cite news |title = Jackie Kennedy: Post-Camelot Style | work = [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |url = http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/31382/jackie-kennedy-postcamelot-style |accessdate = October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She set a new fashion trend with beltless, white [[jeans]] with a black [[turtleneck]] that was never tucked in and instead pulled down over her hips.

Off Newport, RI, aboard the USS Joseph P.... - NARA - 194214.jpg|thumb|Kennedy and the President watching the [[America's Cup Race]]]] Kennedy acquired a large collection of jewellery throughout her lifetime. Her triple-strand [[Pearl#Pearls in jewelry|pearl necklace]], designed by American jeweller [[Kenneth Jay Lane]], became her signature piece of jewelry during her time as First Lady in the White House. Often referred to as the "berry brooch," the two-fruit cluster brooch of strawberries made of rubies with stems and leaves of diamonds, designed by French jeweler [[Jean Schlumberger (jewelry designer)|Jean Schlumberger]] for [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], was personally selected and given to her by her husband several days prior to his inauguration in January 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasures of the Kennedy Library |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/NR/rdonlyres/5CE1EDAD-4E84-4DE6-AE2A-E01C47655B32/22759/TreasuresExhibit.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029153313/http://www.jfklibrary.org/NR/rdonlyres/5CE1EDAD-4E84-4DE6-AE2A-E01C47655B32/22759/TreasuresExhibit.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She wore Schlumberger's gold and enamel bracelets so frequently in the early and mid-1960s that the press called them "Jackie bracelets"; she also favored his white enamel and gold "banana" earrings. Kennedy wore jewelry designed by [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]] throughout the 1950s,&lt;ref name="jackiesjewelry.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jacqueline Kennedy Collection by Camrose &amp; Kross|url=http://jackiesjewelry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960s&lt;ref name="jackiesjewelry.com" /&gt; and 1970s; her sentimental favorite was the Van Cleef &amp; Arpels wedding ring given to her by President Kennedy.

'''Karl Wilhelm Scheibler''' ({{lang-pl|Karol Scheibler}}, 1 September 1820 &amp;ndash; 13 April 1881) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Poland|Polish]] industrialist, businessman and textile manufacturer.&lt;ref name=Heike&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;id=ZecIAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=heike+otto+textilindustrie&amp;q=medaille|title=Aufbau und Entwicklung der Lodzer Textilindustrie|accessdate=2009-10-02 |work= |publisher= Otto Heike |year=1971 |date= |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Scheibler was born in Montjoie (today [[Monschau]]) in the [[Prussia]]n [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] into a family of textile fabricants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSmid=46785965&amp;GRid=13378537&amp; findagrave]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended school in Monschau and [[Krefeld]] and received a practical education at his uncle's [[Worsted|Worsted factory]] at [[Verviers]] ([[Belgium]]). In 1839, he worked for [[Société anonyme John Cockerill]], a well known producer of machinery construction at that time.

Because of the riots of the [[Spring of Nations]] in 1848 Scheibler decided to leave Germany and moved to [[Ozorkow]] in [[Congress Poland]], where his uncle, Friedrich Schlösser, had operated a textile factory since 1816. After Schlösser's death he became its commercial director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IG3Rp8NAO8EC&amp;pg=PA794&amp;lpg=PA794&amp;dq=karl+wilhelm+scheibler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Uddn_skQZA&amp;sig=Hem-Mmlwzb4aQDmRSHD38H8DtJw&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=xuLFSoDwF56MmwPh0pFI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=karl%20wilhelm%20scheibler&amp;f=false|title=Deutsche biographische Enzyklopädie|accessdate=2009-10-02 |work= |publisher= Rudolf Vierhaus |year=2007 |date= |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheibler married Anna née Werner, a niece of Schlösser, on 16 September 1854. In 1852, Scheibler and his partner Julius Schwartz bought a plot at [[Łódź]] and started to build a machinery factory. In October 1854, Schwartz sold his share to Scheibler for 10,000 [[Ruble|rubles]], making him the sole owner of the factory.

In 1855, Scheibler founded a spinning mill with 34 frames and a steam engine of 40 [[horsepower]]. In 1857, Scheibler employed 180 labourers and earned a turnover of 305,100 rubles in 1860. Scheibler made large profits after cotton prices in Europe increased because of the [[American Civil War]] and sold his stock at triple the price.&lt;ref name=EU&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wie/eubuildit/manufacturing/lodz/scheibler/ EUbuildit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605082257/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wie/eubuildit/manufacturing/lodz/scheibler/ |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became known as the "King of the Cotton and Linen Empires of Łódź".&lt;ref name=Michlic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ces.fas.harvard.edu/publications/docs/pdfs/Michlic.pdf |title=Łódź in the Post-communist Era: In Search of a New Identity|accessdate=2009-10-02 |work=Joanna B. Michlic |publisher= Stockton University|year= |date= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, 1,911 employees worked in his factory, which was the third largest (9.3 percent) cotton producer of Poland.

Scheibler's factory continued to prosper and he bought several smaller mills in the districts of Źarki and Księży Młyn. After a fire destroyed the factory at Księży Młyn in 1874, Scheibler rebuilt it with 88.000 spindles and built his own "Kingdom" of Księży Młyn with houses for 321 families, a fire station, schools, shops and a hospital&lt;ref name=Michlic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migrationsroute.nrw.de/projekt_vorschlag.php?projekt_id=24 migrationsroute.nrw.de]{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheibler was known for his social engagement&lt;ref&gt;[http://gim24pitagora.atspace.com/poland/scheibler.html Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the foundation of a municipal credit association, the Commercial Bank of Łódź (Bank Handlowy) in 1872&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.it.pw.edu.pl/muzeum/data/ap151_info.html History of the Bank Handlowy] {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the construction of a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Catholic]] Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lodz.ap.gov.pl/fab7.html Biography at State archive Łódź] {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, he transformed his enterprise into a stock corporation with a share capital of 9 million Ruble.&lt;ref&gt;Urząd Miasta Łódź, ''Księży Młyn'', Łódź 1998, p. 23 {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheibler died on 13 April 1881 in Łódź and was buried at the [[Protestant]] Cemetery of Łódź in a [[Karol Scheibler's Chapel in Łódź|mausoleum]] designed by the Warsaw architects Joseph Dziekonski and Edward Lilop.

A '''multilateral exchange''' is a transaction, or forum for transactions, which involve more than two parties.

For example, Alice gives Bob an apple in exchange for an orange, that is a bilateral exchange.
A multilateral exchange would involve a third party, for example:
Alice gives an apple to Bob who gives an orange to Charles, who gives a pear to Alice.

In the real world, such transactions are spread over time, and involved items of different values, and involve many more parties. A special type of accounting is used for this, called [[mutual credit]], or [[credit clearing]].

==Accounting==
Although any accounting framework can be used, there is one approach that fits naturally for multilateral exchange. It is the simplest possible database/spreadsheet design, [[single-entry bookkeeping system|single-entry bookkeeping]] rather than [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

All accounts begin with a balance of zero, meaning they owe nothing and are owed nothing. An account may only close at zero, meaning it has given as much as it has received, i.e. that the exchange is complete with respect to all the other accounts. When a transaction happens, an entry is made in an accounting journal of a payment, or credit flowing in the opposite direction.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! #id !! Payee !! Payer !! Amount !! Description
|-
| 1 || Ann || Bob || 10 || Bob gave Ann an Apple
|-
| 2 || Bob || Charlie || 5 || Charlie gave Bob an Apricot
|-
| 3 || Charlie || Ann || 10 || Ann gave Charlie an Orange
|-
| Volume ||  ||  || 15 ||
|}
Account balances are derived by 'adding up' the journal.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! Balance !!  Meaning
|-
| Ann || 0 || Balanced - Ann may close her account
|-
| Bob || +10-5=5 || Bob is owed (and obliged to take) goods and services to the value of 5 units
|-
| Charlie || +5-10=-5 || Charlie owes (and is obliged to give) goods and services to the value of 5 units
|-
| Total || 0 || nothing entered or left this closed system of accounts.
|}
The sum of all account balances is ''a priori'' [[zero]]. Accounts which close (or are retired) above zero have given more value to the other accounts than they have received and vice versa. Thus a positive balance represents not value *in* the account, but value *owed* to that account by (the aggregate of) all other accounts.

An account's balance in such a system, indicates not the position of the account with respect to past activities with other accounts, but also the activity needed to complete the exchange. thus a balance of +10 means that not only has the account delivered +10 more value to the other members than it has received, but that in order to complete the exchange it intends to receive +10 more in the future than it delivers.

Bob's obligation to spend 5, exactly matches Charlie's obligation to earn 5.

== History ==

===As NAXION===
NAXION is the new name for National Analysts Worldwide, a [[market research]]/[[marketing research]] and consulting company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naxionthinking.com/about-us/our-history|title=Our History {{!}} NAXION  {{!}}  Research &gt; Consulting|website=www.naxionthinking.com|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm was formed in 1911 when [[Curtis Publishing Company]] hired [[Charles Coolidge Parlin]] to oversee the Division of Commercial Research and conduct research that would help manufacturers understand their customers in the newly emerging [[consumer economy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketingpower.com/Calendar/Pages/CharlesCoolidgeParlinAward.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History of Marketing Thought, Robert Bartels, page 124 - 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Market Research and Modeling: Progress and Prospects, Youuram Wind, Paul E. Green, page 246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to encourage manufacturing companies to make more effective use of advertising in Curtis publications like ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[The Ladies Home Journal]]'', both of which would go on to have a major impact on 20th Century popular culture. It is considered to be the "first commercial research company" ever formed.&lt;ref&gt;American Advertising Foundation www.advertisinghalloffame.org/members/member_bio.php?memid=748&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marketing/Research People: Their Behind-th-Scenes Stories, Jack J. Honomichl, page 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A New Brand of Business, Douglas B. Ward&lt;/ref&gt; It became an independent corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Curtis in 1943 in order to "provide research services to industry and government." In 1970, it was purchased by [[Booz Allen Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;Original Corporate Records, National Analysts Worldwide, Historical Society of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; a consulting firm then seeking to expand its role in the marketing services arena. Two Booz Allen Hamilton officers, Susan Schwartz McDonald and John Berrigan, purchased the firm in 1992, and with Berrigan's retirement in 2004, ownership was restructured as an [[Employee stock ownership plan|ESOP]] under the leadership of McDonald, CEO. In 2006, the firm changed its name to National Analysts Worldwide.  In June 2014, the firm changed its name to NAXION to better reflect its expanding 21st century capabilities and affirm its global reach.

==Business holding==
Nay Shwe Thway Aung is the Major broker between the regime officials and businesspersons. He has earned a reputation as the most notorious member of the ruling family. He has been accused of ordering military officers serving as his assistants to carry out attacks on business rivals, and even top generals are said to be wary of displeasing him.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www2.irrawaddy.com/article.php?art_id=20396|title=Than Shwe's Son-in-law Named Ambassador to China|date=23 December 2010|work=[[The Irrawaddy]]|access-date=|author=Wai Moe|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Nay Shwe Thway Aung had close ties to key figure with business tycoon [[Zaw Zaw]]. Through his relationships, Zaw Zaw have won concessions and import licenses, including most of the country's car and motorcycle import licenses, as well as import and distribution licenses for fuel.

According to business sources in Yangon, Nay Shwe Thway Aung took a new [[Mercedes Benz]] from a warehouse of the military-owned [[Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings|Union of Myanmar Economic Holding, Ltd]] (UMEHL), paying just 10 million kyat (US $11,600) for a luxury vehicle valued at least 200 million kyat ($230,000) in Burma.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; 

In January 2009, Nay Shwe Thway Aung has plan to buying one of the world's most popular football clubs, [[Manchester United]] football team for US $1 billion, according to US diplomatic cables revealed by [[WikiLeaks]], but he reportedly abandoned the plan, because such an investment only months after nearly 150,000 people were killed by [[Cyclone Nargis]], was deemed inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/06/wikileaks-burma-manchester-united-takeover|title=WikiLeaks cables: Burma general considered Manchester United buyout|date=6 December 2010|work=The Guardian News|access-date=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/football/03/21/soccer.wikileaks.manchester.myanmar/index.html|title=Soccerleaks: The football files|date=21 March 2011|publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Dictator post==
Nay Shwe Thway Aung was hoped heir pretender to the dictator of Burma, and will take his grandfather Than Shwe's chair and ruling authority by Burmese peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celekabar.com/%E1%80%96%E1%80%AD%E1%80%AF%E1%80%B8%E1%80%9C%E1%80%BB%E1%80%95%E1%80%8A%E1%80%B9%E1%80%B7-%E1%80%81-%E1%80%B1%E1%80%94%E1%80%B1%E1%80%9B%E1%82%8A%E1%80%B1%E1%80%9E%E1%80%BC%E1%80%B8%E1%80%B1/|title=ဖိုးလပြည့် (ခ) နေရွှေသွေးအောင် ပြောတဲ့ သူနဲ့သူ၏မေမေအကြောင်း|work=Cele Kabar|date=20 April 2018|accessdate=30 April 2018|language=my}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/documents/18154/Jade_full_report_online_low_res.pdf|title=Myanmar's "Big State Secret"|work=Global Witness|date=|accessdate=5 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 20th Birthday, Nay Shwe Thway Aung said "I will not succeed ruling authority from my grandfather [[Than Shwe]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://burma.irrawaddy.com/news/2011/11/16/2395.html |title=နေရွှေသွေးအောင် အကြောင်း|work=[[The Irrawaddy]]|date=16 November 2011|accessdate=30 April 2018|language=my}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Than Shwe officially stepped down as head of state in favour of his hand-picked successor, [[Thein Sein]] to [[President of Burma]].

In 4 December 2015, Nay Shwe Thway Aung and his grandfather [[Than Shwe]] met with [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] as the future leader of the country and that he pledged to support her if she works for the development of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mizzimaburmese.com/article/7946|title=“ဒေါ်အောင်ဆန်းစုကြည်၊ ဖိုးလပြည့်နဲ့ သတင်းမီဒီယာ လောက”|date=20 November 2015|work=[[Mizzima News]]|access-date=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mizzimaburmese.com/article/7900|title=တိုင်းပြည်အတွက် ကျရာကဏ္ဍက ကူညီမယ်လို့ ဖိုးလပြည့်ပြော

But the patience, analytical skills, the thinking skills, the ability to do those things will be skills that will be forever in demand."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wltx.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=138076&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview, he stated: "Studies have shown that chess develops logical thinking, improves concentration and promotes imagination, creativity and independence."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sc.edu/news/newsarticle.php?nid=2069#.UbLpokCTi90&lt;/ref&gt; As a speaker, De Abreu was represented internationally by [[Sabirul Islam]]'s Teen Speakers International Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teen-speakers.com/?p=251 |title=Pedro De Abreu |publisher=Teen-speakers.com |date=2011-10-11 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:De Abreu at TEDxColumbiaSC.jpg|thumb|De Abreu at TEDx]]De Abreu has spoken in countries like [[Dubai]], [[Oman]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Brazil]], and at [[TEDx]].&lt;ref&gt;http://leanblitz.net/2013/01/a-visit-to-tedxcolumbiasc/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sc.edu/news/newsarticle.php?nid=5271#.UbLum0CTi90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/6478&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/tedxyouthcolumbiasc/photos/pb.337793959590789.-2207520000.1397975724./676295039074011/?type=3&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:2008 05 07 - Baltimore - View above Hanover St 1.jpg|thumb|left|The two towers of the hotel]]
The '''Radisson Hotel Baltimore Downtown-Inner Harbor''' is a [[high-rise]] hotel complex located in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The complex contains two nearly identical towers, rising to 302 feet/92 meters, containing 27 floors and making them among the [[List of tallest buildings in Baltimore|tallest buildings in Baltimore]].

==History==
The hotel opened as '''The Statler Hilton Baltimore''' on July 15, 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/219159321/|title=The Baltimore Sun from Baltimore, Maryland on July 9, 1967 · 133|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one tower, containing 352 rooms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-03-16/business/0603160082_1_sheraton-inner-harbor-convention-hotel-sheraton-city-center|title=Baltimore will have two Sheraton hotels|website=Articles.baltimoresun.com|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Statler Hilton was a part of the Charles Center urban renewal project. The sponsors and developers, the Hilton Hotels Corporation and the Metropolitan Structures, Inc., signed a contract on July 25, 1964. The hotel was expected to cost $12 million and to contain 500 to 800 rooms in two towers. The first tower was scheduled to be completed by mid-1966.&lt;ref&gt;"Baltimore to Get Theater and Hotel." ''The New York Times'', July 26, 1964. Proquest Historical Newspaper: The New York Times with index, pg. 34. (accessed December 7, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The head architect of the project was [[William B. Tabler]]; a famous hotel architect who designed Hiltons throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Architecture: Design, Engineering, and Construction,'' s.v. "Tabler, William B," Vol 5. (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1990.)&lt;/ref&gt; The second tower was a later addition.

The hotel eventually became the '''Baltimore Hilton'''. In 1984, it was renamed the '''Omni International Baltimore''', in 2000 the '''Wyndham Baltimore''', in 2006 the '''Sheraton Baltimore City Center''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2006_1st/Mar06_BaltimoreSheraton.html|title=Columbia Sussex Planning to Rebrand the 707 room Wyndham Baltimore Inner Harbor to Sheraton; Reflagging Will Be the Hotel's Fourth Brand |date=1 March 2006|website=Hotel-online.com|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on May 29, 2014 the '''Baltimore Harbor Hotel''', and on May 18, 2016 the '''Radisson Hotel Baltimore Downtown-Inner Harbor'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article89356.html|title=Radisson Hotel Baltimore Downtown-Inner Harbor Hotel Opens|first=Hotel News|last=Resource|website=Hotelnewsresource.com|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel was the site of a 1980 Presidential debate between [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[John B. Anderson]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; TV

It also played host to the first WWE (then WWF) Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

The North Tower has 23 floors and the South Tower (which is now a separate '''Crowne Plaza Hotel''')  has 27 floors.

== Early and personal life ==

Hardy was born in Toronto, Ontario and grew up in Eastern Canada where he attended [[Earl of March Secondary School]]. After graduating from [[Bishops University]], Hardy’s passion for skiing pulled him to the West Coast. He spent a year skiing in Whistler and came to the decision that BC was his home.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David [http://www.bcbusiness.ca/people/clearly-contacts-ceo-roger-hardy "Clearly Contacts CEO Roger Hardy]''[[BC Business]]''Nov 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

While attending university, Hardy was a member of many sports teams where his competitive nature garnered him the Most Valuable Player of the year award. Later in his career, it was this competitive spirit that helped Hardy succeed in an online industry in which thousands had entered, and failed.&lt;ref&gt;Mitra, Sramana [http://www.sramanamitra.com/2010/11/12/building-a-niche-e-commerce-powerhouse-coastal-contacts-ceo-roger-hardy-part-1/ "Building A Niche E-Commerce Powerhouse: Coastal Contacts CEO Roger Hardy (Part 1)"] ''[[One Million by One Million]]''.

== Career ==

=== Coastal Contacts Inc. ===

Hardy first worked for a transportation and logistics company, followed by a [[contact lens]] company. While working at the contact lens company, Hardy recognized that purchasing contact lenses was expensive, time consuming and service constrained for consumers.

In 2000, Hardy founded Coastal Contacts Inc. The Company started in a basement office with one phone line, a 14K modem, a ping pong table and a Visa card. Hardy purchased the keyword “contact lens” from [[AltaVista]] and Snap.com. This keyword was not known to have any value at the time and no other companies were advertising on the keyword. Hardy bought the exclusive rights to “contact lenses” and launched with that advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Coastal Contacts [http://investors.coastal.com/Press-Room/News-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2009/Clearly-a-Winning-Strategy/default.aspx "Clearly a Winning Strategy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204192233/http://investors.coastal.com/Press-Room/News-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2009/Clearly-a-Winning-Strategy/default.aspx |date=2012-02-04 }}. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first day, they had 30 orders; within the first month, they had $68,000 in sales.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David [http://www.bcbusiness.ca/people/clearly-contacts-ceo-roger-hardy "Clearly Contacts CEO Roger Hardy"] ''[[BC Business]]'' Nov 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/success-stories/clearly-contacts-has-clear-vision-for-how-to-manage-growth/article2364571/ "Clearly Contacts has clear vision for how to manage growth"] ''[[the Globe and Mail]]'' Mar 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Hardy’s direction, Coastal Contacts Inc. became the world’s largest online retailer for eyewear. In 2001, Coastal achieved $1 million in cumulative revenue. In 2004, the Company began trading on TSX. In 2008, the Company launched eyeglasses business unit. In 2012, Coastal surpasses $1 billion in cumulative sales since 2000 and starts trading on NASDAQ.&lt;ref&gt;Coastal Contacts [http://investors.coastal.com/Investors/Financial-Reports/default.aspx "Financial Reports"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coastal Contacts [http://investors.coastal.com/Press-Room/News-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2012/Coastal-to-Begin-Trading-on-NASDAQ-as-COA1131576/default.aspx "Coastal to Begin Trading on NASDAQ"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Jacqueline [http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/industries/consumer-goods/business-without-borders-coastal-contacts/ "Business without Borders: Coastal Contacts"] ''[[Canadian Business]]'' Mar 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Easter Seals, The Ride to Conquer Cancer, The Greater Vancouver Food Bank, ORBIS Canada and The Red Cross are some of the many charities that he is involved with. 
Hardy has also contributed hundreds of pairs of free glasses to people in developing countries such as Mexico, El Salvador and Kenya, as well as disadvantaged people in Canada through Coastal Contacts Inc.’s own charity project, Change the View.&lt;ref&gt;Coastal Contacts [http://investors.coastal.com/Press-Room/News-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2011/Online-eyewear-company-to-Change-the-View-for-millions-around-the-world1124687/default.aspx "Online Eyewear Company to Change the View for Millions Around the World"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304074011/http://investors.coastal.com/Press-Room/News-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2011/Online-eyewear-company-to-Change-the-View-for-millions-around-the-world1124687/default.aspx |date=2014-03-04 }} 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tfss.ca/blog/2013/12/clearly-contacts-celebrates-over-5000-glasses-donated-to-tfss "Clearly Contacts Celebrates Over 5,000 Glasses Donated to TFSS"] Dec 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Shigeo Shingo'''|新郷 重夫|Shingō Shigeo|extra=1909 - 1990}}, born in [[Saga, Saga|Saga City]], [[Japan]], was a [[Japan]]ese [[industrial engineer]] who was considered as the world’s leading expert on manufacturing practices and the [[Toyota Production System]].

==Life and work==
After having worked as a technician specialized in fusions at the Taiwanese railways in [[Taipei]], at the end of the [[World War II]], in 1945, he started to work at the [[Japan Management Association]] (JMA)([[:ja:日本能率協会]]) in [[Tokyo]], becoming a consultant focused on the improvement of factory management. Gathering tips from the improvement experiences in the field he had in 1950 at Toyo Ind. (now [[Mazda]]) and in 1957 at the sites in [[Hiroshima]] of the [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industry]], since 1969 Shingō got involved in some actions in Toyota Motor Corporation ([[Toyota]]) for the reduction of set-up time (change of dies) of pressing machines which took him to the formulation of a specific technique based on operational analysis, which shortened set-up times from 1 to 2 hours (or even half a day) per each exchange of dies to a rapid setting of a few minutes. The method spread out under the English denomination ''Single Minute Exchange of Die'', abbreviated as [[Single-Minute Exchange of Die|SMED]].

Shingo may well be known better in the West than in Japan, as a result of his meeting [[Norman Bodek]], an American entrepreneur and founder of [[Productivity Inc.]] in the USA. In 1981 Bodek had travelled to Japan to learn about the Toyota Production System, and came across books by Shingō, who as an external consultant had been teaching [[Industrial engineering]] courses at Toyota since 1955. Since 1947, in fact, Shingō had been involved all over Japan in the training of thousands of people, who joined his courses on the fundamental techniques of analysis and improvement of the operational activities in factories (among which the [[P-Course]]&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, or ''Production Course'').&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}}'' JMAグループの原点・JMA Group no genten -The DNA of JMA Group'', edited by JMA Group renkei sokushin iinkai, Tokyo 2010 - pp 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

Shingō had written his Study of the [[Toyota Production System]] in Japanese and had it translated, very poorly, into English in 1980. Bodek took as many copies of this book as he could to the USA and arranged to translate Shingo's other books into English, eventually having his original study re-translated. Bodek also brought Shingō to lecture in the USA and developed one of the first Western lean manufacturing consultancy practices with Shingō's support.

The relevance of his contribution has sometimes been doubted, but it is substantially confirmed by the opinions of his contemporaries,&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: [[Akira Kōdate]]&lt;/ref&gt; many saw him even as a contributor to the fundamental concepts of [[Toyota Production System|TPS]], such as Just in time, and the “pull” production system, which were created by Toyota and Mr.[[Taiichi Ohno]] and still remain a strong logical and practical basis for the lean production and [[lean thinking]] management approaches.
The myth prevails that Shingo invented the [[Toyota Production System]] but what can be stated is that he did document the system. Thanks to his charisma we owe to Shingo the merit of having contributed to the formalization of some aspects of the management philosophy known as the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), developed and applied in Japan since the 1950s and later implemented in a huge number of companies in the world.

In 1988, the [[Jon M. Huntsman School of Business]] at [[Utah State University]] recognized Dr. Shingō for his lifetime accomplishments and created the [[Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence]] that recognizes world-class, lean organizations and [[operational excellence]].

The theorist of important innovations related to Industrial engineering, such as [[Poka-yoke]] and the [[Zero Quality Control]], Shingō could influence fields other than manufacturing.
For example, his concepts of SMED, mistake-proofing, and "zero quality control" (eliminating the need for inspection of results) have all been applied in the [[sales process engineering]]&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;{{cite book | title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|pages =94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shingo is the author of several books including: ''A Study of the Toyota Production System''; ''Revolution in Manufacturing: The SMED System''; ''Zero Quality Control: Source Inspection and the Poka-yoke System''; ''The Sayings of Shigeo Shingo: Key Strategies for Plant Improvement''; ''Non-Stock Production: The Shingo System for Continuous Improvement'' and ''The Shingo Production Management System: Improving Process Functions''.

'''Thomas Corcoran Jr.''' (1754 - January 27, 1830) was an [[Irish American]] merchant who served as mayor of the town of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and 22 terms on the Georgetown Common Council. He also held several appointed positions with the state of [[Maryland]] and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. He was one of Georgetown's and Washington's first philanthropists, and the father of banker and philanthropist [[William Wilson Corcoran]].

==Life and career==

===Early life in Ireland and Maryland===
Thomas Corcoran Jr. was born in 1754 (the exact date is not known) to Thomas and Elizabeth ({{nee}} Wilson) Corcoran in [[County Limerick]] in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]].{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=3}}{{sfn|Joint Select Committee to Investigate the Charities and Reformatory Institutions in the District of Columbia|1898|page=144}} Thomas Sr. had emigrated to Ireland from [[London]], and the Corcorans were a merchant family. Thomas' uncle, William Wilson, emigrated in 1769 to the city of [[Baltimore]] in the [[Province of Maryland]] in [[North America]].{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=3}} Thomas Jr. emigrated to the Baltimore himself in 1783,{{sfn|Holloway|1885|page=38}} where he took a position as a clerk in his uncle's import and export business.{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=3}} Over the next few years, William Wilson became one of the biggest importers in Maryland. Between 1783 and 1788, Thomas made three business trips aboard his uncle's merchant vessels, traveling twice to the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in Ireland and once to [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=3}}

Corcoran married Hannah Lemmon of Baltimore in 1788.{{sfn|Joint Select Committee to Investigate the Charities and Reformatory Institutions in the District of Columbia|1898|page=144}} That year, he traveled south with the intent of settling in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Corcoran's first stop, however, was the village of Georgetown on the northern shore of the [[Potomac River]] in southern Maryland. Impressed with the large number of ocean-going vessels docked at the port of Georgetown, Corcoran decided to forgo his trip to Richmond and settle in Georgetown.{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=3}} He brought his wife and children to Georgetown in late 1788,{{sfn|Warner|1994|page=74}} and rented a house on Congress Street (now 31st Street NW) from which he operated a shoemaker's shop and leather goods business.{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=3}} He swiftly grew wealthy supplying shoes for the faculty and students at nearby [[Georgetown University|Georgetown College]].{{sfn|Warner|1994|page=74}} Corcoran also began buying [[tobacco]] and [[flax]] seed for export on his uncle's ships.{{sfn|Joint Select Committee to Investigate the Charities and Reformatory Institutions in the District of Columbia|1898|page=144}} He built a three-story brick home at 122 Bridge Street (now [[M Street (Washington, D.C.)|M Street NW]]) and moved into it in 1791.{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=3}}

Corcoran became one of Georgetown's, and the District of Columbia's, wealthiest citizens in time.  He later became a director of the Bank of Columbia, and was a member of the board of trustees of [[George Washington University|Columbia College]].{{sfn|Holloway|1885|page=38}}{{sfn|Hall|1895|page=197}} He moved out of the leather and shoe business and into banking and real estate, where his fortune was made.{{sfn|Warner|1994|page=74}}

===Georgetown Common Council and mayor===
Corcoran's position in the community made him a leading political figure as well.  Georgetown was incorporated by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] on December 25, 1789. The town's charter provided for a mayor, recorder, several aldermen, and a "common council" of 10 people. The first recorded meeting of the common council was on November 28, 1791.{{sfn|Taggart|1908|page=202}} Corcoran was elected 22 times to the Georgetown Common Council.{{sfn|Warner|1994|page=74}} He was first elected [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.#Mayors of Georgetown (1790–1871)|Mayor of Georgetown]] in 1795 for a one-year term beginning January 7, 1805. His predecessor was [[Daniel Reintzel]], a successful real estate developer under whom Georgetown had rapidly prospered. Corcoran served but a single term initially, being replaced in 1806 by Reintzell. Corcoran was again elected town mayor for terms beginning in January 1808, January 1809, and January 1810. David Wiley succeeded him for a single term, and Corcoran served his last term as mayor of Georgetown in 1812.{{sfn|Tindall|1922|page=99}} After the [[Burning of Washington]] on August 24, 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], some members of Congress wished to move the nation's capital away from the District of Columbia. Corcoran swiftly offered Congress and the executive branch the use of Georgetown College while the [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol]] were being rebuilt.{{sfn|Warner|1994|page=185}}

The [[Thirteen Colonies]] declared their independence from [[Great Britain]] in July 1776, and achieved it with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 (which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]]). With ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788, a new national capital needed to be chosen. On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]], which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. The exact location was to be selected by President [[George Washington]], who chose a portion of the states of Maryland and [[Virginia]] on January 24, 1791.{{sfn|Evelyn|Dickson|Ackerman|2008|page=8}} The Maryland land was already owned by David Burns, [[Daniel Carroll]], Samuel Davidson, Robert Peter, and Notley Young (later known as the "original patentees"), and Washington needed to negotiate with them for the purchase of their property. He traveled to Georgetown for a meeting with the original patentees in March 1791.{{sfn|Benedetto|Donovan|Du Vall|2003|page=210}} Washington was greeted at the village's entrance by Corcoran and a group of 50 men on horseback.{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=4}} Corcoran delivered a speech and expressed the group's support for Washington's endeavors.{{sfn|Joint Select Committee to Investigate the Charities and Reformatory Institutions in the District of Columbia|1898|page=144}}{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=4}}

===Maryland and federal appointments===
Until December 1, 1800, citizens of the District of Columbia were able to vote in federal, state, and local elections in both Maryland and Virginia.{{sfn|Tindall|1909|page=17}} In 1794, [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Thomas Sim Lee]] appointed Corcoran [[adjutant]] of the 18th Regiment of the [[Maryland Army National Guard|Maryland militia]]. Governor [[Benjamin Ogle]] promoted him to captain in 1799.{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=4}}

President [[Thomas Jefferson]] appointed Corcoran a member of the Levy Court of the District of Columbia in 1801. This body, which had the authority of a [[county commission]], helped administer the part of the District of Columbia not included in the City of Washington or the town of Georgetown. Corcoran was reappointed to the position by President [[James Madison]] in 1809, President [[James Monroe]] in 1817, President [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1825, and President [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1829. He was still a member of the Levy Court at the time of his death.{{sfn|Joint Select Committee to Investigate the Charities and Reformatory Institutions in the District of Columbia|1898|page=144}}{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=4}}  His reputation also won Corcoran a seat on the first [[grand jury]] ever to sit in the District of Columbia (in 1801).{{sfn|Warner|1994|page=154}}

President Madison appointed Corcoran Postmaster of Georgetown in 1815. Corcoran held the lucrative position until his death.{{sfn|Joint Select Committee to Investigate the Charities and Reformatory Institutions in the District of Columbia|1898|page=144}}{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=4}}

==Personal life and death==
Corcoran was a lifelong member of the [[Anglicanism|Episcopal church]],{{sfn|Wallis|July 1872|page=163}} and was a [[vestryman]] at St. John's Episcopal Church of Georgetown.{{sfn|Warner|1994|page=234, fn. 8}} Corcoran was a noted philanthropist, and gave substantial sums of money to Columbian College, [[Christ Church (Georgetown, Washington, D.C.)|Christ Church of Georgetown]], [[Holy Trinity Catholic Church (Washington, D.C.)|Holy Trinity Catholic Church]], and St. John's Episcopal Church of Georgetown. He also gave liberally to create and endow [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cemeteries in Georgetown and its surrounding areas.{{sfn|Warner|1994|pages=74-75}}

Nothing is known about Thomas Corcoran's first wife, other than she died and they had no children.{{sfn|Holloway|1885|page=38}}{{sfn|Simmons|1981|page=70}} It is not known if he married in Ireland or America, when he married, how long the marriage lasted, what her name was, how old she was, or what she died from.

Thomas and Hanna Corcoran had 12 children (six boys and six girls), six of whom survived to maturity:  James, Eliza, Thomas Jr., Sarah, William, and Ellen.{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=4}} His youngest son, [[William Wilson Corcoran]], became one of the richest men in the District of Columbia through his banking activities, and founded Oak Hill Cemetery and the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]].{{sfn|Holloway|1885|pages=39-41}}{{sfn|Hall|1895|page=197}}

Thomas Corcoran died of unspecified causes at his home in Georgetown on January 27, 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Died|newspaper=The National Intelligencer|date=January 29, 1830}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear where he was initially buried, although cemetery and burial scholar Wesley Pippenger believes it likely that he was buried at the [[Presbyterian Burying Ground]] in Georgetown.{{sfn|Pippenger|2004|page=245}}  However, William Wilson Corcoran had his father's and mother's remains disinterred and reburied at Oak Hill Cemetery some time after 1850. They were interred beneath a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] grey granite pillar near the Corcoran Mausoleum.{{sfn|Corcoran|1879|page=540}}

Corcoran is one of two mayors of Georgetown to have a D.C. public school named after him.{{sfn|Commissioners of the District of Columbia|1913|page=22}} The Corcoran School, opened in 1889, closed in 1951. It then spent 30 years as administrative space before being sold to the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union, which used it for more than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey of Historic School Buildings in Georgetown: The Corcoran School|url=https://georgetownmetropolitan.com/2012/07/25/survey-of-historic-school-buildings-in-georgetown-the-corcoran-school/|website=Georgetown Metropolitan|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
