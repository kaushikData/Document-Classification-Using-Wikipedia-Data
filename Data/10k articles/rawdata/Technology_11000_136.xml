The '''advanced fire information system''' ('''AFIS''') provides information on current and historical fires detected by sensors on [[Earth observation satellite]]s, e.g. [[Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer|NASA MODIS]], [[Meteosat|EUMETSAT MSG]], [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES]], [[NPOESS Preparatory Project|NPP]], etc. covering multiple regions across the globe. The system provides monitoring of active fire on a web-based map and delivers near real-time alerts to registered users when a fire is detected within their specified areas of interest via email, [[Short Message Service|SMS]], [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/handle/10204/2789&lt;/ref&gt;

The system started as a research project at the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]] Meraka Institute in collaboration with [[Eskom]] in 2007. It was then extended to support many fire protection associations in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wof-int.com/wildfire-satellite-detection.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418110941/http://www.wof-int.com/wildfire-satellite-detection.html |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4720">[[Image:Ampeg Portaflex B-15N.JPG|thumb|right|200px|B-15N]]
The '''Portaflex''' is a line of [[amplifier]]s for electric guitars and bass guitars created by [[Ampeg]]. Originally designed by [[Jess Oliver]], the main characteristic of the Portaflex is that the head of the amplifier is stored inside the cabinet and flips over when being used. The Portaflex line has many different configurations.

==SB-12==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Ampeg manufactured the Portaflex SB-12 model amplifier from 1965-1971.  This lightweight (67 pound) cabinet incorporated the flip-top design of other larger Portaflex amplifiers of the time.  Although the SB-12 isn't as well known as the more powerful B-15, it is still highly sought after by musicians who use it mainly for studio recording.

The 'SB' in SB-12 stood for string bass; the '12' indicates the diameter of the speaker in inches.  It contained a single-channel, 25-watt tube amplifier and a single Jensen speaker.  Unlike bulk of the Portaflex line of bass amplifiers, the SB-12 was designed as a universal amplifier.  It incorporated two separate inputs, one labeled "Bass" and the other "Instruments".

FILE:Ampeg Portaflex B-15N (1967-1968).jpg|Portaflex B-15N (1960s)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fjestad|2010}} "''Much like all of Ampeg’s amps, the B-15 underwent constant change, and the B-15 was replaced by the B-15N in 1961. In 1962, Ampeg updated the B-15N with a solid-state rectifier called the B-15NB and introduced their famous “blue check” vinyl covering to their entire amp line. Ampeg went back to a tube rectifier and changed to a printed circuit board in 1964 (B-15NC). This model lasted until mid 1965, when they introduced the B-15NF with fixed bias tubes and a single-baffle cabinet.''".

In [[aviation]], an accident is defined by the [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation|Convention on International Civil Aviation]] Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft, which takes place from the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of [[flight]] until all such persons have disembarked, and in which a)&amp;nbsp;a person is fatally or seriously injured, b) the aircraft sustains significant damage or structural failure, or c) the aircraft goes missing or becomes completely inaccessible.&lt;ref name=Annex13&gt;{{cite web

== Major disasters ==

=== September 11 terrorist attacks ===
{{main|September 11 attacks}}
'''2,996:''' The deadliest aviation-related disaster of any kind, considering fatalities on both the aircraft and the ground, was the destruction of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]] on September 11, 2001. On that morning four aircraft traveling on transcontinental flights from East Coast airports to California were [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] after takeoff, and used in four separate [[Suicide Attack|suicide attacks]] against major American landmarks by 19 [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorists]] affiliated with [[Al Qaeda]]. [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and [[United Airlines Flight 175]] were intentionally crashed into the North and South Towers respectively of the World Trade Center, [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destroying both buildings in less than two hours]]. The World Trade Center crashes killed 2,753, the vast majority of fatalities being occupants of the World Trade Center towers or emergency personnel responding to the disaster. In addition, 184 were killed by [[American Airlines Flight 77]], which crashed into [[The Pentagon]] (causing severe damage and partial destruction to the building's west side). 40 passengers were also killed when [[United Airlines Flight 93]] crashed into a [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset County]] Pennsylvania field after passengers fought back and prevented the hijackers from reaching their designated target. This brought the total number of casualties of the September 11 attacks to 2,996 (including the 19 terrorist hijackers). As deliberate terrorist acts, the 9/11 crashes were not classified as accidents, but as mass murder-suicide; these events were subsequently treated by the [[United States]] and the member nations of [[NATO]] as an act of war and terrorism.

=== Tenerife disaster ===
'''583:''' The [[Tenerife airport disaster]], which occurred on March 27, 1977, remains the accident with the highest number of airliner passenger fatalities. 583 people died when a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 747]] attempted to take off without flight clearance, and collided with a taxiing [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] 747 at [[Los Rodeos Airport]] on the Canary Island of Tenerife, Spain.  There were no survivors from the KLM aircraft; 61 of the 396 passengers and crew on the Pan Am aircraft survived. Pilot error was the primary cause, as the KLM captain began his takeoff run without obtaining air traffic control clearance.&lt;ref name="Tonyleather"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tonyleather|title=The Deadliest Airplane Accidents in History|url=http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/mass-murder/news-most-fatal-plane-crashes-past-100-years?image=|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Sebastien Freissinet|title=The Tenerife crash-March 27th, 1977|url= http://www.1001crash.com/index-page-Tenerife-lg-2.html |accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contributing factor was the dense fog. The KLM flight crew could not see the Pan Am aircraft on the runway until immediately before the collision.&lt;ref name=ASN&gt;{{cite web|title=ASN Accident Description|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19770327-0|publisher=Aviation Safety Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident had a lasting influence on the industry, particularly in the area of communication. An increased emphasis was placed on using standardized phraseology in air traffic control (ATC) communication by both controllers and pilots alike. "[[Cockpit Resource Management]]"  has also been incorporated into flight crew training. The captain is no longer considered infallible, and combined crew input is encouraged during aircraft operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenerife-information-centre.com/tenerife-airport-disaster.html|title=The Tenerife Airport Disaster – the worst in aviation history|work=The Tenerife Information Centre|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== JAL Flight 123 ===
'''520:''' The crash of [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]] on August 12, 1985, is the single-aircraft disaster with the highest number of fatalities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/632.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Investigation Report Japan Air Lines Co., Ltd. Boeing 747 SR-100, JA8119 Gunma Prefecture, Japan August 12, 1985 |work=[[Japan Transport Safety Board]] |date=June 19, 1987 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 520 people died on board a [[Boeing 747]]. The aircraft suffered an [[uncontrolled decompression|explosive decompression]] from an incorrectly repaired [[aft pressure bulkhead]], which failed in mid flight, destroying most of its [[vertical stabilizer]] and severing all of the hydraulic lines, making the 747 virtually uncontrollable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= AviationSafetyNetwork|title=Accident description|url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19850812-1|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilots were able to keep the plane flying for 32 minutes after the mechanical failure before crashing into a mountain. All 15 crew members and 505 of the 509 passengers on board died. The death toll was exacerbated by delays in the rescue operation. Although a number of people survived the impact, by the time the Japanese rescue teams arrived at the crash site all but four had succumbed to their injuries.

=== 1996 Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision ===

'''349:''' On November 12, 1996, the world's deadliest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Klein|title=Top 10 plane crashes in the world|url=http://www.planecrashes.org/top-10-plane-crashes.html|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mid-air collision]] was the [[Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision]] involving [[Saudia]] Flight 763 and [[Kazakhstan Airlines]] Flight 1907 over [[Charkhi Dadri]], [[India]]. The collision was mainly the result of the Kazakh pilot flying lower than the assigned clearance altitude. All 349 passengers and crew on board of both the aircraft died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= AviationSafetyNetwork|title=Accident description|url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19961112-1|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ramesh Chandra Lahoti]] Commission, empowered to study the causes, recommended the creation of the "semi-circular rule", to prevent aircraft from flying in opposite directions at the same altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flightcrewguide.com/wiki/rules-regulations/semicircular-cruising-level-system-icao/|title=Semicircular Cruising Level System (ICAO)|last=|first=|date=|website=Flight Crew Guide|publisher=|accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil Aviation Authorities in India made it mandatory for all aircraft flying in and out of India to be equipped with a [[Traffic Collision Avoidance System]] (TCAS), setting a worldwide precedent for mandatory use of TCAS.

=== Other crashes with death tolls of 200 or higher ===
{{See also|List of aircraft accidents and incidents resulting in at least 50 fatalities|List of aircraft accidents and incidents by number of ground fatalities}}

'''346:''' On March 3, 1974, [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]], a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], crashed in [[Ermenonville Forest|a forest]] northeast of Paris, France. The London-bound plane crashed shortly after taking off from Orly airport; all 346 people on board died. It was later determined that the cargo door detached, which caused an explosive decompression; this caused the floor just above to collapse. The collapsed floor severed the control cables, which left the pilots without control of the elevators, the rudder and No. 2 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accident description|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19740303-1|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane entered a steep dive and crashed. It was the deadliest plane crash of all time until the Tenerife disaster in 1977.&lt;ref name="Tonyleather"/&gt;

'''329:''' On June 23, 1985, [[Air India Flight 182]], a [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-237B]], crashed off the southwest coast of Ireland when a bomb exploded in the cargo hold. All 307 passengers and 22 crew members died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= AviationSafetyNetwork|title=Accident description |url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19850623-2|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One passenger had checked in as "M. Singh". Singh did not board the flight. His suitcase containing the bomb was loaded onto the plane, however. "Mr Singh" was never identified or captured. It was later determined [[Sikh]] extremists were behind the bombing as a retaliation for the Indian government's [[Operation Blue Star|attack]] on the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] in the city of [[Amritsar]], which is very important for the Sikhs. This was, at the time, the deadliest terrorist attack involving an airplane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Touchton|title= Recent Major Bomb Blasts and Terror Attacks in India|url= http://voices.yahoo.com/recent-major-bomb-blasts-terror-5964202.html?cat=16|accessdate= May 7, 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140715034520/http://voices.yahoo.com/recent-major-bomb-blasts-terror-5964202.html?cat=16|archivedate= July 15, 2014|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''301:''' On August 19, 1980, [[Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 163]], a [[Lockheed L-1011]], became the world's deadliest aviation accident that did not involve a crash. The crew performed an emergency landing at [[Riyadh]] after a fire broke out in an aft baggage compartment. The fire burned through the ceiling of the compartment and into the passenger cabin. While the crew managed to land the plane safely, the captain did not stop immediately and order an evacuation. He taxied off the runway instead, by which time everyone in the cabin had become unconscious due to fumes and unable to open any doors or evacuate. All 301 passengers and crew died of suffocation before rescue ground crews could open any door, after which the aircraft burst into flames and was consumed by fire.&lt;ref name=AccidentReport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lessonslearned.faa.gov/Saudi163/AircraftAccidentReportSAA.pdf |title=Saudi Arabian Airlines flight 163 Accident Report |publisher=Saudi Arabian Presidency of Civil Aviation |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''298:''' On July 17, 2014, [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]], a Boeing 777-200ER, flying from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Kuala Lumpur]] with 298 people on board, was shot down in an area of Eastern [[Ukraine]] near the Ukraine/Russian border during [[War in Donbass|Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. There were 283 passengers, including 3 infants, and 15 crew members on board MH17, all of whom perished. The crew were all Malaysians, while the passengers were of various nationalities, most from the Netherlands. According to a Dutch report, high-energy objects hit the plane in midair, causing it to break apart. According to the preliminary report of the international investigation commission, the plane was shot down by [[Russian Armed Forces|Russian occupation troops]] using a [[surface-to-air missile]] fired from the Ukrainian territory that they occupied.

'''239:''' On March 8, 2014, a [[Boeing 777-200ER]], [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]], flying from [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], to [[Beijing]], [[China]], lost contact with air traffic controllers over the [[South China Sea]], deviated from its planned route, and was presumed lost in the southern [[Indian Ocean]]. It carried 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 15 nations. A multinational search effort, the most extensive and expensive in aviation history, has thus far failed to locate them, though debris from the aircraft were recovered on July 29, 2015, on [[Réunion Island]]. Numerous [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 unofficial disappearance theories|theories]] have been offered to explain the disappearance of the flight, but none has been confirmed.

'''234:''' On September 26, 1997, an [[Airbus A300B4-220]], [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 152]], which departed from [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], and was preparing to land at [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]], crashed into mountainous terrain, killing 222 passengers and 12 crew members. The causes included turning left instead of right as instructed by the ATC and descending below the assigned altitude of 2,000 feet due to pilot error.

'''230:''' On July 17, 1996, a [[Boeing 747-131]], [[TWA Flight 800]], carrying 212 passengers and 18 crew, exploded and crashed into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near [[East Moriches]], [[New York (state)|New York]], shortly after departing from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] on a flight to [[Paris]] and [[Rome]]. A lengthy investigation concluded that the [[probable cause]] of the accident was a short circuit in a fuel tank that contained an explosive mixture of fuel vapor and air. As a result, new requirements were developed to prevent future fuel tank explosions in aircraft.

'''229:''' On September 2, 1998, a [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]], [[Swissair Flight 111]], carrying 215 passengers and 14 crew from [[New York City]] to [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] crashed into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], killing all aboard. After a lengthy investigation, an official report stated that flammable material used in the aircraft's structure, specifically the Personal TV Systems recently installed in the Business Class Cabin, allowed a fire to spread, resulting in a loss of control.

'''228:''' On June 1, 2009, an [[Airbus A330-203]], [[Air France Flight 447]], carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew, was en route from [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] to [[Paris]], [[France]], when it crashed into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The aircraft's [[flight recorder]]s were not recovered from the ocean floor until May 2011, and the final investigative report was released in July 2012. It determined that the disaster was likely due to the aircraft's [[pitot tube]]s being obstructed by ice crystals, causing the [[autopilot]] to disconnect. The crew reacted incorrectly, leading to an [[stall (flight)|aerodynamic stall]] from which the jet did not recover.

'''228:''' On August 6, 1997, a [[Boeing 747-3B5]], [[Korean Air Flight 801]], crashed on approach to the international airport in the United States territory of [[Guam]], killing 228 of the 254 people aboard. Contributing factors in the crash were fatigue and errors by the flight crew, inadequate flight crew training, and a modification of the airport's altitude warning system that prevented it from detecting aircraft below a minimum safe altitude.

'''227:''' On January 8, 1996, an [[Antonov An-32B]] aircraft with 6 crew members on board overshot the runway at [[Kahemba Airport]] and plowed into a market place. Four on board survived but 225 people on the ground were killed and an estimated 500 were injured (estimated 253 seriously injured). It is the crash with the most non-passenger ground fatalities (not including [[9/11]]). It is usually known as the [[1996 Air Africa crash]].

'''225:''' On May 25, 2002, a [[Boeing 747-209B]], [[China Airlines Flight 611]], bound for [[Hong Kong International Airport]] in [[Hong Kong]], disintegrated in mid-air and crashed into the [[Taiwan Strait]] 20 minutes after takeoff from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (now [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]]) in [[Taiwan]]. It was determined that the crash, which killed all 206 passengers and 19 crewmembers aboard the plane, was caused by improper repairs to the aircraft 22 years earlier when the aircraft encountered a [[tailstrike]].

'''224:''' On October 31, 2015, an [[Airbus A321-231]], [[Metrojet Flight 9268]], crashed in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] after departing [[Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport]], [[Egypt]], en route to [[Pulkovo Airport]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. All 217 passengers and 7 crewmembers were killed. A branch of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] claimed responsibility for bringing down the jet, and a Russian investigation concluded that a bomb was detonated inside the plane at a high altitude.

'''223:''' On May 26, 1991, a [[Boeing 767-3Z9ER]], [[Lauda Air Flight 004]], broke up in midair over a remote area of [[Thailand]] due to an uncommanded deployment of a [[thrust reverser]] on one of the plane's engines, killing all 213 passengers and 10 crewmembers aboard. The flight, which originated at [[Kai Tak Airport]], [[Hong Kong]], and made a stopover at [[Don Mueang International Airport]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], was en route to [[Vienna International Airport]], [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], when the accident occurred.

'''217:''' On October 31, 1999, a [[Boeing 767-366ER]], [[EgyptAir Flight 990]], flying from [[Los Angeles International Airport]], [[United States]], to [[Cairo International Airport]], [[Egypt]], with a stop at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], [[New York City]], crashed into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] south of [[Nantucket Island]], [[Massachusetts]], killing all 203 passengers and 14 crewmembers. The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] determined that the [[probable cause]] of the crash was deliberate action by the relief first officer in response to his removal from international service within [[Egyptair]], a finding disputed by Egyptian authorities who maintain another cause of the accident.

'''213:''' On January 1, 1978, a [[Boeing 747-237B]], [[Air India Flight 855]], crashed into the [[Arabian Sea]] just off the coast of [[Bombay]], [[India]], killing all 190 passengers and 23 crew on board. An investigation concluded that the captain became disoriented after the failure of one of the flight instruments in the cockpit, leading to "irrational control inputs" that caused the plane to crash.

'''203:''' On February 16, 1998, an [[Airbus A300B4-622R]], [[China Airlines Flight 676]], en route from [[Ngurah Rai Airport]] in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]], to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (now [[Taoyuan International Airport]]), [[Taiwan]], crashed into a road and residential neighborhood in [[Taoyuan, Taiwan]], killing 182 passengers, 14 crew, and 7 people on the ground. An investigation determined that when the control tower ordered the pilot to abort his landing and "go around" for a second attempt, the pilot, who had unintentionally released the plane's autopilot, did nothing to take control of the plane for 11 seconds as he apparently thought the autopilot would initiate the go around. As the aircraft approached the airport, the pilot executed a sudden steep ascent that produced a [[Stall (flight)|stall]] and crash. [[China Airlines]] was also criticized for "insufficient training."

'''200:''' On July 10, 1985, a [[Tupolev Tu-154B-2]], [[Aeroflot Flight 7425]], on a domestic [[Karshi]]–[[Ufa]]–[[Leningrad]] route, crashed near [[Uchkuduk]], [[Uzbek SSR]], [[Soviet Union]], on the second leg of its route. All 191 passengers and 9 crew were killed. An investigation concluded that the plane went down due to pilot error. The air crew used an inappropriately low airspeed, causing vibrations that they incorrectly interpreted as engine surges. As a result, they further reduced engine power, causing the aircraft to [[Stall (flight)|stall]] and crash.

[[File:Boeing 720 Controlled Impact Demonstration.jpg|thumb|right|[[Controlled Impact Demonstration]] by [[NASA]] and the [[FAA]].]]

In over one hundred years of implementation, aviation safety has improved considerably.  In modern times, two major manufacturers still produce heavy passenger aircraft for the civilian market: [[Boeing]] in the [[United States|United States of America]], and the [[Europe]]an company [[Airbus]]. Both place huge emphasis on the use of aviation safety equipment, now a billion-dollar industry in its own right; for each, safety is a major selling point—realizing that a poor safety record in the aviation industry is a threat to corporate survival. Some major safety devices now required in commercial aircraft involve:

Measured on a passenger-distance calculation, air travel is the safest form of transportation available: Figures mentioned are the ones shared by the air industry when quoting air safety statistics. A typical statement, e.g., by the BBC: "UK airline operations are among the safest anywhere. When compared to all other modes of transport, on a 'fatality per mile basis', air transport is the safest&amp;nbsp;— six times safer than traveling by car; twice as safe as rail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/736582.stm |date=May 8, 2000 |publisher=BBC News |title=Flying remains the safest form of travel | accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When measured by fatalities per person transported, however, buses are the safest form of transportation.  The number of air travel fatalities per person is surpassed only by bicycles and motorcycles. This statistic is used by the insurance industry when calculating insurance rates for air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16321985.200-flight-into-danger.html |title=Flight into danger |date=August 7, 1999 |publisher=New Scientist Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per every billion kilometers traveled, trains have a fatality rate 12 times over air travel; by comparison, fatality rates for automobiles are 62 times greater than air travel. By contrast, for every billion [[travel|journeys]], buses are the safest form of transportation. By the last measure, air transportation is three times more dangerous than car transportation, and almost 30 times more dangerous than bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/risks_of_travel.htm |title=The risks of travel |website=numberwatch.co.uk |accessdate=2017-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010907173322/http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/risks_of_travel.htm |archivedate=September 7, 2001 }} The website attributes the source as an October 2000 article by editor [[Roger Ford]] in the magazine ''[[Modern Railways]]'' and based on an unidentified DETR survey.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study by ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' found passengers sitting at the back of a plane are 40% more likely to survive a crash than those sitting in the front.  Although this article quotes Boeing, the FAA and a website on aircraft safety, all claim there is no "safest" seat.

In efforts to prevent incidents such as the disappearance of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370]], a new standard has been issued for all commercial aircraft to report their position every 15 minutes to air traffic controllers regardless of the country of origin.  The regulation was taken into effect in 2016 by the [[ICAO]], and requires no new aircraft equipment so long as airlines adhere to it.  This requirement is part of a long-term plan, in which by 2020 [[ICAO]] will require new aircraft be fitted with data broadcast systems that air traffic controllers are in constant contact with.  The plan is called the Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2015051500&amp;type=hitlist&amp;num=0|title=Airline Safety|website=CQ Researcher by CQ Press|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASRS==
{{Main|Aviation Safety Reporting System}}
The [[Aviation Safety Reporting System]] (ASRS) collects voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident/situation reports from pilots, controllers and others. The ASRS uses reports to identify system deficiencies, issue alert messages, and produce two publications, ''CALLBACK'', and ''ASRS Directline''. The collected information is made available to the public, and is used by the FAA, NASA and other organizations working in research and flight safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/overview/summary.html |title=Aviation Safety Reporting System |date=May 9, 2012 |publisher=ASRS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.baaa-acro.com/ Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives] (B3A), a non-government organization based in [[Geneva]], compiles statistics on aviation accidents of aircraft capable of carrying more than six passengers, excluding helicopters, balloons, and combat aircraft.  Note that ACRO only considers crashes in which the aircraft has suffered such damage that it is removed from service, which will further reduce the statistics for incidents and fatalities compared to some other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=My mission, my goal |url=http://www.baaa-acro.com/presentation/ |website=Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, Aircraft Crashes Record Office (ACRO) |accessdate=2017-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025160002/http://www.baaa-acro.com/presentation/ |archive-date=October 25, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ACRO, recent years have been considerably safer for aviation, with fewer than 170 incidents every year between 2009 and 2017, compared to as many as 226 as recently as 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baaa-acro.com/statistics/crashs-rate-per-year|title=B3A Accidents per year|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual fatalities have been less than 1,000 in nine of the fourteen years since 2004, with 2017 experiencing the lowest number of fatalities, at 399, since the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baaa-acro.com/statistics/death-rate-per-year|title=B3A Deaths Per Year|author=B3A|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2014 included the [[MH370|disappearance of flight MH370]] over the [[Indian Ocean]] (possible homicide, plane not found apart from minor debris washed ashore) and the [[MH17|shootdown of flight MH17]] by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine as part of the [[War in Donbass]]. The total number of fatalities in 2014 was 869 more than in 2013.

===Annual Aviation Safety Review (EASA)===
The [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) is tasked by Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 20, 2008 to provide an annual review of aviation safety.

The '''Annual Safety Review''' presents statistics on European and worldwide civil aviation safety. Statistics are grouped according to type of operation, for instance, commercial air transport, and aircraft category, such as aeroplanes, helicopters, gliders, etc.
The Agency has access to accident and statistical information collected by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.easa.europa.eu/the-agency/the-agency|title=European Aviation Safety Agency|date=July 6, 2017 |publisher=[[EASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; States are required, according to ICAO Annex 13, on Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation, to report to ICAO information, on accidents and serious incidents to aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off mass (MTOM) over 2250&amp;nbsp;kg. Therefore, most statistics in this review concern aircraft above this mass. In addition to the ICAO data, a request was made to the EASA Member States to obtain light aircraft accident data. Furthermore, data on the operation of aircraft for commercial air transport were obtained from both ICAO and the [[NLR Air Transport Safety Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlr-atsi.nl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308135957/http://www.nlr-atsi.nl/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 8, 2007|title=NLR-ATSI|author=NLR-ATSI|publisher=|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7765">'''Betavoltaic devices''', also known as '''betavoltaic cells''', are generators of [[electric current]], in effect a form of [[battery (electricity)|battery]], which use energy from a [[radioactive]] source emitting [[beta particle]]s ([[electron]]s). A common source used is the [[hydrogen]] [[isotope]] [[tritium]]. 
Unlike most nuclear power sources, which use nuclear radiation to generate heat, which then is used to generate electricity (thermoelectric and thermionic sources), betavoltaics use a non-thermal conversion process; converting the electron-hole pairs produced by the ionization trail of beta particles traversing a semiconductor.&lt;ref name=tr20091109&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/23959/ A 25-Year Battery: Long-lived nuclear batteries powered by hydrogen isotopes are in testing for military applications], Katherine Bourzac, [[Technology Review]], MIT, 17 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Betavoltaic power sources (and the related technology of [[Alphavoltaics|alphavoltaic]] power sources&lt;ref&gt;NASA Glenn Research Center, [http://rt.grc.nasa.gov/power-in-space-propulsion/photovoltaics-power-technologies/technology-thrusts/alpha-and-beta-voltaics/ Alpha- and Beta-voltaics] (accessed Oct. 4, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;) are particularly well-suited to low-power electrical applications where [[Service life|long life]] of the energy source is needed, such as [[Implant (medicine)|implantable medical devices]] or [[military]] and [[Outer space|space]] applications.&lt;ref name="tr20091109" /&gt;

== History ==
Betavoltaics were invented in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/park-j1/|title=Review and Preview of Nuclear Battery Technology|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[pacemaker]]s in the 1970s used betavoltaics based on [[promethium]],&lt;ref name=olsen1973&gt;{{cite journal | last = Olsen | first = L.C. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Betavoltaic energy conversion | journal = Energy Conversion | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 117–124, IN1, 125–127 | publisher = Elsevier Ltd. | location = | date = December 1973 | url = | doi = 10.1016/0013-7480(73)90010-7 | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were phased out as cheaper lithium batteries were developed.&lt;ref name="tr20091109"/&gt;

Early [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] materials weren't efficient at converting [[electron]]s from [[beta decay]] into usable current, so higher energy, more expensive—and potentially hazardous—[[isotope]]s were used. The more efficient semiconducting materials used today can be paired with relatively benign isotopes such as tritium, which produce less radiation.&lt;ref name="tr20091109"/&gt;

The [[Betacel]] was considered the first successfully commercialized betavoltaic battery. The use of diamond-encapsulated carbon-14 to be extracted from nuclear waste was proposed in 2016 as a very long lived betavoltaic source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thechemicalengineer.com/latest%20news/2016/november/diamond-battery-made-from-nuclear-waste.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202233327/http://www.thechemicalengineer.com/latest%20news/2016/november/diamond-battery-made-from-nuclear-waste.aspx |archive-date=2016-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 a Russian design based on 2-micron thick [[Isotopes of nickel|nickel-63]] slabs sandwiched between 10 micron diamond layers was introduced. It produced power output of about 1 microWatt (μW) at a [[power density]] of 10 μW/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Its energy density was 3.3 kilowatt-hours/kg. The half-life of nickel-63 is 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/nickel-nuclear-battery-design/54884|title=Russian scientists pack more power into nuclear battery prototype|last=Irving|first=Michael|date=June 3, 2018|website=newatlas.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The primary use for betavoltaics is for remote and long-term use, such as [[spacecraft]] requiring electrical power for a decade or two. Recent progress has prompted some to suggest using betavoltaics to [[trickle charging|trickle-charge]] conventional batteries in consumer devices, such as [[cell phones]] and [[laptop computers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=betavoltaic.co.uk|url=http://www.betavoltaic.co.uk/trickle_charge.html|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1973, betavoltaics were suggested for use in long-term medical devices such as [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]].&lt;ref name=olsen1973/&gt;

Although betavoltaics use a radioactive material as a power source, the beta particles used are low energy and easily stopped by a few millimetres of shielding. With proper device construction (that is, proper shielding and containment), a betavoltaic device would not emit dangerous radiation. Leakage of the enclosed material would engender health risks, just as leakage of the materials in other types of batteries (such as [[lithium]], [[cadmium]] and [[lead]]) leads to significant health and environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maher | first = George | title = Battery Basics | work = County Commissions, North Dakota State University and U.S. Department of Agriculture | publisher = North Dakota State University | date = October 1991 | url = http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ageng/safety/ae1022w.htm | accessdate = August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawbacks ==
As radioactive material emits, it slowly decreases in activity (refer to [[half-life]]). Thus, over time a betavoltaic device will provide less power. For practical devices, this decrease occurs over a period of many years. For [[tritium]] devices, the half-life is 12.32 years. In device design, one must account for what battery characteristics are required at end-of-life, and ensure that the beginning-of-life properties take into account the desired usable lifetime.

Liability connected with environmental laws and human exposure to tritium and its beta decay must also be taken into consideration in risk assessment and product development. Naturally, this increases both time-to-market and the already high cost associated with tritium.
A 2007 report by the UK government's [[Health Protection Agency]] Advisory Group on Ionizing Radiation declared the health risks of tritium exposure to be double those previously set by the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] located in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12984-tritium-hazard-rating-should-be-doubled.html |work=NewScientist |title=Tritium hazard rating 'should be doubled' |date=29 November 2007 |first=Rob |last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brenda Laurel''', [[Ph.D.]] works as an independent scholar and consultant. She is an advocate for diversity and inclusiveness in video games, a "pioneer in developing [[virtual reality]]",&lt;ref name="girl games" /&gt; a public speaker and an academic. She is also a board member of several companies and organizations.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brenda Laurel |url=http://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/design-mba/blaurel |publisher=California College of the Arts |accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was founder and chair of the Graduate Design Program at [[California College of the Arts]] (2006–2012).&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and of the Media Design graduate program at Art Center College of Design (2000–2006). She has worked for [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]], co-founded the game development firm [[Purple Moon]], and served as an interaction design consultant for multiple companies including [[Sony Pictures]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Citibank]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

==Education==

Laurel received a [[Bachelor's degree#United States|Bachelor of Arts]] from [[DePauw University]]. She received her [[Masters of Fine Arts]] as well as her [[Ph.D.]] from [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== Early works ==
Laurel's first games were for the CyberVision platform in 1977/78.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MattPowers/20140425/215846/The_History_of_a_Forgotten_Computer__PART_1.php|title=The History of a Forgotten Computer – PART 1|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the worked as a producer at Atari between 1980 and 1983 after which she worked for Activision between 1985 and 1987. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brenda Laurel : pioneering games for girls|last=A.,|first=Kocurek, Carly|isbn=9781501319778|location=New York|oclc=974487356|date = 2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 80's and early 90's she worked as a creative consultant on a number of Lucasfilm Games and Chris Crawford's Balance of the Planet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Purple Moon and games for girls==
{{main|Purple Moon}}
As one of the earliest female game designers, Laurel is also one of the foremost theorists regarding developing videogames for girls. She posited that while the early videogame industry focused almost exclusively upon developing products aimed at young men, girls were not inherently disinterested in the medium. Rather, girls were simply interested in ''different kinds'' of gaming experiences. Her research uncovered that young women tended to prefer experiences based around complex social interaction, verbal skills, and [[Transmedia storytelling|transmedia]].&lt;ref name="girl games"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beato |first1=G. |title=Girl Games |journal=Wired |date=April 1997 |issue=5.04 |url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive//5.04/es_girlgames.html |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The game business arose from computer programs that were written by and for young men in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They worked so well that they formed a very lucrative industry fairly quickly. But what worked for that demographic absolutely did not work for most girls and women.|sign=Brenda Laurel|source=''Wired Magazine'' &lt;ref name="girl games" /&gt;}}

In 1996, Laurel founded Purple Moon,  the first American software company to cater games to young girls between the ages of 8 and 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cyberliteracy: navigating the Internet with awareness |last=Gurak |first=Laura J. |authorlink=Laura J.

The firm produced games designed around storytelling, open-ended exploration, and rehearsing realistic scenarios from one's day-to-day life, as opposed to competitive games featuring scores and timed segments.&lt;ref name="girl games" /&gt;&lt;ref name=kotaku&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hernandez |first1=Patricia |title=She Tried To Make Good Video Games For Girls, Whatever That Meant |url=http://kotaku.com/5913019/she-tried-to-make-good-video-games-for-girls-whatever-that-meant |website=Kotaku |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company produced ten games primarily divided into two series: "[[Purple Moon#Rockett series|Rockett]]", which focused around a young girl's quotidian interactions, and the more meditative "[[Purple Moon#Secret Paths series|Secret Path]]" series. It was eventually bought by [[Mattel]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Gurak, 2001, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katie Salen, Eric Zimmerman ''The Game Design Reader: A Rules of Play Anthology''  – 2006 0262195364 p352  "Secret Paths is what Brenda Laurel calls a "friendship adventure," allowing young girls to rehearse their coping skills and try alternative social strategies. The Play Town: Another Space for Girls? Harriet was trying to explain to Sport how to&lt;/ref&gt;

Purple Moon received criticism for focusing on designing games based on gender.&lt;ref name="kotaku" /&gt; The research was accused of reifying the differences between genders that girls were already socialized to accept, thus the focus on the stereotypically feminine values of cooperation, narrative, and socialization as opposed to the stereotypically masculine values embodied in most games as violence and competition.

==Virtual reality==

In Laurel's work regarding interface design, she is well known for her support of the theory of ''interactivity,'' the "degree to which users of a medium can influence the form or content of the mediated environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steuer |first=Jonathan |title=Defining virtual reality: Dimensions determining telepresence |journal=Journal of Communication |year=2006 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=73–93 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00812.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.33.5821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual reality, according to Laurel, is less characterized by its ''imaginary'' or ''unreal'' elements than by its ''multisensory'' representation of objects, be they real or imaginary.&lt;ref name=aperture&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sand |first1=Michael |title=Virtual Reality Check: An E-Mail Interview with Brenda Laurel |journal=Aperture |date=Summer 1994 |issue=136 |pages=70–72 |issn=0003-6420}}&lt;/ref&gt; While discussions around virtual reality tended to center on visual representations, audio and kinesthesia are two potent sources of sensory input that virtual reality devices attempt to tap into. Laurel's 1994 ''Placeholder'' installation at [[Banff Centre|Banff Center for the Arts]]—a collaboration with [[Rachel Strickland]]—explored these multisensory possibilities.&lt;ref name=placeholder&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laurel |first1=Brenda |title=Placeholder Virtual Reality Project |url=http://tauzero.com/Brenda_Laurel/Placeholder/Placeholder.html |website=TauZero |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation allowed multiple people to construct a narrative by attaching movement trackers to its subjects' bodies while letting them navigate a virtual environment by doing common physical acts with special results, such as flapping one's arms to fly.

A '''cleanroom''' or '''clean room''' is a facility ordinarily utilized as a part of specialized industrial production or scientific research, including the manufacture of pharmaceutical items and microprocessors. Cleanrooms are designed to maintain extremely low levels of particulates, such as dust, airborne organisms, or vaporized particles. Cleanrooms typically have an cleanliness level quanitified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a predetermined molecule measure. The ambient outdoor air in a typical urban area contains 35,000,000 particles for each cubic meter in the size range 0.5 μm and bigger in measurement, equivalent to an ISO 9 cleanroom, while by comparison an ISO 1 cleanroom permits no particles in that size range and just 12 particles for each cubic meter of 0.3 μm and smaller.

==History==
The modern cleanroom was invented by American [[physicist]] [[Willis Whitfield]].&lt;ref name=nkwes&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Yardley|title=Willis Whitfield, Clean Room Inventor, Dies at 92 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/business/willis-whitfield-clean-room-inventor-dies-at-92.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As employee of the [[Sandia National Laboratories]], Whitfield created the initial plans for the cleanroom in 1960.&lt;ref name=nkwes/&gt; Prior to Whitfield's invention, earlier cleanrooms often had problems with particles and unpredictable [[airflow]]s. Whitfield designed his cleanroom with a constant, highly filtered air flow to flush out impurities.&lt;ref name=nkwes/&gt; Within a few years of its invention in the 1960s, Whitfield's modern cleanroom had generated more than 50 billion USD in sales worldwide.&lt;ref name=kwes&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Sandia physicist, cleanroom inventor dies at 92 |url=http://www.kwes.com/story/20187574/sandia-physicist-cleanroom-inventor-dies-at-92 |work=[[KWES-TV|KWES]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/reinraum_printline_02_2015_Whitfield_110416.pdf|title=Willis Whitfield - Father of the Cleanroom|date=September 2015|publisher=Cleanroom online|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;!--Document specified as "02-2015", pathway as 2014-11, http date as 2016-04-19 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley were made by three companies: MicroAire, PureAire, and Key Plastics.  These competitors made laminar flow units, glove boxes, clean rooms and air showers, along with the chemical tanks and benches used in the 'Wet Process' building of integrated circuits.  These three companies were the pioneers of the use of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] for airguns, chemical pumps, scrubbers, water guns, and other devices needed for the production of [[integrated circuit]s. William (Bill) C. McElroy Jr. worked as engineering manager, drafting room supervisor, QA/QC, and designer for all three companies and his designs added 45 original patents to the technology of the time.  McElroy also wrote a four page article for MicroContamination Journal, wet processing training manuals, and equipment manuals for wet processing and clean rooms.&lt;ref&gt;William (Bill) C. McElroy Jr., MicroAire Engineering Manager and acting VP; Kay Plastics Engineering Manager; PureAire Drafting Room Manager&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Cleanrooms can be very large. Entire manufacturing facilities can be contained within a cleanroom with factory floors covering thousands of square meters. They are used extensively in [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor manufacturing]], [[biotechnology]], the [[life sciences]], and other fields that are very sensitive to environmental contamination. There are also modular cleanrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mecart-cleanrooms.com/what-is-a-cleanroom/ What is a modular cleanroom?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The air entering a cleanroom from outside is [[filter (air)|filter]]ed to exclude dust, and the air inside is constantly recirculated through high-efficiency particulate air ([[HEPA]]) and/or ultra-low particulate air ([[ULPA]]) filters to remove internally generated contaminants.

Staff enter and leave through [[airlock]]s (sometimes including an [[air shower (room)|air shower]] stage), and wear protective clothing such as hoods, face masks, gloves, boots, and coveralls.

Equipment inside the cleanroom is designed to generate minimal air contamination. Only special [[mop]]s and [[bucket]]s are used. Cleanroom furniture is designed to produce a minimum of particles and is easy to clean.

Common materials such as [[paper]], [[pencil]]s, and [[Textile|fabric]]s made from natural fibers are often excluded, and alternatives used. Cleanrooms are not [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] (i.e., free of uncontrolled microbes);&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/science/09clea.html?ref=science In NASA’s Sterile Areas, Plenty of Robust Bacteria] New York Times, 9. October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; only airborne particles are controlled. Particle levels are usually tested using a [[particle counter]] and microorganisms detected and counted through environmental monitoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T |title=Application of quality risk management to set viable environmental monitoring frequencies in biotechnology processing and support areas|journal=[[PDA (journal)|PDA J Pharm Sci Technol]] |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=560–79|date=November 2012 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2012.00891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandle, T 392–403"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T |title=A review of cleanroom microflora: types, trends, and patterns|journal=[[PDA (journal)|PDA J Pharm Sci Technol]] |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=392–403|date=November 2011 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2011.00765}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polymer]] tools used in cleanrooms must be carefully determined to be [[Chemical compatibility|chemically compatible]] with cleanroom processing fluids &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heikkinen|first=Ismo T.S.|last2=Kauppinen|first2=Christoffer|last3=Liu|first3=Zhengjun|last4=Asikainen|first4=Sanja M.|last5=Spoljaric|first5=Steven|last6=Seppälä|first6=Jukka V.|last7=Savin|first7=Hele|date=2018-10|title=Chemical compatibility of fused filament fabrication-based 3-D printed components with solutions commonly used in semiconductor wet processing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2018.07.015|journal=Additive Manufacturing|volume=23|pages=99–107|doi=10.1016/j.addma.2018.07.015|issn=2214-8604|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ensured to generate a low level of particle generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasanen|first=T.P.|last2=von Gastrow|first2=G.|last3=Heikkinen|first3=I.T.S.|last4=Vähänissi|first4=V.|last5=Savin|first5=H.|last6=Pearce|first6=J.M.|date=2019-01|title=Compatibility of 3-D printed devices in cleanroom environments for semiconductor processing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mssp.2018.08.027|journal=Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing|volume=89|pages=59–67|doi=10.1016/j.mssp.2018.08.027|issn=1369-8001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cleanrooms are kept at a [[positive pressure]] so if any leaks occur, air leaks out of the chamber instead of unfiltered air coming in.

Some cleanroom [[HVAC]] systems control the [[humidity]] to such low levels that extra equipment like [[Air_ioniser|air ionizers]] are required to prevent [[electrostatic discharge]] problems.

Low-level cleanrooms may only require special shoes, with completely smooth soles that do not track in dust or dirt. However, for safety reasons, shoe soles must not create slipping hazards. Access to a cleanroom is usually restricted to those wearing a [[cleanroom suit]].

In cleanrooms in which the standards of air contamination are less rigorous, the entrance to the cleanroom may not have an air shower. An anteroom (known as a "gray room") is used to put on clean-room clothing.

Some manufacturing facilities do not use fully classified cleanrooms, but use some practices or technologies typical of cleanrooms to meet their contamination requirements.

In [[Hospital]]s, [[Operating theater|Theatre]]s are similar to cleanroom for surgical patients' operation with [[Surgical incision|incisions]] to prevent any infections for the patient.

|[[File:Laminar Flow Reinraum.png|thumb|none|Air flow pattern for "[[Laminar Flow]] Cleanroom"]]
|}

Cleanrooms maintain particulate-free air through the use of either [[HEPA]] or [[ULPA]] filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacistspharmajournal.org/2010/02/clean-room-classification-aspects-of.html Limits for Microbial load for clean room as per US FDA and EU Guidelines for pharmaceutical products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/automation-electronics/Cleanroom-Air-Flow-Principles Cleanroom Air Flow Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personnel contamination of cleanrooms==
{| class="centered"
|- style="vertical-align:top"
|}
The greatest threat to cleanroom contamination comes from the users themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ansi.org/2015/07/cleanroom-and-controlled-environment/|title=Cleanroom and Controlled Environment Attire - ANSI Blog|date=2015-07-15|work=The ANSI Blog|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, control of microorganisms is important, especially microorganisms likely to be deposited into the air stream from skin shedding. Studying cleanroom microflora is of importance for microbiologists and quality control personnel to assess changes in trends. Shifts in the types of microflora may indicate deviations from the “norm” such as resistant strains or problems with cleaning practices.

In assessing cleanroom microorganisms, the typical flora are primarily those associated with human skin (Gram-positive cocci), although microorganisms from other sources such as the environment (Gram-positive rods) and water (Gram-negative rods) are also detected, although in lower number. Common bacterial genera include ''Micrococcus'', ''Staphylococcus'', ''Corynebacterium'', and ''Bacillus'', and fungal genera include ''Aspergillus'' and ''Pencillin''.&lt;ref name="Sandle, T 392–403"/&gt;

==Cleanroom classification and standardization==
Cleanrooms are classified according to the number and size of particles permitted per volume of air. Large numbers like "class 100" or "class 1000" refer to [[FED-STD-209E]], and denote the number of particles of size 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm or larger permitted per cubic foot of air. The standard also allows interpolation; for example [[SNOLAB]] is maintained as a class 2000 cleanroom.

A discrete, light-scattering airborne particle counter is used to determine the concentration of airborne particles, equal to and larger than the specified sizes, at designated sampling locations.

Small numbers refer to [[ISO 14644|ISO 14644-1]] standards, which specify the decimal [[logarithm]] of the number of particles 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm or larger permitted per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air. So, for example, an ISO class 5 cleanroom has at most 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; particles/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Both FS 209E and ISO 14644-1 assume log-log relationships between particle size and particle concentration. For that reason, zero particle concentration does not exist. Some classes do not require testing some particle sizes, because the concentration is too low or too high to be practical to test for, but such blanks should not be read as zero.

Because 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is about 35&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the two standards are mostly equivalent when measuring 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm particles, although the testing standards differ. Ordinary room air is around class 1,000,000 or ISO 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ee.byu.edu/cleanroom/particlecount.phtml Cleanroom Classification / Particle Count / FS209E / ISO TC209 /&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ISO 14644-1 and ISO 14698===
[[ISO 14644|ISO 14644-1]] and [[ISO 14698]] are [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] standards developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=53394|title=ISO 14644-1:2015 - Cleanrooms and associated controlled environments -- Part 1: Classification of air cleanliness by particle concentration|website=ISO|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former applies to clean rooms in general (see table below); the latter to cleanrooms where [[contamination|biocontamination]] may be an issue.

[[ISO 14644|ISO 14644-1]] defines the maximum concentration of particles per class and per particle size with the following formula&lt;ref name="Whyte2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Whyte|title=Cleanroom Technology: Fundamentals of Design, Testing and Operation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ufEtmr1sBgC|date=17 October 2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-86842-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{C}_\text{N} = 10^{\text{N}} \left(\frac{0.1}{\text{D}}\right)^{2.08}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\text{C}_\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum concentration of particles in a volume of 1m&lt;math&gt;^3&lt;/math&gt; of airborne particles that are equal to, or larger, than the considered particle size which is rounded to the nearest whole number, using no more than three significant figures, &lt;math&gt;\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the ISO class number, &lt;math&gt;\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the particle in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;m and 0.1 is a constant expressed in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;m. The result for standard particle sizes is expressed in the following table.

In [[Digital Video Broadcasting|digital video broadcasting]] (DVB), a '''data and object carousel''' is used for repeatedly delivering data in a continuous cycle. '''Carousels''' allow data to be pushed from a broadcaster to multiple [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]] by transmitting a data set repeatedly in a standard format. A set-top box receiver may tune to the data stream at any time and is able to reconstitute the data into a virtual file system. The carousel may therefore be considered as a transport file system or file broadcasting system that allows data files to be transmitted from the broadcaster to multiple receivers or clients simultaneously.

In a unidirectional broadcast environment, the receiver is unable to request the retransmission of any data that was missed or received incorrectly. Repeated retransmission of data allows the receiver to cope with random tuning to a channel at an unpredictable time, for instance as the user changes a channel.

The carousel cycle period generally determines the maximum time required for a receiver to acquire an application or specific datum. It is possible to reduce the access time for commonly used files by broadcasting some data more often than others.

An individual object carousel is also called a service domain in some documents. To be precise, a service domain is a group of related DSM-CC objects. In broadcast systems, there is no difference between an object carousel and a service domain except for the terminology: an object carousel is a service domain, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="interactivetvweb"&gt;[http://www.interactivetvweb.org/tutorials/dtv_intro/dsmcc/object_carousel TV without Borders], Object carousels and data carousels&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage and applications ==
Data and object carousels are most commonly used in [[digital video broadcasting|DVB]], which has standards for broadcasting digital television content using carousels. The standard format for a carousel is defined in the Digital Storage Media Command and Control ([[DSM CC|DSM-CC]]) toolkit in ISO/IEC 13818-6 and is part of the Digital Audio Video Council ([[DAVIC]]) DVB standard for digital video broadcasting. The specification provides support for a variety of communication models, including provision for interactive transport control of audio and video streams in a bi-directional environment such as a cable television video on demand system.

The DSM-CC standard specifies two types of carousel, a '''data carousel''' and an '''object carousel'''. The object carousel extends the more limited data carousel and specifies a standard format for representing a file system directory structure comprising a root directory or service gateway and one or more files and directories.

Files and directories are encapsulated in a DSM-CC object carousel in several layers. Objects are encapsulated in modules, which are carried within download data blocks, within DSM-CC sections encoded in MPEG private sections which are assembled from packets.

== Carousel management ==
Carousel complexity can increase dramatically based on various factors such as the content type or the content filling algorithm. Generally the content of a transmission carousel is dynamic, based on a multitude of variables, such as duration of the carousel transmission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=0nqAAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=7240286 |title=US Patent 7,240,286 |accessdate=2008-05-13 |author=Yamaguchi |date=2007-07-03|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is either determined by some type of algorithm or management utility.

Concepts such as embedded carousels are well-known and in use. This is when the main transmission carousel has a particular piece of content dynamically changing itself based on a sub-carousel content provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=5jqGAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=2003/0154203 |title=US Patent Application Publication 2003/0154203 |accessdate=2008-05-13 |author=Morris |date=2003-08-04|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3821">The '''design life''' of a component or product is the period of time during which the item is expected by its designers to work within its specified parameters; in other words, the life expectancy of the item.  It is the length of time between placement into service of a single item and that item's onset of wearout.

The design life of components and products differs from the items' [[mean time between failures]], (MTBF), in that MTBF is a measure of the rate of occurrence of random failures in time where these failures are not due to a wear-out mechanism.  For example, the mean time between failure of a device may be 100,000 hours and the design-life is 20,000 hours.  In this example, across the population of products, one failure will occur, on average, every 100,000 population operating hours. (100,000 units operating for 1 hour each = 100,000 population operating hours.)  None of these units will ever approach reaching 100,000 operating hours as each one will fail due to wear-out and be replaced by a new unit.  [[Aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]s, [[fan (machine)|fans]], and [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] are classic examples of components that will fail due to wear-out well before they could individually achieve the operating time indicated by their individual MTBF.

Another use of the term design life deals with consumer products.  Many products employ design life as one factor of their differentiation from competing products and components. A [[disposable camera]] is designed to withstand a short life, whilst an expensive [[single-lens reflex camera]] can be expected to have a design life measured in years or decades. (Clearly in this example there are other differentiators.)

==Long design lives==
Some products designed for heavy or demanding use are so well-made that they are retained and used well beyond their design life. Some [[public transport]] [[vehicles]] come into this category, as do a number of [[artificial satellites]] and [[spacecraft]]. In general, entry-level products&amp;mdash;those at the lowest end of the price range fulfilling a certain specification&amp;mdash;will tend to have shorter design lives than more expensive products fulfilling the same function, since there are savings to be made in using designs that are cheaper to implement, or, conversely, costs to be passed onto the customer in engineering to provide a safe margin leading to an increased working life. This [[economics|economic]] truism leads to the phenomenon of products designed (or appearing to be designed) to last only so long as their warranty period.

==Obsolescence==
Design life is related to but distinct from the concept of built-in obsolescence. The latter is the somewhat more nebulous notion that products are designed so as to become [[obsolete]]&amp;mdash;at least in the eyes of the user&amp;mdash;before the end of their design life. Two classic examples here are [[digital camera]]s, which become genuinely obsolete as a result of the very rapid rate of technological advances, although still in perfect working order; and non-digital [[cameras]], which are perceived as obsolete after a year or so as they are no longer "the latest design" although actually capable of years of useful service.

'''Diag Human''' is a [[Liechtenstein]]-incorporated [[blood plasma]] trading company, established by [[Swiss]]-[[Czechs|Czech]] entrepreneur Josef Šťáva (born 17 March 1950 in [[Prague]]) in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="folkman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Folkman|first1=Ted|title=Case of the day: Diag Human vs. Czech Ministry of Health|url=https://lettersblogatory.com/2014/08/19/case-day-diag-human-v-czech-ministry-health/|website=Letters Blogatory|date=19 August 2014|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated aim of the company was to help "currency-deficient Eastern Bloc states acquire modern blood plasma technology".&lt;ref name="folkman"/&gt;

== Lawsuit against the Czech government ==

The company received media attention in the 1996, when it filed a lawsuit against the [[Czech government]] in Prague Commercial Court, for defamation and unfair competition. The company claimed that the Health Minister had contacted [[Novo Nordisk]], a major business partner of Diag Human, to dissuade the company from doing business with them, which led to the failure of Diag Human's business in the country.&lt;ref name="folkman"/&gt; The two parties agreed to enter arbitration,&lt;ref name="folkman"/&gt; and the case became one of the largest cases of commercial litigation in the history of Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120321091048/http://www.praguetravelguide.info/article-280686-en.html An article from PragueTravelGuide.info.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2007/04/30/2565288.htm |title=Prague dissatisfied with firm assisting in Diag Human case-server |work=Czech News Agency |date=30 April 2007 |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the court found in favour of Diag Human, awarding around $650 million to the company.&lt;ref name="folkman"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4144">'''Direct borohydride fuel cells''' (DBFCs) are a subcategory of [[alkaline fuel cell]]s which are directly fed by [[sodium borohydride]] or [[potassium borohydride]] as a fuel and either air/oxygen&lt;ref&gt;Amendola S.C., Onnerud P., Kelly M., Petillo P., Sharp-Goldman S. L and Binder M. (1999) ‘A novel high power density borohydride-air cell’, J. Power Sources, 84, pp. 130–133.&lt;/ref&gt; or hydrogen peroxide&lt;ref&gt;Choudhury, N.A.; Raman, R.K.; Sampath, S.; Shukla, A.K. An alkaline direct borohydride fuel cell with hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. J. Power Sources 2005, 143, 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; as the oxidant. DBFCs are relatively new types of fuel cells which are currently in the developmental stage and are attractive due to their high operating potential in relation to other type of fuel cells.

==Chemistry==
Sodium borohydride could potentially be used in more conventional hydrogen [[fuel cell]] systems as a means of storing hydrogen. The hydrogen can be regenerated for a fuel cell by [[catalyst|catalytic]] [[chemical decomposition|decomposition]] of the borohydride:

:NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → NaBO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Direct borohydride fuel cells decompose and [[redox|oxidize]] the borohydride directly, side-stepping [[hydrogen production]] and even producing slightly higher energy yields:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222656844_A_comprehensive_review_of_direct_borohydride_fuel_cells Ma, Choudhury, Sahai - A comprehensive review of direct borohydride fuel cells]&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Cathode''': 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 8e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 8OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = +0.4[[volts|V]])
:'''Anode''': NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 8OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NaBO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 8e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = -1.24 V)
::'''Total E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''' = +1.64V

The simplified reaction is:

:NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NaBO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Electricity

The working temperature of a direct sodium borohydride fuel cell is 70&amp;nbsp;°C (158&amp;nbsp;°F).

==Advantages==
DBFCs could be produced more cheaply than a traditional fuel cell because they do not need expensive [[platinum]] catalysts. In addition, they have a higher [[power density]].

==Disadvantages==
Unfortunately, DBFCs do produce some hydrogen from a side reaction of NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with water heated by the fuel cell. This hydrogen can either be piped out to the exhaust or piped to a conventional hydrogen fuel cell. Either fuel cell will produce water, and the water can be recycled to allow for higher concentrations of NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

More importantly, the process of creating electricity via a DBFC is not easily reversible.  For example, after sodium borohydride (NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) has released its hydrogen and has been oxidized, the product is NaBO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[sodium metaborate]]). Sodium metaborate might be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] back into sodium borohydride fuel by several different techniques, some of which might theoretically require nothing more than water and [[electricity]] or heat.  However, these techniques are still in active development.  As of June 30, 2010, many patents claiming to effectively achieve the conversion of sodium metaborate to sodium borohydride have been investigated but none have been confirmed—the current efficiency of "boron hydride recycling" seems to be well below 1% which is unsuitable for recharging a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/984730-7DgquU/984730.pdf Final Report: Electrochemical Hydrogen Storage Systems, MacDonald 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
Sodium borohydride costs US$500 per kg, but with borax recycling and mass production projected prices for the fuel are as low as US$10/kg.
Sodium borohydride can already be purchased for as low as US$ 200 per kg from european eBay's sellers

'''Dynamic Roentgen stereophotogrammetry''' (also referred to as '''dynamic RSA''') is a modern and sophisticated x-ray recording method, used to measure real-time 3D motions of prostheses and bones during motion with high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horsager|first1=Kristian|last2=Kaptein|first2=Bart L|last3=RøMer|first3=Lone|last4=Jørgensen|first4=Peter B|last5=Stilling|first5=Maiken|title=Dynamic RSA for the evaluation of inducible micromotion of Oxford UKA during step-up and step-down motion|journal=Acta Orthopaedica|date=9 January 2017|pages=1–7|doi=10.1080/17453674.2016.1274592}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly used in orthopedic research settings and is an advancement of conventional RSA.

[[Roentgen stereophotogrammetry|Conventional static RSA]] is used to evaluate migration of prosthesis with respect to the bone in three dimensions as a function of time. Migration of the prosthesis are normal 12‐24 months after the surgery.  Ongoing migration increase the risk of aseptic loosening with revision surgery as a consequence. The method has proven valuable in the evaluation of fixation for hip and knee arthroplasty, as early RSA evaluations have shown high predictive value for later aseptic component loosening.

In contrast, Dynamic RSA makes it possible to accurately assess both micro movements in the fixation interface and kinematics of the prosthetic components in three dimensions, during active motions.

'''Electronic hardware''' consists of interconnected [[electronic component]]s which perform [[analog circuit|analog]] or [[Digital electronics|logic]] operations on received and locally stored information to produce as output or store resulting new information or to provide control for output actuator mechanisms.

Electronic hardware can range from individual [[Computer chips|chips]]/[[electrical network|circuits]] to distributed [[information processing]] systems. Well designed electronic hardware is composed of hierarchies of functional modules which inter-communicate via precisely defined interfaces.

'''Hardware logic''' is primarily a differentiation of the data processing circuitry from other more generalized circuitry. For example nearly all computers include a [[power supply]] which consists of circuitry not involved in data processing but rather powering the data processing circuits. Similarly, a computer may output information to a [[computer monitor]] or [[audio amplifier]] which is also not involved in the computational processes.

[[File:Europkarte bestückt 100mm × 160mm mit VG-Leiste (DIN 41612).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Board on a Eurocard PCB. A [[DIN 41612]] connector on right side]]
'''Eurocard''' is a European standard format for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) cards that can be plugged together into a standard chassis which, in turn, can be mounted in a [[19-inch rack]]. The chassis consists of a series of slotted card guides on the top and bottom, into which the cards are slid so they stand on end, like books on a shelf. At the spine of each card is one or more connectors which plug into mating connectors on a backplane that closes the rear of the chassis.

== Dimensions ==
As the cards are assumed to be installed in a vertical orientation, the usual meanings of height and width are transposed: A card might be 233.35&amp;nbsp;mm "high", but only 20&amp;nbsp;mm "wide".  Height is measured in [[rack unit]]s, "U", with 1 U being {{convert|1.75|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}.  This dimension refers to the subrack in which the card is to be mounted, rather than the card itself.  

Enclosure heights are multiples of 3U, with the cards always {{convert|33.35|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} shorter than the enclosure.  Two common heights are 3U (a 100&amp;nbsp;mm card in a {{convert|5.25|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} subrack) and 6U (a 233.35&amp;nbsp;mm card in a {{convert|10.5|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} high subrack).  As two 3U cards are shorter than a 6U card (by 33.35&amp;nbsp;mm), it is possible to install two 3U cards in one slot of a 6U subrack, with a mid-height structure for proper support. 

Card widths are specified in [[horizontal pitch]] units "HP", with 1 HP being {{convert|0.20|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}.

Card depths start at {{convert|100|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} and increase in {{convert|60|mm|in|3|adj=on|abbr=on}} increments. The most common today is {{convert|160|mm|in|3|adj=on|abbr=on}}, but standard hardware is available for depths of {{convert|100|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, {{convert|160|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, {{convert|220|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, {{convert|280|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|400|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}.

== Standards and architecture ==
The Eurocard mechanical architecture was defined originally under [[19-inch rack|IEC-60297-3]]. Today, the most widely recognized standards for this mechanical structure are [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] 1101.1, IEEE 1101.10 (also known commonly as "dot ten") and IEEE 1101.11. IEEE 1101.10 covers the additional mechanical and [[electromagnetic interference]] features required for [[VMEbus International Trade Association|VITA]] 1.1-1997(R2002), which is the VME64 Extensions standard, as well as [[PICMG]] 2.0 (R3.0), which is the [[CompactPCI]] specification.

The IEEE 1101.11 standard covers rear plug-in units that are also called [[rear transition module]]s or RTMs.

The Eurocard is a mechanical system and does not define the specific connector to be used or the signals that are assigned to connector contacts.

The connector systems that are commonly used with Eurocard architectures include the original [[DIN 41612]] connector that is also standardized as IEC 60603.2. This is the connector that is used for the [[VMEbus]] standard, which was IEEE 1014. The connector known as the 5-row DIN, which is used for the VME64 Extensions standard is IEC 61076-4-113. The VME64 Extension architecture defined by VITA 1.1-1997 (R2002).

Another popular computer architecture that utilizes the 6U-160 Eurocard is [[CompactPCI]] and [[CompactPCI Express]]. These are defined by PICMG 2.0R3 and PICMG Exp0 R1 respectively. Other computer architectures that utilize the Eurocard system are [[VME eXtensions for Instrumentation]] (VXI), [[PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation]] (PXI), and [[PXI Express]].

A computer architecture that used the 6U-220 Eurocard format was [[Multibus|Multibus-II]], which was IEEE 1296.

Because the Eurocard system provided for so many modular card sizes and because connector manufacturers have continued to create new connectors that are compatible with this system, it is a popular mechanical standard that is also used for innumerable "one-off" applications.

Conduction-cooled Eurocards are used in military and aerospace applications.  They are defined by the IEEE 1101.2-1992 (2001) standard.

The Eurocard standard is also the basis of the "[[Eurorack]]" format for [[modular synthesizer|modular electronic music synthesizers]], popularized by [[Doepfer]] and other manufacturers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2843">'''Eyelid glue''', commonly called {{nihongo|'''eye putti'''|アイプチ|ai puchi}},&lt;ref&gt;The spelling "Eye Putti" is a Japanese brand name&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[cosmetics|eye make-up]] used in [[East Asia]] designed to change the [[Epicanthic fold|monolid]] (eyelid without a crease). Eyelid glue is a water-soluble adhesive that can be easily removed.

==History==
Eyelid glue became available in Japan in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Miller|first=Laura|authorlink=|title=Beauty up: Exploring Contemporary Japanese Body Aesthetics|publisher=University of California Press|date=July 2006|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|pages=116|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=978-0-520-24508-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Double eyelids are considered a sign of feminine beauty in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;
|title= The Business of Race|url= http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2013/12/11/the-business-of-race/|location= Toronto|publisher= CBC Radio, Ideas|date= December 11, 2013|accessdate= 2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women opt for a temporary solution by wearing eyelid glue. The glue is painted on the upper eyelid, which is then pushed upward with a plastic prong and held in place by the adhesive. The glue needs to dry for a minute before holding the fold. This method creates or enhances a fold in the eyelid ("double eyelid") that opens up the eye exposing the eyelashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/health/feature/2000/02/16/asian_eyes|title=Asian Eyes|publisher=Salon.com|date=February 16, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of eyelid glue also exists amongst men.

The glue does not last and must be reapplied after a few hours. Eyelid glue may also cause irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2300-204_162-10004213-2.html?tag=page;next | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variant==
A variant called '''eyelid tape''' or '''crease tape''' comes in a fibrous elastic strip that is trimmed to shape and placed on the eyelid. The tape creates a crease that stays on the eyelid. The tape does not last and must be reapplied after a few hours.

'''Heritage Operations Processing System''', '''Heritage Ops''', or '''HOPS''', is a web-based tool for the day-to-day running and management of preserved and heritage railways. The system was developed, from a concept drawn up by Danny Scroggins and Luke Cartey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Operations Processing – System Updates|url=http://www.heritage-ops.org.uk/system_updates.php|work= Heritage Operations Processing website|publisher= Heritage Operations Processing|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding and development ==
The HOPS Project began early in August 2009 in the [[Schedule (workplace)|rostering]] office of the [[railway signalling|signalling]] department at the [[Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway]] – who embraced the use of the technology. [[Beta testing]] began in January 2010 with a small group of volunteers, the group being enlarged later that year. After this bedding-in period, the system was made more widely available to other UK heritage railways in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Operations Processing – History &amp; Growth History|url=http://www.heritage-ops.org.uk/about_history.php|work= Heritage Operations Processing website|publisher= Heritage Operations Processing|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the system is to provide administration tools associated with operating functions on heritage railways, such as staff rostering, timetabling and competence management, document control, etc. The system assists railways in meeting the requirements of government legislation such as the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006 (ROGS) which were introduced in Great Britain to put the 2004 European Railway Safety Directive into practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006 (as amended) – A Guide to ROGS: May 2013|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/rogs-guidance.pdf|work= Office of Rail Regulation website|publisher= Office of Rail Regulation|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system assists with competency management (as a requirement of the [[Safety management systems|Safety Management System]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RSSB – General SMS Guidance |url=http://www.rssb.co.uk/sms/Pages/generalsmsguidance.aspx |work=RSSB website |publisher=Rail Safety and Standards Board Ltd |accessdate=10 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222040741/http://www.rssb.co.uk/sms/Pages/generalsmsguidance.aspx |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RSSB – Competence Management |url=http://www.rssb.co.uk/sms/Pages/CompetenceManagement.aspx |work=RSSB website |publisher=Rail Safety and Standards Board Ltd |accessdate=10 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222040650/http://www.rssb.co.uk/sms/Pages/CompetenceManagement.aspx |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethos of the development of the system has been that in the majority of cases, producing large-scale data-handling and storage facilities, with the appropriate level of security, access, backups, etc., would not be economical for an individual railway. A single program, in use by many railway companies, however, would make the investment economical.

The system has grown significantly in the five years it has been in development, mainly in response to feedback from users and demands of the industry, and promises to continue to develop on the same lines in the future.

The first decorative [[fountain]] in the United States was dedicated in [[City Hall Park]], in [[New York City]], in 1842.  Early American fountains were used to distribute clean drinking water, had little ornamentation, and copied European styles.

In the 20th century, American fountains often ceased to distribute drinking water; they became purely decorative, and were designed to honor events or individuals, as works of urban sculpture or to imitate nature.  In the late 20th century, the [[musical fountain]], where the dance of water is controlled by a computer and is accompanied by lights and music, became a form of public entertainment in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and other American cities.

Philadelphia built the first citywide water system in the United States, which began operation in January 1801. Underground aqueducts carried drinking water from the [[Schuylkill River]], and twin steam pumps propelled it into a water tower at Centre Square, now the site of [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. Scottish-born architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]] designed the system along with the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] pumping house/water tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schillerinstitute.org/educ/hist/eiw_this_week/v4n3_jan20_1801.html "Benjamin Latrobe Designs the first American Steam-Powered Municipal Waterworks,"] from ''This Week in History'', January 2012, The Schiller Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Centre Square was converted from a meadow into a public park, and an ornamental fountain was added, 1808&amp;ndash;1809. Sculptor [[William Rush]] carved a wooden statue, ''Allegory of the Schuylkill River'' (better known as ''Water Nymph with Bittern''), to adorn the Centre Square fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafa.org/museum/The-Collection-Greenfield-American-Art-Resource/Tour-the-Collection/Category/Collection-Detail/985/coltype--Sculpture/mkey--8434/sort57--3_3a30-/ ''Head of the Nymph''], from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first monumental fountains in the United States were built to mark the termini of aqueducts bringing fresh drinking water into New York City. A [[cholera]] epidemic in 1832 and the disastrous [[Great Fire of New York]], in 1835, persuaded the government of New York City to build the [[Croton aqueduct]] to bring abundant fresh water into the city.  The [[Croton Dam]], aqueduct, and reservoir were finished in 1841,  bringing water 40 miles from the [[Croton River]] to New York City.  In commemoration, the first fountain in the U.S., the ''Croton Fountain'' in [[City Hall Park]], was turned on on October 14, 1842 and jetted water 50 feet into the air.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Burns and James Sanders, ''New York, an Illustrated History'', Alfred Knopf, New York, 1999, pg. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second fountain in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] was also connected to the system.

The first fountains were very simple, without sculpture, and simply spouted water up into the air.  They no longer exist, though vestiges of the original water system remain.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Symmes with Maria Ann Conelli, "Fountains as Refreshment", in the collection ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present''. Thames and Hudson, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Boston completed its own new water system, an aqueduct from [[Lake Cochituate]] 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) to the [[Boston Common]], where the first fountain was located. A parade and festival were held to mark the fountain's opening on October 25, 1848.  The ceremony included schoolchildren singing an ode written by American poet [[James Russell Lowell]] for the event.  The ode began:

"My name is Water: I have sped
through strange dark ways untried before,
By pure desire of friendship led,
Cochituate's Ambassador:
He sends four gifts by me,
Long life, health, peace, and purity."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Marilynn Symmes and Maria Ann Conelli in ''Fountains, Splash and Spectacle''. Pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the first American fountains, which were simple and functional, in the 1850s, more decorative fountains were constructed as part of a nationwide effort to beautify American cities by building parks, squares, and fountains inspired by European models. 
[[File:Bethesda Fountain, Central Park.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Bethesda Fountain]]'' in [[Central Park]], New York (1873)]]
For example, the ''[[Bethesda Fountain]]'' was created to adorn New York City's new [[Central Park]], which project had been begun in 1858 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]], to create a vast [[natural landscape]] in the heart of the city.  In the middle of the park was one formal element: a mall adorned with elm trees and a terrace with views over a lake.  In 1863, the park commissioners decided to build a monumental fountain for the central basin in the middle of the mall.  The sculptor was a little-known American artist, [[Emma Stebbins]], whose brother was the head of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and President of the Board of Commissioners, who lobbied on her behalf.  Her fountain was based on the biblical verse from the [[Gospel of Saint John]], in which an angel touched, or "troubled", the waters of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in [[Jerusalem]], giving it healing powers.  She wrote about the fountain:  "We have no less healing, comfort and purification freely sent to us through the blessed gift of pure, wholesome water, which to all the countless homes of this great city comes like an angel visitant."&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein, 'American Women Sculptors: A History of Women Working in Three Dimensions'', Chicago, 1990, pg. 63-66. Cited in "The Bethesda Fountain in New York City", article by Andrew Scott Dolkart in ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present'', by Marilynn Symmes.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was criticized by some writers when it was opened in 1873: the ''New York Times'' called it "a feebly-pretty idealess thing",&lt;ref&gt;"The Bethesda Fountain", ''The New York Times'', June 1, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; but gradually the fountain became a popular favorite, featured in many films and in recent times in [[Tony Kushner]]'s play ''[[Angels in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Kushner - ''Angels in America part two'', Perestroika, New York, 1994, pp. 143-146.  Cited by Andrew Scott Dolkart in ''Fountains - Splash and Spectacle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1900-2000 ==
Fountains built in the United States between 1900 and 1950 mostly followed European models and classical styles.  For example:
*The handsome ''[[Samuel Francis Dupont Memorial Fountain]]'' (aka ''Dupont Circle Fountain''), in [[Dupont Circle]], [[Washington D.C.]], was designed and created by [[Henry Bacon]] and [[Daniel Chester French]], the architect and sculptor of the [[Lincoln Memorial]],  in 1921, in a pure [[Neoclassical sculpture|neoclassical]] style.
*The ''[[Buckingham Fountain]]'' in Grant Park, Chicago was one of the first American fountains to use powerful modern pumps to shoot water as high as 150 feet (46 meters) into the air.
*The ''Fountain of Prometheus,'' with sculpture by [[Paul Manship]], built at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] in 1933, was the first American fountain in the [[Art-Deco]] style.

After World War II, fountains in the United States became more varied in form.  Some, like the [[Vaillancourt Fountain]] in [[San Francisco]] (1971), were pure works of sculpture. The modernist French-Canadian [[Armand Vaillancourt]] built his monumental fountain at Embarcadero Plaza in San Francisco in a [[cubist]] style, though it was intended as a political statement - the official title is "Quebec Libre!", and the artist was arrested at the time of the opening for painting political slogans on his own fountain.

Other fountains, like the ''Frankin Roosevelt Memorial Waterfall'' (1997), by architect [[Lawrence Halprin]], were designed as landscapes to illustrate themes.  This fountain is part of the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]], which has four outdoor "rooms" illustrating FDR's Presidency.  Each "room" contains a cascade or waterfall;  the cascade in the third room illustrates the turbulence of the years of the World War II.  Halprin wrote at an early stage of the design; "the whole environment of the memorial becomes sculpture: to touch, feel, hear and contact - with all the senses."&lt;ref&gt;Halprin, Lawrence, Notebooks 1959-1971, Cambridge Massachusetts (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most unusual modern American fountains is the [[Civil Rights Memorial]] (1989) at the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], designed by [[Maya Lin]], the designer of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington D.C.  The ''Civil Rights Memorial'' fountain features a low elliptical black granite table, with a thin surface of water flowing over the surface, over the inscribed names of civil rights leaders who lost their lives, illustrating the quotation from [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]:  "...Until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream."  Visitors are invited to touch the names through the water. "The water is as slow as I could get it," Lin wrote. "It remains very still until you touch it. Your hand carves ripples, which transform and alter the piece, just as reading the words completes the piece."&lt;ref&gt;Zinnser, William, "I Realized Her Tears Were Becoming Part of The Memorial (Maya Lin), ''Smithsonian'' 22, no. 6. September 1991 pp. 32-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RAMfirst.svg|frame|200px|right|RAMfirst Interactive Paging&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The '''Inter@ctive Pager''', introduced in 1996 by [[Research In Motion]] (RIM), allowed users to receive and send messages over the internet via a [[wireless]] data network known as [[Mobitex]].  The US Operator of Mobitex, [[RAM Mobile Data]] operated the network and introduced the Inter@ctive Pager service as RAMfirst Interactive Paging&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;. The product was named the 1997 Top Product by Wireless for the Corporate User Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101543/http://www.rim.net/news/press/1998/pr-07_01_1998.shtml Research In Motion Increases Contract With RAM Mobile Data To $90 Million] Research In Motion, January 7, 1998, archived from [http://www.rim.net/news/press/1998/pr-07_01_1998.shtml the original] on 28 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter@ctive Pager was also known as the [[RIM-900]].

In August 1998, BellSouth Wireless Data replaced the RIM-900 with the '''RIM 950''' and marketed the service as BellSouth Interactive Paging(sm).

The Interactive Paging service introduced wireless users to such features as [[peer-to-peer]] Delivery and Read Receipts and sending [[fax]]es and [[text to speech]] messages to a telephone.  It also incorporated all the features of a traditional one way paging system ([[Interactive voice response]], [[Telocator Alphanumeric input Protocol]], etc..) and added two way extensions to those services.  The devices communicated to the internet, peer users, and the [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] via a Gateway which also served as the store and forward mailbox for the wireless user.  Interactive Paging became known as Interactive Messaging Plus(sm) when [[BellSouth]] and [[SBC Communications|SBC]] formed [[Cingular Wireless]].

RIM also produced a proprietary file format called [[Interactive Pager Backup|IPD]], or Inter@ctive Pager Database.

'''Johnson's Baby''' is an American brand of baby [[cosmetics]] and skin care products owned by [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]. The brand dates back to 1893 when Johnson's Baby Powder was introduced. Product line consists of [[baby powder]], [[shampoo]]s, body [[lotion]]s, massage oil, shower gels and [[Wet wipe#Baby wipes|baby wipes]]. The brand has reputation for making baby products that are "exceptionally pure and safe" since at least the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/08/magazine/beauty-the-boom-in-no-frills-cosmetics.html |title = Beauty; THE BOOM IN NO-FRILLS COSMETICS |date = February 8, 1981 |publisher = The New York Times |accessdate = August 5, 2014 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6Rbr21OJ0?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/08/magazine/beauty-the-boom-in-no-frills-cosmetics.html |archivedate = August 5, 2014 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Johnson's Baby Powder and sanitary napkins (1893) ===

[[File:Johnsons Baby Powder 1,5 OZS talc, pic5.JPG|thumb|right|Johnson's Baby Powder (20th century)]]

[[File:Johnsons Baby Powder massage.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson's Baby Powder (2014)]]

Johnson's Baby Powder was an invention of Dr. [[Frederick Barnett Kilmer|Frederick B. Kilmer]], company's first director of scientific affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Turner |first = Tyya |date = 2007 |title = Vault Guide to the Top Consumer Products Employers |url = https://books.google.com/?id=aT59Q0J1QV0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vault+Guide+to+the+Top+Consumer+Products+Employers#v=onepage&amp;q=kilmer&amp;f=false |publisher = Vault |page = 185 |isbn = 978-1-58131-323-9 |accessdate = August 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 he got a letter from a physician noting that patient suffered skin irritations after using medicated plasters. Kilmer suggested to use scented Italian [[talc]]um powder to mitigate the irritation and sent a can to the doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Oppenheimer |first = Jerry |date = 2013 |title = Crazy Rich: Power, Scandal and Tragedy Inside the Johnson and Johnson Dynasty |url = https://books.google.com/?id=17q2qiDwhyQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jerry+oppenheimer#v=onepage&amp;q=kilmer&amp;f=false |publisher = St. Martin's Press |page = 46 |isbn = 978-0-312-66211-0 |accessdate = August 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baby Powder debuted in 1893 and went to the market in 1894.&lt;ref name="kilmerhouse"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kilmerhouse.com/2007/04/the-birth-of-our-baby-products/ |title = The Birth of Our Baby Products |author = Margaret Gurowitz |date = April 30, 2007 |publisher = Kilmerhouse.com |accessdate = August 3, 2014 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6RXvDOkzp?url=http://www.kilmerhouse.com/2007/04/the-birth-of-our-baby-products/ |archivedate = August 3, 2014 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Baby Powder was in a yellow and red tin with a label "For Toilet and Nursery”.&lt;ref name="kilmerhouse" /&gt;

According to Robert Shook, sanitary napkins were included in the young mother's kit but never considered a separate product until customers asked the company for it.
{{quote|quote=In 1893 the talc was packaged in a box that was originally distributed to midwives and given to mothers following childbirth. The mothers liked it so much, the company started to sell it in drugstores. Also in the midwife's box were twelve sanitary napkins. Prior to this, there was no such product available to purchase. After the company received hundreds of letter from women wanting to know where they could buy these products, the company started to manufacture them – the first company to make sanitary napkins in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Shook |first = Robert L. |date = 2007 |title = Miracle Medicines: Seven Lifesaving Drugs and the People Who Created Them |url = https://books.google.com/?id=3f7rnSnP7LUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Miracle+Medicines:+Seven+Lifesaving+Drugs+and+the+People+Who+Created+Them#v=onepage&amp;q=Baby%20Powder&amp;f=false |publisher = Penguin Group |isbn = 978-1-4406-9607-7 |accessdate = August 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first baby to appear on Johnson's Baby powder label was [[Mary Lea Johnson Richards]], granddaughter of [[Robert Wood Johnson I]] (co-founder of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]).&lt;ref name=NYMag&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=peMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = Crazier Than You and Me |author = Rhoda Koenig |date = February 23, 1987 |publisher = [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |accessdate = November 25, 2014 }} (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/nyregion/about-books.html?scp=3&amp;sq=mary%20lea%20johnson&amp;st=cse |title=About books |author=Shirley Horner |date=February 15, 1987 |publisher=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6UKj5BiTc?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/nyregion/about-books.html?scp=3 |archivedate=November 24, 2014 |accessdate=November 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's Baby Powder has a particular scent that for many Americans is associated with the smell of the baby itself. According to Johnson &amp; Johnson's representative Fred Tewell (cited by [[Toronto Star]]), baby powder-scented cleaning products became almost a standard not only to cosmetics, but to diapers as well. And all Johnson's Baby products have a "powdery" note in them.&lt;ref name="tstar"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.thestar.com/life/2008/04/18/smelling_like_a_baby.html |title = Smelling like a baby: now at the grownup fragrance counter – the scent of a baby |author = Samantha Critchell |date = April 18, 2008 |publisher = [[Toronto Star]] |accessdate = August 6, 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140806191519/http://www.thestar.com/life/2008/04/18/smelling_like_a_baby.html |archivedate = August 6, 2014 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Johnson's Baby Cream (1921) ===

Johnson's Baby cream was introduced in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Meyer |first = Thomas A. |date = 2010 |title = Innovate!: How Great Companies Get Started in Terrible Times |url = https://books.google.com/?id=2CWkH2peM6MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Innovate!:+How+Great+Companies+Get+Started+in+Terrible+Times#v=onepage&amp;q=baby%20cream&amp;f=false |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons |page = 74 |isbn = 978-0-470-56058-7 |accessdate = August 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gift Box (1921) ===

According to Margaret Gurowitz, Johnson &amp; Johnson's corporate historian, in 1921 the company released its first "Baby Gift Box" that contained small packages of Baby Powder, Baby Cream and Baby Soap and "was designed as a small gift that people could take when visiting a family with a new baby".&lt;ref name="kilmerhouse" /&gt;

[[File:Johnsons Baby Empty.jpg|thumb|right|Baby reaching for the empty bottle of "No More Tears" shampoo while bathing]]

"No More Tears" shampoo was introduced in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ideas.time.com/2012/08/22/the-real-lesson-of-formaldehyde-in-baby-shampoo/ |title = The Real Lesson of Formaldehyde In Baby Shampoo |author = Dominique Browning |date = August 22, 2012 |publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate = August 3, 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140803085226/http://ideas.time.com/2012/08/22/the-real-lesson-of-formaldehyde-in-baby-shampoo/ |archivedate = August 3, 2014 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Nunes and Johnson:

{{quote|quote=In 1953 Johnson &amp; Johnson introduced its No More Tears baby shampoo. Targeting this particular use involved a real soap breakthrough, however, with the company introducing [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]] cleansing agents to consumer use. Though these agents are not as effective as traditional soaps, they are extremely mild, which makes them quite literally ''easy on the eyes'' and perfect for a baby's sensitive but presumably not-too-dirty skin. Designing this new category of cleaners for this user segment enabled Johnson &amp; Johnson to capture a category it still dominates today, more than fifty years later. Within six months of its introduction, Johnson &amp; Johnson had captured 75 percent of the baby shampoo market, a share it held as recently as 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Nunes |first1 = Paul |last2 = Johnson |first2 = Brian |date = 2004 |title = Mass Affluence: Seven New Rules of Marketing to Today's Consumer |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LLmU8dWCem4C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher = Harvard Business Review Press |page = 95 |isbn = 978-1-59139-196-8 |accessdate = August 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955 [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] placed advertising at the "[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|Adventures of Robin Hood]] TV series for [[Band-Aid]] and Johnson's baby shampoo. The later was advertised with the tagline "Johnson's can't burn eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year = 1955 |title = Adventures of Robin Hood (1955–59) Complete Open (J&amp;J) |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyCFHm5LnDA |access-date = June 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"No More Tears" has been registered as a trademark only since 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://trademarks.justia.com/722/01/no-more-tears-72201033.html |title = NO MORE TEARS – Trademark Details |publisher = Justia.com |accessdate = August 8, 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140807204305/http://trademarks.justia.com/722/01/no-more-tears-72201033.html |archivedate=August 7, 2014 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the brand launched the "So much more" campaign focused on multi-sensory experiences (such as a massage during bathing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/johnson-baby-wash-commercial-star-monterey-stealing-hearts-around-world/ |title = Meet the adorable new face of Johnson's Baby Wash |date = September 7, 2015 |publisher = [[CBS News]] |accessdate = October 4, 2015 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151004205505/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/johnson-baby-wash-commercial-star-monterey-stealing-hearts-around-world/ |archivedate = October 4, 2015 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;) highlighting the benefits of such experiences for baby's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/04/jjs-baby-unit-launches-new-campaign-to-show-baths-are-so-much-more/ |title = J&amp;J’s Baby Unit Launches New Campaign to Show Baths are ‘So Much More’ |author = Nathalie Tadena |date = February 4, 2015 |publisher = The Wall Street Journal |accessdate = June 28, 2015 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6Zcb66PBT?url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/04/jjs-baby-unit-launches-new-campaign-to-show-baths-are-so-much-more/ |archivedate = June 28, 2015 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing baby products to adults ==

The company has been using "Best for the Baby – Best for You" tagline since the early days. Some examples of such advertising can be spotted as early as 1913, when only Johnson's Baby Powder existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2SkuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=29QFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4810%2C820658 |title = The Red Cross Pharmacy |date = January 13, 1913 |publisher = [[The Miami News]] |quote = Johnson's Toilet and Baby Powder. Best for Baby and Best for You. The Purest Toilet Powder that it is possiblt to manufacture" |accessdate = August 8, 2014 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime in the beginning of 70s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D_wjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=62YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6866%2C3789354 |title = Us Births Decline, Baby Businesses Grow |date = September 9, 1974 |publisher = [[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |quote = The company has produced heavy family-oriented advertising for the past few years" |accessdate = August 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson started marketing baby products to families, promoting so-called "family usage".

The strategy has been a success. By the 80s Johnson's Baby grew market share in the adult market due to the perception that "baby products are milder than others".&lt;ref name="nybaby"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/19/magazine/babying-grown-ups.html |title = Babying grown-ups |author = Deborah Blumenthal |date = May 19, 1985 |publisher = The New York Times |accessdate = August 5, 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140805213809/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/19/magazine/babying-grown-ups.html |archivedate = August 5, 2014 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, for instance, 70 percent of Johnson's Baby powder in the United States was used by adults.&lt;ref name="nybaby" /&gt;

== Non-baby usage ==

Johnson's Baby products are widely used for non-baby occasions. For example, Johnson's [[Baby Oil]] is used as a facial [[cleanser]] (it has been reported by the "[[New York (magazine)|New York]]" magazine that popular TV talk show host [[Martha Stewart]] uses it this way&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/01/martha-stewarts-2000-beauty-regimen.html |title = Martha Stewart’s $2,000 Beauty Regimen |author = Kathleen Hou |date = January 9, 2014 |publisher = [[New York (magazine)|The Cut]] |accessdate = August 8, 2014 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6RgAJCZtR?url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/01/martha-stewarts-2000-beauty-regimen.html |archivedate = August 8, 2014 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;), by male [[stripper]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/thecut/2012/06/men-of-hunk-o-mania-on-grooming-routines.html |title = The Male Exotic Dancers of Hunk-A-Mania on Their Grooming Routines |author = Christina Han |date = June 28, 2012 |publisher = [[New York (magazine)|The Cut]] |accessdate = August 8, 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808175518/http://nymag.com/thecut/2012/06/men-of-hunk-o-mania-on-grooming-routines.html |archivedate = August 8, 2014 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[lubricant]] in some sexual practices.

== Health risk issues ==

In December 1985 two physicians urged parents not to use baby powder, stating that it was unsafe to inhale and Johnson &amp; Johnson responded with an official statement that "product is safe when used as it is intended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/27/us/2-physicians-assert-baby-powder-can-endanger-infants-breathing.html |title = 2 physicians assert baby powder can endanger infants' breathing |date = December 27, 1985 |publisher = The New York Times |accessdate = August 5, 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140805214512/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/27/us/2-physicians-assert-baby-powder-can-endanger-infants-breathing.html |archivedate = August 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, J&amp;J was ordered to pay $72 million in damages to the family of Jackie Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015. She had used Johnson's Baby Powder for many years. J&amp;J claimed that the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence and it plans to appeal the verdict. The British charity, Ovacome was quoted as saying that while there were 16 studies which showed that using talc increased the risk of ovarian cancer by around a third, and a 2013 review of US studies had similar results for genital, but not general, talcum powder use they were not convinced that the results were reliable. Furthermore, they said, "Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk."

== Clinical studies ==

In 2007 [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] sponsored "1st European Round Table meeting on 'Best Practice for Infant Cleansing" (a panel of expert dermatologists and paediatricians from across Europe) focused on the use of '''liquid cleansers''' in bathing as opposed to washing with water. It has been concluded that "bathing is generally superior to washing, provided basic safety procedures are followed, and has psychological benefits for the infant and parents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Blume-Peytavi |first1 = U |last2 = Cork |first2 = MJ |last3 = Faergemann |first3 = J |last4 = Szczapa |first4 = J |last5 = Vanaclocha |first5 = F |last6 = Gelmetti |first6 = C |title = Bathing and cleansing in newborns from day 1 to first year of life: recommendations from a European round table meeting |journal = Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology |volume = 23 |issue = 7 |pages = 751–759 |date = June 3, 2009 |url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-3083.2009.03140.x/abstract |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2009.03140.x |pmid = 19646134 |accessdate = June 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A randomized clinical trial, sponsored by Johnson's baby brand in 2010 studied the effectiveness of using moisturizer as part of a standardized skin care regimen, for improving moisture levels in baby skin. Research showed that using '''baby lotion''' is effective for maintaining favorable moisture levels in baby skin (in comparison to not using baby lotion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Garcia Bartels |first1 = N |last2 = Scheufele |first2 = R |last3 = Prosch |first3 = F |last4 = Schink |first4 = T |last5 = Proquitté |first5 = H |last6 = Wauer |first6 = PR |last7 = Blume-Peytavi |first7 = U |title = Effect of standardized skin care regimens on neonatal skin barrier function in different body areas |journal = Pediatric Dermatology |volume = 27 |issue = 1 |pages = 1–8 |date = February 23, 2010 |doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1470.2009.01068.x |pmid = 20199402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013 [[Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, &amp; Neonatal Nursing]] published a research by academics at [[University of Manchester|The University of Manchester]] that showed that washing newborn babies with Johnson’s Baby '''Top-to-Toe wash''' is just as safe as using water alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 3664406 |title = Randomized, Controlled Trial Evaluating a Baby Wash Product on Skin Barrier Function in Healthy, Term Neonates |author = Tina Lavender |date = February 19, 2013 |website = ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ |publisher = [[Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, &amp; Neonatal Nursing]] |pages = 203–14|doi = 10.1111/1552-6909.12015|pmid = 23421327|display-authors = etal |volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been sponsored by Johnson &amp; Johnson "but carried out under strict, independent scientific protocols, including blind testing and peer review".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=9546 |title=Baby wash does not damage baby’s skin barrier function, study finds |date=February 19, 2013 |website=manchester.ac.uk/ |publisher=[[University of Manchester]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6S2sHPnh5?url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=9546 |archive-date=August 23, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[AK-47]] type rifles can mount a [[Rifle grenade#Cup-type|cup-type grenade-launcher]] that fires standard [[RGD-5]] Soviet hand-grenades. The soup-can shaped launcher is screwed onto the AK-47’s [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ar15.com/content/webPDF/AK47USArmyOperatorManual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/AK-47_Operator%27s_Manual&lt;/ref&gt; To fire, first insert a standard RGD-5 hand-grenade into the launcher and then remove the safety pin. Second, insert a special [[blank cartridge]] into the rifle's chamber. Third, place the butt-stock of the rifle on the ground and fire from this position.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ar15.com/content/webPDF/AK47USArmyOperatorManual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum effective range is approximately 150 meters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ar15.com/content/webPDF/AK47USArmyOperatorManual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This cup-type launcher can also be used to launch [[tear-gas]] and [[riot control]] grenades.

'''LaborNet''' is a [[San Francisco]]-based "democratic communications" network for the [[labour movement]]. It was founded in 1991.

According to  LaborNet's website, its "''founders believe that the new communication technology must be put to use to revitalize and rebuild the labor movement. To that end we established the first regular Labor News web page in the United States.''" [http://www.labornet.org/about.htm]

Currently, the initiative has been expanded, with "LaborNets" being also set up in other places like [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. LaborNet says it also works to defend the [[internet]] from [[censorship]] and the [[privatization]] of [[information]] "''that would limit and destroy our rights to communicate and build world unionism.''"

This is a '''list of on-air resignations'''. These are [[resignation]]s in the public eye.

==On radio==
*[[William (Rosko) Mercer]] – known to his fans simply as Rosko, resigned on-air twice: first from [[WOR-FM]] in October 1967 over the station's employment of radio consultants; and then again in 1985, when he left [[WKTU-FM]] while on the air, again over a dispute with the station management.

'''MetaSolv Solution''' (''also known as MetaSolv or MSS'') is an [[Operations Support System]] [[database application]] originally created by MetaSolv Software, Inc. for use by the telcommunications industry. The company was acquired by [[Oracle Corporation]], and Oracle still supports the application today under the umbrella of [[Oracle Corporation#Corporate structures|Oracle Communications]]. The software is used by many telecom companies (not just [[Telephone company|telephone]], but [[Internet service provider|ISPs]], [[List of cable television companies|cable companies]], and more).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://community.oracle.com/groups/metasolv-sig |title=MetaSolv User Group |website=Community.Oracle.com |publisher=Oracle |access-date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
When MetaSolv was originally developed in the early [[1990s]], the new application was first referred to as '''ASAP''' (''Access Services and Provisioning''). ASAP provided a method for tracking [[Inventory|equipment inventory]], port consumption and circuit designs for engineering departments within telecom companies. But, by 1997, the need for tracking [[Work order|customer service orders]] was identified, and the system enhanced to provide for it. Along with order tracking, the need for [[Workflow|workflow]] management was also addressed.

By the late 1990s, the application was rebranded by the company as '''TBS''' (''Telecom Business Solution'') from version 3.10 through version 4.11, until the introduction of the 5.0 version. At that time (''about 2003''), MetaSolv Inc again rebranded the application, this time to '''MetaSolv Solution''', also known as M/5. The latest release is often simply referred to simply as '''M6'''.

MetaSolv Inc had several other products besides M6, and made efforts to provide seamless [[System integration|integration]] and connectivity between MetaSolv and those products in various ways. After Oracle acquired MetaSolv Inc (see below), Oracle absorbed all of MetaSolv Inc's products and continued the trend of integrating them. Even without those integrations, MetaSolv is a stand-alone OSS application that supports service provisioning through the entire life-cycle of customer and network development.

== Oracle Acquisition ==
MetaSolv Software Inc. (''Nasdaq: MSLV'') was privately founded in 1992 soon becoming a leading provider of service fulfillment solutions designed to meet the needs of telecommunications providers. MetaSolv Inc became a publicly traded company offering an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/metasolv-inc-10266-2893 |title= NASDAQ - MetaSolv Inc (MSLV) IPO |date= |website= NASDAQ |publisher= |access-date= July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MetaSolv (''the company'') was acquired by Oracle in 2006 for $219 million. On December 15, 2006, a majority of MetaSolv stockholders approved Oracle's acquisition of MetaSolv Software Inc..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/MetaSolv |title= Oracle FAQs - MetaSolv |date= December 2008 |last= Naude |first= Frank |website= OraFAQ |publisher= |access-date= July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle continues to offer and maintain the application today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/metasolv/support.html |title= Oracle Acquisitions - Support for MetaSolv Products |date= |website= Oracle |publisher= |access-date= July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
=== General Capabilities ===
MetaSolv Solution (''the software'') is an [[Oracle Database]] application sometimes described as "''Telco in a Box''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.oracle.com/industries/communications/service-providers/products/metasolv-solution/index.html |title= Oracle Communications MetaSolv Solution |date= |website= Oracle |publisher= |access-date= July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system provides for many business processes common among all types of telecommunications businesses including:

* Ordering (Regulated and Unregulated)
* [[Workflow Management]]
* [[Inventory Management]]
* [[Telecommunications engineering|Network Engineering]]
* Network Infrastructure Management 
* [[Service Provisioning]]
* Trouble Management

Typical implementation of MetaSolv within any telecom company often include users from Customer Care, Service Ordering, Engineering, Switching, Central Office and Field Technician departments.

=== Industry Standards ===
Early in the development of the application, MetaSolv Inc realized the need to implement common industry standard practices such as those provided today by '''iConectiv''' (''previously known as [[Telcordia Technologies]], but rebranded after [[Ericsson]] acquired them''). These standards included such things as standard equipment identifiers, [[Circuit ID|circuit identification]], location identification (''commonly called [[CLLI code]]''), connection codes (''also known as Network Channel codes''), rate codes, and much more. Across the industry, such standards are typically provided by iConectiv in the form of [[Common Language Information Services]]. By adding these standards to MetaSolv, the application more properly fit into the telecom OSS industry.

Later however, companies expressed an interest in varying from industry standards. Releases after version 6.0 (6.1, 6.2, etc) included the ability to do so in some areas.

=== Interfacing and Reporting ===
Today, MetaSolv is often interfaced with other telecom company [[OSS/BSS]] systems through [[Application programming interface|APIs]] and other means. Since the software is a front-end [[database application]] with an Oracle database behind it, multiple off-the-shelf [[SQL]]-based reporting tools are used to support [[business intelligence]] needs in several departments.

'''Military communications''' or '''military signals''' involve all aspects of [[communication]]s, or conveyance of [[information]], by [[armed forces]]. Military communications span from pre-history to the present. The earliest military communications were delivered by [[Runner (soldier)|runners]]. Later, communications progressed to visual and audible signals, and then advanced into the electronic age. Examples from ''[[Jane's Military Communications]]'' include text, audio, facsimile, [[Military tactics|tactical]]  ground-based communications, terrestrial microwave, [[tropospheric scatter]], naval, satellite communications systems and equipment, surveillance and signal analysis, encryption and security and direction-finding and jamming.&lt;ref name=JMC&gt;[[IHS Inc.|IHS]] [[Jane's]]  [http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence/systems/military-communications.aspx?pu=1&amp;rd=janes_com Military Communications] Retrieved 2012-01-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In past centuries communicating a message usually required someone to go to the destination, bringing the message. Thus, the term "communication" often implied the ability to transport people and supplies. A place under [[siege]] was one that lost communication in both senses. The association between transport and messaging declined in recent centuries.

The first '''military communications''' involved the use of runners or the sending and receiving of simple [[wikt:signal|signals]] (sometimes [[cryptography|encoded]] to be unrecognizable). The first distinctive uses of military communications were called "signals". Modern units specializing in these tactics are usually designated as "[[signal corps]]".  The Roman system of military communication (''[[cursus publicus]]'' or ''cursus vehicularis'') is an early example of this. Later, the terms "signals" and "[[signaler]]" became words referring to a highly-distinct military occupation dealing with general communications methods (similar to those in [[Civilian|civil]] use) rather than with [[weapons]].

Present-day military forces of an [[informational society]] conduct intense and complicated communicating activities on a daily basis, using modern [[telecommunications]] and [[computing]] methods. Only a small portion of these activities are directly related to combat actions.

Modern concepts of [[network-centric warfare]] (NCW) rely on [[Telecommunications network|network]]-oriented methods of communications and control to make existing forces more effective.

==Military communications equipment==
Drums, horns, flags, and riders on horseback were some of the early methods the military used to send messages over distances. In the middle 20th century [[radio]] equipment came to dominate the field.

Many modern pieces of military communications equipment are built to both encrypt and decode [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmissions]] and survive rough treatment in hostile climates. They use different [[frequency|frequencies]] to send signals to other radios and to satellites.

Military communications - or "comms" - are activities, equipment, techniques, and tactics used by the military in some of the most hostile areas of the earth and in challenging environments such as battlefields, on [[Radio in a box|land]], underwater and also in air. Military comms include command, control and communications and intelligence and were known as the C3I model before computers were fully integrated. The U.S. Army expanded the model to C4I when it recognized the vital role played by automated computer equipment to send and receive large, bulky amounts of data. {{Further information|C4ISTAR}}

The advent of distinctive signals led to the formation of the signal corps, a group specialized in the tactics of military communications. The signal corps evolved into a distinctive occupation where the [[signaler]] became a highly technical job dealing with all available communications methods including civil ones. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the modern world, most nations attempt to minimize the risk of war caused by miscommunication or inadequate communication.  As a result, military communication is intense and complicated, and often motivates the development of advanced technology for remote systems such as satellites and aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as well as computers. Computers and their varied applications have revolutionized military comms. Although military communication is designed for warfare, it also supports intelligence-gathering and communication between adversaries, and thus sometimes prevents war.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-5675-24, Übung zum Unternehmen "Seelöwe".jpg|alt=Man in uniform with headphones and throat microphone|thumb|Officer using radio, 1940]]
There are six categories of military comms: the alert measurement systems, cryptography, military radio systems, nuclear command control, the signal corps, and network-centric warfare.

The alert measurement systems are various states of alertness or readiness for the armed forces used around the world during a state of war, act of terrorism or a military attack against a state. They are known by different acronyms, such as DEFCON, or defense readiness condition, used by the U.S. Armed Forces.

[[Cryptography]] is the study of methods of converting messages to a form unreadable except to one who knows how to decrypt them.  This ancient military comms art gained new importance with the rise of radio systems whose signals traveled far and were easily intercepted.  Cryptographic software is also widely used in civilian commerce.

== Commercial refile ==
In United States military communications systems, commercial refile refers to sending a military message via a commercial [[communications network]]. 
The [[message]] may come from a military [[telecommunications network|network]], such as a [[tape relay]] network, a point-to-point telegraph network, a [[Wireless telegraphy|radio-telegraph]] network, or the [[Defense Switched Network]].

Commercial refiling of a message will usually require a reformatting of the message, particularly the heading.

[[File:Mobile phone evolution.jpg|thumb|upright|Evolution of mobile phones, to an early smartphone]]
A '''mobile phone''', '''cell phone''' or '''hand phone''' (short for '''mobile telephone''', '''cellular telephone''' and '''handheld telephone''' respectively), sometimes shortened to simply '''mobile''', '''cell''' or just '''phone''', is a portable [[telephone]] that can make and receive [[telephone call|calls]] over a [[radio frequency]] link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a [[mobile phone operator]], which provides access to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a [[cellular network]] architecture, and, therefore, mobile telephones are called ''cellular telephones'' or ''cell phones'', in North America. In addition to [[telephony]], 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other [[GSM services|services]], such as [[text messaging]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], [[email]], [[Internet access]], short-range wireless communications ([[Infrared Data Association|infrared]], [[Bluetooth]]), business applications, [[video games]], and [[digital photography]]. Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as [[feature phone]]s; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as [[smartphone]]s.

==History==
{{Main article|History of mobile phones}}
[[File:2007Computex e21Forum-MartinCooper.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]] of Motorola made the first publicized handheld mobile phone call on a prototype DynaTAC model on 3 April 1973. This is a reenactment in 2007.]]

A handheld mobile radio telephone service was envisioned in the early stages of radio engineering. In 1917, [[Finland|Finnish]] inventor [[Eric Tigerstedt]] filed a patent for a "pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone". Early predecessors of cellular phones included [[analog signal|analog]] radio communications from ships and trains. The race to create truly portable telephone devices began after World War II, with developments taking place in many countries. The advances in [[mobile telephony]] have been traced in successive "generations", starting with the early zeroth-generation ([[Mobile radio telephone|0G]]) services, such as [[Bell System]]'s [[Mobile Telephone Service]] and its successor, the [[Improved Mobile Telephone Service]]. These 0G systems were not [[Cellular network|cellular]], supported few simultaneous calls, and were very expensive.

[[File:DynaTAC8000X.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.5|The [[Motorola DynaTAC]] 8000X. First commercially available handheld cellular mobile phone, 1984.]]
The first handheld cellular mobile phone was demonstrated by [[John Francis Mitchell|John F. Mitchell]]&lt;ref name="John F. Mitchell Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who invented the cell phone"/&gt; and [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]] of [[Motorola Mobility|Motorola]] in 1973, using a handset weighing {{convert|2|kg|lbs}}.&lt;ref name="Inventor"/&gt; The first commercial automated cellular network ([[1G]]) [[Analog signal|analog]] was launched in Japan by [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]] in 1979. This was followed in 1981 by the simultaneous launch of the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]] (NMT) system in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tekniskamuseet.se/mobilen/engelska/1980_90.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022043906/http://www.tekniskamuseet.se/mobilen/engelska/1980_90.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 October 2008 |title=Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology |publisher=Tekniskamuseet.se |accessdate=29 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other countries then followed in the early to mid-1980s. These first-generation ([[1G]]) systems could support far more simultaneous calls but still used [[analog electronics|analog]] cellular technology. In 1983, the [[Motorola DynaTAC|DynaTAC 8000x]] was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone.

In 1991, the second-generation ([[2G]]) [[digital technology|digital]] cellular technology was launched in Finland by [[Radiolinja]] on the [[GSM]] standard. This sparked competition in the sector as the new operators challenged the incumbent 1G network operators.

Ten years later, in 2001, the third generation ([[3G]]) was launched in Japan by [[NTT DoCoMo]] on the [[WCDMA]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UMTS World |url=http://www.umtsworld.com/umts/history.htm |title=History of UMTS and 3G development |publisher=Umtsworld.com |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G enhancements based on the [[High-Speed Packet Access|high-speed packet access]] (HSPA) family, allowing [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS networks]] to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity.

By 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications, such as [[streaming media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ece.iupui.edu/~dskim/Classes/ECE695MWN/2006-saeed-Capacity_Limit_Problem_in_3G_Networks.ppt | title=Capacity Limit Problem in 3G Networks | author=Fahd Ahmad Saeed | publisher=Purdue School of Engineering | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized fourth-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to ten-fold over existing 3G technologies. The first two commercially available technologies billed as [[4G]] were the [[WiMAX]] standard, offered in North America by [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], and the [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] standard, first offered in Scandinavia by [[TeliaSonera]].

[[5G]] is a technology and term used in research papers and projects to denote the next major phase in mobile telecommunication standards beyond the [[4G]]/[[IMT-Advanced]] standards. The term 5G is not officially used in any specification or official document yet made public by telecommunication companies or standardization bodies such as [[3GPP]], [[WiMAX]] Forum or [[ITU-R]]. New standards beyond 4G are currently being developed by standardization bodies, but they are at this time seen as under the 4G umbrella, not for a new mobile generation.

==Types==

===Smartphone===
{{main|Smartphone}}
[[File:Active mobile broadband subscriptions 2007-2014.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Active mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx|title=Statistics|work=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Smartphone]]s have a number of distinguishing features.  The [[International Telecommunication Union]] measures those with Internet connection, which it calls ''Active Mobile-Broadband subscriptions'' (which includes tablets, etc.). In the developed world, smartphones have now overtaken the usage of earlier mobile systems. However, in the developing world, they account for around 50% of [[mobile telephony]].

===Feature phone===
{{main|Feature phone}}
Feature phone is a term typically used as a [[retronym]] to describe [[mobile phones]] which are limited in capabilities in contrast to a modern [[smartphone]]. Feature phones typically provide [[voice calling]] and [[text messaging]] functionality, in addition to basic [[multimedia]] and [[Internet]] capabilities, and other services offered by the user's [[wireless service provider]]. A feature phone has additional functions over and above a basic mobile phone which is only capable of voice calling and text messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,1237,t=feature+phone&amp;i=62894,00.asp feature phone Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes-twoweeks"&gt;Todd Hixon, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2012/11/13/two-weeks-with-a-dumb-phone/ Two Weeks With A Dumb Phone], ''Forbes'', 13 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Feature phones and basic mobile phones tend to use a proprietary, custom-designed [[software]] and [[user interface]]. By contrast, smartphones generally use a [[mobile operating system]] that often shares common traits across devices.

==={{anchor|Kosher phone}}Kosher phone===
There are [[Orthodox Jewish]] religious restrictions which, by some interpretations, standard mobile telephones overstep. To deal with this problem, some rabbinical organizations have recommended that phones with text-messaging capability not be used by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/01/kosher-phones-orthodox-jews/|title=Kosher Phones For Britain's Orthodox Jews|work=Public Radio International}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Telephone numbers in Israel#Kosher numbers|Phones with restricted features]] are known as [[kosher]] phones and have [[rabbi]]nical approval for use in Israel and elsewhere by observant Orthodox Jews. Although these phones are intended to prevent [[Immodesty#Judaism|immodesty]], some vendors report good sales to adults who prefer the simplicity of the devices. Some phones are approved for use by essential workers (such as health, security, and public service workers) on the [[Shabbat|sabbath]], even though the use of any electrical device is generally prohibited during this time.&lt;ref name=kosher&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/154153|title=Introducing: A 'Kosher Phone' Permitted on Shabbat|work=Arutz Sheva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
{{main|Cellular network|WiFi}}
Mobile phones communicate with cell towers that are placed to give coverage across a telephone service area which is divided up into 'cells'. Each cell uses a different set of frequencies from neighbouring cells, and will typically be covered by 3 towers placed at different locations. The cell towers are usually interconnected to each other and the phone network and the internet by wired connections. Due to bandwidth limitations each cell will have a maximum number of cell phones it can handle at once. The cells are therefore sized depending on the expected usage density, and may be much smaller in cities. In that case much lower transmitter powers are used to avoid broadcasting beyond the cell.

As a phone moves around, a phone will "hand off"- automatically disconnect and reconnect to the tower that gives the best reception.

Additionally, short-range [[Wi-Fi]] infrastructure is often used by smartphones as much as possible as it offloads traffic from cell networks on to local area networks.

==Hardware==
{{Main article|Mobile phone features}}

The common components found on all phones are:

* A [[CPU]], the processor of phones.
* A [[battery (electricity)|battery]], providing the power source for the phone functions.
* An input mechanism to allow the user to interact with the phone. These are a [[keypad]] for feature phones and [[touch screen]]s for most smartphones.
* A display which echoes the user's typing, and displays text messages, contacts, and more.
* Speakers for sound.
* [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]]s and [[Removable User Identity Module|R-UIM cards]].

Low-end mobile phones are often referred to as [[feature phone]]s and offer basic telephony. Handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native software applications are known as [[smartphone]]s.

===Central processing unit===
Mobile phones have [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), similar to those in computers, but optimised to operate in low power environments.

Mobile CPU performance depends not only on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of [[hertz]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = CPU Frequency
 | work = CPU World Glossary
 | publisher = CPU World
 | date = 25 March 2008
 | url = http://www.cpu-world.com/Glossary/C/CPU_Frequency.html
 | accessdate =1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the [[memory hierarchy]] also greatly affects overall performance. Because of these problems, the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.

===Display===
{{main article|Display device}}
One of the main characteristics of phones is the [[Display device|screen]]. Depending on the device's type and design, the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a device's front surface. Many smartphone displays have an [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of [[16:9]], but taller aspect ratios became more common in 2017.

Screen sizes are measured in diagonal [[inch]]es; feature phones generally have screen sizes below 3.5 inches. Phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called "[[phablet]]s." Smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand, since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface; they may need to be shifted around in the hand, held in one hand and manipulated by the other, or used in place with both hands. Due to design advances, some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and "edge-to-edge" designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics, while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller 16:9 displays.&lt;ref name="phonearena-s7edgenotphablet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't call it a phablet: the 5.5" Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is narrower than many 5.2" devices|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Dont-call-it-a-phablet-the-5.5-Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Edge-is-narrower-than-many-5.2-devices_id79482|website=PhoneArena|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-phabletpytha"&gt;{{cite web|title=We’re gonna need Pythagoras’ help to compare screen sizes in 2017|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/30/15120824/screen-aspect-ratio-mathematics-galaxy-s8-lg-g6|website=The Verge|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-s8aspectratio"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Samsung Galaxy S8 will change the way we think about display sizes|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/30/15121526/samsung-galaxy-s8-vs-google-pixel-iphone-7-screen-size-comparison|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liquid-crystal display]]s are the most common; others are [[IPS panel|IPS]], [[LED]], [[OLED]], and [[AMOLED]] displays. Some displays are integrated with pressure-sensitive digitizers, such as those developed by [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] and [[Samsung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=J. R.|last2=Phillips|first2=M. J.|date=1987-04-01|title=Digitizer Technology: Performance Characteristics and the Effects on the User Interface|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4057152/|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume=7|issue=4|pages=31–44|doi=10.1109/MCG.1987.276869|issn=0272-1716}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Apple's "[[3D Touch]]" system.

===Sound===
In sound, smartphones and feature phones vary little. Some audio-quality enhancing features, such as [[Voice over LTE]] and [[HD Voice]], have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones.  Sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone, the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in [[long distance call]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-mobile-voice-quality-still-stinksand-how-to-fix-it|title=Why Mobile Voice Quality Still Stinks—and How to Fix It|author=Jeff Hecht|work=ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-cell-phone-call-quality-so-terrible|title=Why Is Cell Phone Call Quality So Terrible?|author=Elena Malykhina|work=scientificamerican.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audio quality can be improved using a [[VoIP]] application over [[WiFi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/whats-the-best-mobile-voip-app-1579791681|title=What's the Best Mobile VoIP App?|author=Alan Henry|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Lifehacker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a [[speakerphone]] feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear. The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component, without holding the phone close to the ear.

===Battery===
The average phone battery lasts 2-3 years at best. Many of the wireless devices use a Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery, which charges 500-2500 times, depending on how users take care of the battery and the charging techniques used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.phonedog.com/2011/08/07/how-to-prolong-your-cell-phone-battery-s-life-span|title=How To Prolong Your Cell Phone Battery's Life Span|last=Taylor|first=Martin|date=|work=Phonedog.com|access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only natural for these rechargeable batteries to chemically age, which is why the performance of the battery when used for a year or two will begin to deteriorate. Battery life can be extended by draining it regularly, not overcharging it, and keeping it away from heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387|title=Iphone Battery and Performance|last=|first=|date=|website=Apple Support|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/expert-advice-on-how-to-avoid-destroying-your-phones-battery/|title=Should You Leave Your Smartphone Plugged Into The Charger Overnight?

===SIM card===
{{Main article|Subscriber Identity Module|Removable User Identity Module}}
[[File:Typical cellphone SIM cards.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical mobile phone mini-[[SIM card]].]]
Mobile phones require a small [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] called a Subscriber Identity Module or [[SIM card]], in order to function. The SIM card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit. The SIM securely stores the [[International Mobile Subscriber Identity|service-subscriber key (IMSI)]] and the [[Authentication Center|K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]] used to identify and authenticate the user of the mobile phone. The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device, provided that this is not prevented by a [[SIM lock]]. The first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker [[Giesecke &amp; Devrient]] for the Finnish wireless network operator [[Radiolinja]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

A hybrid mobile phone can hold up to four [[SIM card]]s, with a phone having an IMEI per SIM Card. SIM and [[R-UIM]] cards may be mixed together to allow both [[GSM]] and [[CDMA]] networks to be accessed. From 2010 onwards, such phones became popular in emerging markets,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110429/wr_nm/us_handsets]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508150638/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110429/wr_nm/us_handsets|date=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was attributed to the desire to obtain the lowest on-net calling rate.

==Software==

===Software platforms===
{{main|Mobile operating system}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}
Feature phones have basic software platforms.

Smartphones have advanced software platforms.

===Mobile app===
{{main|Mobile app}}
A mobile app is a computer program designed to run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone. The term "app" is a shortening of the term "software application".

;Messaging
{{see also|SMS|Multimedia Messaging Service{{!}}MMS}}
[[File:IPhone Text Message Amber Alert 1882467856 o.jpg|thumb|A text message (SMS).]]

A common data application on mobile phones is [[SMS|Short Message Service]] (SMS) text messaging. The first SMS message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK while the first person-to-person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993. The first [[mobile news]] service, delivered via SMS, was launched in Finland in 2000,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and subsequently many organizations provided "on-demand" and "instant" news services by SMS. [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS) was introduced in 2001.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Application stores===
{{Main article|List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices}}

The introduction of Apple's App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July 2008 popularized manufacturer-hosted [[list of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices|online distribution]] for third-party applications (software and computer programs) focused on a single platform. There are a huge variety of apps, including [[video game]]s, music products and business tools. Up until that point, smartphone application distribution depended on [[List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices#Third-party platforms|third-party sources]] providing applications for multiple platforms, such as [[GetJar]], [[Handango]], [[Handmark]], and [[PocketGear]]. Following the success of the App Store, other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores, such as Google's Android Market (later renamed to the Google Play Store) and RIM's [[BlackBerry App World]] and Android-related app stores like [[F-Droid]]. In February 2014, 93% of [[mobile developers]] were targeting smartphones first for mobile app development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/02/w3c-interview-vision-mobile-on-the-app-developer-economy-with-matos-kapetanakis-and-dimitris-michalakos/ W3C Interview: Vision Mobile on the App Developer Economy with Matos Kapetanakis and Dimitris Michalakos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629101713/http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/02/w3c-interview-vision-mobile-on-the-app-developer-economy-with-matos-kapetanakis-and-dimitris-michalakos/ |date=June 29, 2016 }}.

Mobile phones are used for a variety of purposes, such as keeping in touch with family members, for conducting business, and in order to have access to a telephone in the event of an emergency. Some people carry more than one mobile phone for different purposes, such as for business and personal use. Multiple SIM cards may be used to take advantage of the benefits of different calling plans.  For example, a particular plan might provide for cheaper local calls, long-distance calls, international calls, or roaming.

The mobile phone has been used in a variety of diverse contexts in society.  For example:
* A study by [[Motorola Mobility|Motorola]] found that one in ten mobile phone subscribers have a second phone that is often kept secret from other family members.

===Content distribution===
In 1998, one of the first examples of [[content distribution|distributing and selling media content]] through the mobile phone was the sale of [[ringtone]]s by [[Radiolinja]] in Finland. Soon afterwards, other media content appeared, such as news, video games, jokes, horoscopes, TV content and advertising. Most early content for mobile phones tended to be copies of [[legacy media]], such as banner advertisements or TV news highlight video clips. Recently, unique content for mobile phones has been emerging, from ringtones and [[ringback tones]] to [[mobisodes]], video content that has been produced exclusively for mobile phones.

===Mobile banking and payment===
[[File:Mobile payment 01.jpg|thumb|Mobile payment system.]]
{{main article|Mobile banking|Mobile payment}}
{{see also|Branchless banking|Contactless payment}}
In many countries, mobile phones are used to provide [[mobile banking]] services, which may include the ability to transfer cash payments by secure SMS text message. Kenya's [[M-PESA]] mobile banking service, for example, allows customers of the mobile phone operator [[Safaricom]] to hold cash balances which are recorded on their SIM cards. Cash can be deposited or withdrawn from M-PESA accounts at Safaricom retail outlets located throughout the country and can be transferred electronically from person to person and used to pay bills to companies.

[[Branchless banking]] has also been successful in South Africa and the [[Philippines]]. A pilot project in [[Bali]] was launched in 2011 by the [[International Finance Corporation]] and an [[Indonesia]]n bank, [[Bank Mandiri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/01/branchless-banking-start-bali.html |title=Branchless banking to start in Bali |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application of mobile banking technology is [[Zidisha]], a US-based nonprofit micro-lending platform that allows residents of developing countries to raise small business loans from Web users worldwide. Zidisha uses mobile banking for loan disbursements and repayments, transferring funds from lenders in the United States to borrowers in rural Africa who have mobile phones and can use the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |title="Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010 |publisher=Microfinancefocus.com |date=7 February 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921054251/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia |archivedate=21 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in [[Espoo]] were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually, the idea spread and in 1999, the Philippines launched the country's first commercial mobile payments systems with mobile operators [[Globe Telecom|Globe]] and [[Smart Communications|Smart]].

Some mobile phones can make [[mobile payment]]s via direct mobile billing schemes, or through [[contactless payment]]s if the phone and the [[point of sale]] support [[near field communication]] (NFC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banktech.com/blog/archives/2007/06/mobile_payments.html |title=Mobile Payments: Look to Korea |author=Feig, Nancy |publisher=banktech.com |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=29 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326155917/http://www.banktech.com/blog/archives/2007/06/mobile_payments.html |archivedate=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enabling contactless payments through NFC-equipped mobile phones requires the co-operation of manufacturers, network operators, and retail merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1350709 |title=End of the credit card?

===Mobile tracking===
{{see also|Cellphone surveillance|Mobile phone tracking}}

Mobile phones are commonly used to collect location data. While the phone is turned on, the geographical location of a mobile phone can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not) using a technique known as [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the mobile phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.&lt;ref name="bbc-phone-locate"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm |title= Tracking a suspect by mobile phone |date= 3 August 2005 |work= BBC News |accessdate= 14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews-phone-locate"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/03/18/cell-phone-tracking-can-locate-terrorists-but-only-where-it-legal/ |title= Cell Phone Tracking Can Locate Terrorists&amp;nbsp;— But Only Where It's Legal |last= Miller |first= Joshua |date= 14 March 2009 |work= FOX News |accessdate= 4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movements of a mobile phone user can be tracked by their service provider and if desired, by law enforcement agencies and their governments. Both the [[SIM card]] and the handset can be tracked.&lt;ref name="bbc-phone-locate"/&gt;

China has proposed using this technology to track the commuting patterns of Beijing city residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2011/03/china_said_it_may_begin.html |author= Cecilia Kang |title= China plans to track cellphone users, sparking human rights concerns |publisher= The Washington Post |date= 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK and US, law enforcement and intelligence services use mobile phones to perform surveillance operations.

===While driving===
{{Main article|Mobile phones and driving safety|Texting while driving}}

[[File:Hand held phone in car.JPG|thumb|right|A driver using two hand-held mobile phones at once.]]
[[File:NocellphonesSouthsidePlaceTX.JPG|thumb|A sign in the U.S. restricting cell phone use to certain times of day]]

Mobile phone use while driving, including talking on the phone, texting, or operating other phone features, is common but controversial. It is widely considered dangerous due to [[distracted driving]]. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents. In September 2010, the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) reported that 995 people were killed by [[Restrictions on cell phone use by U.S. drivers|drivers distracted by cell phones]]. In March 2011, a U.S. insurance company, [[State Farm Insurance]], announced the results of a study which showed 19% of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news |title=Quit Googling yourself and drive: About 20% of drivers using Web behind the wheel, study says |work=Los Angeles Times |date=4 March 2011 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/03/honk-if-youre-googling-20-of-drivers-using-web-behind-the-wheel-says-study.html/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. In Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal, and Singapore, both handheld and hands-free use of a mobile phone (which uses a [[speakerphone]]) is banned.  In other countries, including the UK and France and in many [[Restrictions on cell phone use by US drivers|U.S. states]], only handheld phone use is banned while hands-free use is permitted.

A 2011 study reported that over 90% of college students surveyed text (initiate, reply or read) while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457510002095|title = The Choice to Text and Drive in Younger Drivers: Behaviour May Shape Attitude|last = Atchley|first = Paul|date = January 2011|journal = Accident Analysis and Prevention|doi = 10.1016/j.aap.2010.08.003|pmid = |access-date = |first2 = Stephanie|last2 = Atwood|last3 = Boulton|first3 = Aaron|volume=43|pages=134–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scientific literature on the dangers of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or ''[[texting while driving]]'', is limited. A simulation study at the [[University of Utah]] found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070714/NEWS01/707140333&amp;template=printart Text messaging not illegal but data clear on its peril]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the increasing complexity of mobile phones, they are often more like mobile computers in their available uses. This has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices. This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which ban handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a phone call when, in fact, they were using the device legally, for example, when using the phone's incorporated controls for car stereo, [[GPS]] or [[satnav]].

A 2010 study reviewed the incidence of mobile phone use while [[cycling]] and its effects on behaviour and safety.&lt;ref&gt;de Waard, D., Schepers, P., Ormel, W. and Brookhuis, K., 2010, ''Mobile phone use while cycling: Incidence and effects on behaviour and safety'', ''Ergonomics'', Vol 53, No. 1, January 2010, pp 30–42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a national survey in the US reported the number of drivers who reported using their cellphones to access the Internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/12/distracted-driving-accessing-internet/3497721/ Drivers still Web surfing while driving, survey finds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the University of Vienna examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones, such as using mobile phones while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://homepage.univie.ac.at/andreas.hergovich/php/reaching_the_mobile_respondent_soc.sci.comp.rev.pdf |title = Reaching the Mobile Respondent: Determinants of High-Level Mobile Phone Use Among a High-Coverage Group  |publisher = Social Science Computer Review |doi = 10.1177/0894439309353099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidents involving a driver being distracted by talking on a mobile phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding. In the [[United Kingdom]], from 27 February 2007, motorists who are caught using a hand-held mobile phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of [[£]]60.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6287005.stm Drivers face new phone penalties]&lt;/ref&gt; This increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6382077.stm Careless talk]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]] prohibits all mobile phone use while driving, including use of hands-free devices.  New Zealand has banned hand-held cell phone use since 1 November 2009. Many states in the United States have banned texting on cell phones while driving. Illinois became the 17th American state to enforce this law.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/08/06/illinois.texting.ban/index.html | work=CNN | title=Illinois to ban texting while driving - CNN.com | accessdate=12 May 2010 | date=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2010, 30 states had banned texting while driving, with Kentucky becoming the most recent addition on 15 July.&lt;ref name="Courier-Journal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20100714/NEWS01/7140399/1008/NEWS01/Texting+while+driving+ban++other+new+Kentucky+laws+take+effect+Thursday |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119183044/http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20100714/NEWS01/7140399/1008/NEWS01/Texting+while+driving+ban++other+new+Kentucky+laws+take+effect+Thursday |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 January 2013 |title=Texting while driving ban, other new Kentucky laws take effect today |first=Stephanie |last=Steitzer |publisher=''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public health law|Public Health Law Research]] maintains a list of distracted driving laws in the United States. This database of laws provides a comprehensive view of the provisions of laws that restrict the use of mobile communication devices while driving for all 50 states and the District of Columbia between 1992 when first law was passed, through 1 December 2010. The dataset contains information on 22 dichotomous, continuous or categorical variables including, for example, activities regulated (e.g., texting versus talking, hands-free versus handheld), targeted populations, and exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publichealthlawresearch.org/product/distracted-driving-laws-map |title=Distracted Driving Laws |publisher=Public Health Law Research |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health effects===
{{Main article|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
{{See also|Nomophobia|Mobile phone overuse}}
The effect of mobile phone radiation on human health is the subject of recent{{When|date=October 2017}} interest and study, as a result of the enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world. Mobile phones use [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[microwave]] range, which some believe may be harmful to human health. A large body of research exists, both [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] and experimental, in [[animal model|non-human animals]] and in humans.  The majority of this research shows no definite causative relationship between exposure to mobile phones and harmful biological effects in humans. This is often paraphrased simply as the balance of evidence showing no harm to humans from mobile phones, although a significant number of individual studies do suggest such a relationship, or are inconclusive. Other [[Wireless electronic devices and health|digital wireless systems]], such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

On 31 May 2011, the [[World Health Organization]] stated that mobile phone use may possibly represent a long-term health risk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IARC CLASSIFIES RADIOFREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AS POSSIBLY CARCINOGENIC TO HUMANS|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/features/qa/30/en|title= What are the health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations?|accessdate=19 January 2008|date= 5 December 2005|work= Online Q&amp;A|publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; classifying mobile phone radiation as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" after a team of scientists reviewed studies on mobile phone safety.&lt;ref name="cnnwhocarcinogenic"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/05/31/who.cell.phones/index.html|title= WHO: Cell phone use can increase possible cancer risk|accessdate=31 May 2011|publisher=CNN|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mobile phone is in [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|category 2B]], which ranks it alongside [[coffee]] and other possibly carcinogenic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/ClassificationsGroupOrder.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agents Classified by the IARC Monographs, Volumes 1–107|website=monographs.iarc.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kovvali|first=Gopala|title=Cell phones are as carcinogenic as coffee|journal=Journal of Carcinogenesis|date=1 January 2011|volume=10|issue=1|page=18|doi=10.4103/1477-3163.83044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent{{When|date=October 2017}} studies have found an association between mobile phone use and certain kinds of brain and salivary gland tumors. [[Lennart Hardell]] and other authors of a 2009 meta-analysis of 11 studies from peer-reviewed journals concluded that cell phone usage for at least ten years "approximately doubles the risk of being diagnosed with a brain tumor on the same ('ipsilateral') side of the head as that preferred for cell phone use".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khurana|first=VG|author2=Teo C |author3=Kundi M |author4=Hardell L |author5=Carlberg M |title=Cell phones and brain tumors: A review including the long term epidemiologic data|journal=Surgical Neurology|volume=72|issue=3|pages=205–214|doi=10.1016/j.surneu.2009.01.019|pmid=19328536|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study of past mobile phone use cited in the report showed a "40% increased risk for [[gliomas]] (brain cancer) in the highest category of heavy users (reported average: 30 minutes per day over a 10‐year period)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cell-phones-cause-cancer-2011-5 |title=World Health Organization: Cell Phones May Cause Cancer|accessdate=31 May 2011|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reversal of the study's prior position that cancer was unlikely to be caused by cellular phones or their base stations and that reviews had found no convincing evidence for other health effects.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en|title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile telephones and their base stations|accessdate=19 January 2008|date=June 2000|work= Fact sheet N°193|publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study published 24 March 2012, in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' questioned these estimates because the increase in brain cancers has not paralleled the increase in mobile phone use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Little MP, Rajaraman P, Curtis RE, etal | title = Mobile phone use and glioma risk: comparison of epidemiological study results with incidence trends in the United States | journal = BMJ | year = 2012 | volume=344 | pages=e1147 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e1147 | pmid=22403263 | pmc=3297541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain countries, including France, have warned against the use of mobile phones by minors in particular, due to health risk uncertainties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0223157720080102|title=France warns against excessive mobile phone use|accessdate=10 May 2010|date=2 January 2008|publisher=Reuters|author=Brian Rohan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile pollution by transmitting electromagnetic waves can be decreased up to 90% by adopting the circuit as designed in mobile phone and mobile exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijcnwc.org/papers/vol2no52012/3vol2no5.pdf|title=Mobile Phone and System Are Designed In A Novel Way To Have Minimum Electromagnetic Wave Transmission In Air and Minimum Electrical Power Consumption|last=Bhattacharjee|first=Pijush Kanti (2012)|date=|website=International Journal of Computer Networks and Wireless Communications [IJCNWC], vol. 2, no. 5, pp. 556–559, 2012.|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, preliminary findings of a long-term study by the U.S. government suggested that radio-frequency (RF) radiation, the type emitted by cell phones, can cause cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/05/federal-study-links-cell-phone-radiation-cancer "“Game-Changing” Study Links Cellphone Radiation to Cancer"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/05/26/055699.full.pdf "Report of Partial Findings from the National Toxicology Program Carcinogenesis Studies of Cell Phone Radiofrequency Radiation in Hsd: Sprague Dawley® SD rats (Whole Body Exposures) – Draft 5-19-2016"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational impact===
{{see also|Mobile phone use in schools}}
A study by the London School of Economics found that banning mobile phones in schools could increase pupils' academic performance, providing benefits equal to one extra week of schooling per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Social media 'more stressful than exams'|last=Davis|first=Anna|date=18 May 2015|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|page=13|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic waste regulation===
[[File:Handy schrott mobile phone scrap.jpg|right|thumb|Scrapped mobile phones.]]
{{see also|Mobile phone recycling}}
Studies have shown that around 40–50% of the environmental impact of mobile phones occurs during the manufacture of their printed wiring boards and integrated circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informinc.org/pages/media/the-secret-life-series/the-secret-life-of-cell-phones.html|title=The Secret Life Series – Environmental Impacts of Cell Phones|publisher=Inform, Inc.|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average user replaces their mobile phone every 11 to 18 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/engineering-information-technology/e-waste-research-group/facts-figures|title=E-waste research group, Facts and figures|publisher=Griffith University|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the discarded phones then contribute to [[electronic waste]].  Mobile phone manufacturers within [[Europe]] are subject to the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive|WEEE directive]], and Australia has introduced a mobile phone recycling scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arp.net.au/envcha.php|title=Mobile Phone Waste and The Environment|publisher=Aussie Recycling Program|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple Inc.]] had an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter called Liam specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones.&lt;sup&gt;[[Apple Inc.|[350]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Theft===
According to the [[Federal Communications Commission]], one out of three robberies involve the theft of a cellular phone.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Police data in San Francisco show that half of all robberies in 2012 were thefts of cellular phones.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} An online petition on [[Change.org]], called ''[[Secure our Smartphones]]'', urged smartphone manufacturers to install [[kill switch]]es in their devices to make them unusable if stolen. The petition is part of a joint effort by New York Attorney General [[Eric Schneiderman]] and San Francisco District Attorney [[George Gascón]] and was directed to the [[CEO]]s of the major smartphone manufacturers and telecommunication carriers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/plea-urges-anti-theft-phone-tech/Content?oid=2447711  Adams, Mike "Plea Urges Anti-Theft Phone Tech"] ''San Francisco Examiner'' Friday, 7 June 2013 Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday, 10 June 2013, Apple announced that it would install a "[[kill switch]]" on its [[iOS 7|next iPhone operating system]], due to debut in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"Apple to add kill switches to help combat iPhone theft" by Jaxon Van Derbeken ''San  Francisco Chronicle'' Tuesday, 11 June 2013 Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

All mobile phones have a unique identifier called [[International Mobile Station Equipment Identity|IMEI]]. Anyone can report their phone as lost or stolen with their Telecom Carrier, and the IMEI would be blacklisted with a central registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imeipro.info/|title=IMEIpro – free IMEI number check service|website=www.imeipro.info|access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telecom carriers, depending upon local regulation can or must implement blocking of blacklisted phones in their network. There are, however, a number of ways to circumvent a blacklist. One method is to send the phone to a country where the telecom carriers are not required to implement the blacklisting and sell it there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/android/combatting-theft-with-stolen-phone-blacklists/|title=How stolen phone blacklists will tamp down on crime, and what to do in the mean time|date=27 November 2012|language=en-US|access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; another involves altering the phone's IMEI number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unlockphonetool.com/how-to-change-imei-number/|title=How To Change IMEI Number|date=1 July 2015|language=en-US|access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, mobile phones typically have less value on the second-hand market if the phones original IMEI is blacklisted.

An unusual example of a phone bill caused by theft (reported on 28 June 2018) was when a biological group in Poland put a [[GPS tracker]] on a [[white stork]] and released it; during autumn [[Animal migration|migration]] over the [[Blue Nile]] valley in eastern [[Sudan]] someone got hold of the stork's GPS tracker, and found in it a mobile-phone-type [[sim card]], which he put in his mobile phone, and made 20 hours of calls on it, running up a bill of over 10,000 Polish [[zloty]]s (= $2700) for the biological group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-44645217 |title=Polish charity gets huge phone bill thanks to stork |work=BBC News |date=28 June 2018 |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict minerals===
{{main|Conflict minerals}}

Demand for metals used in mobile phones and other electronics fuelled the [[Second Congo War]], which claimed almost 5.5 million lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/democraticrepublicofcongo/8792068/Is-your-mobile-phone-helping-fund-war-in-Congo.html |title=Is your mobile phone helping fund war in Congo? |date= 27 September 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 news story, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported: "In unsafe mines deep underground in eastern Congo, [[Child labour|children are working]] to extract minerals essential for the electronics industry. The profits from the minerals finance the bloodiest conflict since the second world war; the war has lasted nearly 20 years and has recently flared up again. ... For the last 15 years, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] has been a major source of natural resources for the mobile phone industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/congo-child-labour-mobile-minerals |title= Children of the Congo who risk their lives to supply our mobile phones |date= 7 December 2012 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company [[Fairphone]] has worked to develop a mobile phone that does not contain [[Conflict resource|conflict minerals]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2295">'''Modular construction''' is the use of volumetric building modules where the units form the structure of the building as well as enclose usable space. Modular construction is particularly popular for hotels and student residences due to the [[economies of scale]] available from many similar sized modules and the particular benefit of reduced site construction time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951742611|title=Offsite architecture : constructing the future|others=Smith, Ryan E.,, Quale, John D.,|isbn=9781138821378|location=London|oclc=951742611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety Advantages ==
Modular construction can help eliminate or reduce many hazards associated with traditional construction can be avoided including: 
* Falling from heights, such as roofs. A common method used now is to construct the roof on the ground and lift it into position with a crane later&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-133/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - PtD - Architectural Design and Construction - Instructor's Manual (2013-133)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dropping objects. When construction necessitates working on a building in its finished position, work is often performed at different elevations. This leads to the possibility of objects falling onto other workers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Ergonomic strains. Workers can perform their tasks on smaller pieces of project in easy to access areas to eliminate the need to reach and stretch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Environmental hazards. As with ergonomic hazards, employees can work on the project in a protected environment instead of in the elements. Only needing to be on site for final assembly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Use of modular construction methods is encouraged by proponents of [[Prevention through design|Prevention through Design]] techniques in construction. It is included as a recommended hazard control for construction projects in the "PtD - Architectural Design and Construction Education Module" published by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Nanobiomechanics''' (also '''bionanomechanics''') is an emerging field in [[nanoscience]] and [[biomechanics]] that combines the powerful tools of [[nanomechanics]] to explore fundamental science of [[biomaterials]] and biomechanics.

Since the introduction by its founder [[Yuan-Cheng Fung]], the field of biomechanics has become one of the branches of mechanics and bioscience. For many years, biomechanics has examined [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]. Through advancements in nanoscience, the scale of the [[force]]s that could be measured and also the scale of observation of biomaterials was reduced to "nano" and "pico" level. Consequently, it became possible to measure the mechanical properties of biological materials at [[nanoscale]].

Most of the biological materials have different hierarchical levels, and the smallest ones refer to the nanoscale. For example, [[bone]] has up to seven levels of [[biological organization]], and the smallest level, i.e., single [[collagen]] [[fibril]] and [[hydroxylapatite]] minerals have dimensions well below 100&amp;nbsp;nm. Therefore, being able to probe properties at this small scales provides a great opportunity for better understanding the fundamental properties of these materials. For example, measurements have shown that nanomechanical [[heterogeneity]] exists even within single collagen fibrils as small as 100&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Minary-Jolandan |first1=Majid |last2=Yu |first2=Min-Feng |title=Nanomechanical heterogeneity in the gap and overlap regions of type I collagen fibrils with implications for bone heterogeneity |journal=Biomacromolecules |year=2009 |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=2565–70 |pmid=19694448 |doi=10.1021/bm900519v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the other most relevant topics in this field is measurement of tiny forces on [[living cell]]s to recognize changes caused by different [[disease]]s. For example, it has been shown that [[red blood cell]]s infected by [[malaria]] are 10 times stiffer than normal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/16475/ |title=Nanobiomechanics |author=Michael Fitzgerald |date=March–April 2006 |work=Technology Review |publisher=MIT |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it has been shown that [[cancer cell]]s are 70 percent softer than normal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/19808/ |title=The Feel of Cancer Cells |author=Katherine Bourzac |date=December 4, 2007 |work=Technology Review |publisher=MIT |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early signs of aging [[cartilage]] and [[osteoarthritis]] has been shown by looking at the changes in the tissue at the nanoscale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Stolz M, Gottardi R, Raiteri R, Miot S, Martin I, Imer R, etal |title=Early detection of aging cartilage and osteoarthritis in mice and patient samples using atomic force microscopy |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |year=2009 |volume=4 |issue=3 | pages=186–92 |pmid=19265849 |doi=10.1038/nnano.2008.410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods and instrumentation ==
The common methods in nanobiomechanics are [[atomic force microscope]], [[optical tweezers]], and magnetic twisting cytometry.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Examples of relevant materials are bone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tai K, Dao M, Suresh S, Palazoglu A, Ortiz C |title=Nanoscale heterogeneity promotes energy dissipation in bone |journal=Nature Materials |year=2007 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=454–62 |pmid=17515917 |doi=10.1038/nmat1911 |url=http://nanomechanics.mit.edu/papers/NatureMater_2007_Bone_nanoindent.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422172752/http://nanomechanics.mit.edu/papers/NatureMater_2007_Bone_nanoindent.pdf |archivedate=April 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its hierarchical constituents such as single collagen fibrils, single living cells, [[actin filaments]] and [[microtubules]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kiss|title=Nanomechanics of Microtubules |journal=Physical Review Letters |year=2002 |volume=89 |issue=24 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.248101|display-authors=etal|url=https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/147380/files/PhysRevLett.89.248101.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and synthetic peptide nanotubes.

== Computational nanobiomechanics ==
In addition to experimental aspect, research has been expanding through computational methods.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided a wealth of knowledge in this area. Although, the MD simulation are still limited to a small number of atoms and molecules, due to limitation in the computational performance, they have proved to be an instrumental branch of this emerging field.

A '''nitro engine''' generally refers to an engine powered with a fuel that contains some portion (usually between 10% and 40%) of [[nitromethane]] mixed with [[methanol]].  Nitromethane is a highly combustible substance that is generally only used in very specifically designed engines found in [[Top Fuel]] [[drag racing]] and miniature [[Model aircraft#Internal combustion|internal combustion engines]] in [[Radio-controlled aircraft|radio control]], [[control line]] and [[free flight (model aircraft)|free flight]] model aircraft.

The term "nitro" has only come into use in the last few years to describe these engines and has its origins in marketing hype in the model car market. For the fifty or so years prior to this term since the engines were first developed, they were simply referred to as "glow engines", but the term "nitro" has more impact in ad copy. These engines are actually fueled by methanol, but the fuel is often doped with nitromethane as a performance additive. The ignition system consists of a [[Glow plug (model engine)|glow plug]] - hence the older term "glow" engine - which has a coil of platinum-containing wire alloy, usually [[platinum]]-[[Iridium]]. The glow plug is heated with electric current for starting, after which power is disconnected and the combination of residual heat and [[Catalysis|catalytic]] action of the platinum alloy with methanol ignites the fuel mixture.

==Working cycle==
Nitro engines for models can turn in excess of 50,000 RPM. Typical operating rpm for sport model aircraft engines is 10,000-14,000 rpm. For [[radio control]] (RC) boats and [[ducted fan]] aircraft engines, 20,000-25,000 is the usual range, and for cars rpm in the range of 25,000-37,000 is common. With this much movement, a lot of frictional heat is generated and the fuel used for these engines usually contains between 12-20% oil content depending on the nitromethane and methanol percentage, the engine type and application. Most engines in RC cars today are [[2 stroke engine]]s, which means that it takes 2 strokes of the piston (one revolution) to complete the engine cycle. On the first stroke as the piston travels upward, a mixture of fuel and air is sucked into the crankcase, from the [[carburettor]]. When the piston travels downward the new fuel air mixture travels into the induction port and finally into the combustion chamber. As the piston travels upward the mixture is compressed which causes the fuel/air mixture to ignite, producing hot gas under pressure to force the piston down. As the piston travels downward the spent exhaust gases escape out of the combustion chamber through the exhaust port, and the cycle starts over by the fuel mixture being again pushed into the induction port.

==Ignition==
When starting, the glow plug is electrically preheated by electric current. The glow plug is not to be confused with a [[spark plug]] - there is no spark in the glow plug. Catalysis from methanol vapor on the heated platinum element keeps it red-hot even after voltage has been removed, which ignites the fuel and keeps the engine running. Whereas spark plugs are constantly used to ignite the fuel/air mix every time the piston comes up, as seen in the petrol engine where the spark plug is used, the fuel cannot be ignited with compression alone. It is the plug's temperature, still [[Red heat|red-hot]] from previous ignition and from catalysis with the new compressed mixture, that ignites the fuel.

==Carburetor==
Nitros engines typically use a [[carburetor]] to mix the fuel and air together, although for some applications where throttling is not required they have a simple [[Venturi effect|venturi]] with a spraybar and [[needle valve]]. The carburetor can either be sliding or rotary. On a rotary carburetor, the slide is opened as the arm is turned by the [[Servo (radio control)|servo]]. On a slide carburetor the slide is opened by sliding the arm out by the servo. Both are held open slightly by an idle screw which allows the engine to receive a very small amount of fuel to keep the engine running when the vehicle is at a stop. The carburetors usually feature 2 needles used to tune the mixture. A high speed needle tunes how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at mid to high RPM, and a low speed needle determines how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at low to mid range RPM. Turning either needle in a clockwise motion will thin the [[Air–fuel ratio|fuel mixture]]. Lean describes the amount of fuel in the fuel / air mixture. To a point this will make the engine run faster with better performance, but once too lean the engine will overheat, and wear out prematurely due to not receiving enough lubrication. Turning either needle counterclockwise will enrich the fuel mixture (unless the low speed needle is an air bleed in which case the opposite is true). Rich is the opposite of lean, it means more oil (fuel mixture) is entering the engine. If the engine is too rich, it will run poorly, and fuel that has not yet been burnt may start to spit out of the exhaust. The engine will run very slowly and seem to have no power and possibly cut out from being flooded with fuel. Although, being too rich is better than being too lean, because being too rich just means the engine is getting too much oil which is perfectly fine, although performance may not be as good as if the engine were lean. An excessively lean mixture can damage an engine in a short time, as it will run above its design temperature. A properly tuned engine will last a long time with good performance throughout its life.

==Variations==
There are several different types of R/C engines. There are on-road, off-road, aircraft, marine, and monster truck engines. 

===On-road and off-road===
{{main|Radio-controlled car}}
On-road engines are designed to come into their power band from mid to high RPM. These engines can be used in off-road vehicles but are normally used in on-road sedans where very high RPM and high speed is required. Off-road engines have a less abrupt power curve compared to on-road engines. Off-road engines have a power band that extends through most of the RPM range. Off-road engines do not rev as high as on-road engines, but they do have more torque that can easily propel the vehicle it is in to impressive speeds. Off-road engines are usually used in 1/8 scale buggies where high speeds and good acceleration are required.

===Monster truck===
Monster truck engines are generally very large compared to on-road and off-road engines. Where an off-road engine may be 0.21 [[cubic inch]] (ci) size, a monster truck engine may be as much as 0.46 ci. Monster truck engines generate much of their torque and horsepower at low to mid range RPM. They are usually used in large and heavy trucks where all that power is needed to get good performance out of the vehicle.

===Aircraft===
{{main|Radio-controlled aircraft}}
Aircraft engines are manufactured to be able to sustain high RPM. The biggest difference between all other nitro engines and aircraft engines is the ability to sustain RPM. Other nitro engines tend to break if run at full throttle for a full tank of fuel.

===Marine===
{{main|Radio-controlled boat}}
Marine engines are cooled with water rather than air like other nitro engines.

==Drag racing==
Members of the full scale [[drag racing]] industry use much higher concentrations of nitromethane: they are limited by the rules to 90% (at least in the NHRA, the main sanctioning body). Historically, racers used higher percentages which frequently caused massive explosions. Modern engines are estimated to generate around 8000 horsepower. The cars can accelerate from 0 to 100mph in 0.8 seconds and 0 to 335mph in 4.5 seconds.

'''Push''' is a British media organisation that offers information to university applicants and students in the United Kingdom.

Its flagship is now the website Push.co.uk, which features profiles of every UK university, advice about choosing a university and student finance, and a tool called the 'Uni Chooser' which allows users to create a shortlist of suitable universities sorted according to a large variety of criteria. Push describes itself as "the ruthlessly independent guide to UK universities" and uses the tagline "Push… like it is".

Previously, Push published a range of books including ''The Push Guide to Which University'', ''The Push Guide to Money'' and ''The Push Guide to Choosing a University'', but these are now out of print and their content has been updated, extended and incorporated into the Push website. In association with various sponsors, Push also conducts an annual tour of schools and sixth-form colleges, delivering guidance talks and reaching around 200 institutions each year.

==History==

Push was founded in 1992 by two brothers, Johnny Rich and Ben Rich, to publish the [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Polytechnic]] and University Student Handbook. It differed from other similar books because they did not give copy approval to the universities included and covered a wider range of concerns, particularly those relating to non-academic features of student life. The first edition of the book coincided with legislation that led to the transformation of all British polytechnics into universities, but the acronym was retained as the book had provoked considerable media interest. In particular, attention focused on what Push called 'flunk rates' (i.e. the proportion of students who dropped out or failed their courses), which were revealed in a comparative form for the first time.

The website was launched in 1996 and, shortly afterwards, Ben Rich left Push as his career in public relations demanded too much of his time.

Johnny Rich still manages the organisation as editor and is an acknowledged authority on university applications and student life and finance. He makes regular media appearances.

In 2005, Push became a division of [[Independent News &amp; Media]], publishers of [[The Independent]] newspaper. Push left The Independent in 2010 and merged with Real World, a print and online magazine providing careers information and advice for graduates.

==Research==

Push's research methodology is significantly different from similar resources such as [[league tables of British universities]] published by several UK newspapers. Although it uses publicly available data from [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]], [[National Student Survey]] and other sources, Push also originates most of its own research from a series of lengthy questionnaires sent to the universities and students unions and from annual site visits by Push's own research team to every UK university. These visits involve face-to-face interviews with students from the university.

This research is published in the form of detailed profiles of each university and in a number of statistical tables and top ten lists for individual criteria.

The following are among the statistics exclusive to Push:

* The Push Student Debt Survey: This is the largest annual survey of student debt in the UK that does not rely on self-selecting participants. Instead it surveys over 2,000 interviewees, including a minimum of 15 from each university. It is the only survey to provide a comparative breakdown of average student debts for each institution.
* The Booze Index: An index of average student drinks prices, based on the weighted cost of a pint of beer, a glass of wine and a glass of orange juice bought in the student bar and a local pub.
* Flunk rates: Based on [[Higher Education Statistics Agency|HESA]]'s 'non-completion' data, this table shows the proportion of students who do not successfully complete the degree courses on which they enrol.
* The Student Living Costs Survey: A weighted index showing the comparative costs of living and studying at each university in the UK, based on accommodation costs, entertainments and a basket of goods that a student is likely to buy.

Media attention is also often given to data published about sex ratios at each university, clearing rates (i.e. the proportion of student arriving through the [[UCAS]] clearing system), the availability and cost of housing, famous alumni and the provision of welfare.

Push has a stated opposition to the [[league tables of British universities]] and Johnny Rich has been outspoken on the subject on a number of occasions. Push's position is that "Any university ranking is based on what its inventors think is important, but their priorities may be a snail's hike from yours."&lt;ref&gt;See &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;http://push.co.uk/Document.aspx?id=7D721341-E65B-45B3-B9B2-124474259582&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to prove the point and provoke controversy, on [[April Fools' Day]] 2008 Push published its own alternative league table which used what it argued were more student-centred criteria and which featured very different universities at the top of the list. These included 
[[Lampeter University]] in first place and two institutions – [[Harper Adams University College]] and [[Bishop Grosseteste University College]] – which had only gained full university status in the past year. Neither [[Oxford University]] nor [[Cambridge University]] made it into the top ten.

==Trivia==

Push makes extensive use of interesting snippets of information about universities and student life. For example:

* [[University of York]] has the highest duck:student ratio of any campus in Europe.
* Push claims that the full name of [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] is The College of the Holy Trinity and the Most Blessed and Exalted Virgin St Radegund. This name is both incomplete and inaccurate—the actual official name is "The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund, near Cambridge".
* Staff and students at the [[University of Dundee]] rehearsed and produced ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' in 23 hours and 30 mins and now hold the world record for the fastest ever staging of a musical.
* [[The Archbishop of Canterbury]] is the only person in the country who can award degrees personally and, legally speaking, he is a university.
* Teaching staff at Southampton's Oceanography Centre include the appropriately-named Professor Roe, Mr Brine, Mr Fisher and Professor Herring.

'''Park Royal''' is an area in northwest [[London]], [[England]]. It is the site of the largest business park in London, occupying about {{convert|500|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.invest-in-the-uk.com/parkroyal.html |title=Invest in the UK Park Royal |publisher=Invest in the UK |accessdate=29 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060329233657/http://www.invest-in-the-uk.com/parkroyal.html |archivedate=29 March 2006 |df=dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Park Royal Business Park is promoted commercially by the [[Park Royal Business Group]] (PRBG) which is part of West London Business. Park Royal is partly in the [[London Borough of Brent]] and partly the [[London Borough of Ealing]].

Park Royal business park has over 1,200 businesses, employing an estimated 35,000 workers.&lt;ref name="BrentUDP"&gt;{{cite web | title= Chapter 13 - PARK ROYAL | work= Brent Council Unitary Development Plan | publisher= London Borough of Brent | url= http://www.brent.gov.uk/udponline/chapter13.html | format= [[HTTP]] | accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 500 food companies operate at Park Royal, employing more than 14,000 people.&lt;ref name="Wallop"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9090329/Londons-bread-basket-wrestles-to-keep-costs-down-as-even-foodies-cut-back.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wallop | title=London's 'bread basket' wrestles to keep costs down as even foodies cut back | date=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One third of all the food consumed in London is supplied by businesses in Park Royal.&lt;ref name="Wallop"/&gt;  Park Royal also has areas of residential housing and amenities serving them.

==Location==
[[File:Map of Park Royal, London.png|thumb|left|350px|Map of Park Royal Business Park ([[OpenStreetMap]])]]

To the north of Park Royal is [[Harlesden]] in the northeast, [[West Twyford]], an outlying area of [[Ealing]], in the northwest, and a [[Network Rail]] depot at [[Stonebridge Park, London|Stonebridge Park]] in the far north, which also has [[London Underground]] [[Bakerloo line]] tracks running through it (and [[Harlesden]] station nearby). On the eastern side, Park Royal is bounded by Acton Lane and Park Royal Road (B4492). The [[Central Middlesex Hospital]] is located here.

On the southern side beyond the arterial [[Western Avenue (London)|Western Avenue]] ([[A40 road|A40]]), which leads to the [[Hanger Lane Gyratory System]], is the Royale Leisure Park, which contains a cinema, restaurants, arcade and a bowling alley. There is also a B&amp;Q superstore, Renault and Nissan Car Dealerships, a Staples Superstore and other industrial buildings comprising the southern half of Park Royal. [[Park Royal tube station|Park Royal Underground station]], on the [[Piccadilly line]], is located just off Western Avenue. To the west of Park Royal is [[Hanger Hill]] and the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]] ([[A406 road|A406]]).

As well as many small industrial firms, Park Royal is the location of some large company buildings, including [[McVities]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedbiscuits.com/80256C1A0047922E/vWeb/pcTSTT5DWHZ7 http://www.unitedbiscuits.com/80256C1A0047922E/vWeb/pcTSTT5DWHZ7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624214113/http://www.unitedbiscuits.com/80256C1A0047922E/vWeb/pcTSTT5DWHZ7 |date=24 June 2007 }} ''unitedbiscuits.com''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]]. The old [[Guinness]] brewery and sports ground site at the south-western extremity of the district has now been totally demolished, however the rail sidings are still in use for aggregate freight traffic supplying the [[Lafarge Tarmac]] depot.  The first building erected adjacent to the new roundabout and bridge link to Western Avenue is occupied by international drinks company [[Diageo]], owner of the Guinness brand and the redevelopment site. The Female Health Company, which manufactures [[Femidom]]s, has one of its two manufacturing plants here, too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.femalehealth.com/theproduct.html#made http://www.femalehealth.com/theproduct.html#made] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050903121504/http://femalehealth.com/theproduct.html |date=3 September 2005 }} ''femalehealth.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grand Union Canal]] runs through the middle of the Park Royal industrial estate, with pedestrian access via the towpath.

==History==
The name Park Royal derives from the short-lived showgrounds opened in 1903 by the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]] as a permanent exhibition site for the society's annual show. After only three years the society sold the site, and returned to a touring format for its shows. With its road, rail and canal links, Park Royal was subsequently developed for industrial use, mainly during the 1930s.

[[File:Park Royal Guinness Brewery during demolition December 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|The Guinness Brewery Park Royal during demolition, at its peak the largest and most productive brewery in the world]]
For many years it was a centre of engineering, with firms including [[Park Royal Vehicles]], [[GKN]] and [[Landis+Gyr|Landis and Gyr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22549  | title='Acton: Economic history'| publisher=Victoria County History| work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 7: Acton, Chiswick, Ealing and Brentford, West Twyford, Willesden (1982), pp. 23-30 | accessdate=8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queens Park Rangers F.C.]] played on two grounds in Park Royal. The first was the Horse Ring, later the site of the Guinness brewery, which had a capacity of 40,000. When the Royal Agricultural Society sold the grounds in 1907, QPR moved to the Park Royal Ground, {{convert|400|yd}} south, an almost exact replica of [[Ayresome Park]], with a capacity of 60,000. The club was forced to move out in February 1915 as the ground was taken over by the [[British Army|Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Inglis|Inglis, Simon]]: Football Grounds of Britain, page 304. {{ISBN|0-00218426-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 1908, the first ever [[rugby league]] test match between [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] took place at the Park Royal Ground in front of 2,000 fans. The match ended in a 22-all draw and was played as part of the [[1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain|first ever]] [[Kangaroo Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/ashes-series-1908/game-1/england-vs-australia/summary.html Great Britain vs Australia 1908 at Rugby League Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
It is public policy to maintain Park Royal as predominantly a business area. It is designated as an Opportunity Area, and in 2008 the [[Mayor of London]]'s office published a draft Planning Framework which aspires to maintain, "growing economic clusters of food/drink, transport/logistics and television/film."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning/park-royal.jsp http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning/park-royal.jsp] ''london.gov.uk''&lt;/ref&gt; The framework does not preclude use of parts of the site for housing.

In summer 2011, the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham launched a Park Royal City plan for [[Old Oak Common]], based around the immediate eastern border of [[North Acton]], including light-rail lines to nearby areas.&lt;ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[File:Park Royal stn building.JPG|thumb|250px|Park Royal tube station]]

===Road===
Park Royal is served by the [[A40 road in London|A40]] and [[A406 road|A406]] roads, and is situated close to a major interchange called the [[Hanger Lane gyratory]].

====Cycle Network====
There is a proposal to build a [[List of cycle routes in London#Cycle Superhighways|Barclays Cycle Superhighway]] CS10 from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to Park Royal, which is under review by Transport for London.&lt;ref name=TfLCS10&gt;{{cite web|title=Barclays Cycle Superhighways / Routes &amp; maps|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/15832.aspx|work=TfL Website|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TfLCSMap&gt;{{cite web|title=Barclays Cycle Superhighways Indicative Routes Map|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/roadusers/barclays-cycle-superhighways-map.pdf|work=Transport for London Website|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Verwendung einer Elektrozange.gif|thumb|Cutting wire with diagonal pliers/side cutters]]
'''Pliers''' are a [[hand tool]] used to hold objects firmly, possibly developed from [[tongs]] used to handle hot metal in [[Bronze Age]] Europe.&lt;ref name=EB &gt;{{cite web|title=Hand Tools:Tongs, pincers, and pliers|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254115/hand-tool/39226/Tongs-pincers-and-pliers|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=Mar 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also useful for  [[bending]] and  [[Compression (physical)|compressing]] a wide range of materials. Generally, pliers consist of a pair of [[metal]] [[Lever#Classes_of_levers|first-class levers]] joined at a [[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] positioned closer to one end of the levers, creating short ''jaws'' on one side of the fulcrum, and longer ''[[Handle (grip)|handles]]'' on the other side.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; This arrangement creates a [[mechanical advantage]], allowing the [[force]] of the [[Grip strength|hand's grip]] to be amplified and focused on an object with precision. The jaws can also be used to manipulate objects too small or unwieldy to be manipulated with the [[finger]]s.

[[Pincers (tool)|Pincers]] are a similar tool with a different type of head used for cutting and pulling, rather than squeezing. Tools designed for safely handling hot objects are usually called [[tongs]]. Special tools for making [[crimp connection]]s in electrical and electronic applications are often called "crimping pliers"; each type of connection uses its own dedicated tool.

There are many kinds of pliers made for various general and specific purposes.

==History==
[[File:Kneifzange HH-Harburg.jpg|thumb|Medieval pincers found in Hamburg-Harburg (15th/16th century)]]
As pliers in the general sense are an ancient and simple [[invention]], no single point in history, or  inventor, can be credited. Early metal working processes from several millennia [[BCE]] would have required plier-like devices to handle hot materials in the process of [[smithing]] or [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]]. Development from [[wooden]] to [[bronze]] pliers would have probably happened sometime prior to [[3000 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Bellis, Mary. [http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blpliers.htm "The History of Hardware Tools"]. Inventors.About.com. Accessed 16 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the oldest illustrations of pliers are those showing the [[Greek god]] [[Hephaestus]] in his [[forge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |page=313|first=Francis |last=Warre Cornish|year= 1898|publisher=Spottiswoode &amp; Co. |location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vQwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA313#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of different designs of pliers grew with the invention of the different objects which they were used to handle: [[horseshoe]]s, [[fasteners]], [[wire]], [[Pipe (material)|pipe]]s, [[electrical]], and [[electronic component]]s.

==Design==
The basic design of pliers has changed little since their origins, with the pair of ''handles'', the ''pivot'' (often formed by a [[rivet]]), and the ''head'' section with the gripping jaws or cutting edges forming the three elements.

The materials used to make pliers consist mainly of [[steel]] [[alloy]]s with additives such as [[vanadium]] or [[chromium]], to improve strength and prevent [[corrosion]]. The metal handles of pliers are often fitted with grips of other materials to ensure better handling; grips are usually [[Insulator (electrical)|insulated]]  and additionally protect against [[electric shock]]. The jaws vary widely in size, from delicate [[needle-nose pliers]] to heavy jaws capable of exerting much pressure, and shape, from basic flat jaws to various specialized and often asymmetrical jaw configurations for specific manipulations. The surfaces are typically textured rather than smooth, to minimize slipping.

A plier-like tool designed for cutting [[wire]]s is often called [[diagonal pliers]]. Some [[Lineman's pliers|pliers for electrical work]] are fitted with wire-cutter blades either built into the jaws or on the handles just below the pivot.

Where it is necessary to avoid scratching or damaging the workpiece, as for example in [[jewellery]] and [[musical instrument]] [[repair]], pliers with a layer of softer material such as [[aluminium]], [[brass]], or [[plastic]] over the jaws are used.

==Ergonomics==
Much research has been undertaken to improve the design of pliers, to make them easier to use in often difficult circumstances (such as restricted spaces). The handles can be bent, for example, so that the load applied by the hand is aligned with the arm, rather than at an angle, so reducing [[muscle fatigue]]. It is especially important for factory workers who use pliers continuously and prevents [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].

'''Pride International, Inc.''' was an offshore oil drilling company headquartered in [[Houston]], Texas, the United States. With over 7000 employees, Pride provided contract drilling and related services to oil and gas companies worldwide. It had positioned its fleet to operate offshore with more than 50 units in five continents. Its largest operations included those in [[Angola]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Mexico]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prideinternational.com/fw/filemanager/fm_file_manager_download.asp?FileName=Pride08AnnualReport.pdf&amp;FilePath=/_filelib/FileCabinet/PDFs/2008/ Pride International Annual Report (www.prideinternational.com)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629062918/http://www.prideinternational.com/fw/filemanager/fm_file_manager_download.asp?FileName=Pride08AnnualReport.pdf&amp;FilePath=%2F_filelib%2FFileCabinet%2FPDFs%2F2008%2F |date=2009-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride spun off its mat [[Jackup rig|jackups]] as a public company called '''Seahawk Drilling''' in August 2009, so the company's focus is primarily deep-water drilling along with some high-spec jackups.

Effective from 31 May 2011, Pride International was acquired by [[Ensco plc]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12418">'''Professor John Perkins' Review of Engineering Skills''', also known as the '''Perkins Review''', was a 2013 report commissioned by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS) on engineering training and the skills shortage in the United Kingdom. Principally authored by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the BIS (Professor [[John Perkins (academic)|John Perkins]]), it made key recommendations for improving the training of British engineers and encouraging more entrants into the profession.  Key aspects it highlighted included the gender gap, with ten times more men employed in the profession than women, and the current reliance on foreign engineers.

== The report ==
The report was commissioned by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS) under the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron–Clegg coalition government]] and took two years to prepare.&lt;ref name=perkins/&gt;{{rp|1}}  The principal author of the report was Professor [[John Perkins (academic)|John Perkins]], the chief scientific adviser to BIS, and it was published in November 2013.&lt;ref name=perkins&gt;{{cite web |title=Professor John Perkins' Review of Engineering Skills |url=https://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/perkins-review-of-engineering-skills |website=Royal Academy of Engineering |publisher=Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–2}}&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burns |first1=Judith |title=Engineering gap 'constrains' economy |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24779016 |accessdate=6 September 2018 |work=BBC News |date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perkins' contract expired the next year and he left the BIS.&lt;ref name=man&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Victoria |title=Professor John Perkins: science of success |url=https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/professor-john-perkins-science-of-success/ |accessdate=6 September 2018 |work=The Manufacturer |date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1980 paper, the [[Finniston Report]] made a similar review of the state of the engineering profession in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=ETB |title=Engineering UK 2005: A Statistical Guide to Labour Supply |url=https://www.engineeringuk.com/media/1481/2005-engineering-uk-full-report.pdf |publisher=Engineering UK |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==
Perkins stated that an engineering skills shortage was hampering the country's recovery from the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  There was a  "substantial demand for engineers" and an undersupply which meant that 73% of manufacturing companies had reported a difficulty in filling engineering roles since 2010.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EEF appoints Professor John Perkins as engineering and skills adviser |url=https://www.eef.org.uk/about-eef/media-news-and-insights/media-releases/2016/may/eef-appoints-professor-john-perkins-as-engineering-and-skills-adviser |website=EEF (former  Engineering Employers' Federation) |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than half of the occupations listed in the British government's [[Work permit (United Kingdom)#Shortage occupations|tier 2 shortage occupations list]] are in engineering with a further 20% for allied scientific or technical roles.&lt;ref name=perkins/&gt;{{rp|12}}

The report showed that there was a failure to attract girls into the profession.  It stated that only 35% of 11–14 year-old girls would consider a career in engineering and only 24% of their parents would consider it a suitable career for their daughters.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;   This fed through into the older age groups – at further education level only around 15% of applicants for undergraduate engineering courses are women and only one in ten of British engineering professionals are female, the lowest proportion in any country of the European Union.&lt;ref name=perkins/&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;   Perkins stated that there was a lack of female role models from within the profession.&lt;ref name=man/&gt;  In press interviews accompanying the release of the report business secretary [[Vince Cable]] stated that "half of all state schools don't have a single girl doing physics".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kiss |first1=Jemima |title=Vince Cable says UK economy hampered by lack of female engineers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/04/vince-cable-uk-economy-female-engineers |accessdate=16 October 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=4 November 2013 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins showed that the profession was relying on immigrants to make up the skills deficit.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  The report stated that in some sectors such as oil and gas or aerospace immigrants accounted for 20% of professional engineering roles and that 32% of students studying engineering and technology in the UK were from overseas.&lt;ref name=perkins/&gt;{{rp|12}}

The Perkins report made 22 key recommendations for the government to address the skills shortage. This included working to promote the industry to girls, increasing the uptake of [[A-level]] physics, recruiting more physics teachers and introducing new vocational qualifications for 16-19 year olds.  He also urged the professional engineering institutions to work to promote the sector to young people.&lt;ref name=perkins/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

== Impact ==
Upon his retirement Perkins expressed confidence that the government had implemented measures to address the skills shortage.  This included providing additional university funding for [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] courses, to fund engineering research and to construct teaching facilities.  He also highlighted work done by practising engineers in schools and colleges to promote the subject.&lt;ref name=man/&gt;  As part of the response to the Perkins Review business secretary [[Vince Cable]] announced £49 million of funding for improvements to engineering education.  This included funding for the new [[Manufacturing Technology Centre]] in Coventry, schemes to encourage children to consider engineering as a career and for initiatives to encourage former engineers to return to the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=£49 million funding for engineering skills as Perkins Review published |url=http://www.manufacturingmanagement.co.uk/news/49-million-funding-for-engineering-skills-as-perkins-review-published |accessdate=16 October 2018 |work=Manufacturing Management |date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The funding was monitored as part of the government's  Employer Ownership Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=£30m fund to secure supply of engineers and boost number of women in sector |url=https://www.trainingjournal.com/articles/news/%C2%A330m-fund-secure-supply-engineers-and-boost-number-women-sector |accessdate=16 October 2018 |work=Training Journal |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further £2.8 million of funding, as part of the Improving Engineering Careers scheme, was announced in March 2015 to help six companies implement the objectives of the Perkins Review.  The companies, which included the Nissan plant in Sunderland, would match the government funding and implement schemes to train more British engineers and offer more job positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Government working with leading engineering firms to create pathway to specialist skills |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-working-with-leading-engineering-firms-to-create-pathway-to-specialist-skills |website=British Government |accessdate=16 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government will introduce the first [[T Level]]s, a new technical qualification for 17-18 year olds from 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Education Secretary announces first new T Levels |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/education-secretary-announces-first-new-t-levels |website=Gov.uk |publisher=British Government |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review was welcomed by many of the engineering institutions including the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]], the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] and the [[Nuclear Institute]] – many of whom highlighted their existing schemes to encourage women and young people into the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Institution responds to Perkins review on UK engineering skills |url=http://www.imeche.org/policy-and-press/press-releases/press-release-detail/institution-responds-to-perkins-review-on-uk-engineering-skills |publisher=Institution of Mechanical Engineers |accessdate=16 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IET welcomes Perkins' Review |url=https://www.theiet.org/membership/member-news/33a/perkins-review.cfm? |publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuclear Institute welcomes Perkins Review of Engineering Skills |url=https://www.nuclearinst.com/News/nuclear-institute-welcomes-perkins-review-of-engineering-skills |publisher=Nuclear Institute |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One key outcome from the report was support for the Tomorrow's Engineers programme, a national initiative to give every 11- to 14-year-old hand-on experience with a local engineering firm.  A year on from the report the programme had reached 50,000 school pupils in more than 1,200 schools.  Girls who participated in the programme were 50% more likely to see engineering as an attractive career choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bonino |first1=Erik |title=UK's engineering shortage must – and can – be fixed |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/11204563/UKs-engineering-shortage-must-and-can-be-fixed.html |accessdate=16 October 2018 |work=Daily Telegraph |date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after its publication the report was debated by the British [[House of Commons]] in a [[Westminster Hall]] debate on 10 December 2013.  Conservative MP [[Peter Luff]] advocated targeting campaigns at age groups even younger than the 11-year-olds proposed in Perkins' report, citing research from the [[National Foundation for Educational Research]] that intervention at primary school age was most effective – an opinion echoed by [[Meg Munn]].  [[Andrew Miller (politician)|Andrew Miller]] advocated a more joined up system of apprenticeships as a means of meeting the Perkins objectives.  [[David Mowat]] called for greater visibility of engineers in the media and noted that, unlike in Britain, in Europe engineers were held in higher regard – on a par with doctors.  He also noted that salaries were an issue with many engineering graduates entering other high-paid professions such as accountancy instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Engineering Skills (Perkins Review) – 10 December 2013 |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2013-12-10/debates/13121048000001/EngineeringSkills(PerkinsReview) |publisher=Hansard volume 572 |accessdate=16 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins carried out his own review on actions taken in the year following the publication of the report.  He noted the improvement in the standing of the profession brought about by the government funding of the Tomorrow's Engineers programme and the successful introduction of a "Tomorrow's Engineers Week".  He also welcomed the actions taken by 200 engineering companies to open up new entry-level engineering positions and to implement their own schemes to attract young people and women into the profession.  There was also an improvement recognised in the education sector with steps taken to fund scholarships to attract high-quality STEM candidates into the teaching profession but noted that there had been no progress in improving the uptake of A-level physics amongst female students.  At further education level it was noted that applications for engineering courses had increased by 6.1% over the previous year and recognised an increase of £385 million in government funding of science and engineering courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Engineering Skills: Perkins Review Progress Report |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/369566/bis-14-1164-engineering-skills-perkins-review-progress-report.pdf |publisher=Department for Business, Innovation and Skills |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Route capacity''' is the maximum number of vehicles, people, or amount of freight than can travel a given route in a given amount of time, usually an hour. It may be limited by the worst [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] in the system,&lt;ref name="dictref"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/route+capacity |title=route capacity |work=[[The Free Dictionary]] |accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a stretch of road with fewer lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=4653 |title=Military definition route capacity |work=[[Military Factory Definition]] |accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air traffic route capacity is affected by weather.&lt;ref name="mitair"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/aviation/wxatmintegration/wximpacts.html |title=Weather Impacts on Air Route Capacity |author=Lincoln Laboratory |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[Metro (rapid transit)|metro]] system, route capacity is generally the capacity of each vehicle, times the number of vehicles per train, times the number of trains per hour (tph). In this way, route capacity is highly dependent on [[headway]]. Beyond this mathematical theory, capacity may be influenced by other factors such as slow zones, single-tracked areas, and infrastructure limitations, e.g. to useful train lengths.

==Overview==

Any assessment of the effectiveness of a transport network includes a calculation of what capacity is used, how it is used, and whether it is used effectively. For instance, overloaded routes may need to be upgraded, or capacity provided by other routes. Unused capacity can represent an opportunity to move more people or goods: as the capacity exists no additional investment is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/archive/conferences/railworkshop/background-mcclellan.pdf |title=RailRoad Capacity Issues |accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many transport networks have unused capacity.

External factors affect route capacity in different ways. Severely overcrowded highways will reduce the capacity of bus services. Severe snowfalls will reduce the capacity of highways and freeways, and high winds will make landing and departing airports difficult. In many cases route capacity will vary day to day depending on external factors. Rail systems are more rarely affected by external factors.

Routes can become congested where only a fraction of routes can accept certain traffic types. For example, a road may have a low bridge that restricts the height of any trucks (lorries), or a rail line may be unable to accept wagons loaded beyond a certain axle load. This will result in any route that can accept a wider range of vehicles being congested, and other more restrictive routes be underutilised. Rail traffic between the US and Mexico is limited by the types of vehicles, especially grain wagons, and as 2009 the only routes that could accept newer rail wagons passed through Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automotive-fleet.com/article/story/2015/02/north-american-rail-congestion-causes-and-effects.aspx |title=North American Rail Congestion and Effects |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Traffic bottleneck|Bottlenecks]] play a large role in determining route capacity. Along any route the capacity is limited to the point with the lowest capacity, and long routes may have their capacity compromised by one bottleneck. Where more vehicles enter a route than a single bottleneck can accept, then the route will be free of congestion at all points except at the bottleneck. For this reason bottlenecks are often the focus of transport improvement projects.

==Application to railways==

Route capacity is often calculated and applied in the management and design of rail systems. For railways with very high passenger loads, the maximum possible route capacity is an important factor. A common unit for route capacity is people per hour (pph), which can for metro style systems can be as high as 80,000. Route capacity can also be expressed as number of vehicles per hour, such as 20 trains per hour (tph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technical.com/High%20Speed%20Railway%20Capacity%20v13%20conf.pdf |title=High Speed Railway Capacity |author=Piers Connor |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Route capacities in rail lines with two tracks are almost always the same in either direction.

The maximum speed or average speed of rail traffic will have no impact on the route capacity where all train services are of the same type, and the stopping patterns are the same.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Whilst slower trains will mean passengers take longer to reach their destination, the number of trains moving past a specific point will remain the same.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Route capacity at a particular period of time can be observed by an observer standing on a station platform. A slower rail system will require more [[rolling stock]] to maintain a high throughput of trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.dsic.upv.es/~msalido/papers/transport.pdf |title=An Assessment of Rail Capacity |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of traffic will affect the required headway between trains (it is not simply proportional to the speed) and will thus affect the route capacity.

In calculating route capacity it is important to consider practical considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/news/railzurich2009/Presentations/b1_kontaxi.pdf |title=An Assessment of Rail Capacity |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.dsic.upv.es/~msalido/papers/transport.pdf |title=An Assessment of Rail Capacity |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many railways will wish to operate at the maximum capacity for hours on any given day, and the theoretical capacity is not sustainable for more than a few trains.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} A reduced level of capacity, which can be maintained for hours, is often calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trafikdage.dk/td/papers/papers06/Trafikdage-2006-503.pdf |title=An Evaluation of Rail Capacity |date=2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A railway that operates at close to the level of theoretical capacity for extended periods will have lower punctuality (fewer trains arriving when timetabled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trafikdage.dk/td/papers/papers06/Trafikdage-2006-503.pdf |title=An Evaluation of Rail Capacity |date=2006 |page=5 |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Route capacity depends on the number of passengers using a system, if only because this will affect the length of station stops. Much of the route capacity in an existing rail system will be used for existing timetabled rail movements. This is described as used capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/news/railzurich2009/Presentations/b1_kontaxi.pdf |title=Techniques and methodologies for railway capacity analysis |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; What capacity remains to be allocated to additional trains is called available capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/news/railzurich2009/Presentations/b1_kontaxi.pdf |title=Techniques and methodologies for railway capacity analysis |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing route capacity for a rail system requires substantial investment in [[infrastructure]]. Increasing route capacity for a railway from, for example, 12 trains per hour, to 20 per hour, can be a very substantial project requiring substantial budgets.

Rail capacity is often less affected by the weather than route capacity for aircraft. However it can be affected by e.g. snow blocking the line, or by buckled rails at high temperatures.

===Calculating route capacity===

The are two main methods of calculating route capacity; using the method outlined in UIC 406, and by using headways. The [[International Union of Railways]] produces documents on a variety of rail related topics, and published a leaflet on rail capacity. This leaflet provides a method of calculating route capacity based on the creation of paths through a rail route. The number of paths for a "standard" train is created, and then the train paths added. The total number of trains that can potentially enter the route, and leave it, as well as the actual number, can then be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-research.org/IMG/pdf/326.pdf |title=Implementation of the UIC 406 method at the Austrian Railways |accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic formula for the calculation of a route capacity from a headway is:

{{NumBlk|:|'''&lt;big&gt;Route Capacity&lt;/big&gt;''' &lt;math&gt;=\frac{60}{Headway}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

For example, a headway of 4 minutes translates into a route capacity of 15 trains per hour.

===Reducing route capacities by mixing different types of rail services together===

Route capacity is maximised for any rail system when all the rail traffic is the same type. Mixing different types of trains, or even different stopping patterns, will result in a substantial reduction of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trafikdage.dk/td/papers/papers06/Trafikdage-2006-503.pdf |title=An Evaluation of Rail Capacity |date=2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where different types of trains are mixed together this is sometimes called heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trafikdage.dk/td/papers/papers06/Trafikdage-2006-503.pdf |title=An Evaluation of Rail Capacity |date=2006|page=5|accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context different types of trains means those that are slower than other trains, for example, freight and passenger trains. Freight trains often accelerate and brake more slowly than passenger, and have lower top speeds. Also passenger trains that have different stopping patterns, such as a local all stops service, when mixed with a limited or express service, will result in a reduction of route capacity. Route capacity is not lost where all the trains on one route stop at all stations, but only where trains with different stopping patterns are mixed together.

===Route capacities in different types of railways===

Rail systems vary greatly in performance and route capacity, with metro systems having the highest capacity. Tram and light rail systems have in theory very high route capacities, but in practice route capacities of 12 trains per hour is a practical upper limit. For High Speed Rail a route capacity of up to 18 trains per hour may be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technical.com/High%20Speed%20Railway%20Capacity%20v13%20conf.pdf |title=High Speed Railway Capacity |author=Piers Connor |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Punggol metro line in Singapore uses a moving block system to achieve a headway of 90 seconds, so the route capacity is 40 trains per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stee.stengg.com/pdf/railway_systems/Signalg-PSD.pdf |title=Signalling and Platform Screen Doors for Singapore MRT - The NorthEast Line |author=St Engineering |accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Route capacity for a [[Commuter railway|commuter rail]] system is typically around 12 to 16 trains per hour, which is lower than a metro, as the trains are longer, and the traffic is often mixed with other rail services such as freight and intercity trains. By contrast the [[Alameda Corridor|Alameda Freight Corridor]] in Los Angeles has a route capacity of 150 freight trains per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acta.org/projects/projects_completed_alameda_factsheet.asp |title=Alameda Fact Sheet |author=Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority |accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is high in comparison to other rail freight systems, but low compared to metros.

The route capacity of freight rail systems is often limited by the terminal to which the freight is heading. Large terminals will be able to accept more freight trains, but a route capacity of 15 freight trains per hour would be very unusual.

===Route capacities and stations===

Stations in a railway system, and where train are required to stop to pick up or drop off passengers, serves to reduce the route capacity. This is particularly the case where trains of different stopping patterns are moving one after another through a rail system. [[Terminal dwell time|Dwell time]], known as [[layover]] in the US, is the time taken from the opening of train doors at a station, to their closing again. Dwell times strongly influence route capacity in a rail system.

===Route capacities and moving block headways===

Many rail systems use a fixed block system for [[Railway signal|signal]]ling. [[Moving block]] represents a new type of signalling that allows the reduction of headways, and an improvement of route capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Double Railway Capacity without Building new Track |url=http://www.infrastructure-intelligence.com/article/jun-2014/how-double-railway-capacity-without-building-new-track |work=Infrastructure Intelligence |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving block is a signalling principle that exists within a signalling system called [[automatic train protection|automatic train protection]]. Many technical problems exist with the construction of any rail line that supports moving block, as this type of signalling system requires constant communication between signalling systems and trains, which is often achieved with a train radio system (but can be achieved other ways). Another problem is the signalling system needs to know the length of any train at all times, and so an engineering system is needed on all trains that can detect all carriages and wagons within the train.

During the [[Vietnam War]], Cohen argued that using small neutron bombs would end the war quickly and save many American lives, but politicians were not amenable to his ideas and other scientists ignored the neutron bomb in reviewing the role of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nautilus.org/VietnamFOIA/report/dyson67.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702090333/http://nautilus.org/VietnamFOIA/report/dyson67.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the ''Los Alamos Tactical Nuclear Weapons Panel'' in the early 1970s.

==="Clean" nuclear tests===
In 1956, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] announced the testing of a 95% "clean" (2-stage) fusion weapon, later identified to have been the 11 July ''Navajo'' test at Bikini Atoll during ''Operation Redwing''. This weapon had a yield of 4.5 megatons.  Previous "dirty" weapons had fission proportions of 50–77%, due to the use of uranium-238 as a "pusher" around the lithium deuteride (secondary) stage. This is deliberate; the fusion reactions give off large quantities of 14.1 M neutrons, which have more energy than then 1.1 MeV "fission threshold" for U238. This means the neutrons, which would otherwise escape, create fission reactions in the tamper, increasing the overall yield of the weapon essentially "for free".

The 1956 "clean" tests used a lead pusher, while in 1958 a [[tungsten carbide]] pusher was employed.  [[Hans Bethe|Hans A. Bethe]] supported clean nuclear weapons in 1958 as Chairman of a Presidential science advisory group on nuclear testing:&lt;ref&gt;http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1b/7374_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;certain hard targets require ground bursts, such as airfield runways if it is desired to make a crater, railroad yards if severe destruction of tracks is to be accomplished&amp;nbsp;... The use of clean weapons in strategic situations may be indicated in order to protect the local population.&lt;br /&gt;– Dr. Hans Bethe, Working Group Chairman, 27 March 1958 "Top Secret&amp;nbsp;— Restricted Data" Report to the NSC Ad Hoc Working Group on the Technical Feasibility of a Cessation of Nuclear Testing, p 9.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In consequence of Bethe's recommendations, on 12 July 1958, the ''Hardtack-Poplar'' shot of the Mk-41C warhead was carried out on a barge in the lagoon yielded 9.3 megatons, of which only 4.8% was fission, and thus 95.2% "clean".

In 1958, Cohen investigated a low-yield "clean" nuclear weapon and discovered that the "clean" bomb case thickness scales as the cube-root of yield.  So a larger percentage of neutrons escapes from a small detonation, due to the thinner case required to reflect back X-rays during the secondary stage (fusion) ignition.  For example, a 1-kiloton bomb only needs a case one-tenth the thickness of that required for 1-megaton.

So, although most neutrons are absorbed by the casing in a 1-megaton bomb, in a 1-kiloton bomb they would mostly escape.  A neutron bomb is only feasible if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, and if the yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons.  This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1–10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage).  The neutron output per kiloton is then 10–15 times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a W87 or W88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/395689.stm | work=BBC News | title=Neutron bomb: Why 'clean' is deadly | date=July 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Department of Defense manual on the neutron bomb===
Cohen's neutron bomb is not mentioned in the unclassified manual by Glasstone and Dolan, ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'' 1957–1977, but is included as an "enhanced neutron weapon" in chapter 5 of the declassified (formerly secret) manual edited by [[Philip J. Dolan]], ''Capabilities of Nuclear Weapons'', U.S. Department of Defense, effects manual DNA-EM-1, updated 1981 (U.S. Freedom of Information Act).

Under most atmospheric conditions no fallout effects would occur from the use of a neutron bomb, according to that manual, as the combination of 500-meter burst altitude and low yield prevents fallout in addition to significant thermal and blast effects. The reduction in damage outside the target area is a major advantage of such a weapon to deter massed tank invasions. An aggressor would thus be forced to disperse tanks, which would make them easier to destroy by simple hand-held anti-tank missile launchers.

Cohen's backing of investigations into these controversial ideas won him some media attention after many years of being ignored. In 1992 he was featured in the award-winning BBC TV series ''[[Pandora's Box (TV series)#To The Brink of Eternity|Pandora's Box]]'', episode "To the Brink of Eternity", discussing his battles with officialdom and colleagues at the RAND Corporation. Cohen controversially argued: "When we started this systems analysis business, we stepped through the looking glass where people did the weirdest things and (used) the most perverse kind of logic imaginable and yet claimed to have the most precise understanding of everything."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smmirror.com/Volume1/issue23/rand_and_the_city.html Santa Monica Mirror: RAND and the City: Part V&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged support from the Pope for low-yield tactical nuclear bombs==

At the time, [[Warsaw Pact]] forces had a massive tank superiority in Europe (though NATO maintained an overall strategic superiority); the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported in 1981 that there were "19,500 tanks in the Soviet-controlled forces of the Warsaw Pact aimed at Western Europe. Of these, 12,500 are Soviet tanks in Soviet units. NATO has 7,000 tanks on its side facing the 19,500."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harsch | first = Joseph C. | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Neutron Bomb: Why It Worries The Russians | newspaper = [[Christian Science Monitor]] | pages = | year = | date = 14 August 1981 | url = http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa015es.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deterrent which was designed to minimise civilian casualties was a step away from the risk of indiscriminate warfare. The neutron bomb's killing by neutron radiation is different from the fallout of a normal high yield thermonuclear weapon because it can be controlled more precisely, restricted to military targets and kept away from civilians.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The speed of modern warfare meant that the civilian population would be unlikely to be able to withdraw from combat zones and would suffer a large number of deaths in a nuclear war where the blast yields and fallout were significant. Because neutron bombs do not produce the indiscriminate blast (only 40 [[kilopascals]] at ground zero from a 1 kt blast yield detonation at 500 m altitude, and only 7 kPa at 2&amp;nbsp;km distance), heat, and fallout damage of other nuclear weapons, they were more credible as a deterrent to Soviet tanks. However, many people believed that the very deployment of the neutron bomb threatened an escalation to full-scale nuclear retaliation, thus canceling out the supposed benefits. Advances in precision anti-tank weapons ultimately made the neutron bomb redundant tactically in its original objective. The debate over "clean" low yield nuclear weapons continues with earth penetrator technology ("[[nuclear bunker buster]]s").

===Red Mercury claims===
More recently, Cohen was the main proponent of what most consider to be a mythical substance, [[red mercury]]. If the "conventional story" is to be believed, red mercury was a [[disinformation]] campaign led by US government agencies in order to lure potential terrorists into being captured. The story that was released was that red mercury was developed by the [[Soviet Union]] as a "shortcut" to a [[fusion bomb]], and that with the fall of the Soviet Union it was being offered on the market by the Soviet mafia. When prospective buyers showed up to take delivery of the material, they were arrested.

During the height of the story, in the 1990s, Cohen became a proponent of red mercury, claiming not only that it existed, but going further to claim that it was a powerful [[ballotechnic]] material that directly compressed the fusion fuel without the need for a fission primary. Bombs using red mercury had no real [[critical mass]] and could be developed at any size. He further claimed that the Soviets had produced a number of "micro-nukes" based on red mercury, which are described as being about as large as a [[baseball]] and weighing 10 pounds. According to Cohen, their existence meant that any effort to control [[nuclear proliferation]] based on fissile material was thus hopeless. A reiteration of the claim can be seen in ''The Nuclear Threat That Doesn't Exist – or Does It?'', by Cohen and Joe Douglass in an 11 March 2003 guest editorial in ''Financial Sense Online''.&lt;ref name=fse/&gt;

In a column for [[WorldNetDaily]], Cohen claimed that 100 of these mini-nukes were in the hands of terrorists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cohen | first = Sam | author-link = | last2 = Douglass | first2 = Joe | author2-link = | title = Realities of nuclear terrorism | publisher = WorldNetDaily | date = 8 November 2001 | year = | url = http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=25248 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later that [[Saddam Hussein]] had taken delivery of about fifty of these devices, which he supposedly planned on using against the US forces as they approached [[Baghdad]].

===Political involvement===
Cohen spoke at an April 2000 fundraiser in [[La Canada, California]], for then-[[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] presidential candidate [[Patrick Buchanan]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BUCHANAN+PROMISES+TO+PROTECT+BORDER.-a083411321 Buchanan promises to protect border]." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. April 30, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irv Rubin]] was prominently present at this event, with his organization, the [[Jewish Defense League]] (JDL), and with members of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], to protest. The JDL posted Cohen's home phone number and address on its website, urging its members to contact him, to persuade him to stop supporting Buchanan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Raimondo|Raimondo, Justin]]. "[http://www.antiwar.com/justin/pf/p-j061400.html Wild About Harry: Why I am not Voting Libertarian this Year]." ''[[Antiwar.com]]'' June 14, 2000. Accessed August 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her address to the 2000 Reform Party National Convention, Buchanan's running mate, [[Ezola Foster]], cited Cohen's endorsement of Buchanan to refute the claim that the candidate was [[anti-Semitic]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Ezola. "[http://www.gwu.edu/~action/fost081200.html Reform Party Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech]. August 12, 2000. Accessed August 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for Baptist pastor and author William P. Grady==
As part of a self-described unusual friendship, Cohen wrote the afterword to Dr. [[William P. Grady]]'s 2005 bestseller titled ''[[How Satan Turned America Against God]]''.  Cohen explained that although he was an unbelieving Jew, and thus could not relate to the spiritual content of the book, he concurred with Grady's grasp of America's disastrous foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Grady, William. [http://www.gradypublications.com/pdf/afterword.pdf How Satan Turned America Against God], Afterword, 2005."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
He died on November 28, 2010 in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles]], from complications of his [[stomach cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Robert D. McFadden]] |coauthors= |title=Samuel T. Cohen, Neutron Bomb Inventor, Dies at 89 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/us/02cohen.html?ref=science |quote=Samuel T. Cohen, the physicist who invented the small tactical nuclear weapon known as the neutron bomb, a controversial device designed to kill enemy troops with subatomic particles but leave battlefields and cities relatively intact, died on Sunday at his home in [[Los Angeles]]. He was 89. The cause was complications of stomach cancer, his son Paul said. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
On the DVD of film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' (which contains a fictional character loosely based on Cohen and the neutron bomb as a plot device), Cohen is interviewed in the commentary on the deleted scenes.  During the interview, Cohen  asserts that the neutron bomb conforms to [[just war]] theories.

'''Satellite delay''' is the noticeable [[latency (engineering)|latency]] which occurs due to the [[speed of light]], when sending data to and from satellites, especially the much further out [[geosynchronous satellite]]s.  Bouncing a signal off one geosynchronous satellite takes about a quarter of a second, which is enough to be noticeable, but relaying data between 2 or 3 such satellites increases the delay further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elbert |first1=Bruce R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9k5s2-mMKgC&amp;dq |title=The Satellite Communication Applications Handbook |publisher=Artech House |year=2004 |isbn=978-1580538084 |accessdate=2014-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Birmingham]] is one of England's principal industrial centres and has a history of industrial and scientific innovation. It was once known as '[[city of a thousand trades]]' and in 1791, [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] (the writer and commentator on British economic life) described Birmingham as "the first manufacturing town in the world".&lt;ref name="Revolutionary Players"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revolutionary Players|url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/default.asp?resource=2879|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right up until the mid-19th century Birmingham was regarded as the prime industrial urban town in Britain and perhaps the world, the town's rivals were more specific in their trade bases. [[Mill (grinding)|Mill]]s and [[foundries]] across the world were helped along by the advances in [[steam power]] and [[engineering]] that were taking place in the city. The town offered a vast array of industries and was the world's leading manufacturer of metal ware, although this was by no means the only trade flourishing in the town.&lt;ref name="Revolutionary Players"/&gt;

By the year 2000, of the 4,000 inventions copyrighted in the UK, 2,800 came from within a 35-mile radius of Birmingham. Peter Colegate of the [[Patent Office]] stated that "Every year, Birmingham amazes us by coming up with thousands of inventions. It is impossible to explain but people in the area seem to have a remarkable ability to come up with, and have the dedication to produce, ideas."&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=McIlroy|first=A J|title=Why Birmingham is mother of invention|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1379400/Why-Birmingham-is-mother-of-invention.html|accessdate=11 September 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 Dec 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the time line of industry and innovation listed below is extensive, it is by no means a comprehensive list of Birmingham's industrial and scientific achievements, more a guide to highlight the great diversity in the city's industrial might, which can still be seen today.

==Pre-17th century==

[[File:Deritendware Jug and Sherds.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Deritend ware]]]]Birmingham's reputation for trade and innovation really begins to take off in the 12th century with the expansion of a market held there by the [[De Birmingham family]]. Around this time the [[Birmingham Bull Ring]] begins to take shape, and with the town's markets there arises a necessity to produce items good enough to be sold elsewhere.

Medieval crafts in the town include [[textiles]], [[leather]] working and [[iron]] working, with archaeological evidence also suggesting the presence of [[pottery]], [[tile]] manufacture and probably the working of bone and horn. The following period sees the new town expand rapidly in highly favourable economic circumstances and there is archaeological evidence of small-scale industries taking place such as [[kiln]]s producing the distinctive local [[Deritend ware]] pottery.

The following decades, Birmingham becomes very productive in several trades [[metal working]], including making small, high value items, possibly [[jewellery]] or metal ornaments, for Master of the [[Knights Templar]]. They are sufficiently well known to be referred to without explanation as far away as London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holt|1986|p=8}}; {{Citation|last=Gooder|first=E. A.|title=Birmingham Pieces|journal=Transactions, Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeological Society|volume=88|year=1978|page=135|issn=0140-4202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Rogers - Willem van de Passe.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Rogers (Bible editor and martyr)|John Rogers]], the compiler and editor of the 1537 ''[[Matthew Bible]]'']]Birmingham's first notable literary figure is [[John Rogers (Bible editor and martyr)|John Rogers]], the compiler and editor of the 1537 ''[[Matthew Bible]]'', parts of which he also translates.

By the early 16th century Birmingham has already evolved into a well established arms manufacturing town, in 1538 churchman John Leialand passes through the Midlands and writes:

[[File:Nye-Almanacke.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Frontispiece of [[Nathaniel Nye|Nye]]'s ''New Almanacke and Prognostication'' for 1642]]&lt;blockquote&gt;''I came through a praty street or ever I entered Bermingham. This street, as I remember, is called Dirty (Deritend). In it dwells smiths and cutlers and there is a brooke that divides this street from Bermingham ........ There be many smiths in the towne, that use to make knives and all manner of cutting tools, and many lorimers that make bittes, and a great many naylours, so that a great part of the towne is maintained by smiths, who have their iron and sea-coal out of Staffordshire."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://rifleman.org.uk/Birmingham_Small_Arms_Co.htm |title=The Birmingham Small Arms Company |publisher=Rifleman.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Birmingham loses its [[Lord of the Manor]] in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pelham|1950|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the district as a whole remains an area of weak lordship throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2009|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; With local government remaining essentially [[Manorialism|manorial]], the townspeoples' resulting high degree of economic and social freedom is to be a highly significant factor in Birmingham's subsequent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2009|p=62}}; {{Harvnb|Pelham|1950|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saker.jpg|left|thumb|17th-century European [[saker (cannon)|saker]] [[cannon]]]]
In 1642 the early Birmingham mathematician and astronomer [[Nathaniel Nye]] publishes ''A New Almanacke and Prognostication calculated exactly for the faire and populous Towne of Birmicham in Warwickshire, where the Pole is elevated above the Horizon 52 degrees and 38 minutes, and may serve for any part of this Kingdome''.

Birmingham's principal tradesmen during the [[English Civil War]] were the smiths, who were called upon to manufacture over 15,000 sword blades, these are supplied to [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces only. One of the town's leading minds, 'Nathaniel Nye' is recorded as testing a Birmingham cannon in 1643. Nye also experimented with a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in [[Deritend]] in 1645. From 1645 he became the master gunner to the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] garrison at [[Evesham]] and in 1646 he successfully directs the artillery at the [[Siege of Worcester]], detailing his experiences and in his 1647 book ''The Art of Gunnery'', believing that war is as much a science as an art.

[[File:Snaphance Lock, External View, Cocked.png|right|thumb|External view of a cocked 17th century [[snaphance]] lock on [[musket]], a weapon Birmingham was selling to London.]]
The earliest known clock makers in the town arrived from London in 1667. Between 1770 and 1870 there are over 700 clock and watch makers in the town.

In 1689 Sir [[Sir Richard Newdigate, 2nd Baronet|Richard Newdigate]], one of the new, local [[Newdigate baronets]], approaches manufacturers in the town with the notion of supplying the British Government with [[small arms]]. It is stressed that they would need to be of high enough calibre to equal the small arms that were being imported from abroad. After a successful trial order in 1692, the Government places its first contract. On 5 January 1693, the "Officers of Ordnance" chooses five local firearms manufacturers to initially produce 200 "[[snaphance]] [[musket|musquets]]" per month over the period of one year, paying 17 [[shilling]]s per musket, plus 3 shillings per [[hundredweight]] for delivery to London.

==18th century==
1722: Richard Baddeley, [[ironmonger]], patents a method for "casting wheel streaks and [[Clothes pressing iron|box irons]]".

1727: Birmingham is becoming a hot-bed of creative activity and local businessman and bookseller [[Thomas Warren]] opens a bookshop in the Birmingham's High Street. Warren is an influential figure in Birmingham at this time.

[[File:Birmingham Journal 1733.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The only known surviving copy of the ''[[Birmingham Journal (eighteenth century)|Birmingham Journal]]'', dated 21 May 1733]]1732: The ''[[Birmingham Journal (eighteenth century)|Birmingham Journal]]'' is founded and published from Thomas Warren's book store. This is possibly Birmingham's first weekly [[newspaper]]; one of its contributors is the very notable [[Samuel Johnson]] of nearby [[Lichfield]].

1733: Thomas Warren edits and publishes Samuel Johnson's first original writing—a translation of [[Jerónimo Lobo]]'s Voyage to Abyssinia. Johnson works for the Journal while he lodges with Warren. Johnson later moves on to greater things and [[James Boswell]] writes of Johnson's life: "After nine years of work, Johnson's ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' was published in 1755; it had a far-reaching effect on Modern English and has been described as "one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship". The dictionary brings Johnson popularity and success. Until the completion of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' 150 years later, Johnson's dictionary is among the most influential dictionaries in the history of the [[English language]].

[[File:Waterframe.jpg|thumb|right| Model of a [[water frame]] inspired by [[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]]'s early [[cotton spinning mnachine]].]]
1738: [[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]], of Birmingham, patent the [[Spinning wheel|roller spinning machine]] and the flyer-and-bobbin system, for drawing [[cotton]] to a more even thickness, using two sets of rollers that travel at different speeds. This principle later becomes the basis of [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]].

1741: [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]], mechanic and inventor, designs and constructs a cart-weighing machine, later referred to as a [[compound lever]] [[weighing machine]]; the design works by way of levers that hold in place a platform, no matter where the weight is placed the load is transferred to a central lever. Weights attached to that lever then help in obtaining a reading of accurate weight. The simplicity, efficiency and accuracy of the weighing machine prove extremely popular across England, subsequently weighing errors are reduced to approximately one pound per ton, this remains a high standard of measurement into the mid-19th century.

1741: The [[Upper Priory Cotton Mill]] opens as the world's first [[Cotton mill|mechanised cotton-spinning factory]]. It is financed by local businessman [[Thomas Warren]], and opened by John Wyatt and Lewis Paul.

1742: [[John Baskerville]] takes out a patent for making [[metal]] [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], rolling, grinding and [[japanning]] metal plates by use of weights, rollers and pickling, which Baskerville uses over the more traditional method of employing screws. This is the first patent for making metal mouldings by passing them through rolls of a certain profile.

[[File:Restored carding machine at Quarry Bank Mill.jpg|thumb|left| A restored carding machine at [[Quarry Bank Mill]] in the UK.]]
1743: A factory opens in [[Northampton]], fifty spindles turned on five of Paul and Wyatt's machines proving more successful than their first mill. This operates until 1764.

1746: The Colmore family release land on what is later to be known as the [[Jewellery Quarter]] to help satisfy the demands of an increasing population.

1746: A [[Sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] factory is set up at [[Steelhouse Lane]] to use the [[lead chamber process]] invented by its co-founder [[John Roebuck]]. Roebuck and local businessman [[Samuel Garbett]] later relocate to [[Prestonpans]] in Scotland, taking with them several skilled men from the Birmingham factory. It is here in 1762 where Roebuck takes out a patent for making [[malleable iron]].

1748: Lewis Paul invents the hand driven [[carding]] machine. A coat of wire slips are placed around a card, which is then wrapped around a cylinder. Lewis's invention is later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright and [[Samuel Crompton]], although this comes about under great suspicion after a fire at [[Daniel Bourn]]'s factory in [[Leominster]] that specifically uses Paul and Wyatt's spindles. Bourn produces a similar patent in the same year.

1757: Rev John Dyer of Northampton recognises the importance of the Paul and Wyatt cotton spinning machine in poem:

[[File:Westley---East-Prospect-of-Birmingham-1732.jpg|400px|thumb|Birmingham on the cusp of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in 1732]]

:A circular machine, of new design
:In conic shape: it draws and spins a thread
:Without the tedious toil of needless hands.
:A wheel, invisible, beneath the floor,
:To ev'ry member of th' harmonius frame,
:Gives necessary motion. One, intent,
:O'erlooks the work; the carded wool, he says,
:Is smoothly lapp'd around those cylinders,
:Which, gently turning, yield it to yon' cirque
:Of upright spindles, which with rapid whirl
:Spin out, in long extent, an even twine.

[[File:Baskerville - Industry and Genius.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''Industry and Genius'', 1990, by David Patten, sculpture dedicated to [[John Baskerville]] in [[Centenary Square]]]]1757: [[Baskerville|Baskerville serif]] typeface is designed by [[John Baskerville]] (1706–1775) in Birmingham, England. Baskerville is classified as a transitional typeface, positioned between the old style typefaces of William [[Caslon]], and the modern styles of Giambattista [[Bodoni]] and Firmin [[Didot (typeface)|Didot]].

1758: Paul and Wyatt improve their Roller Spinning machine and take out a second patent. Richard Arkwright later uses this as the model for his [[water frame]].

[[File:Lunar Society.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting of the [[Lunar Society]] late 18th century, possibly at [[Soho House]]]]1758: [[Benjamin Franklin]] first travels to Birmingham "to improve and increase Acquaintance among Persons of Influence", and later returns in 1760 to conduct experiments with Boulton on [[electricity]] and [[sound]]. Franklin remains a common link among many of the early [[Lunar Society]] members.

1759: A patent is granted to Thomas Blockley ([[locksmith]]), for rolling [[iron]] into different forms and making (metal) wheel tyres.

1762: [[Matthew Boulton]] opens the [[Soho Foundry]] engineering works, Handsworth; his partnership with Scottish engineer [[James Watt]] makes the [[steam engine]] into the power plant for the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The term "[[horsepower]]" is coined by Watt.

[[File:Sohohouse1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Soho House]] from the front. The house is now a museum free to patrons under 16.]]
1765: [[The Lunar Society]] begins life as a dinner club and informal learned society of prominent figures in the [[Midlands Enlightenment]], including industrialists, natural philosophers and intellectuals, who meet regularly until 1813 in Birmingham. A paper read at the Science Museum in London in 1963 claims that "of all the provincial philosophical societies it was the most important, perhaps because it was not merely provincial. All the world came to Soho to meet Boulton, Watt or Small, who were acquainted with the leading men of Science throughout Europe and America." The Midlands Enlightenment dominates the
experience of the Enlightenment within England and its leading thinkers have international influence. In particular, it forms a pivotal link between the earlier [[Scientific Revolution]] and the later [[Industrial Revolution]], facilitating the exchange of ideas between experimental science, polite culture and practical technology that enables the technological preconditions for rapid economic growth to be attained.

[[File:Old bess steam engine 1777.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Old Bess (beam engine)|Old Bess]]'', as now preserved in the [[Science Museum, London]]]]
1767: A number of prominent Birmingham businessmen, including Matthew Boulton and others from the Lunar Society,&lt;ref name=p&gt;{{cite book |last= Paget-Tomlinson|first= Edward W.|authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The Illustrated History of Canal &amp; River Navigations|origyear=1978|year=2006|publisher= Landmark Publishing Ltd|isbn= 1-84306-207-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; hold a public meeting in the White Swan, High Street,&lt;ref name=sbcn&gt;''Smethwick and the BCN'', Malcolm D. Freeman, 2003, Sandwell MBC and Smethwick Heritage Centre Trust&lt;/ref&gt; to consider the possibility of building a canal from Birmingham to the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]] near [[Wolverhampton]], taking in the coalfields of the [[Black Country]]. They commission the [[canal engineer]] [[James Brindley]] to propose a route. Brindley comes back with a largely level route via [[Smethwick]], [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Tipton]], [[Bilston]] and Wolverhampton to Aldersley.&lt;ref name=p/&gt;&lt;ref name=hadfield&gt;{{cite book|author=Hadfield, Charles|title=Canals of the West Midlands|publisher=[[David &amp; Charles]]|location=Newton Abbott}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kick-starts what is to become the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]].

1770: James Watt applies the first [[screw propeller]] to an early steam engine at his Birmingham works, thus beginning the use of a hydrodynamic screw for propulsion.

1775: [[Ketley's Building Society]] is founded and becomes the world's first [[building society]]. [[Midland Bank]] (now owned by [[HSBC]]) and [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] are also founded in Birmingham.

1777: Boulton and Watt build '[[Old Bess (beam engine)|Old Bess]]', as described by the [[Science Museum (London)|London science museums]] 'an engine that stands at a crossroads in history'.

1779: [[James Keir]] takes out a patent for a compound metal that is capable of being [[Forging|forged]] when hot or cold more fit for the making of bolts, nails, and sheathing for ships prior to anything before. This metal uses the same compounds and similar quantities of metals as the [[patent]] of [[Muntz metal]], which appears at the same time.

[[File:Lloyds Bank, Five Ways, Birmingham.jpg|thumb|left|Birmingham became a town of commerce with two of the [[Big Four (banking)|big four]] banks founded in the town. [[Lloyds TSB|Lloyds bank]] was founded in 1765, the world's first [[building society]] [[Ketley's Building Society|Ketley's]] was founded in 1775, and [[Midland Bank]] (now owned by [[HSBC]] was founded in 1836). Pictured is the Edgbaston branch of Lloyds Bank, [[Five Ways, Birmingham]]]]
1779: [[Matthew Wasbrough]] designs and builds the [[Pickard Engine]] (first crank engine) for [[James Pickard]] of [[Snowhill|Snow Hill]], this is defined as 'the first atmospheric engine in the world to directly achieve rotary motion by the use of a [[crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[flywheel]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~historical.engines/pickard.htm |title=Steam Engines of the Eighteenth Century - The Pickard Engine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135427/http://www.btinternet.com/~historical.engines/pickard.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1779: James Watt patents a copying press or 'letter copying machine' to deal with the mass of paper work at his business; he also invents an [[ink]] to work with it. This is the first widely used copy machine for offices and is a commercial success, being used for over a century. This letter copying press is considered to be the original [[photocopier]].

[[File:Sun and planet gear science museum.JPG|thumb|right|Boulton &amp; Watt engine of 1788. The '[[sun and planet gear]]' (also called the 'planet and sun gear') was a method of converting reciprocal motion to [[rotary motion]] and was utilised in a reciprocating steam engine]]
1781: James Watt markets his [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotary-motion]] steam engine. The earlier steam engine's vertical movement was ideal for operating [[water pump]]s but the new [[engine]] can be adapted to drive all sorts of machinery. [[Richard Arkwright]] pioneers its use in his cotton mills and within 15 years there are 500+ Boulton &amp; Watt steam engines in British factories and mines. Boulton also arranges, in 1775, an [[Act of Parliament]] extending the term of Watt's 1769 patent to 1799.

1784: [[James Watt]] refers to a two-speed transmission in patent No. 1432, which relates to [[steam carriage]]s: The concept of changing speed (or a variable velocity) in [[Gear ratio|gearing]], which could arguably be the seed of thought for all subsequent gearing systems.

"Motion [from a steam engine] is communicated to the axle-tree of one or more wheels of the carriage by means of the "circulating rotative to machinery" formerly patented by the inventor. Two or more loose wheels of different diameters are placed to be locked on the axle and impart extra power for bad roads or steep ascents."

1785: [[William Withering]] publishes ''An Account of the [[Digitalis purpurea|Foxglove]] and some of its Medical Uses'', pioneering its use as a [[heart|cardiac]] drug, [[Digitalis]].

1785: James Watt and [[William Murdoch]] invent the [[oscillating cylinder]] and [[Double-acting cylinder|double action engine]]. Around this time James Watt creates a governor and [[throttle]] [[valve]] for automatically regulating the supply of [[steam]] to an [[engine]] although no patents for this are taken out by Watt.

[[File:MurraysMillsOldDeckerMill.jpg|thumb|left|The first steam powered [[Cotton Mill]]s such as this [[Murrays' Mills|Murrays']] Mill in [[Greater Manchester]] were powered by 40 hp Boulton and Watt beam engines. [[Richard Arkwright]] pioneered Watt's [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotary-motion]] steam engine in his cotton mills and within 15 years there were 500+ Boulton &amp; Watt steam engines in British factories and mines.]]
1788: Boulton and Watt build the [[Reciprocating engine|rotative steam engine]] also known as a [[piston engine]], an [[Watt steam engine#Later improvements|improved steam engine]] whose smooth reciprocating action enable it to drive a variety of rotary machinery.

1790: W. Richardson publishes ''The Chemical Principles of the Metallic Arts: designed chiefly for the use of Manufacturers'', which is used to help with diseases associated with the metal working industry.

[[File:Soho-mint-mark-cartwheel-2-.jpg|thumb|right|Soho mint mark on a cartwheel twopence. The [[Soho Mint]] pioneered mass production methods of coin manufacture around the world, with eight machines, driven by a steam engine, each capable of striking 70 to 84 coins per minute and worked by children.]]
1794: [[Ralph Heaton]] patents a steam powered machine for mass-producing [[button]] shanks. This is one of the earliest forms of mechanical mass production and steam powered machine tool operation.

Around this time William Futrell (a well known Birmingham [[pugilist]]) becomes publisher of possibly the first British [[boxing]] paper.

1797: [[Matthew Boulton]] erects at Soho a complete [[coining (mint)|coining]] plant with which he strikes coins for the [[Sierra Leone]] and [[East India]] companies and for Russia, and produces a new [[copper]] [[coin]]age for Britain. Also in 1797, he takes out a British patent in connection with raising water on the principle of the [[hydraulic ram]] although one of a similar nature appears in France at around the same time.

1799: The first [[bellcrank]] engine is patented by [[William Murdoch]] while working for Boulton and Watt. It is the first compact, self-contained engine.

Among the products [[Matthew Boulton]] seeks to make in his new facility are [[sterling silver|sterling]] [[silver plate]] for those able to afford it, and [[Sheffield plate]], silver-plated copper, for those less well off. Boulton and his father make small silver items throughout the 18th century, and there is no record of large items in either [[silver]] or Sheffield plate being made in Birmingham before Boulton does so. To make items such as [[candlestick]]s more cheaply than the London competition, the firm makes many items out of thin, die-stamped sections, which are shaped and joined together.
[[File:Birmingham Assay Office - Newhall Street - Birmingham - 2005-10-13.jpg|thumb|left|[[Birmingham Assay Office]] was fought for by Boulton and it changed the fortunes of [[silver]] making in the town and can still be visited today.]]
One impediment to Boulton's work is the lack of an [[assay office]] in Birmingham. The silver toys long made by the family firm are generally too light to require assaying, but silver plate has to be sent over 70 miles (110&amp;nbsp;km) to the nearest assay office, at [[Chester]], to be assayed and [[hallmark]]ed, with the attendant risks of damage and loss. Alternatively they can be sent to London, but this exposes them to the risk of being copied by competitors.

Boulton writes in 1771, "I am very desirous of becoming a great [[silversmith]], yet I am determined not to take up that branch in the large way I intended, unless powers can be obtained to have a marking hall [assay office] at Birmingham."

Boulton petitions [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] for the establishment of an assay office in Birmingham. Though the petition is bitterly opposed by London [[goldsmith]]s, he is successful in getting Parliament to pass an act establishing assay offices in Birmingham and Sheffield, whose silversmiths face similar difficulties in transporting their wares. The act is passed in March 1773, to grant Birmingham and Sheffield the right to assay silver.

1773: The [[Birmingham Assay Office]] opens on 31 August and the town becomes a leading manufacturer of all types of silver ware spanning three centuries. The Assay office can still be visited today by appointment and is situated near to the city's well renowned [[Jewellery Quarter]].

1793: "A gentleman of the name of Hand" in Birmingham obtains a patent for preparing flexible [[leather]] having a [[glaze (metallurgy)|glaze]] and [[Polishing|polish]] that renders it impervious to water and needing only be wiped with a sponge to restore it to its original lustre. This is later recognised as [[patent leather]] and is further improved by other inventors.

At some time around the late 18th or early 19th century a stand-alone cooking range or [[stove]] is invented by John Heard (joiner), capable of roasting, boiling, baking and of course heating a room. The products of combustion are carried off by means of a flue leading to the chimney, the inventor mentions it is particularly suitable for use on board ships. This is possibly the first of its kind, as earlier stoves such as the [[Franklin stove]] do not appear to have flues attached and require a hearth and chimney to function, also it is not until the turn of the 19th century that other stoves begin appearing for cooking as well as heating a room.

==19th century==

[[File:Gas lighting at Lincoln's Inn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gas lighting]] was pioneered in Birmingham, and subsequently spread around the world. Gas lamps were later replaced with electric fittings.]]
1802: The exterior of the [[Soho Foundry]] is lit with [[gas lighting]] by [[William Murdoch]]. Murdoch, its developer, worked for [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]] at Soho. This becomes the basis for Birmingham's immense gas industry, which incorporates many products and trades that rely on gas to work.

1811: [[Henry James]] takes out a patent for propelling vessels by steam, via a [[paddle wheel]] fixed in the middle of the stern and steered by two fins to relieve [[legger]]s from the arduous duty of pushing boats through canal tunnels.

1814: Thomas Dobbs (actor) invents a [[reaping machine]], which consists of a circular saw or sickle; the grain is drawn or fed up to the saw by means of a pair of rollers. This predates William Bell's [[straw cutting]] machine.

[[File:Cadbury's Cocoa advert with rower 1885.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Cadbury]]'s was founded in Birmingham and later became a household name in Britain, selling [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] based foods and drink and pioneering mass food manufacture techniques as well as major advances in the well-being of employees by providing homes and encouraging fitness through sport.]]
1821: Emanuel Heaton, [[gun finisher]], takes out a patent for a watertight pan for [[gun lock]]s.

1823: [[Francis Deakin]] improves a method of stringing the [[piano]] by employing the screw and nut as opposed to the previously used wooden peg, thus allowing a greater tension and strength of wire.

1824: American inventor [[William Church (inventor)|William Church]] patents a [[printing machine]] in his Birmingham works, which positions the paper sheets more accurately. He is a prolific inventor, taking out numerous patents for methods of button making, nail making, metal working, smelting iron, spinning and other branches of engineering.

1824: [[John Cadbury]] begins selling [[tea]], [[coffee]], and [[drinking chocolate]], which he produces himself, at Bull Street. He later moves into the production of a variety of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and drinking chocolates, made in a factory in Bridge Street and sold mainly to the wealthy because of the high cost of production. John Cadbury becomes a partner with his brother Benjamin and the company they form is called 'Cadbury Brothers of Birmingham'.&lt;ref name="birm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghamuk.com/cadburyhistory.htm |title=The history of Cadbury Schweppes |publisher=Birminghamuk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers open an office in London and in 1854 they receive the [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] as manufacturers of chocolate and cocoa to [[Queen Victoria]]. In the 1850s the industry receives a much needed boost, with the reduction in the high import taxes on cocoa, allowing chocolate to be more affordable to everybody. Cadbury's later becomes one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world and is still in production across the world today with a major production plant in [[Bournville]].

[[File:291-packag.jpg|left|thumb|230px|By the 1850s, [[Birmingham Pen Trade]] existed as a world centre for steel pen and steel nib manufacture; more than half the steel-nib pens manufactured in the world at this time were made in Birmingham.]]1828: [[Josiah Mason]] improves a cheap, efficient slip-in [[Nib (pen)|nib]] that can be added to a [[fountain pen]].

1830: With the invention of a new machine, [[Joseph Gillott|William Joseph Gillott]], John Mitchell and [[James Stephen Perry]] devise a way to mass-produce robust, cheap steel [[pen nib]]s. This boosts the [[Birmingham pen trade]] and by the 1850s, Birmingham exists as a world centre for steel pen and steel nib manufacture; more than half the steel-nib pens manufactured in the world are made in Birmingham. Thousands of skilled craftsmen and -women are employed in the industry. Many new manufacturing techniques are perfected, enabling the city's factories to mass-produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These are sold worldwide to many who previously cannot afford to write, thus encouraging the development of education and literacy.

[[File:Cutty sark detail.jpg|thumb|175pix|right|[[Muntz metal]] was used in maritime vessels such as the hull of the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'', Its original application was as a replacement for [[copper]] sheathing placed on the bottom of boats and is still used today for corrosion resistant machine parts.]]1830s: [[Thomas Ridgway]] begins trading in the [[Bull Ring, Birmingham|Bull Ring]], selling [[tea]]. Ridgway later goes bankrupt. Setting up business in London, he pays back all of his creditors and continues his tea trade, becoming one of the first English tea companies to hygienically prepack tea so as to avoid adulteration. In 1876, [[Queen Victoria]] commands House of Ridgways to create a blend for her own personal use.

1832: [[Muntz metal]] is patented, an [[alpha-beta brass]] with about 40% zinc and 60% copper. Its original use is as a replacement for the [[copper]] lining placed on the bottom of boats as it maintains the anti-fouling abilities of the pure form.

It costs around two-thirds that of pure copper and has identical properties for this application, it becomes the material of choice and Muntz makes his fortune. A notable use of Muntz Metal is in the hull of the [[Cutty Sark]].

[[File:HecetaHeadLighthouse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Heceta Head Light]]house in Oregon. The Chance Brothers [[Fresnel lens]], built in the early 1890s, is still in operation at this historic light station.

Another famous lighthouse [[Split Point Lighthouse]] in Australia uses a Birmingham-made Fresnel lens but the factory was bombed during war-time and the essential formulae for making the unique lens crystal were lost]]
1832: William Chance, owner of a Birmingham iron merchants, invests in his brothers failing glass works in nearby [[Smethwick]]. After saving the company, this partnership later becomes the [[Chance Brothers and Company|Chance Brothers]]. The company relies on local workers, and at one stage is known as "...&amp;nbsp;the greatest glass manufacturer in Britain", taking advantage of the Birmingham Canal Navigations and the Industrial Revolution in the region. Great advances in glass manufacture take place such as perfection of the earliest [[optical lens]]es to block the harmful [[ultra violet]] rays of the [[sun]] and improvements in [[lighthouse]] [[illumination (lighting)|illumination]]. The company is responsible for glazing the original [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] to house the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, and the [[Houses of Parliament]] (built 1840–1860). At that time it is the only firm that is able to make the opal glass for the four faces of the Westminster Clock Tower that houses the famous bell, [[Big Ben]]. The ornamental windows for the [[White House]] in America are also made at Chances.

Bird's custard powder later becomes famous around the world.

1838: Charles Green patents an original and unique method of producing solid, seamless [[brass]] and [[copper]] tubes, around this time much development takes place in Birmingham and [[Manchester]] with regard to copper tubing and printing plates.

1839: After many years of research, innovation and campaigning, [[Rowland Hill]] (of Kidderminster and later Birmingham) is given a two-year contract to run his new postal system. Hill is an English teacher, inventor and [[reform movement|social reformer]]. He campaigns for a comprehensive reform of the [[postal system]], based on the concept of [[Uniform Penny Post|penny postage]] and his solution of prepayment facilitates the safe, speedy and cheap transfer of letters. Hill later serves as a government postal official, and he is usually credited with originating the basic concepts of the modern [[postal service]], including the invention of the [[postage stamp]] (his brother [[Edwin Hill (engineer)|Edwin Hill]] helps the service with further innovations).

[[George Elkington]] and Henry Elkington found the English [[electroplating]] industry in the early 19th century. In 1840, they aid [[John Wright (inventor)|John Wright]], who discovers that [[potassium cyanide]] is a suitable [[electrolyte]] for gold and silver electroplating.

[[Carl Wilhelm Siemens]] has several meetings with George Elkington, and makes speeches on 'Science and Industry,' to the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute]], he later sets up a works in Birmingham and carries out experiments on metals and [[telegraphy]].

Stroudley spent seven years studying in Birmingham under [[John Inshaw]] before becoming one of Britain's most famous steam locomotive engineers.]]1845: During the late 1830s, canal steam boats begin operating with limited success but in 1845, Birmingham engineer [[John Inshaw]] builds the first [[twin-screw]] [[canal steamer]]s. Inshaw finds great success through his engineering and in 1859 the owners of the [[Ashby Canal]] ban his steamer "Pioneer", claiming it erodes the canal banks. It is later allowed to run no faster than 4&amp;nbsp;mph, thus begin speed limits on [[British waterways]]. Inshaw's "Pioneer" is successful and later inspires other steam boats such as those built for the [[Grand Junction Canal]]. Inshaw is also consulted by [[George Stephenson]] on the design of wheels for steam locomotives.

Stroudley later becomes one of Britain's most famous steam locomotive engineers of the 19th century, working principally for the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&amp;SCR). He designs some of the most famous and longest-lived steam locomotives of his era.

Birmingham [[glass]]works are among the early mass-producers of [[uranium glass]]. Manufacturers include Bacchus, Green &amp; Green (later [[George Bacchus &amp; Sons]]), Union Glassworks, in the 1840s, and Lloyd &amp; Summerfield in the 1850s, who are the first to use uranium in glass commercially.

1849: [[William Tranter]] takes out the first of many patents for his improvements in manufacture of the [[firearm]].

The use of weather charts in a modern sense begins in the middle portion of the 19th century. Weather map pioneers include William Charles Redfield, William Reid, Elias Loomis, and Birmingham's [[Sir Francis Galton]], who creates the first [[History of surface weather analysis|weather maps]] in order to devise a theory on storm systems.

Galton formulates (and later coins the term for) [[eugenics]] as well as [[questionnaire]]s and many important tools in [[statistics]]. Galton avidly supports the theories of his cousin [[Charles Darwin]], and also furthers the most important advances in [[fingerprinting]].

1851: [[John Nettlefold]], [[screw manufacturer]], attends the [[Paris exhibition]]. He later buys exclusive rights to use [[Thomas Sloan]]'s machine for making screws, which is in the show. With adaptation of the machine for their Birmingham premises and inspiration of Birmingham mass production methods, Nettlefold &amp; Chamberlain become Britain's leading screw-making firm.

1854: Birmingham [[chemist]] [[Thomas Allcock]] invents the porous [[plaster]] for the relief of pain in New York after fighting as a [[General]] for the New York Heavy Artillery during the [[American Civil War]] after emigrating in 1845 aged 20.

1857: [[Joseph Sturge]] buys the Elberton Sugar Estate and converts it into a lime production plant. The [[Montserrat]] Co. Ltd. is formed in Edgbaston by J.&amp; E. Sturge. Lime juice is produced in the city and then exported for use in the manufacture of [[citric acid]]. The failure of [[Sicily]]'s lemon crop at this time results in an opening in the market, which [[Edmund Sturge#The Montserrat connection|Sturge]] takes great advantage of utilizing their extensive [[chemical]] works based in Edgbaston. He also tries to prove that [[Free labour]] can be made profitable (the Sturge family are instrumental in the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|anti-slavery movement]]). A company is set up by the Sturge and Albright families who fund the development of [[Montserrat estates]] in 1867.

[[File:Film strip.jpg|thumb|left|[[Celluloid]] as a bulk material for forming objects was invented in 1856 by [[Alexander Parkes]], it was later described as generally the first [[plastic]] and is used in various subsequent inventions, most notably [[movie]] [[Film stock|film]].]]
The first [[celluloid]] as a bulk material for forming objects is invented in 1856 by [[Alexander Parkes]]. Many years later, and with the recognition of celluloid as a format for making photographic film, an American court declares Parkes as the true inventor of celluloid.

1862: the [[thermoplastic]] [[Parkesine]] is showcased at the [[World's Fair|Great International Exhibition]] in London. Invented by Alexander Parkes, this celluloid is credited by the [[London Science Museum]] to be "generally accepted as the first plastic". (This presumably refers to synthetic plastic formed into objects: it is predated by the 1848 [[collodion]], a [[nitrocellulose]]-based solution that dries to a celluloid-like film but is useless for industrial purposes, (as well as several natural plastics).

1862: [[James Moore Clements]] of Livery Street, who has already invented an improved machine for making [[buttonhole]]s, is granted a patent for a new arrangement of 'stitching the hole'.

1880: [[Gamgee Tissue]], a surgical dressing with a thick layer of absorbent cotton wool between two layers of absorbent gauze, is invented by [[Joseph Sampson Gamgee]]. It represents the [[cotton wool|first use of cotton wool in a medical context]], and is a major advancement in the prevention of infection of surgical wounds. It is still the basis for many modern surgical dressings. Gamgee also invents the [[aseptic technique]], a procedure that is performed under sterile conditions. This includes medical and laboratory techniques, such as with microbiological cultures. It includes techniques like flame sterilization. The largest example of aseptic techniques is in hospital operating theatres. J. R. R. Tolkien later bases [[Lord of the Rings]] character '[[Sam Gamgee]]' on this character as they live near to Mr Gamgee.

During the late 19th century, Birmingham companies such as [[Lucas Industries|Joseph Lucas &amp; Sons]] and [[Powell &amp; Hammer]] pioneered the production of [[Bicycle lighting|bicycle lamps]] and [[lantern]]s for ships, capitalising on the advances in using [[acetylene gas]].

1895: [[Frederick William Lanchester]] and his brother build the first petrol driven four-wheeled car in Britain. Lanchester also experiments with the wick [[carburetor]], [[fuel injection]], [[turbochargers]] and invents the [[accelerator pedal]] and first uses the [[pendulum governor]] for controlling the speed of a car engine. In 1893 he designs and builds his first engine (a vertical single cylinder) that is fitted to the first British [[motorboat]].

1895: [[Herbert Austin]], an employee at [[Wolseley Sheep Shearing Company]], becomes interested in engines and automobiles. During the winter of 1895–96 he makes his own version of a design by [[Léon Bollée]] that he has seen in Paris. Later he finds that another British group have bought the rights, therefore Austin has to come up with a design of his own.

Two years later, the second [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] car is revealed. It is a three-wheeled design featuring independent rear suspension, mid-engine and back-to-back seating for two adults. Four years later the Wolseley Gasoline Carriage is built featuring a steering wheel instead of a tiller. Austin manages the new Wolseley company for a short time before resigning to form his own concern, the [[Austin Motor Company]], in 1905.

The company is later merged in other motor car companies.

1896: The first [[radiography|radiograph]] used to assist in [[surgery]] is taken in Birmingham by the British pioneer of medical [[X-ray]]s, Major [[John Hall-Edwards]] thus kick-starting a whole new field of medical science.

1896: A new building is built in [[Corporation Street, Birmingham|Corporation Street]] to house [[James Henry Cook]]'s [[vegetarian]] [[restaurant]], one of the first in England. In 1898, '[[The Pitman Vegetarian Hotel]]', named after the famous vegetarian [[Sir Isaac Pitman]], opens on the same site, and the proprietors subsequently open a long-running [[health food store]].

1896: The first 'public' trial in Birmingham of a "horseless carriage" or motor car takes place at [[Cannon Hill Park]].

1897: [[John Benjamin Stone]] founds the [[National Photographic Record Association]], of which he becomes president. The [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] holds 62 of his portraits and many photographs of people and places in and around [[Westminster]]. His career culminates in 1911 with his appointment as official photographer to the [[coronation of King George V]]. Stone travels widely in pursuit of his hobby, taking 26,000 photographs, and writing books as he travels. He publishes works and invaluable records of the folk customs and traditions of the British Isles, which later influence photographers of note, such as [[Tony Ray-Jones]].

1897: [[Reynolds Technology|The Reynolds Tube Company]] patents the process for making butted bicycle tubes, which are thicker at the ends than in the middle, this allows frame builders to create frames that are both strong and lightweight. Reynolds continues to develop lightweight bicycle frames into the 20th century picking up many awards for wins in races such as the [[Tour de France]], the company still makes lightweight frames in the city today.

Bicycles have been manufactured in the Midlands (mainly Birmingham and [[Coventry]]) since the mid 19th century. By 1900 Birmingham has the largest number of bicycle makers and component manufacturers in Britain. Several advances in the development of the bicycle take place, one of the longer established high quality manufacturers being the '[[Quadrant Cycle Company]]' of Sheepcote Street, which later manufactures motorbikes (as do many cycle makers).

Other notable firms are [[Reynolds Technology|Reynolds]] (still manufacturing in the city), [[New Hudson (company)|New Hudson]], [[Rudge-Whitworth]] (also of Coventry), [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|B.S.A.]], C.W.S., [[Dawes Cycles|Dawes]], Grundle, [[James Cycle Co]], [[Ariel Motorcycles|Ariel]], [[Armstrong Cycles]], [[Phillips Cycles]], [[Excelsior Motor Company|Excelsior]] (originally of Coventry), [[Sun (motorcycle)|Sun Cycle &amp; Fittings Co]], [[Pashley Cycles]] (now manufactured in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]) and [[Hercules Cycle and Motor Company]].

Through the 20th century, many of Birmingham's bicycle manufacturers evolve into automobile and motorcycle brands, creating one of the busiest and most productive engineering hubs in the world.

1902: The first caliper-type automobile [[disc brake]] is patented by [[Frederick William Lanchester]] in his [[Birmingham]] factory and used successfully on [[Lanchester Motor Company|Lanchester]] cars. However, the limited choice of metals in this period means that he has to use copper as the braking medium acting on the disc. The poor state of the roads at this time — no more than dusty, rough tracks — means that the copper wears quickly, making the disc brake system non-viable. It is not until 1929, in the same city that manufacturers [[Girling brakes|Girling]] and [[New Hudson (company)|New Hudson]] further develop disc brakes, which are very successful on racing cars from the early 1950s to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powertrackbrakes.co.uk/ |title=Classic Car Parts - PowerTrack Ltd - Mail Order Supplier of Lockheed and Girling Brake and Clutch Components For British Car and Commercial 1935 - 1980 |publisher=Powertrackbrakes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girling brakes have the quirk of using [[natural rubber]] (later [[nitrile]]) seals.

Hopkinson builds a team of researchers, one of whom is [[Harry Ricardo]], the engineer who makes his name for his pioneering work on [[internal combustion engines]]. Hopkinson encourages Ricardo to work on engines.

1903: Brummie [[Francis William Aston]] wins a [[scholarship]] to the [[University of Birmingham]] and in his studies of electronic discharge tubes he discovers the phenomenon now known as the [[Aston Dark Space]]. He later moves to the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge]], where he uses a method of electromagnetic focusing to invent the [[mass spectrograph]], which rapidly allows him to identify no fewer than 212 of the 287 naturally occurring [[isotope]]s. His work on isotopes also leads to his formulation of the [[Whole Number Rule]], which is later used extensively in the development of [[Nuclear physics|nuclear energy]]. In 1922 he wins the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the invention of the mass spectrometer.

1905: A manually powered domestic [[vacuum cleaner]] is invented by manufacturer Walter Griffiths of 72, Conybere Street, Highgate. It is originally patented as 'Griffiths' Improved Vacuum Apparatus for Removing Dust from Carpets'. Although an electric cleaner is patented in 1901 by [[H. Cecil Booth]], Griffiths' design is more similar to modern portable cleaners than Booth's cart-mounted device.

1905: [[Herbert Austin]] begins making cars at [[Longbridge plant|Longbridge]], many improvements in mass car manufacture and production later arise from these car works. Seventeen years later the [[Austin 7]] goes into production, it becomes one of the most popular cars ever produced for the British market, its effect on the British market is similar to that of the [[Model T Ford]] in the USA. Austin's designs and production help set up other car brands around the world that later become famous in their own right, such as [[BMW]], [[Nissan]] and [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]].

1906: The earliest work on the [[parkerizing]] processes is developed by British inventors William Alexander Ross, in 1869, and by Thomas Watts Coslett, in 1906. Coslett, of Birmingham, subsequently files a patent based on this same process in America in 1907. It essentially provides an iron [[phosphating]] process, using [[phosphoric acid]]. Parkerizing (also called phosphating and phosphatizing) is a method of protecting a steel surface from corrosion and increasing its resistance to wear. Parkerizing is commonly used on firearms.

Several other small engineering firms design and build early aircraft engines such as [[Maxfield &amp; Co]], who test an early monoplane in 1909 at Castle Bromwich,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heath|first=Ref|title=modelflight.regheath.com|url=http://www.modelflight.regheath.com/earlybirds/1909frameset.htm|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Butterfield Brothers also make an experimental aircraft engine in 1911. Birmingham engineering works later diversify with all manner of industries relating to the development and manufacture of aircraft components including assembly of whole planes during war years such as [[Spitfire]]s, [[Hawker Hurricane]]s, [[Fairey Battle]] light bombers, Mercury and Pegasus aero engines, Short Stirling four-engined heavy bombers and [[Avro Lancaster]]s (towards the end of World War II).

1910: [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] begins to construct his first [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elfin tongue]] whilst a pupil at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]. He later calls it Qenya (c. 1915). Tolkien is already familiar with Latin, Greek, Spanish, and several ancient Germanic languages, Gothic, Old Norse and Old English. Tolkien's parents are from Birmingham and he himself grows up, and studies in and around Birmingham (Tolkien also meets his wife in the town and considers himself a 'West Midlander').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Ordelle G.|title=Looking westward|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AJ7RS6Ob_wC&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;ots=FfNsGkfi67&amp;dq=tolkien%20consider%20myself%20a%20west%20midlander&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=tolkien%20consider%20myself%20a%20west%20midlander&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enduring popularity of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' later leads to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by [[Tolkien fandom|fans of Tolkien's works]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/travel/escapes/23Ahead.html|title= Elvish Impersonators|work=The New York Times|date=23 March 2007|last=Gilsdorf| first=Ethan|accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works.

By 1927 Dunlop tyres have already helped [[Malcolm Campbell]] reach a British land speed record and in this year, they help Henry Segrave achieve the world [[land speed record]] in a [[Sunbeam 1000 hp]] at [[Daytona Beach Road Course]], USA. [[File:Telefunken electric appliance water boiling Oct-2011 HK.jpg|175px|thumb|right|The [[electric kettle]] has changed little since the invention of an immersed heating resistor and the safety valve both by Birmingham firms.]]In 1931 Dunlop tyres help [[Malcolm Campbell]] achieve a new [[land speed record]] in a [[Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird|Blue Bird]] at [[Daytona Beach Road Course]], USA. In 1935 Dunlop helps [[Malcolm Campbell]] achieve yet another new [[land speed record]] in the USA. [[Foam rubber]] is also invented at the Dunlop Latex Development Laboratories, [[Fort Dunlop]] in 1929. Dunlop continues to pioneer advances in tyre manufacture and becomes industry standard for many prestigious car makers and its tyres have been used, and continue to be used, on cars achieving victory in motor rallies and racing championships such as [[Formula 1]] and touring.

1923: [[Arthur L. Large]] invents the immersed heating [[resistor]], a major advancement in the [[electric kettle]]. A [[safety valve]] is introduced by kettle maker Walter H. Bullpitt, also from Birmingham, in 1931.
These two advances in electrical water heating are to have profound effects on water heating and become the basis of the modern day electric kettle.

[[File:Mellotron.jpg|thumb|left|The Birmingham-made [[Mellotron]] has played a vital part in popular music since the 1960s, being used by artists such as [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].]]
1962: Bill Fransen of American company Chamberlins brings two of their musical instruments to England to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlin keyboards. Fransen approaches a UK company that is skilled enough to develop the idea further and a deal is struck with Bradmatic Ltd. The first [[Mellotron]] sample keyboards are manufactured in Aston and are to enjoy great longevity in the music industry. Alongside the [[Hammond organ]], the Mellotron later becomes a seminal musical instrument for music genres such as [[rock music|rock]] and [[psychedelia]], it is also crucial to shaping the sound of the [[progressive rock]] and [[hard rock]] groups of the 1970s as well as inspiring further development of the sample keyboard, most notably the [[Fairlight (company)|Fairlight]], which, in turn, inspired sample modules such as the [[Akai Sampler]] range; synonymous with [[hip hop]] and [[dance music]].

Some of the more notable songs that make use of the signature Mellotron sound include [[Nights In White Satin]] by [[The Moody Blues]], [[Tomorrow Never Knows]] and [[Strawberry Fields Forever]] by [[The Beatles]], [[2000 Light Years from Home]] and [[We Love You]] by [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Hole In My Shoe]] by [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Mercy Mercy Me]] by [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Days (The Kinks song)|Days]] by [[The Kinks]], [[Space Oddity]] by [[David Bowie]], [[Stairway to Heaven]], [[The Rain Song]] and [[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]] by [[Led Zeppelin]].

==21st century==
Most of Birmingham's present day research and innovation is being undertaken in the fields of medical science, such as cancer research and eye disease research.

Since the establishment of its Nanoscale Physics Research Laboratory, the [[University of Birmingham]] has become one of the significant UK research centres for [[nanotechnology]].

[[Aston University]] is also carrying out groundbreaking research in the field of micro-technologies, including a micro-[[robotic]] drill for use in [[surgery]], which is able to drill a hole so small into the shell of an [[egg]], that the [[Biological membrane|membrane]] remains intact. This is being developed for use in operations on the [[inner ear]]. A project to use [[fibre optics]] instead of electric [[sensor]]s in aircraft [[fuel tank]]s is also being undertaken, cutting substantially the risk of sparks setting off an explosion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4075">In the graphical [[Workplace Shell]] (WPS) of the [[OS/2]] operating system, a '''shadow''' is an object that represents another object.

A shadow is a stand-in for any other object on the desktop, such as a [[document]], an [[Application software|application]], a [[folder (computing)|folder]], a [[hard disk]], a [[network share]] or removable medium, or a [[computer printer|printer]].  A target object can have an arbitrary number of shadows.  When double-clicked, the desktop acts the same way as if the original object had been double-clicked.  The shadow's context menu is the same as the target object's context menu, with the addition of an "Original" sub-menu, that allows the location of, and explicit operation upon, the original object.

A shadow is a dynamic reference to an object. The original may be moved to another place in the file system, without breaking the link. The WPS updates shadows of objects whenever the original target objects are renamed or moved.  To do this, it requests notification from the operating system of all file rename operations.  (Thus if a target filesystem object is renamed when the WPS is not running, the link between the shadow and the target object is broken.)

== Similarities to and differences from other mechanisms ==
Shadows are similar in operation to [[alias (Mac OS)|alias]]es in [[Mac OS]], although there are some differences:
* Shadows in the WPS are not filesystem objects, as aliases are.  They are derived from the &lt;tt&gt;WPAbstract&lt;/tt&gt; class, and thus their backing storage is the user INI file, not a file in the file system.&lt;ref name="OS/2WorkplaceShellAPI"&gt;{{cite book|title=OS/2 Workplace Shell API|author=Mindy Pollack|editor=Marc A. Stock|isbn=9780471038726 |year=1995|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus shadows are invisible to applications that do not use the WPS API.
* The WPS has no mechanism for re-connecting shadows when the link between them and the target object has been broken.  (Although where the link has been broken because target objects are temporarily inaccessible, restarting the WPS after the target becomes accessible once more often restores the link.)

Shadows are different from [[symbolic link]]s and [[Computer shortcut|shortcut]]s because they are not filesystem objects, and because shadows are dynamically updated as target objects are moved.

Shadows are different from [[hard link]]s because unlike hard links they can cross [[volume (computing)|volume]] boundaries and because their names are always the same as those of their target objects.

== Distinguishing marks ==
On (and within nested folders on) the WPS desktop, shadows' "icon titles" can be set to one's preferred font color, independently of the preferred font-color assigned to other non-shadow WPS objects, although they share the font actually selected for that text.

Like the icons for all other 'open' objects on the WPS Desktop, whether for folders or applications, Shadows' icons become diagonally hatched on 'opening' and remain in that state until closed/exited respectively.

== Managing shadows ==

There are several ways to create a shadow.  One way is to select the target object and choose "Create Shadow" from its context menu.  The desktop then prompts with a dialogue box allowing the user to specify where the shadow should be created**.  Another way is to employ [[drag-and-drop]] to create shadows, holding down the [[shift key|shift]] and [[control key|control]] modifier keys whilst dragging.

The dialog box opens initially with a view of currently opened folders on the "Opened" Tab (page) of the dialog, first of which is the current Desktop folder, allowing direct selection of the destination. There are a further 4 Tabs for "Related", "Desktop", "Drives" and "Path", this latter allowing textual path specification including drive(volume), whereas the other three options display an expandable hierarchical tree of folders to select from.

'''Sonicare''' is the brand name of an [[electric toothbrush]] produced by [[Philips]].

==Product and technology==
The brush head vibrates at hundreds of times per second, with the latest models at 31,000 strokes per minute or 62,000 movements per minute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:di1_aXxsgEgJ:www.ifa.philips.com/content/01-news/01-health-and-home/12-philips-mens-care-kit/Philips%2520Premium%2520Men%27s%2520Care%2520Kit%2520Press%2520Release_FINAL_30%2520Aug.pdf|title=Press Information - Philips IFA 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (258&amp;nbsp;Hz).  Rather than connecting to its charger with conductors, it uses [[inductive charging]]&amp;mdash;the charger includes the primary winding of the voltage-reducing transformer and the fat handle of the brush includes the secondary winding.  The replaceable head is also driven magnetically.

===Clinical research===
Individual clinical research has shown Sonicare toothbrushes to be more effective than comparable [[Oral-B]] electric toothbrushes in reduction of [[gingivitis|gingival inflammation]] and therefore improvement in [[periodontitis|periodontal health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A six-month clinical comparison of the efficacy of the Sonicare and the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes on improving periodontal health in adult periodontitis patients |journal=J Clin Dent |volume=8 |issue=1 Spec No |pages=4–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9487838 |doi= |url= |last1=Robinson |first1=PJ |last2=Maddalozzo |first2=D |last3=Breslin |first3=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a 2004 review of 29 studies concluded that only electric toothbrushes with rotational/oscillation movement removed more plaque than other brushes when correctly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Power toothbrushes: a critical review  |journal=Int J Dent Hyg |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=40–4 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-5037.2004.00048.x |last1=Penick |first1=Catherine |pmid=16451451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second review found no clinical evidence for the dynamic fluid activity of the Sonicare toothbrush being more effective in plaque removal than an Oral-B oscillating/rotating electric toothbrush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A review of the clinical efficacy of the Oral-B oscillating/rotating power toothbrush and the Philips Sonicare toothbrush in normal subject populations |journal=Int Dent J |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=429–37 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15633499 |doi= 10.1111/j.1875-595X.2004.tb00300.x|url= |last1=Warren |first1=PR |last2=Cugini |first2=MA |last3=Chater |first3=BV |last4=Strate |first4=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study comparing the two found the rotation/oscillation brush to be more effective in single-use plaque reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Clinical evaluations of plaque removal efficacy: an advanced rotating-oscillating power toothbrush versus a sonic toothbrush |journal=J Clin Dent |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=106–11 |year=2007 |pmid=18277740 |doi= |url= |last1=Biesbrock |first1=AR |last2=Bartizek |first2=RD |last3=Walters |first3=PA |last4=Warren |first4=PR |last5=Cugini |first5=M |last6=Goyal |first6=CR |last7=Qaqish |first7=J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional study showed that while both Sonicare and [[Oral B]] electric toothbrushes do better than manual toothbrushes in removing plaque, reducing gingival inflammation, and reducing probing depths, the Sonicare showed significantly more improvement than Oral B. The percentage reduction in inflammation from baseline at 6 months was 31.9% for Sonicare and 18.1% for Oral B. In regards to probing depth, Sonicare showed a mean reduction of 0.84&amp;nbsp;mm from baseline at 6 months, while Oral B showed an average reduction of 0.39&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A six-month clinical comparison of the efficacy of the Sonicare and the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes on improving periodontal health in adult periodontitis patients| pmid=9487838 | volume=8 | year=1997| journal=J Clin Dent| pages=4–9 | last1 = Robinson | first1 = PJ | last2 = Maddalozzo | first2 = D | last3 = Breslin | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual studies have shown that Sonicare toothbrushes are more effective in plaque removal and reduction in [[gingivitis]] compared to manual toothbrushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Professional brushing study comparing the effectiveness of sonic brush heads with manual toothbrushes: a single blinded, randomized clinical trial |journal=Clin Oral Investig |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=451–60 |date=August 2011 |pmid=20387085 |doi=10.1007/s00784-010-0411-0 |url= |last1=Pelka |first1=Anna-Kristina |last2=Nagler |first2=Tonia |last3=Hopp |first3=Imke |last4=Petschelt |first4=Anselm |last5=Pelka |first5=Matthias Anton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A randomized, parallel design study to evaluate the effects of a Sonicare and a manual toothbrush on plaque and gingivitis |journal=J Clin Dent |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=64–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18763689 |doi= |url= |last1=Moritis |first1=K |last2=Jenkins |first2=W |last3=Hefti |first3=A |last4=Schmitt |first4=P |last5=McGrady |first5=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1987, David Giuliani, an entrepreneur with a background in electrical engineering, met with University of Washington professors Drs. David Engel and Roy Martin. They formed a new company named [[GEMTech]] to promote a dental hygiene device using a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] multimorph [[transducer]]. After several years of research and creating prototypes, the Sonicare toothbrush was introduced in November 1992 at a periodontal convention.

In 1995, GEMTech changed its name to [[Optiva Corporation]]. In October 2000, Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care, a division of [[Royal Philips Electronics|Philips]], acquired the company. A few months later Optiva Corporation changed its name to Philips Oral Healthcare, Inc. By the end of 2001, Sonicare had become the number-one selling rechargeable power toothbrush in the United States.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sonicare.com/discover/sonicare_story/our_story.asp|title=Sonicare - Our Story|accessdate=2008-06-04|publisher=Sonicare.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, to improve Philips brand recognition in the US, Philips began rebranding the Sonicare toothbrush as "Philips Sonicare".

'''Thermionic emission''' is the thermally induced flow of [[charge carriers]] from a surface or over a potential-energy barrier. This occurs because the thermal energy given to the carrier overcomes the [[work function]] of the material. The charge carriers can be [[electron]]s or [[ion]]s, and in older literature are sometimes referred to as '''thermions'''. After emission, a charge that is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the total charge emitted is initially left behind in the emitting region. But if the emitter is connected to a battery, the charge left behind is neutralized by charge supplied by the battery as the emitted charge carriers move away from the emitter, and finally the emitter will be in the same state as it was before emission.

The classical example of thermionic emission is that of electrons from a [[hot cathode]] into a vacuum (also known as '''thermal electron emission''' or the '''Edison effect''') in a [[vacuum tube]]. The hot cathode can be a metal filament, a coated metal filament, or a separate structure of metal or carbides or borides of transition metals. Vacuum emission from metals tends to become significant only for temperatures over {{convert|1000|K|C F}}.

The term "thermionic emission" is now also used to refer to any thermally-excited charge emission process, even when the charge is emitted from one [[solid-state physics|solid-state]] region into another. This process is crucially important in the operation of a variety of electronic devices and can be used for [[electricity generation]] (such as [[thermionic converter]]s and [[electrodynamic tether]]s) or cooling. The magnitude of the charge flow increases dramatically with increasing temperature.

==History==
[[Image:EdisonEffect.svg|frame|The Edison effect in a diode tube. A diode tube is connected in two configurations; one has a flow of electrons and the other does not. Note that the arrows represent electron current, not [[conventional current]].]]

Because the [[electron]] was not identified as a separate physical particle until the 1897 work of [[J. J. Thomson]], the word "electron" was not used when discussing experiments that took place before this date.

The effect was rediscovered again by [[Thomas Edison]] on February 13, 1880, while he was trying to discover the reason for breakage of lamp filaments and uneven blackening (darkest near the positive terminal of the filament) of the bulbs in his [[incandescent lamp]]s.

Edison built several experimental lamp bulbs with an extra wire, metal plate, or foil inside the bulb that was separate from the filament and thus could serve as an electrode. He connected a [[galvanometer]], a device used to measure current (the flow of charge), to the output of the extra metal electrode. If the foil was put at a negative potential relative to the filament, there was no measurable current between the filament and the foil. When the foil was raised to a positive potential relative to the filament, there could be a significant current between the filament through the vacuum to the foil if the filament was heated sufficiently (by its own external power source).

We now know that the filament was emitting electrons, which were attracted to a positively charged foil, but not a negatively charged one.  This one-way current was called the ''Edison effect'' (although the term is occasionally used to refer to thermionic emission itself). He found that the current emitted by the hot filament increased rapidly with increasing voltage, and filed a patent application for a voltage-regulating device using the effect on November 15, 1883 (U.S. patent 307,031,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|inventor-first=Thomas A. |inventor-last=Edison |inventorlink1=Thomas Edison |title=Electrical indicator |country-code=US |patent-number=307031 |publication-date=November 15, 1883 |issue-date=October 21, 1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first US patent for an electronic device). He found that sufficient current would pass through the device to operate a telegraph sounder. This was exhibited at the [[International Electrical Exposition]] in Philadelphia in September 1884. [[William Preece]], a British scientist, took back with him several of the Edison effect bulbs. He presented a paper on them in 1885, where he referred to thermionic emission as the "Edison Effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William Henry |last=Preece |authorlink=William Preece |year=1885 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmdDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On a peculiar behaviour of glow lamps when raised to high incandescence |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=38 |issue= |pages=219–230 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1884.0093 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626213555/http://books.google.com/books?id=xmdDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2014-06-26 |df= }}  Preece coins the term the "Edison effect" on page 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Josephson&gt;

Fleming went on to develop the two-element [[vacuum tube]] known as the [[diode]], which he patented on November 16, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Provisional specification for a thermionic valve was lodged on November 16, 1904.  In this document, Fleming coined the British term "valve" for what in North America is called a "vacuum tube":  "The means I employ for this purpose consists in the insertion in the circuit of the alternating current of an appliance which permits only the passage of electric current in one direction and constitutes therefore an electrical valve."

The thermionic diode can also be configured as a device that converts a heat difference to electric power directly without moving parts (a [[thermionic converter]], a type of [[heat engine]]).

==Richardson's law {{anchor|Richardson's Law}}== &lt;!-- 'Richardson's law' and 'Richardson's Law' redirect here --&gt;

Following J. J. Thomson's identification of the electron in 1897, the British physicist [[Owen Willans Richardson]] began work on the topic that he later called "thermionic emission". He received a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1928 "for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him".

From [[band theory]], there are one or two electrons per [[atom]] in a solid that are free to move from atom to atom. This is sometimes collectively referred to as a "sea of electrons". Their velocities follow a statistical distribution, rather than being uniform, and occasionally an electron will have enough velocity to exit the metal without being pulled back in. The minimum amount of energy needed for an electron to leave a surface is called the [[work function]]. The work function is characteristic of the material and for most metals is on the order of several [[electronvolt]]s. Thermionic currents can be increased by decreasing the work function. This often-desired goal can be achieved by applying various oxide coatings to the wire.

In 1901 [[Owen Willans Richardson|Richardson]] published the results of his experiments: the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the [[Arrhenius equation]].&lt;ref&gt;O. W. Richardson (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAUPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On the negative radiation from hot platinum,"] ''Philosophical of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'', '''11''' : 286-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he proposed that the emission law should have the mathematical form&lt;ref name="Crowell"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J = A_{\mathrm{G}} T^2 \mathrm{e}^{-W \over k T}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the emission [[current density]], ''T'' is the temperature of the metal, ''W'' is the [[work function]] of the metal, ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is a parameter discussed next.

In the period 1911 to 1930, as physical understanding of the behaviour of electrons in metals increased, various theoretical expressions (based on different physical assumptions) were put forwards for ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, by Richardson, [[Saul Dushman]], [[Ralph H. Fowler]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] and [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim]]. Over 60 years later, there is still no consensus amongst interested theoreticians as to what is the exact expression of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, but there is agreement that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; must be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt; A_{\mathrm{G}} = \; \lambda_{\mathrm{R}} A_0 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is a material-specific correction factor that is typically of order 0.5, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a universal constant given by&lt;ref name="Crowell"&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = {4 \pi m k^2 e \over h^3} = 1.20173 \times 10^6\,\mathrm{A\,m^{-2}\,K^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' and &amp;minus;''e'' are the mass and charge of an electron, and ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]].

In fact, by about 1930 there was agreement that, due to the wave-like nature of electrons, some proportion ''r''&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt; of the outgoing electrons would be reflected as they reached the emitter surface, so the emission current density would be reduced, and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; would have the value (1-''r''&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt;). Thus, one sometimes sees the thermionic emission equation written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;J = (1-r_{\mathrm{av}})\lambda_B A_0 T^2 \mathrm{e}^{-W \over k T}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, a modern theoretical treatment by Modinos assumes that the [[band theory|band-structure]] of the emitting material must also be taken into account. This would introduce a second correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; into ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt; A_{\mathrm{G}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{B}} (1-r_{\mathrm{av}}) A_0 &lt;/math&gt;. Experimental values for the "generalized" coefficient ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; are generally of the order of magnitude of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but do differ significantly as between different emitting materials, and can differ as between different [[crystallographic face]]s of the same material. At least qualitatively, these experimental differences can be explained as due to differences in the value of ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.

Considerable confusion exists in the literature of this area because: (1) many sources do not distinguish between ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but just use the symbol ''A'' (and sometimes the name "Richardson constant") indiscriminately; (2) equations with and without the correction factor here denoted by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; are both given the same name; and (3) a variety of names exist for these equations, including "Richardson equation", "Dushman's equation", "Richardson–Dushman equation" and "Richardson–Laue–Dushman equation". In the literature, the elementary equation is sometimes given in circumstances where the generalized equation would be more appropriate, and this in itself can cause confusion. To avoid misunderstandings, the meaning of any "A-like" symbol should always be explicitly defined in terms of the more fundamental quantities involved.

Because of the exponential function, the current increases rapidly with temperature when ''kT'' is less than ''W''. (For essentially every material, melting occurs well before ''kT'' = ''W''.)

==Schottky emission==
{{Contradicts other|date=March 2013|1=Schottky effect}}
{{Main|Schottky effect}}
In electron emission devices, especially [[electron gun]]s, the thermionic electron emitter will be biased negative relative to its surroundings. This creates an electric field of magnitude ''F'' at the emitter surface. Without the field, the surface barrier seen by an escaping Fermi-level electron has height ''W'' equal to the local work-function. The electric field lowers the surface barrier by an amount Δ''W'', and increases the emission current. This is known as the '''Schottky effect''' (named for [[Walter H. Schottky]]) or field enhanced thermionic emission. It can be modeled by a simple modification of the Richardson equation, by replacing ''W'' by (''W''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;Δ''W''). This gives the equation&lt;ref&gt;

Electron emission that takes place in the field-and-temperature-regime where this modified equation applies is often called '''Schottky emission'''. This equation is relatively accurate for electric field strengths lower than about 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; V&amp;nbsp; m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

In this regime, the combined effects of field-enhanced thermionic and field emission can be modeled by the Murphy-Good equation for thermo-field (T-F) emission.&lt;ref&gt;

==Photon-enhanced thermionic emission==
Photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) is a process developed by scientists at [[Stanford University]] that harnesses both the light and heat of the sun to generate electricity and increases the efficiency of solar power production by more than twice the current levels. The device developed for the process reaches peak efficiency above 200&amp;nbsp;°C, while most silicon [[solar cell]]s become inert after reaching 100&amp;nbsp;°C. Such devices work best in [[parabolic dish]] collectors, which reach temperatures up to 800&amp;nbsp;°C. Although the team used a [[gallium nitride]] semiconductor in its proof-of-concept device, it claims that the use of [[gallium arsenide]] can increase the device's efficiency to 55–60 percent, nearly triple that of existing systems,&lt;ref&gt;

An '''underground power station''' is a type of [[hydroelectric]] [[power station]] constructed by excavating the major components (e.g. machine hall, penstocks, and tailrace) from rock, rather than the more common surface-based construction methods.

One or more conditions impact whether a power station is constructed underground. The terrain or geology around a dam is taken into consideration, as gorges or steep valleys may not accommodate a surface power station. A power station within bedrock may be less expensive to construct than a surface power station on loose soil. [[Avalanche]]-prone valleys often make a surface station unfeasible as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A K Raja, Amit Prakash Shriwastava, Manish Dwivedi|title=Power Plant Engineering|publisher=Digital Designs|pages=358–359|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ucHBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA358&amp;dq=underground+power+stations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fmfFVOvuNYa9ggTLxIH4Bg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=underground%20power%20stations&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], large [[hydroelectric]] power stations were placed underground more often in order to protect them from [[airstrike]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dandekar|first1=M. M.|last2=Sharma|first2=K. N.|title=Water power engineering|date=2010|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|location=Noida|isbn=0706986369|page=381|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4IXPNDYQJQC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=underground+power+stations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fmfFVOvuNYa9ggTLxIH4Bg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=underground%20power%20stations&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often underground power stations form part of [[pumped storage hydroelectricity]] schemes, whose basic function is to level load: they use cheap or surplus off-peak power to pump water from a lower lake to an upper lake. During peak periods (when electricity prices are often high), the power station generates power from the water held in the upper lake.

==Notable examples==
Some notable underground power stations are:

*[[Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Plant]] in [[King County, Washington]], [[United States]], built in two stages, Plant 1, completed in 1899 was the world's first completely underground power station and is still used to provide power to the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] area. The two power houses have a combined installed capacity of 53.9 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Project|url=https://pse.com/inyourcommunity/king/Pages/Snoqualmie-Falls.aspx|publisher=Puget Sound Energy|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urea perchlorate''' is a sheet-shaped crystallite with good chemical stability and strong hygroscopicity. It has usage as an [[oxidizer]] in [[liquid explosives]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liu|first1=Jiping|title=Liquid Explosives|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783662458464|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Underwater explosion|underwater blasting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|number = US3952655 A| title = Underwater blasting method and explosives and devices used therein| pubdate = 27 Apr 1976 | fdate = 26 Feb 1974| pridate = 27 Feb 1973| inventor = Masao Kusakabe, Shuzo Fuziwara, Kazuo Shiino
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==

The compound is synthesized by gradual addition of urea into a perchloric acid solution:

:CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

An alternative route is addition of urea to hydrochloric acid solution, followed by addition of sodium perchlorate, and filtration of the salt.

:NaClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl → CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The '''VHF Data Link''' or '''VHF Digital Link''' (VDL) is a means of sending information between aircraft and ground stations (and in the case of VDL Mode 4, other aircraft). Aeronautical VHF data links use the band 117.975–137&amp;nbsp;MHz assigned by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] to [[Aeronautical mobile (R) service]]. There are ARINC standards for [[ACARS]] on VHF and other data links installed on approximately 14,000 aircraft and a range of [[ICAO]] standards defined by the Aeronautical Mobile Communications Panel (AMCP) in the 1990s. Mode 2 is the only VDL mode being implemented operationally to support [[Controller Pilot Data Link Communications]] (CPDLC).

== ICAO VDL Mode 1 ==
The ICAO AMCP defined this Mode for validation purposes. It was the same as VDL Mode 2 except that it used the same VHF link as VHF ACARS so it could be implemented using analog radios before VHF Digital Radio implementation was completed. The ICAO AMCP completed validation of VDL Modes 1&amp;2 in 1994, after which the Mode 1 was no longer needed and was deleted from the ICAO standards.

== ICAO VDL Mode 2 ==
The ICAO VDL Mode 2 is the main version of VDL. It has been implemented in a Eurocontrol Link 2000+ program and is specified as the primary link in the EU [[Single European Sky]] rule adopted in January 2009 requiring all new aircraft flying in Europe after January 1, 2014 to be equipped with [[CPDLC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Data Link Services Implementing Rule
 | url = http://www.eurocontrol.int/link2000/public/standard_page/implementing_rule.html
 | date = February 21, 2011
 | accessdate = January 24, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In advance of CPDLC implementation, VDL Mode 2 has already been implemented in approximately 2,000 aircraft to transport ACARS messages simplifying the addition of CPDLC. Networks of ground stations providing VDL Mode 2 service have been deployed by [[ARINC]] and [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]] with varying levels of coverage.

The ICAO standard for the VDL Mode 2 specifies three layers: the ''Subnetwork'', ''Link'', and ''Physical Layer''. The Subnetwork Layer complies with the requirements of the [[ICAO]] [[Aeronautical Telecommunication Network]] (ATN) standard which specifies an end-to-end data protocol to be used over multiple air-ground and ground subnetworks including VDL.

The VDL Mode 2 Link Layer is made up of two sublayers: a ''Data Link'' service and a ''[[media access control]]'' (MAC) sublayer. The Data Link protocol is based on the ISO standards used for dial-up [[High-Level Data Link Control|HDLC]] access to [[X.25]] networks. It provides aircraft with a positive link establishment to a ground station, and defines an addressing scheme for ground stations. The MAC protocol is a version of [[Carrier Sense Multiple Access]] (CSMA).

The VDL Mode 2 Physical Layer specifies the use in a 25&amp;nbsp;kHz wide VHF channel of a modulation scheme called Differential 8-[[Phase-shift keying]] with a symbol rate of 10,500 symbols per second. The raw (uncoded) physical layer bit rate is thus 31.5 kilobit/second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = VHF air - ground Digital Link (VDL) Mode 2; Technical characteristics and methods of measurement for ground- based equipment; Part 1: Physical layer and MAC sub- layer|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301800_301899/30184101/01.03.01_40/en_30184101v010301o.pdf | publisher = ETSI | accessdate = June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This required the implementation of VHF digital radios.

== ICAO VDL Mode 3 ==
The ICAO standard for VDL Mode 3 defines a protocol providing aircraft with both data and digitized voice communications that was defined by the US FAA with support from Mitre. The digitized voice support made the Mode 3 protocol much more complex than VDL Mode 2. The data and digitized voice packets go in Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) slots assigned by ground stations. The FAA implemented a prototype system around 2003 but did not manage to convince airlines to install VDL Mode 3 avionics and in 2004 abandoned its implementation.

== ICAO VDL Mode 4 ==
The ICAO standard for VDL Mode 4 specifies a protocol enabling aircraft to exchange data with ground stations and other aircraft.

VDL Mode 4 uses a protocol (Self-organized Time Division Multiple Access, [[STDMA]], invented by [[Sweden|Swede]] [[Håkan Lans]] in 1988) that allows it to be self-organizing, meaning no master ground station is required. This made it much simpler to implement than VDL Mode 3.

In November 2001 this protocol was adopted by [[ICAO]] as a global standard. Its primary function was to provide a [[VHF]] frequency physical layer for [[ADS-B]] transmissions. However it was overtaken as the link for ADS-B by the Mode S radar link operating in the 1,090&amp;nbsp;MHz band which was selected as the primary link by the ICAO Air Navigation Conference in 2003.

The VDL Mode 4 medium can also be used for air-ground exchanges. It is best used for short message transmissions between a large number of users, e.g. providing situational awareness, Digital [[Aeronautical Information Management]] ([http://www.d-aim.aero/ D-AIM]), etc..

European Air Traffic Management modernization trials have implemented ADS-B and air-ground exchanges using VDL Mode 4 systems. However, on air transport aircraft the operational implementations of ADS-B will use the [[Mode S]] link and of [[CPDLC]] will use VDL Mode 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Airlines propose ADS-B implementation sites | url = http://www.eurocontrol.int/corporate/gallery/content/public/docs/pdf/pressreleases/2008/080221_ADS-B%20Deployment_Final.pdf | date = February 21, 2008 | accessdate = September 10, 2009 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
