The '''Academy of Performing Arts in Prague''' ({{lang-cs|Akademie múzických umění v Praze}}, '''AMU''') is a university in the centre of [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], specialising in the study of music, dance, drama, film, television and multi-media. It is the largest art school in the Czech Republic, with more than 350 educators and researchers, and 1500 students.{{cn|date=May 2017}} 

The academy consists of three faculties: a [[Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague|Film and TV School]] (FAMU); Music and Dance Faculty (HAMU); and [[Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts|Theatre Faculty]] (DAMU), offering Bachelor, Masters, and Doctoral level courses, as well as conducting artistic research, and in some departments also research in art history and theory.  AMU has two cross-faculty pedagogical facilities: a Languages Centre and a Sports, Rehabilitation and Movement Centre. The university also has two facilities outside Prague designed for residential multi-day creative projects.

== History ==
The Academy of Performing Arts was founded by a Presidential Decree of 27 October 1945, and opened to students the next year, in the winter semester of 1946. The establishment of the school was initiated by a group of artists and writers, including {{ill|Jindřich Honzl|cs}}, {{ill|Jiří Frejka|cs}}, and {{ill|František Troster|cs}}, during World War II. Professors of the older [[Prague Conservatory]] also supported the idea of transforming the former maestro school into a university. Writers, artists and other film-makers with practical experience in the film industry, including [[Jaroslav Bouček]], [[Karel Plicka]], [[Otakar Vávra]], [[Ivan Olbracht]], [[Vítězslav Nezval]], and {{ill|Antonin Brousil|cs}}, contributed to the school’s future curriculum, designing it to reflect new trends in post-war film development. Later the Film Studio and the DISK theatre, belonging to the Theatre Faculty, were added. The Opera Studio of the Music Faculty also uses the DISK theatre. When the medium of television emerged, the Film and TV School began offering study programmes for TV specialists. It also has a department with a still photography curriculum.

== Faculties ==
The Academy of Performing Arts consists of a [[Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague|Film and TV School]] (FAMU), Music and Dance Faculty, [[Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts|Theatre Faculty]], and a rector’s office. Besides the DISK theatre and Film Studio, the Academy's teaching facilities include sound and photography studios, laboratories, workshops, dancing and training halls. The [[Liechtenstein Palace (Malostranské náměstí, Prague)|Lichtenštejn Palace]], renovated in 1991, contains a grand concert hall dedicated to the Czech composer [[Bohuslav Martinů]] and the Inspirace theatre.

The Academy owns out-of-town practice and teaching centres in [[Poněšice]] and [[Beroun]]. The Study and Training Centre in Poněšice, South Bohemia, is situated on the [[River Vltava]] River, and is used for special training programmes, sports and language courses for students and other users. The Study, Training and Accommodation Centre in Beroun, 30 kilometres west of Prague, is used for training and study activities and workshops for DAMU, HAMU, FAMU and Studio FAMU. 

===Theatre Faculty (DAMU)===
{{main|Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague}}
The [[Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague]] (DAMU) was established in 1945 as part of the newly created arts university. Teachers at the faculty have included prominent personalities of [[Theatre of the Czech Republic|modern Czech theatre]] including [[Otomar Krejča]], {{ill|František Tröster|cs}}, [[Ivan Vyskočil]]. DAMU is a member of the [[European League of Institutes of the Arts]] (ELIA) and the [[European Network of Cultural Administration Training Centres]] (ENCATC).

===Film and TV School (FAMU)===
{{main|Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague}}
The [[Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague]] (FAMU) was established in 1946, as the world’s fifth university-level arts school with a programme in film education. At the end of the 1960s, a number of the school's graduates emerged as part of the [[Czechoslovak New Wave]] movement, including [[Věra Chytilová]], [[Miloš Forman]], and [[Jiří Menzel]]. Later graduates of the school to receive international acclaim included [[Agnieszka Holland]], [[Emir Kusturica]], and [[Jan Svěrák]]. FAMU is a founding member of the [[CILECT|International Association of Film and Television Schools]] (CILECT), and a member of ELIA and the [[European Grouping of Film and Television Schools]] (GEECT).

===Music and Dance Faculty (HAMU)===
The Music and Dance Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts ({{lang-cs|Hudební fakulta Akademie múzických umění v Praze}}; HAMU) was established in 1945 as one of the academy’s three components, as a successor to the master school of the [[Prague Conservatory]]. The school provides education in the fields of music and dance in Czech and English at Bachelor, Masters and doctoral levels. The faculty has 12 departments (the Departments of String, Keyboard, Wind and Percussion Instruments, Jazz Interpretation, Voice and Opera Directing, Musical Sound, Theory and History of Music, Conducting, Composition and Pantomime). The faculty also includes three research facilities: the Institute of Music Theory, the Institute for Dance Theory, and the Musical Acoustics Research Centre (MARC). HAMU is the organiser of the orchestral cycle "The Best" and the Skrznaskrz festival, which features collaborations between all three AMU faculties as well as other fine arts schools.

==Academics==
The academy runs bachelor, master, and doctoral study programmes covering Art of Music, Art of Dance, Art of Drama, Art of Film, TV and Photography, and New Media. Bachelor study programmes usually last three years and students receive Bachelor of Arts degrees (BcA). Master study programmes usually take two further years. After passing the state examination, students receive Master of Arts degrees (MgA). Doctoral study programmes are established at all the faculties. On passing a doctoral examination and presenting a doctoral theses, students are awarded doctorates (Ph.D). The academy offers other special courses outside the regular university study programme, some of which can be used as credit.

Students at the academy are only accepted after completing secondary school education and successfully passing entrance exams. Each faculty has its own
requirements for the entrance exams.

The official language of instruction of the course units is [[Czech language|Czech]], but each faculty offers some degree programs in English. A limited number of short-term courses are taught in English or in German, and for others a preparatory course in Czech is necessary.

==Facilities and student services==
AMU has a library with more than 180,000 volumes of academic literature, sound recordings and audio-visual works, and students are also entitled to use other libraries free of charge, such as the University library and the library of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Students of the academy have free or discounted entry to some cultural events, such as theatre performances, concerts, exhibitions, lectures and films. The academy has co-operative links with other schools in the Czech Republic and internationally, which include artistic competitions, festivals, and reciprocal exchange performances.

AMU's facilities include theatres, film and television studios, and concert halls. A university publishing service, AMU Press (NAMU), publishes literature about AMU artistic activities. The final projects of students studying disciplines with a significant graphic component are exhibited in the AMU Gallery (GAMU), which also hosts one-off thematic exhibitions. AMU has two halls of residence: one on Hradební Street in the centre of Prague, reconstructed in the academic year 2006/07, and another on the southern outskirts of Prague. The academy's Language Centre provides classes in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian and Czech for students and employees. The AMU Sports, Rehabilitation and Movement Centre organises various sports activities for students.

[[Image:Missel dominicain MG 2113.jpg|thumb|[[Dominican Rite|Dominican]] [[Missal]], c. 1240, giving a portion of the ''Accentus'' (Historical Museum of [[Lausanne]]).]]

'''Accentus''' (or '''Accentus Ecclesiasticus'''; '''Ecclesiastical accent''') is a style of [[church music]] that emphasizes spoken word. It is often contrasted with ''concentus'', an alternative style that emphasizes harmony. The terms ''accentus'' and ''concentus'' were probably introduced by Andreas Ornithoparchus in his ''Musicae Activae Micrologus'', Leipzig, 1517.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, Willi, ed. ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Musical forms Ernst Pauer - 1878  ECCLESIASTICAL ACCENT.* "In Plain-song, the term 'accent' or accentus ecclesiasticus was used to designate that system of movement of the voice, by learning the principles of which (modus legendi choraliter) a chanter could read ...&lt;/ref&gt; "''Concentus'' might be chief ruler over all things that are sung...and ''Accentus'' over all things that are read," according to Ornithoparchus.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, Samuel Cheetham, ''Encyclopaedic Dictionary Of Christian Antiquities'', "Accentus ecclesiasticus", p. 11. Concept Publishing Company, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The style is also known as '''liturgical recitative''', though it differs in some important ways from other types of [[recitative]].

In the medieval church, all that portion of the liturgical song which was performed by the entire [[choir]], or by sections of it, was called ''concentus''; thus [[hymn]]s, [[psalm]]s, [[mass ordinary]], and [[alleluia]]s were, generally speaking, included under this term, as well as anything with more complex or distinctive melodic contours. On the other hand, such parts of the liturgy which the [[priest]], the [[deacon]], the [[subdeacon]], or the [[acolyte]] sang alone were called ''accentus''; such were the [[collect]]s, the [[epistle]] and [[gospel]], the [[Preface (Liturgy)|preface]], or anything which was recited chiefly on one tone, rather than sung, by the priest or one of his assistants. The accentus should never be accompanied by harmonies, whether of voices or of instruments, although the concentus may receive such accompaniment. The intoning words ''Gloria in excelsis Deo'' and ''Credo in Unum Deum'', being assigned to the celebrant alone, should not be repeated by the choir or accompanied by the [[pipe organ|organ]] or other [[musical instrument]].

There were originally seven types of ''Accentus Ecclesiasticus'', depending on how the voice should be inflected at the punctuation marks ending phrases or sentences. In ''accentus immutabilis'', the voice remains at the same tone; in ''accentus medus'' it falls by a third at a colon; in ''accentus gravis'' it falls by a fifth at a period; in ''accentus actus'' it falls by a third and returns to the original tone at a comma; in ''accentus moderatus'' it rises by a second and returns to the original tone at a comma; in ''accentus interrogata'' it falls by a second and returns to the original tone at a question mark; and in ''accentus finalis'', it rises by a second and then falls stepwise to a fourth below the original tone at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = W. L. Hubbard | title = accentus ecclesiastici | encyclopedia = Musical Dictionary | year = 1908 | pages = 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2lE5AAAAIAAJ | publisher = Irving Squire}} (Digital edition by Google Books; also republished 2006 by Adamant Media as {{ISBN|0-543-90764-3}}.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Margaret Pomeranz.jpg|thumb|right|Host Margaret Pomeranz]]
[[File:David Stratton.jpg|thumb|right|Host David Stratton]]

==History==
The program, which began in mid-[[2004 in Australian television|2004]], is a continuation of the pair's earlier program ''[[The Movie Show]]'', which aired on [[SBS One]] from 1986 to 2004. The pair left SBS after expressing dissatisfaction with high-level decisions.

The weekly half-hour program consists of film reviews and discussions as well as interviews with cast and crew members. The hosts also occasionally broadcast from film events such as the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

The pair's 25 years of presenting film reviews on television was celebrated in a special show on 26 October 2011, filmed before an audience and special guests, hosted by [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/the-david-and-margaret-show/story-e6frg8n6-1226163130634 "The David and Margaret show"] by [[Graeme Blundell]], ''[[The Australian]]'' (15 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2014, Stratton and Pomeranz announced they would be retiring at the end of the 2014 series. The final episode aired on 9 December 2014&lt;ref name=retirement&gt;{{cite news|title=Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton roll end credits on 28-year film review partnership; ''At The Movies'' will not return to ABC in 2015|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-16/margaret-pomeranz-and-david-stratton-roll-end-credits/5747214|accessdate=16 September 2014|publisher=ABC News|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stratton and Pomeranz said farewell to over 700,000 viewers, making it one of the most watched season finales on the ABC in the history of the station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mumbrella.com.au/movies-wraps-726000-metro-viewers-267062 "At The Movies wraps with bumper 726,000 metro viewers"] by Dan Robbins, ''Mumbrella'' (5 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Australian rules football]]''' has been played in '''[[People's Republic of China|China]]''' since the 1990s. Interest in Australian football in China received a boost after the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], the premier professional football competition in [[Australia]], invested in an AFL exhibition match in Shanghai in 2010, an AFL academy in 2011, and built a dedicated AFL oval in Tianjin in 2011.

==Senior clubs==

===Guangzhou===
The Guangzhou Scorpions Australian expatriate team was formed in 2010, playing matches against the Hong Kong Dragons and Macau Lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hk-dragons.com/index.php/blog/2010/12/12/dragons-finish-season-on-a-high/ |title=Dragons Finish Season on a High |work=Hong Kong Dragons |first=Paul |last=Mallia |date=12 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711172206/http://www.hk-dragons.com/index.php/blog/2010/12/12/dragons-finish-season-on-a-high/ |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The Hong Kong Dragons Australian expatriate team was formed in 1990, and have been one of Asia's most successful Australian rules football clubs since this time.  The Dragons play against other Asian teams regularly and have competed at all [[Asian Australian Football Championships]] to date.

Auskick, the Australian football program for juniors, grew in the early 2000's after two Victorian expatriate families managed to secure official support and equipment from the AFL in Australia. Players trained at the iconic grounds at Happy Valley as well as the Australian International School Hong Kong (AISHK).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/article/594722/australian-football-gathers-steam&lt;/ref&gt;

A second Australian expatriate team in the [[Pokfulam]] region of Hong Kong was in existence in 2010, playing as the Pokfulam Vikings and conducting some matches against the Dragons.&lt;ref name=HKMac&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20100505112623218 |title=First Hong Kong-Macau local derby this weekend |work=World Footy News |date=6 May 2010 |first=Aaron |last=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tianjin===
The sister city relationship between [[Tianjin]] and [[Melbourne]] saw the beginnings of football development in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20050919055630735 |title=Melbourne link to China development |work=World Footy News |date=19 September 2005 |first=Peter |last=Parry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2007, a development organisation called the AFL China had been formed, with [[Tianjin Normal University]] having two Australian football teams at its main campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20071121172019646 |title=Beijing defeat Shanghai and Tianjin found second team in big week for Chinese footy |work=World Footy News |date=21 November 2007 |first=Aaron |last=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese community in Australia==
[[File:Image-koochew1908.jpg|thumb|right|Wally Koochew of Carlton]]
[[Chinese Australians]] have been playing Australian rules football since the late 19th century. The [[Ballarat]] [[Chinese Football Premiership]] was covered extensively between 1892 and 1896, in local newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;'A death blow to the white Australia policy': Australian rules football and the Chinese community in Victoria, 1892-1908&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wally Koochew]] played four games for [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] during 1908, in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), becoming the league's first Australian player with Chinese heritage.

Between 1973 and 1985, [[Les Fong]] was a prominent and acclaimed player in the [[Western Australian Football League]] (WAFL), which held equal status to the VFL during that period. He was also selected for six [[interstate matches in Australian Football#State of origin|State of Origin]] games for the [[Western Australia Australian rules football team|Western Australian team]], including the first such game (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wafootball.com.au/resources/doc_download/17-wa-state-representatives [[West Australian Football Commission]], 2012, ''Western Australian Interstate Football Representatives'' 1904 - 2011] (19 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Fong played 284 games for [[West Perth Football Club|West Perth]] in the WAFL and remains the club's longest-serving captain (1980&amp;ndash;85).

In August 2012, [[Lin Jong]], a player with the {{AFL WB}} of [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] and [[Chinese people in East Timor|East Timorese]] background, was elevated to the senior list and made his debut against {{AFL Ric}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/more-news/lin-jong-elevated-to-the-western-bulldogs-senior-list/story-e6frf9jf-1226446852478|title=Lin Jong elevated to the Western Bulldogs senior list|date=9 August 2012|first=Sam|last=Landsberger|work=[[Herald Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 Team China captain [[Chen Shaoliang]], 23, joined Port Adelaide on an AFL international scholarship for the season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/teams/port-adelaide/port-adelaide-signs-its-first-recruit-from-china/news-story/3dbfc5140ec5d5c6326d490736a79e09&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Avatar: The Last Airbender – Into the Inferno''''' (known as '''''Avatar: The Legend of Aang – Into the Inferno''''' in Europe) is a [[video game]] based on the Nickelodeon animated TV series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''. Like the previous two games which were set in the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)|first]] and [[Avatar: The Last Airbender – The Burning Earth|second]] seasons, the game's setting is based upon the show's third and final season. The Wii version was released on October 13, 2008 in North America and on November 1, 2008 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woolworths.co.uk/web/jsp/product/index.jsp?pid=51650882 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910022303/http://www.woolworths.co.uk/web/jsp/product/index.jsp?pid=51650882 |date=September 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A PS2 version is also available and was released on October 31, 2008 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.play.com/Games/Xbox360/4-/5985555/Avatar-The-Legend-Of-Aang-Into-The-Inferno/Product.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204123758/http://www.play.com/Games/Xbox360/4-/5985555/Avatar-The-Legend-Of-Aang-Into-The-Inferno/Product.html |archive-date=2009-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Gameplay styles vary on different platforms. In the Nintendo DS version, the characters have very large heads, giving the game a cartoonish feel. [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara's]] ice bridge ability returns from the previous games. [[Sokka|Sokka's]] boomerang is used to disintegrate out-of-reach objects or to solve puzzles; the player draws a path for the boomerang to follow. [[Toph]] can Earthbend small platforms to get over gaps with spikes and Aang can make Whirlwinds to either change directions of objects or to get them across gaps.

The Nintendo Wii and Sony PlayStation 2 versions provide a completely different way to play. Fire balls, rocks and water can all be picked up by holding the B button and are guided using the primary controller (Wii Remote on Nintendo Wii) provided there is a nearby source. Aang can form a sphere of high winds (canonically called an "air ball") to break down obstacles and blow away objects by making a circle with the primary controller. Toph can lift up earth and throw it, pull earth out of walls and lift it up to make pillars. Katara can Bend water to put out fires and can freeze it into a block by shaking the secondary controller (Nunchuk on Nintendo Wii). Ice can also be pulled out of waterfalls and ice pillars can be made. Zuko can guide fire and burn things. Sokka throws his boomerang when the B button is pressed. Aang is unique, in that canonically he can bend all four elements, but only fights using Airbending.

'''''Baltic 1985: Corridor To Berlin''''' is a computer wargame published in 1984 by [[Strategic Simulations]]. Developed by [[Roger Keating]], it was the third in the "When Superpowers Collide" series.

==Summary==
In 1985, after [[NATO]] halts a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of [[West Germany]], and a communist invasion of [[Saudi Arabia]] is thwarted by the American [[Rapid deployment force|Rapid Deployment Forces]], the Soviets rush forces from the West German front into [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] to put down an anti-Soviet uprising.  NATO takes advantage of the moment by invading East Germany to relieve the siege of [[West Berlin]] and evacuate its personnel trapped behind enemy lines.

The player may choose to play either the NATO or Soviet forces, and can play in turns against another human component or against the computer.

"'''Battle of the Atom'''" is a 10-part [[comic book]] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline published by [[Marvel Comics]] that debuted in September and October 2013 and  ran through multiple X-Men books.

The story involves the X-Men of the future traveling to present time in order to force the [[time-displaced X-Men]] to return to their rightful time, as their presence in the current timeline will result in disastrous consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Dave (September 5, 2013). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=47711 "'X-Men' Editor Lowe Fights the 'Battle of the Atom']. [[Comic Book Resources]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==
''Battle of the Atom'' was announced in April 2013. The story involves the X-Men of the future traveling to present time in order to force the [[All-New X-Men]] to return to their rightful time, as their presence in the current timeline will result in disastrous consequences.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;Truitt, Brian (September 8, 2013). [https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/09/08/brian-michael-bendis-x-men-sunday-conversation/2773811/ "Sunday Geekersation: Bendis takes pride in his X-Men"]. ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Michael Bendis]], writer of ''All-New X-Men'', stated that the use of [[time travel]] in the story is less important than the theme of characters exploring how the choices they make early in life affect them later on in life, in a manner similar to the 1986 feature film ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]''. Musing on the nature of fate, and how these ideas inspired both his previous comics work, and "Battle of the Atom" in particular, Bendis explained:&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;

{{quote|I get a lot of questions about this: Where would you see yourself in 10 years or what do you think the 12-year-old version of you would think of this? It seems to be on a lot of people's minds. When the X-Men are faced with all of this, you can't help but second-guess or really take hold of the choices you're making in life, and some people don't. They don't really think about the choices they're making, or you see someone in a relationship with someone and you go, 'Really, that's what you want in your life?' The X-Men can really show that to people in examining your future and such. It's about your own legacy and being the best version of yourself, and if I go down this road, will I be the best version of myself or will I derail completely? I've been writing about that since ''Jinx''. Literally, Jinx says, 'I'm on a road and I have no idea how I got here and I don't even know where the road I was supposed to be on is. I can't even see it.' When I was in college, I saw people not even sure why they were in the major they were in. I'll never forget, one of my neighbors was an astrophysicist, and he was sitting on the porch and he goes, "I hate astrophysics. Why am I doing this? I don't like it." And he was only a year away from graduating. The guy's haunted me all these years.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;}}

== Plot ==
When Kitty Pryde's group of time displaced Original Five (O5) X-Men and Cyclops' Uncanny X-Men are forced to team up to stop an out of control new mutant, young Cyclops is killed by a Sentinel.  He is resurrected moments later by one of Cyclops' recruits, who is a healer. However, in the brief moments that Young Cyclops was dead, the adult Cyclops blinked out of existence and the world around the two groups suddenly began to shudder and shake, as if reality was collapsing from the time paradox.

This causes another round of debate from Wolverine's X-Men about returning the O5 to their proper place in the timeline. The debate is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of a group of older X-Men led by an aged Kitty Pryde, the grandson of Charles Xavier, and an adult Jean Grey (the time displaced O5 Jean Grey, having never returned to the past), dressed as the new Xorn.  They seek to force the X-Men to go back to the past.

Realizing that something does not seem right, O5 Jean escapes with O5 Cyclops.  The X-Men and "Future X-Men" pursue, with Xorn explaining that a catastrophe will soon befall the X-Men if the O5 do not return to their original place in the timeline.  The exact nature of that catastrophe is left ambiguous.

O5 Jean &amp; Scott eventually make contact with Cyclops team of Uncanny X-Men, and after some consideration Scott agrees to help his younger self and young Jean.  Realizing that Scott's thinking on the matter is compromised, Emma Frost telepathically alerts the X-Men and Future X-Men of Young Jean's and Scotts location.  However, upon seeing Xorn attack her younger self, Emma has a change of heart and attacks Xorn with the Cuckoos and O5 Jean.

Xorn is able to defeat the combined powers of Emma and her Cuckoos, but O5 Jean is eventually able to defeat her.  Xorn gives O5 Jean a glimpse of the future, a ploy on her part, which convinces O5 Jean that they need to go back to their proper place in the timeline.  The three teams of X-Men part ways, with Cyclops unsure if this fight is really over.

Magik, who is also suspicious of the motives of these new X-Men, travels to the future along with O5 Beast and O5 Iceman.  It is discovered that these "Future X-Men" are really the "Future Brotherhood", and motives are purely self-serving.  This new Brotherhood was created when Alison Blaire, also known as the X-Man Dazzler, is elected president and quickly assassinated, with the identity of the assassin unrevealed.  The true "Future X-Men" agree to travel back in time and confront the Brotherhood.

Upon arriving at the X-mansion with O5 Jean, Scott and Angel, it is discovered that the O5 Beast and Iceman are in the future.  The Brotherhood realizes that they will soon have to fight Cyclops's team and the true "Future X-Men", and accelerate their plans.  It is revealed that the "Future Kitty Pryde" is really Raze, the shape shifting son of Mystique and Wolverine.  They attack the original X-Men, including an incapacitated Wolverine.  Raze is able to infiltrate Scott's team and capture O5 Iceman and Beast.

The O5 X-Men are brought to Beast's time machine and an attempt is made to send them back in time.  However, an unknown force prevents this process from being completed.  As the other Brotherhood members are overwhelmed by the Uncanny X-Men and the Future X-Men, the surviving Brotherhood members flee to Cape Citadel, the site of the first battle between the O5 X-Men and Magneto.

The Brotherhood attacks the military to attract the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D.  The fully united force of the Uncanny X-Men, Wolverine's team of X-Men, and the "Future" X-Men arrive to stop them.  Xorn is able to control the S.H.I.E.L.D. weapon systems on site and launch the government Sentinels, which were being created in secret.  The X-Men defeat the government Sentinels, and turn their attention to Xorn.  She is able to hold the combined forces off, but her powers overload and she explodes.

The exact catastrophe that befalls the X-Men due to the O5's presence is not revealed.  The Future X-Men return to their proper place in the timeline with their casualties.  The whereabouts of the Brotherhood member Raze is unknown.  The O5 X-Men, due to being nearly forced to go back in time, decide to leave the Jean Grey School and join the Uncanny X-Men. Kitty Pryde, disgusted that the modern X-Men tried to send the original five back by force, even hunting Cyclops and Jean down like criminals, quits and joins the O5 Team to continue to mentor them.

'''Cinematography''' (from [[ancient greek]] κίνημα, ''kìnema''  "movement" and γράφειν, ''gràphein'' "to write") is the science or art of [[motion-picture]] photography by recording light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]], either electronically by means of an [[image sensor]], or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as [[film stock]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book
|title= The Focal Dictionary of Photographic Technologies 
|last= Spencer|first= D A |year= 1973 
|publisher= Focal Press |isbn=978-0133227192 
|page=454
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinematographer]]s use a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to focus reflected light from objects into a [[real image]] that is transferred to some [[image sensor]] or [[film|light-sensitive material]] inside a [[movie camera]]. These [[Exposure (photography)|exposures]] are created sequentially and preserved for later processing and viewing as a [[motion picture]]. Capturing images with an electronic image sensor produces an [[Charge-coupled device|electrical charge]] for each [[pixel]] in the image, which is [[Video processing|electronically processed]] and stored in a [[video file]] for subsequent processing or display. Images captured with [[photographic emulsion]] result in a series of invisible [[latent image]]s on the film stock, which are chemically "[[Photographic developer|developed]]" into a [[Positive (photography)|visible image]]. The images on the film stock are [[movie projector|projected]] for viewing the motion picture.

Cinematography finds uses in many fields of [[science]] and [[business sector|business]] as well as for entertainment purposes and [[mass communication]].

The word "cinematography" is based on the Greek words {{lang|el|[[wikt:κίνημα|κίνημα]]}} (''kinema''), meaning "movement, motion" and {{lang|el|[[wikt:γράφειν|γράφειν]]}} (''graphein'') meaning "to record", together meaning "recording motion". The word used to refer to the art, process, or job of filming movies, but later its meaning became restricted to "motion picture photography".

[[File:Muybridge race horse animated.gif|thumb|[[Eadweard Muybridge|Muybridge]] sequence of a horse galloping]]

In the 1830s, moving images were produced on revolving drums and disks, with independent invention by Simon von Stampfer ([[stroboscope]]) in Austria, Joseph Plateau ([[phenakistoscope]]) in Belgium, and William Horner ([[zoetrope]]) in Britain.

In 1845, [[Francis Ronalds]] invented the [[Francis Ronalds#Continuously recording camera|first successful camera]] able to make [[Photography#Science and forensics|continuous recordings]] of the varying indications of [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic]] instruments over time. The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=The Beginnings of Continuous Scientific Recording using Photography: Sir Francis Ronalds’ Contribution|url=http://www.eshph.org/blog/2016/04/19/1642/|journal=European Society for the History of Photography|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirfrancisronalds.co.uk/camera.html|title=The First "Movie Camera"|website=Sir Francis Ronalds and his Family|access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Lincoln patented a device, in 1867, that showed animated pictures called the "wheel of life" or "[[zoopraxiscope]]". In it, moving drawings or photographs were watched through a slit.

On 19 June 1873, [[Eadweard Muybridge]] successfully photographed a horse named "[[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|Sallie Gardner]]" in fast motion using a series of 24 stereoscopic cameras. The cameras were arranged along a track parallel to the horse's, and each camera shutter was controlled by a trip wire triggered by the horse's hooves. They were 21&amp;nbsp;inches apart to cover the 20 feet taken by the horse stride, taking pictures at one thousandth of a second.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clegg|first=Brian|title=The Man Who Stopped Time| publisher=Joseph Henry Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-309-10112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the decade, Muybridge had adapted sequences of his photographs to a zoopraxiscope for short, primitive projected "movies," which were sensations on his lecture tours by 1879 or 1880.

Nine years later, in 1882, French scientist [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] invented a chronophotographic gun, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, recording all the frames of the same picture.

The late nineteenth to the early twentieth century brought rise to the use of film not only for entertainment purposes but for scientific exploration as well. French biologist and filmmaker Jean Painleve lobbied heavily for the use of film in the scientific field, as the new medium was more efficient in capturing and documenting the behavior, movement, and environment of microorganisms, cells, and bacteria, than the naked eye.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landecker|first=Hannah|date=2006|title=Microcinematography and the History of Science and Film|url=|journal=Isis|doi=10.1086/501105}}&lt;!--|accessdate = 2014-10-26--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of film into scientific fields allowed for not only the viewing "new images and objects, such as cells and natural objects, but also the viewing of them in real time",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; whereas prior to the invention of moving pictures, scientists and doctors alike had to rely on hand drawn sketches of human anatomy and its microorganisms. This posed a great inconvenience in the science and medical worlds. The development of film and increased usage of cameras allowed doctors and scientists to grasp a better understanding and knowledge of their projects.

[[File:Roundhay Garden Scene.ogv|thumb|left|[[Roundhay Garden Scene]] (1888), the world's earliest surviving motion-picture film.]]

The experimental film ''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'', filmed by [[Louis Le Prince]] on 14 October 1888, in [[Roundhay]], [[Leeds]], England, is the earliest surviving motion picture. This movie was shot on paper film.

[[William Kennedy Laurie Dickson|W. K. L. Dickson]], working under the direction of [[Thomas Alva Edison]], was the first to design a successful apparatus, the [[Kinetograph]], patented in 1891. This camera took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated onto a transparent [[Celluloid|celluloid strip]] 35&amp;nbsp;mm wide. The results of this work were first shown in public in 1893, using the viewing apparatus also designed by Dickson, the [[Kinetoscope]]. Contained within a large box, only one person at a time looking into it through a peephole could view the movie.

In the following year, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]] and his projector, the [[Phantoscope]], made a successful audience viewing while [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Louis and Auguste Lumière]] perfected the [[Cinématographe]], an apparatus that took, printed, and projected film, in Paris in December 1895. The Lumière brothers were the first to present projected, moving, photographic, pictures to a paying audience of more than one person.

In 1896, movie theaters were open in France ([[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Nice]], [[Marseille]]); Italy ([[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Bologna]], [[Forlì]]); [[Brussels]]; and [[London]].

In 1896, Edison showed his improved Vitascope projector, the first commercially successful projector in the U.S.

Cooper Hewitt invented mercury lamps which made it practical to shoot films indoors without sunlight in 1905.

The first animated cartoon was produced in 1906.

Credits began to appear at the beginning of motion pictures in 1911.

The Bell and Howell 2709 movie camera invented in 1915 allowed directors to make close-ups without physically moving the camera.

By the late 1920s, most of the movies produced were sound films.

Wide screen formats were first experimented with in the 1950s.

By the 1970s, most movies were color films. IMAX and other 70mm formats gained popularity. Wide distribution of films became commonplace, setting the ground for "blockbusters."

Film cinematography dominated the motion picture industry from its inception until the 2010s when digital cinematography became dominant. Film cinematography is still used by some directors, especially in specific applications or out of fondness of the format.

===Black and white===

From its birth in the 1880s, movies were predominantly monochrome. Contrary to popular belief, monochrome doesn't always mean black and white; it means a movie shot in a single tone or color. Since the cost of tinted film bases was substantially higher, most movies were produced in black and white monochrome. Even with the advent of early color experiments, the greater expense of color meant films were mostly made in black and white until the 1950s, when cheaper color processes were introduced, and in some years the percentage of films shot on color film surpassed 51%. By the 1960s, color became by far the dominant film stock. In the coming decades, the usage of color film greatly increased while monochrome films became scarce.

===Color===
{{Main article|Color motion picture film}}
[[File:Serpentine Dance (1895) - yt.webm|thumb|left|[[Annabelle Serpentine Dance]], hand-tinted version (1895)]]
After the advent of motion pictures, a tremendous amount of energy was invested in the production of photography in natural color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = New Developments in Colour Cinematography|last = Baker|first = T. Thorne|date = 1932|journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the talking picture further increased the demand for the use of color photography. However, in comparison to other technological advances of the time, the arrival of color photography was a relatively slow process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = New Developments in Colour Photography|last = Baker|first = T. Thorne|date = 1932|journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early movies were not actually color movies since they were shot monochrome and hand-colored or machine-colored afterwards. (Such movies are referred to as ''colored'' and not ''color''.) The earliest such example is the hand-tinted [[Annabelle Serpentine Dance]] in 1895 by [[Edison Manufacturing Company]]. Machine-based tinting later became popular. Tinting continued until the advent of natural color cinematography in the 1910s. Many black and white movies have been colorized recently using digital tinting. This includes footage shot from both world wars, sporting events and political propaganda.

In 1902, [[Edward Raymond Turner]] produced the first films with a natural color process rather than using colorization techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-19557914|title=World's first colour film footage viewed for first time|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[kinemacolor]] was introduced. In the same year, the short film ''[[A Visit to the Seaside]]'' became the first natural color movie to be publicly presented.

In 1917, the earliest version of [[Technicolor]] was introduced. [[Kodachrome]] was introduced in 1935. [[Eastmancolor]] was introduced in 1950 and became the color standard for the rest of the century.

In the 2010s, color films were largely superseded by color digital cinematography.

===Digital cinematography===

[[File:Arri Alexa camera.jpg|thumb|[[Arri Alexa]], a digital movie camera.]]

In digital cinematography, the movie is shot on digital medium such as flash storage, as well as distributed through a digital medium such as a hard drive.

Beginning in the late 1980s, [[Sony]] began marketing the concept of "electronic cinematography," utilizing its analog [[Sony HDVS]] [[professional video camera]]s. The effort met with very little success. However, this led to one of the earliest digitally shot feature movies, ''[[Julia and Julia]]'', being produced in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093092/trivia|title=Julia and Julia (1987)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, with the introduction of [[HDCAM]] recorders and 1920 × 1080 pixel digital professional video cameras based on [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] technology, the idea, now re-branded as "digital cinematography," began to gain traction in the market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Shot and released in 1998, ''[[The Last Broadcast (film)|The Last Broadcast]]'' is believed by some to be the first feature-length video shot and edited entirely on consumer-level digital equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Last Broadcast is A First: The Making of a Digital Feature|url=http://www.thelastbroadcastmovie.com/|website=thelastbroadcastmovie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1999, [[George Lucas]] challenged the supremacy of the movie-making medium of film for the first time by including footage filmed with high-definition digital cameras in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''. In late 2013, Paramount became the first major studio to distribute movies to theaters in digital format, eliminating 35mm film entirely. Since then the demand of movies to be developed onto digital format rather than 35mm has increased drastically.

As digital technology improved, movie studios began increasingly shifting towards digital cinematography. Since the 2010s, digital cinematography has become the dominant form of cinematography after largely superseding film cinematography.

== Aspects ==
{{main article|Cinematic techniques}}
Numerous aspects contribute to the art of cinematography, including:

===Cinema technique===
[[File:Melstud2.gif|thumb|upright|[[Georges Méliès]] (left) painting a backdrop in his studio]]
The first film cameras were fastened directly to the head of a tripod or other support, with only the crudest kind of leveling devices provided, in the manner of the still-camera tripod heads of the period. The earliest film cameras were thus effectively fixed during the shot, and hence the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle. The first known of these was a film shot by a Lumière cameraman from the back platform of a train leaving Jerusalem in 1896, and by 1898, there were a number of films shot from moving trains. Although listed under the general heading of "panoramas" in the sales catalogues of the time, those films shot straight forward from in front of a railway engine were usually specifically referred to as "[[phantom ride]]s".

In 1897, [[Robert W. Paul]] had the first real rotating camera head made to put on a tripod, so that he could follow the passing processions of Queen Victoria's [[Diamond Jubilee]] in one uninterrupted shot. This device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a [[worm gear]] driven by turning a crank handle, and Paul put it on general sale the next year. Shots taken using such a [[panning (camera)|"panning"]] head were also referred to as "panoramas" in the film catalogues of the first decade of the cinema. This eventually led to the creation of a panoramic photo as well.

The standard pattern for early film studios was provided by the studio which Georges Méliès had built in 1897. This had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography, and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct ray of the sun on sunny days. The soft overall light without real shadows that this arrangement produced, and which also exists naturally on lightly overcast days, was to become the basis for film lighting in film studios for the next decade.

=== Image sensor and film stock ===
Cinematography can begin with digital [[image sensor]] or rolls of film. Advancements in film emulsion and grain structure provided a wide range of available [[film stock]]s. The selection of a film stock is one of the first decisions made in preparing a typical film production.

Aside from the [[film gauge]] selection – [[8 mm film|8 mm]] (amateur), [[16 mm]] (semi-professional), [[35 mm]] (professional) and [[65 mm]] (epic photography, rarely used except in special event venues) – the cinematographer has a selection of stocks in [[reversal film|reversal]] (which, when developed, create a positive image) and negative formats along with a wide range of [[film speed]]s (varying sensitivity to light) from [[Film speed|ISO]] 50 (slow, least sensitive to light) to 800 (very fast, extremely sensitive to light) and differing response to color (low [[Colorfulness|saturation]], high saturation) and contrast (varying levels between pure black (no exposure) and pure white (complete overexposure).
Advancements and adjustments to nearly all gauges of film create the "super" formats wherein the area of the film used to capture a single frame of an image is expanded, although the physical gauge of the film remains the same. [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8&amp;nbsp;mm]], Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm, and [[Super 35]]&amp;nbsp;mm all utilize more of the overall film area for the image than their "regular" non-super counterparts. The larger the film gauge, the higher the overall image resolution clarity and technical quality. The techniques used by the [[film laboratory]] to [[photographic processing|process the film stock]] can also offer a considerable variance in the image produced. By controlling the temperature and varying the duration in which the film is soaked in the development chemicals, and by skipping certain chemical processes (or partially skipping all of them), cinematographers can achieve very different looks from a single film stock in the laboratory.  Some techniques that can be used are [[push processing]], [[bleach bypass]], and [[cross processing]].

Most of modern cinema uses [[digital cinematography]] and has no film stocks {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}, but the cameras themselves can be adjusted in ways that go far beyond the abilities of one particular film stock. They can provide varying degrees of color sensitivity, image contrast, light sensitivity and so on. One camera can achieve all the various looks of different emulsions. Digital image adjustments such as ISO and contrast are executed by estimating the same adjustments that would take place if actual film were in use, and are thus vulnerable to the camera's sensor designers perceptions of various film stocks and image adjustment parameters.

=== Filters ===
[[Filter (photography)|Filters]], such as diffusion filters or color effect filters, are also widely used to enhance mood or dramatic effects. Most photographic filters are made up of two pieces of optical glass glued together with some form of image or light manipulation material between the glass. In the case of color filters, there is often a translucent color medium pressed between two planes of optical glass. Color filters work by blocking out certain color [[wavelengths]] of light from reaching the film. With color film, this works very intuitively wherein a blue filter will cut down on the passage of red, orange, and yellow light and create a blue tint on the film. In black-and-white photography, color filters are used somewhat counter intuitively; for instance a yellow filter, which cuts down on blue wavelengths of light, can be used to darken a daylight sky (by eliminating blue light from hitting the film, thus greatly underexposing the mostly blue sky) while not biasing most human flesh tone. Certain cinematographers, such as [[Christopher Doyle]], are well known for their innovative use of filters. Filters can be used in front of the lens or, in some cases, behind the lens for different effects. [[Christopher Doyle]] was a pioneer for increased usage of filters in movies. He was highly respected throughout the cinema world.

=== Lens ===
[[Camera lens|Lenses]] can be attached to the camera to give a certain look, feel, or effect by focus, color, etc.

As does the [[human eye]], the camera creates [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and spatial relations with the rest of the world. However, unlike one's eye, a cinematographer can select different lenses for different purposes. Variation in [[focal length]] is one of the chief benefits. The focal length of the lens determines the [[angle of view]] and, therefore, the [[field of view]]. Cinematographers can choose from a range of [[wide-angle lens]]es, "normal" lenses and [[long focus lens]]es, as well as [[Macro photography|macro lenses]] and other special effect lens systems such as [[borescope]] lenses. Wide-angle lenses have short focal lengths and make spatial distances more obvious. A person in the distance is shown as much smaller while someone in the front will loom large. On the other hand, long focus lenses reduce such exaggerations, depicting far-off objects as seemingly close together and flattening perspective. The differences between the perspective rendering is actually not due to the focal length by itself, but by the distance between the subjects and the camera. Therefore, the use of different focal lengths in combination with different camera to subject distances creates these different rendering. Changing the focal length only while keeping the same camera position doesn't affect perspective but the [[camera angle]] of view only.

A [[zoom lens]] allows a camera operator to change his focal length within a shot or quickly between setups for shots. As [[prime lens]]es offer greater optical quality and are "faster" (larger aperture openings, usable in less light) than zoom lenses, they are often employed in professional cinematography over zoom lenses. Certain scenes or even types of filmmaking, however, may require the use of zooms for speed or ease of use, as well as shots involving a zoom move.

As in other photography, the control of the exposed image is done in the lens with the control of the [[diaphragm aperture]]. For proper selection, the cinematographer needs that all lenses be engraved with [[F-number#T-stop|T-stop]], not [[F-number|f-stop]] so that the eventual light loss due to the glass doesn't affect the exposure control when setting it using the usual meters. The choice of the aperture also affects image quality (aberrations) and depth of field.

=== Depth of field and focus ===
[[Image:Citizen Kane deep focus.jpg|alt=A stern looking man and a woman sit on the right side of a table with documents on the table. A top hat is on the table. An unkempt man stands to the left of the picture. In the background a boy can be seen through a window playing in the snow.|thumb|right|A [[deep focus]] shot from ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941): everything, including the hat in the foreground and the boy (young [[Charles Foster Kane]]) in the distance, is in sharp focus.]]
Focal length and diaphragm aperture affect the [[depth of field]] of a scene – that is, how much the background, mid-ground and foreground will be rendered in "acceptable focus" (only one exact plane of the image is in precise focus) on the film or video target. Depth of field (not to be confused with [[depth of focus]]) is determined by the aperture size and the focal distance. A large or deep depth of field is generated with a very small iris aperture and focusing on a point in the distance, whereas a shallow depth of field will be achieved with a large (open) iris aperture and focusing closer to the lens. Depth of field is also governed by the format size. If one considers the field of view and angle of view, the smaller the image is, the shorter the focal length should be, as to keep the same field of view. Then, the smaller the image is, the more depth of field is obtained, for the same field of view. Therefore, 70mm has less depth of field than 35mm for a given field of view, 16mm more than 35mm, and early video cameras, as well as most modern consumer level video cameras, even more depth of field than 16mm. 

In ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]] and director [[Orson Welles]] used tighter apertures to create every detail of the foreground and background of the sets in sharp focus. This practice is known as [[deep focus]]. Deep focus became a popular cinematographic device from the 1940s onwards in Hollywood. Today, the trend is for more [[shallow focus]]. To change the plane of focus from one object or character to another within a shot is commonly known as a ''[[rack focus]]''.

Early in the transition to digital cinematography, the inability of digital video cameras to easily achieve shallow depth of field, due to their small image sensors, was initially an issue of frustration for film makers trying to emulate the look of 35mm film. Optical adapters were devised which accomplished this by mounting a larger format lens which projected its image, at the size of the larger format, on a ground glass screen preserving the depth of field. The adapter and lens then mounted on the small format video camera which in turn focused on the ground glass screen. 

[[Digital SLR]] still cameras have sensor sizes similar to that of the 35mm film frame, and thus are able to produce images with similar depth of field. The advent of video functions in these cameras sparked a revolution in digital cinematography, with more and more film makers adopting still cameras for the purpose because of the film-like qualities of their images. More recently, more and more dedicated video cameras are being equipped with larger sensors capable of 35mm film-like depth of field.

=== Aspect ratio and framing ===
The [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of an image is the ratio of its width to its height. This can be expressed either as a ratio of 2 integers, such as 4:3, or in a decimal format, such as 1.33:1 or simply 1.33.

Different ratios provide different aesthetic effects. Standards for aspect ratio have varied significantly over time.

During the silent era, aspect ratios varied widely, from square [[List of film formats#Film formats|1:1]], all the way up to the extreme widescreen 4:1 [[Polyvision]].  However, from the 1910s, silent motion pictures generally settled on the ratio of 4:3 (1.33). The introduction of sound-on-film briefly narrowed the aspect ratio, to allow room for a sound stripe. In 1932, a new standard was introduced, the [[Academy ratio]] of 1.37, by means of thickening the [[frame line]].

For years, mainstream cinematographers were limited to using the Academy ratio, but in the 1950s, thanks to the popularity of [[Cinerama]], [[widescreen]] ratios were introduced in an effort to pull audiences back into the theater and away from their home [[history of television|television]] sets. These new widescreen formats provided cinematographers a wider frame within which to compose their images.

Many different proprietary photographic systems were invented and utilized in the 1950s to create widescreen movies, but one dominated film: the [[anamorphic]] process, which optically squeezes the image to photograph twice the horizontal area to the same size vertical as standard "spherical" lenses. The first commonly used anamorphic format was [[CinemaScope]], which used a 2.35 aspect ratio, although it was originally 2.55. CinemaScope was used from 1953 to 1967, but due to technical flaws in the design and its ownership by Fox, several third-party companies, led by [[Panavision]]'s technical improvements in the 1950s, dominated the anamorphic cine lens market. Changes to [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] projection standards altered the projected ratio from 2.35 to 2.39 in 1970, although this did not change anything regarding the photographic anamorphic standards; all changes in respect to the aspect ratio of anamorphic 35&amp;nbsp;mm photography are specific to camera or projector gate sizes, not the optical system. After the [[List of film formats|"widescreen wars"]] of the 1950s, the motion-picture industry settled into 1.85 as a standard for theatrical projection in the United States and the United Kingdom. This is a cropped version of 1.37.  Europe and Asia opted for 1.66 at first, although 1.85 has largely permeated these markets in recent decades. Certain "epic" or adventure movies utilized the anamorphic 2.39.

In the 1990s, with the advent of [[high-definition video]], television engineers created the 1.78 (16:9) ratio as a mathematical compromise between the theatrical standard of 1.85 and television's 1.33, as it was not practical to produce a traditional CRT television tube with a width of 1.85. Until that point, nothing had ever been originated in 1.78. Today, this is a standard for high-definition video and for widescreen television.

=== Lighting ===
Light is necessary to create an image exposure on a frame of film or on a digital target (CCD, etc.). The art of lighting for cinematography goes far beyond basic exposure, however, into the essence of visual storytelling. Lighting contributes considerably to the emotional response an audience has watching a motion picture. The increased usage of filters can greatly impact the final image and affect the lighting.

=== Camera movement ===
[[File:Tower Heist marching band jeh.theora.ogv|thumb|Camera on a small motor vehicle representing a large one]]
Cinematography can not only depict a moving subject but can use a camera, which represents the audience's viewpoint or perspective, that moves during the course of filming. This movement plays a considerable role in the emotional language of film images and the audience's emotional reaction to the action. Techniques range from the most basic movements of [[Panning (camera)|panning]] (horizontal shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like turning your head side-to-side) and tilting (vertical shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like tipping your head back to look at the sky or down to look at the ground) to [[Dolly shot|dollying]] (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it closer or farther from the subject), [[tracking shot|tracking]] (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it to the left or right), [[crane shot|craning]] (moving the camera in a vertical position; being able to lift it off the ground as well as swing it side-to-side from a fixed base position), and combinations of the above. Early cinematographers often faced problems that were not common to other graphic artists because of the element of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production Problems: Cinematography|last = Moore|first = Harris C.|date = 1949|journal = Journal of the University Film Producers Association|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Filming outdoor.jpg|thumb|left|Live filming for TV (2013)]]
Cameras have been mounted to nearly every imaginable form of transportation.

Most cameras can also be [[handheld camera|handheld]], that is held in the hands of the camera operator who moves from one position to another while filming the action. Personal stabilizing platforms came into being in the late 1970s through the invention of [[Garrett Brown]], which became known as the [[Steadicam]]. The Steadicam is a body harness and stabilization arm that connects to the camera, supporting the camera while isolating it from the operator's body movements. After the Steadicam patent expired in the early 1990s, many other companies began manufacturing their concept of the personal camera stabilizer. This invention is much more common throughout the cinematic world today. From feature-length films to the evening news, more and more networks have begun to use a personal camera stabilizer.

== Special effects ==
{{main article|Special effect}}
The first special effects in the cinema were created while the film was being shot. These came to be known as "[[In-camera effect|in-camera]]" effects. Later, [[optical printer|optical]] and [[Digital compositing|digital effects]] were developed so that editors and visual effects artists could more tightly control the process by manipulating the film in [[post-production]].

The 1896 movie [[The Execution of Mary Stuart]] shows an actor dressed as the queen placing her head on the execution block in front of a small group of bystanders in Elizabethan dress. The executioner brings his axe down, and the queen's severed head drops onto the ground. This trick was worked by stopping the camera and replacing the actor with a dummy, then restarting the camera before the axe falls. The two pieces of film were then trimmed and cemented together so that the action appeared continuous when the film was shown, thus creating an overall illusion and successfully laying the foundation for special effects.

This film was among those exported to Europe with the first Kinetoscope machines in 1895 and was seen by Georges Méliès, who was putting on magic shows in his Theatre Robert-Houdin in Paris at the time. He took up filmmaking in 1896, and after making imitations of other films from Edison, Lumière, and Robert Paul, he made ''Escamotage d'un dame chez Robert-Houdin ([[The Vanishing Lady]])''. This film shows a woman being made to vanish by using the same [[stop motion]] technique as the earlier Edison film. After this, Georges Méliès made many single shot films using this trick over the next couple of years.

===Double exposure===
[[File:SantaW1.gif|thumb|left|A scene inset inside a circular vignette showing a "dream vision" in ''Santa Claus'' (1898).]]

The other basic technique for trick cinematography involves [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the film in the camera, which was first done by [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] in July 1898 in the UK. Smith's ''[[The Corsican Brothers]]'' (1898) was described in the catalogue of the [[Warwick Trading Company]], which took up the distribution of Smith's films in 1900, thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"One of the twin brothers returns home from shooting in the Corsican mountains, and is visited by the ghost of the other twin. By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*. After indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust, and appealing for vengeance, he disappears. A 'vision' then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow. To the Corsican's amazement, the duel and death of his brother are vividly depicted in the vision, and overcome by his feelings, he falls to the floor just as his mother enters the room."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ghost effect was done by draping the set in black velvet after the main action had been shot, and then re-exposing the negative with the actor playing the ghost going through the actions at the appropriate point. Likewise, the vision, which appeared within a circular vignette or [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]], was similarly superimposed over a black area in the backdrop to the scene, rather than over a part of the set with detail in it, so that nothing appeared through the image, which seemed quite solid. Smith used this technique again in ''[[Santa Claus (1898 film)|Santa Claus]]'' (1898).

[[Georges Méliès]] first used superimposition on a dark background in ''La Caverne maudite (The Cave of the Demons)'' made a couple of months later in 1898, and elaborated it with multiple superimpositions in the one shot in ''[[Un Homme de têtes]] ([[The Four Troublesome Heads]])''. He created further variations in subsequent films.

=== Frame rate selection ===
{{main article|Frame rate}}
Motion picture images are presented to an audience at a constant speed. In the theater it is 24 [[frames per second]], in [[NTSC]] (US) Television it is 30 frames per second (29.97 to be exact), in [[PAL]] (Europe) television it is 25 frames per second. This speed of presentation does not vary.

However, by varying the speed at which the image is captured, various effects can be created knowing that the faster or slower recorded image will be played at a constant speed. Giving the cinematographer even more freedom for creativity and expression to be made.

For instance, [[time-lapse photography]] is created by exposing an image at an extremely slow rate. If a cinematographer sets a camera to expose one frame every minute for four hours, and then that footage is projected at 24 frames per second, a four-hour event will take 10 seconds to present, and one can present the events of a whole day (24 hours) in just one minute.

The inverse of this, if an image is captured at speeds above that at which they will be presented, the effect is to greatly slow down ([[slow motion]]) the image. If a cinematographer shoots a person diving into a pool at 96 frames per second, and that image is played back at 24 frames per second, the presentation will take 4 times as long as the actual event. Extreme slow motion, capturing many thousands of frames per second can present things normally invisible to the [[human eye]], such as bullets in flight and shockwaves travelling through media, a potentially powerful cinematographical technique.

In motion pictures, the manipulation of time and space is a considerable contributing factor to the narrative storytelling tools. Film editing plays a much stronger role in this manipulation, but frame rate selection in the photography of the original action is also a contributing factor to altering time. For example, [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[Modern Times (film)#Production|Modern Times]]'' was shot at "silent speed" (18 fps) but projected at "sound speed" (24 fps), which makes the slapstick action appear even more frenetic.

[[Speed ramping]], or simply "ramping", is a process whereby the capture frame rate of the camera changes over time. For example, if in the course of 10 seconds of capture, the capture frame rate is adjusted from 60 frames per second to 24 frames per second, when played back at the standard movie rate of 24 frames per second, a unique time-manipulation effect is achieved. For example, someone pushing a door open and walking out into the street would appear to start off in [[slow-motion]], but in a few seconds later within the same shot, the person would appear to walk in "realtime" (normal speed). The opposite speed-ramping is done in ''[[The Matrix]]'' when Neo re-enters the Matrix for the first time to see the Oracle. As he comes out of the warehouse "load-point", the camera zooms into Neo at normal speed but as it gets closer to Neo's face, time seems to slow down, [[foreshadowing]] the manipulation of time itself within the Matrix later in the movie.

===Other special techniques===
G. A. Smith initiated the technique of [[reverse motion]] and also improved the quality of self-motivating images. This he did by repeating the action a second time while filming it with an inverted camera and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first. The first films using this were ''Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy'' and ''The Awkward Sign Painter'', the latter which showed a sign painter lettering a sign, and then the painting on the sign vanishing under the painter's brush. The earliest surviving example of this technique is Smith's ''The House That Jack Built'', made before September 1901. Here, a small boy is shown knocking down a castle just constructed by a little girl out of children's building blocks. A title then appears, saying "Reversed", and the action is repeated in reverse so that the castle re-erects itself under his blows.

Cecil Hepworth improved upon this technique by printing the negative of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame, so that in the production of the print the original action was exactly reversed. Hepworth made ''The Bathers'' in 1900, in which bathers who have undressed and jumped into the water appear to spring backwards out of it, and have their clothes magically fly back onto their bodies.

The use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900. Robert Paul's ''On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus'' (1899), had the camera turn so slowly that when the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Cecil Hepworth used the opposite effect in ''The Indian Chief and the [[Seidlitz powder]]'' (1901), in which a naïve [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Red Indian]] eats a lot of the fizzy stomach medicine, causing his stomach to expand and then he then leaps around balloon-like.  This was done by cranking the camera faster than the normal 16 frames per second giving the first "[[slow motion]]" effect.

== Personnel ==
[[File:FMPU camera crew 1944.jpg|thumb|A camera crew from the [[First Motion Picture Unit]]]]
In descending order of seniority, the following staff is involved:

* '''Director of photography''' also called '''[[cinematographer]]'''
* '''Camera operator''' also called '''[[cameraman]]'''
* '''First assistant camera''' also called '''[[focus puller]]'''
* '''Second assistant camera ''' also called '''[[clapper loader]]'''

In the film industry, the '''[[cinematographer]]''' is responsible for the technical aspects of the images (lighting, lens choices, composition, exposure, filtration, film selection), but works closely with the director to ensure that the artistic [[aesthetic]]s are supporting the director's vision of the story being told. The cinematographers are the heads of the camera, [[Grip (job)|grip]] and [[Lighting technician|lighting crew]] on a set, and for this reason, they are often called '''directors of photography''' or '''DPs'''. The ASC defines cinematography as a creative and interpretive process that culminates in the authorship of an original work of art rather than the simple recording of a physical event. Cinematography is not a subcategory of photography. Rather, photography is but one craft that the cinematographer uses in addition to other physical, organizational, managerial, interpretive. and image-manipulating techniques to effect one coherent process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In British tradition, if the DOP actually operates the camera him/herself they are called the ''cinematographer''. On smaller productions, it is common for one person to perform all these functions alone. The career progression usually involves climbing up the ladder from seconding, firsting, eventually to operating the camera.

Directors of photography make many creative and interpretive decisions during the course of their work, from pre-production to post-production, all of which affect the overall feel and look of the motion picture. Many of these decisions are similar to what a photographer needs to note when taking a picture: the cinematographer controls the film choice itself (from a range of available stocks with varying sensitivities to light and color), the selection of lens focal lengths, aperture [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] and focus. Cinematography, however, has a temporal aspect (see [[persistence of vision]]), unlike still photography, which is purely a single still image. It is also bulkier and more strenuous to deal with movie cameras, and it involves a more complex array of choices. As such a cinematographer often needs to work co-operatively with more people than does a photographer, who could frequently function as a single person. As a result, the cinematographer's job also includes personnel management and logistical organization. Given the in-depth knowledge. a cinematographer requires not only of his or her own craft but also that of other personnel, formal tuition in analogue or digital filmmaking can be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyfa.edu/digital-filmmaking/|title=New York Film Academy – Filmmaking|work=nyfa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From 1990 to 2010, the circus has had more than 4,000 youths aged 10–18 in its summer camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Susan |last=Green | title=Circus Smirkus:Let the big top tour begin | url=| work= |publisher=Burlington Free Press |location=Burlington, Vermont |pages= 1(''Weekend'') | date=June 25, 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This annual camp was located at [[Sterling College (Vermont)|Sterling College]] in [[Craftsbury, Vermont]] through 2009. The camp relocated onto the campus of [[Lyndon Institute]] in [[Lyndon, Vermont]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smirkus.org/htm/camp/facilities.html|title=Circus Smirkus Summer Camp Facilities and Meals|publisher=Circus Smirkus|accessdate=November 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802000641/http://www.smirkus.org/htm/camp/facilities.html|archivedate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the camp moved to the Smirkus HQ, Greensboro, VT. A new campus was built 2014-2015.

==Big Top Tour==

== Summer camp ==
Circus Smirkus has a summer camp that trains children in areas such as aerials, clowning/performance, acrobatics and juggling. Participants may also choose to train in other skills such as [[human pyramid]]s, unicycling and [[stilt walking]].  The circus opened its Summer 2015 season at new, permanent facilities—a 135-year-old farmhouse on {{convert|35|acres}} in [[Greensboro, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vtdigger.org/2014/04/28/circus-smirkus-purchases-property-build-permanent-home/|title=CIRCUS SMIRKUS PURCHASES PROPERTY TO BUILD PERMANENT HOME|publisher=Circus Smirkus|accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp sessions offered throughout the season vary from one night overnight camps, one and two-week camps, and advanced camps, including Junior Road Show, Road Show, Ensemble and Aerial Acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smirkus.org/smirkus-camp/camp-sessions/|title=Camp Sessions {{!}} Circus Smirkus|website=www.smirkus.org|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[widescreen]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] was first seen in a [[movie]] in [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s ''[[Old Ironsides (film)|Old Ironsides]]'' of 1926. A few years later in 1928 and '29, a fad broke out for such special features as widescreen and color. Color was the more common choice, being that it was projected the same as black and white while theaters needed wider screens and special lenses for their projectors to show widescreen movies. With the lack of a standard for widescreen aspect ratios, studios had to go to the expense of filming several versions of a widescreen movie to cover the more common kinds of projector lens. The first movie to combine the two was ''[[Fox Movietone Follies of 1929]]'', widescreen and partially in color. The next year there were two, ''[[Song of the Flame]]'' and ''[[Kismet (1930 film)|Kismet]]'', which are today both [[lost films]]. By late 1930, however, most of the planned widescreen movies were shelved as studios began to feel the effects of [[The Great Depression]] and were forced to economize.

In 1953, [[20th Century Fox]] returned to the concept and began using the [[CinemaScope]] process to make widescreen movies, such as ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]''. Widescreen grew in popularity during the 1950s, and since 1960 nearly every American feature film has been widescreen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3440">'''Electronicam''' was a television recording system that shot an image on film and television at the same time through a common lens. It was developed by [[James L. Caddigan]] for the [[DuMont Television Network]] in the 1950s, before electronic recording on [[videotape]] was available. Since the film directly captured the live scene, its quality was much higher than the commonly used [[kinescope]] films, which were shot from a TV screen.

==How it worked==
[[Image:Honeymooners Electronicam.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[The Honeymooners]]'' was filmed using three Electronicams.]]
The image passes through a lens into a [[beam splitter]] that sends half the light to a 35 mm or 16 mm camera mounted on the right side of the television camera. The other half of the light passes to the other side, through a 45-degree angle mirror and into a [[video camera tube]]. Because the camera dollies had to support two cameras—one conventional electronic "image orthicon" TV camera tube, and one 35mm motion picture camera—the system was bulky and heavy, and somewhat clumsy in operation. This made complex productions problematic. Single-stage shows, such as ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', were relatively easy since they had few sets and generally small casts.

In the studio, when two or three Electronicam cameras were used, a kinescope system recorded the live feed (as broadcast), so the Electronicam films could later be edited to match.  The audio was recorded separately, onto either a [[Sound follower|magnetic fullcoat]] (1952, and all later) or as an optical soundtrack negative (pre-1952).

==Usage==
The [[DuMont Television Network]] used Electronicam in 1955 to produce most of its studio-based programming since it had (except for occasional sports events) discontinued use of [[coaxial cable]] and [[microwave]] links to connect stations. Stations would be sent films of shows for broadcast.

The [[The Honeymooners#The "Classic 39" episodes|"Classic 39"]] episodes of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' aired during the 1955–56 television season on CBS were shot with Electronicams, which meant they could be rerun on broadcast TV, and eventually transferred to [[home video]]. Without Electronicams, the half-hour ''The Honeymooners'' episodes in the 1955-56 season may have been broadcast live, and would only exist as poor-quality kinescopes.

Also, around 1956 [[United Kingdom|British]] producer [[Joseph Arthur Rank]] brought three Electronicams to the [[United Kingdom]] to experiment with, but eventually, he was disappointed with the picture quality.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

The introduction of [[Ampex]]'s [[videotape]] recorder in mid-1956 began to eliminate the need for Electronicam and similar systems, allowing electronic recording from live video cameras.

'''Ernesto de Quesada López Chaves''' (1 November 1886 — 1972) was the [[Cuba]]n-born [[impresario]] who founded [[Conciertos Daniel]], the [[Classical music|classical]] [[music management]] agency now known as [[Hispania Clásica]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ernesto de Quesada was born in the [[Oriente Province|Oriente]], in [[Manzanillo, Cuba]],&lt;ref name="FounderBio"/&gt;  when Cuba was still a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colony]] (see the [[history of Cuba]]).  After he completed [[high school]] and [[college]], he devoted himself for a time to teaching guajiros how to read, riding his horse or walking long distances to reach them.  (In Cuba, guajiro is a synonym for campesino ([[peasant]]).&lt;ref name="Barreiro"/&gt;)

In 1905, with his income from teaching and some additional funds borrowed from his parents, de Quesada went to the [[United States]].  There he studied [[English language|English]] for some months in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], attending church on Sundays to listen to the services and accustom his ears to the new language.  He enrolled at [[Harvard University]], where one of his fellow students was [[Julio C. Tello|Julio Cesar Tello]], who would later become an [[archaeologist]] in [[Peru]]. They remained friends for many years.&lt;ref name="GrandsonErnestoBiografia"/&gt;  After completing his [[philosophy]] studies at Harvard, de Quesada went to [[Germany]].

===Career===
In 1908, in [[Berlin]], de Quesada founded the concert management company Konzertdirektion H. Daniel.  As he was only 22 years old and the agency's sole proprietor, he invented an imaginary senior business partner, "Herr Heinrich Daniel," who was said to be out of town whenever anyone asked to speak to him.&lt;ref name="Anniversary"/&gt;

In 1914, on the verge of [[World War I]], de Quesada moved to [[Madrid]], there re-establishing his agency as [[Conciertos Daniel]], with plaques for "H. Daniel" and "Ympresario E. de Quesada" on the doorway, where the artists he would represent included [[Gaspar Cassadó]] and [[Andrés Segovia]].&lt;ref name="GrandsonErnestoBiografia"/&gt;  In 1916, he married Ascensión Delgado Casarreales, a graduate ([[guitar]] and [[violin]]) of the [[Madrid Conservatory|Conservatorio de Música]].

In 1917, as [[Arthur Rubinstein]]'s music manager for his concerts in Spain and Latin America (from 1916),&lt;ref name="SachsSpain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BarenboimParis"/&gt;  de Quesada travelled with him from [[Cádiz]] to [[South America]] on the [[cruiser]] ''Infanta Isabel.''&lt;ref name="GrandsonErnestoBiografia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InfantaIsabel"/&gt;  Rubinstein performed his [[Argentina]] debut concert in [[Buenos Aires]] at the [[Teatro Odéon]] ([[Teatro Colón]]?) on 2 July 1917, in a tour which included concerts in [[Montevideo]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]] and [[Valparaíso]] as well.

In Spain, Ernesto de Quesada also created “Associations for Musical Culture,”&lt;ref name="Anniversary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MusicalCultureAssociationBarcelona"/&gt;  founding an ''Asociación de Cultura Musical'' in each of more than fifty cities in [[Spain]], including small towns where people had never before heard a classical music recital.   He also loaned each of them a ''piano de cola'' — a [[grand piano]] — without asking for payment.  These associations nearly disappeared during the Spanish Civil War, as did the pianos.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[World War II]], Conciertos Daniel was primarily active in [[Latin America]],&lt;ref name="Anniversary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kosloff"/&gt;  expanding throughout the continent, where de Quesada's sons Alfonso,&lt;ref name="MonteroArrau"/&gt;  Enrique, and Ernesto Jr. worked closely with him.  (As correspondence in the mid-1940s with members of the [[Léner Quartet]] reveals, concert management tasks were not always straightforward or simple.&lt;ref name="LenerQuartet"/&gt;)  Ernesto de Quesada's youngest son, Ricardo de Quesada,&lt;ref name="RicardoMadrid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VirtuosiBookings"/&gt;  head of the agency in Madrid since his father died in 1972, reorganised it as [[Hispania Clásica]] in 1996.  One of the founder's grandsons, Enrique de Quesada, Jr.&lt;ref name="VirtuosiBookings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EnriqueJr"/&gt;  in [[Caracas]], is its director for [[Latin America]].

Ernesto de Quesada also founded La Sociedad Artística Daniel&lt;ref name="LaSociedad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StrangeMusicParalelo"/&gt;  and La Sociedad Musical Daniel.&lt;ref name="DanzaVillalon"/&gt;  La Sociedad Musical Daniel was the organizing force on the Latin American side for a twenty-eight-week U.S. government-sponsored [[ballet]] tour of Latin America in 1941,&lt;ref name="Cahan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RaucherQuesada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BriefOnlineEB"/&gt;  which was said by ''[[Dance Magazine]]'' to have been "the first example of an American government's support of dance."&lt;ref name="NaimaPrevots"/&gt;

With fellow impresario [[Sol Hurok]] and others, de Quesada was present when [[Daniel Barenboim]] (then age 13) and [[Arthur Rubinstein]] met for the first time, in [[Paris]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="BarenboimParis"/&gt;

The tour really began in the second half of February 1916 and was organised from the start by the [[Cuba]]n-born Quesada…  He had met Rubinstein at [[San Sebastián]] the previous summer and had immediately begun to organize his 1916 Spanish itinerary.  Indeed, the directors of the local Philharmonic Society in [[Bilbao]], where Rubinstein made two of his earliest appearances on the tour, on February 23 and 24, had complained that Quesada was sending them Rubinstein instead of the more celebrated [[Teresa Correño]] or [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]].

'''Fast Lane Daily''', sometimes referred to as '''FLD''', was an [[web television|Internet-based video]] newscast about the automotive industry, created by Emil Rensing, a founder of [[Next New Networks]]. Fast Lane Daily was part of [[AutoStream, Inc. and Time inc]]. Its first episode first aired on February 17, 2007. As of July 27, 2016, Fast Lane Daily aired its last episode and the show has since been put on indefinite hiatus by its owners, Time Inc., who bought them in February 2016. 

FLD was hosted by Derek DeAngelis and ran daily, Monday through Friday. [[Alex Roy]], JF Musial, and Leo Parente moved to the [[Drive (web series)|DRIVE]] channel. Past FLD hosts include Ji Young Min, Tinabeth Piña,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1897924|Tinabeth Piña}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Gizela,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1965909|Alex Gizela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrie Milbank,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|2838490|Carrie Milbank}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Feczko]], Michael Spinelli and [[Ray Wert]] of [[Jalopnik|Jalopnik.com]], [[Gumball 3000]] veteran [[Alex Roy]] of Team Polizei,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name |1745431|Alex Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Owens of Supercars.net and [[Bullrun Rally|Bullrun]] rally driver Ashley Van Dyke.

As of July, 2016, FLD had over 312,000 YouTube subscribers and shot over 2,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7nH-UajCHo |title=1,500th episode | publisher = Fast Lane Daily | date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate = April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; episodes (available on its [[YouTube]] channel), one of the highest episode counts for an internet show. Historical view count for FLD on YouTube stands at 220 million as of July, 2016.

On December 20, 2010, FLD aired its 1,000th episode. Most of the clips in the episode were recorded at the [[Nürburgring]] when the crew took a trip to [[Germany]] during Halloween of the same year. Unlike most episodes, which are normally 5 to 10 minutes in length, the 1,000th episode ran for over 20 minutes and was the first one in [[high-definition video|high definition]].
On December 10, 2014, FLD aired its 2,000th episode. The episode took place at the Hennessey Performance with Derek DeAngelis showing off the facility and cars. Unlike the 1,000th episode, the 2,000th episode is only slightly longer than a normal episode at 13 minutes.

==Format==
On January 14, 2010, [[Next New Networks]] announced that their entire automotive portfolio would continue to be produced by AutoStream.  With the move, Fast Lane Daily had a shift in production and format.  Before January 2012, news segments of Fast Lane Daily were released Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of every week while Leo Parente's motorsport segment, ''Shakedown'', was released every Friday.

Starting December 23, 2011, there were a number of changes to the show. Parente's ''Shakedown'' and Roy &amp; Musial's ''Road Testament'' are now moved to the YouTube channel [[Drive (web series)|DRIVE]] and Fast Lane Daily together with DRIVE has moved to a new studio in [[Times Square]], [[New York City]].

===Segments===
There were a total of five segments that recurred each week as part of the show. Every Monday a ''Commenter of the Week'' was recognized, every Tuesday was ''You're Doing it Wrong'', featuring a video involving a less-than-intelligent person and a car, and every Wednesday was "Friendsday Wednesday" featuring a subscriber who has done something worth mentioning during the show. On Friday, for "Rapid Fire News," Derek very quickly read off some news that happened during the week. The fifth segment was 'FLD Question of the day' where Derek answered a question that a community member had submitted.

==Awards==
At the 2008 [[Webby Awards]], Fast Lane Daily won the People's Voice Award in the Sports category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ianjenkins.net/blog/2008/05/06/fast-lane-daily-wins-a-webby-award/ |title=Fast Lane Daily Wins a Webby Award &amp;#124; Ian E. Jenkins |publisher=Ianjenkins.net |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 Webby Awards, Fast Lane Daily gained an Honoree Award in the same category.

'''''Flipper''''' is an American television program first [[broadcast]] on [[NBC]] from September 19, 1964, until April 15, 1967. Flipper, a [[bottlenose dolphin]], is the pet of Porter Ricks, Chief Warden at Coral Key Park and Marine Preserve (a fictional version of [[John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park]] in [[Key Largo, Florida|Key Largo]], Florida), and his two young sons, Sandy and Bud.  The show has been dubbed an "aquatic ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''", and a considerable amount of children's merchandise inspired by the show was produced during its first run.

== Production ==

The television show is an extension of the 1963 film ''[[Flipper (1963 film)|Flipper]]'' starring [[Chuck Connors]] and [[Luke Halpin]] as Porter and Sandy Ricks, and of its 1964 sequel, ''[[Flipper's New Adventure]]''. For the second film the producers scripted that Mrs. Ricks had died, making Porter now a [[single parent]], with [[Brian Kelly (actor)|Brian Kelly]] taking over the role as Porter Ricks but now as a trainee Park Ranger rather than a fisherman. In adapting the films to a television series, the producers gave Porter a second, younger [[son]], Bud, portrayed by [[Tommy Norden]], and the TV series sees him returning permanently to the Florida Keys as the Park Ranger of the Coral Key Marine Preserve. The [[television producer|producer]]s also departed from the films in endowing Flipper with an unnatural degree of [[Cetacean intelligence|intelligence]] and an extraordinary understanding of human motives, behavior, and vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Flipper - The Original Series: Season One  |work= [[DVD Talk]]|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27578/flipper-the-original-series-season-one/|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was created, by way of the creation of the first film, by Jack Cowden and Ricou Browning, who had experience in underwater filming and underwater performance, notably as the monster in ''[[The Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''. In Browning's second filmed portrayal of the Creature, ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]'', a scene showcases one of the film's shooting locations, [[Marineland of Florida]] (depicted with a fictionalized name), presenting several stunts performed by "'''Flippy''', the Educated Porpoise", in a form of [[product placement]]. Browning also wrote the book ''Flipper'' based on the ancient legend of Taras, a mythical founder of the Spartan City State of the same name (on the coast of Italy where modern day [[Taranto]] is located) who was rescued from shipwreck by a dolphin sent by [[Poseidon]], which was picked up and adapted by famous producer Ivan Tors into the first ''[[Flipper (1963 film)|Flipper]]'' movie.

=== Filming locations ===

''Flipper'' was filmed in Miami at [http://GreenwichStudios.com/history.html Greenwich Studios] (at the time called Ivan Tors Studios) at 12100 Ivan Tors Boulevard in Miami, Florida, USA and at [[Key Biscayne, Florida]]. Nassau was an occasional location, especially for underwater footage. The show was produced in cooperation with the [[Miami Seaquarium]], an aquarium also located on Key Biscayne in Miami.

Miami Seaquarium still presents the Flipper Show; a dolphin show in the lagoon that served as the film location for the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiseaquarium.net/ Miami Seaquarium: Tickets Prices Coupons Discounts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Miami Seaquarium set where ''Flipper'' was filmed also served as the set of another Ivan Tors production, ''[[Gentle Ben#1960s television series Gentle Ben|Gentle Ben]]''; the house where the Ricks family lived was the same house used for the Wedloe family on ''Gentle Ben.''{{citation needed|reason=Have not seen a text source or any reliable visual evidence that Gentle Ben used Seaquarium grounds or the same house|date=May 2015}} Flipper was moved to Jimbo's Shrimp (also known as Jimbo's Place), located across from Miami Seaquarium, into the care and exercise of James "Jimbo" Luznar, Sr.  Flipper lived in a pen in the cove behind Jimbo's Shrimp.

=== Role of Flipper ===

Flipper was portrayed at first by a female dolphin named Susie, though primarily by another female, Kathy, and occasionally by other females named Patty, Scotty and Squirt. Female dolphins were chosen because they are less aggressive than males and their skins (unlike the skins of male dolphins) are usually free from scars and other disfigurations acquired in altercations with other dolphins, making it easier to have them pass for the identical "Flipper".  The five dolphins performed all of Flipper's scenes except the famous tail walk, a trick they were unable to master completely. A male dolphin named Clown was brought in for scenes involving the tail walk.&lt;ref&gt;Ric O' Barry and Keith Coulbourn, ''Behind the Dolphin Smile'', Renaissance Books, 2000, {{ISBN|978-1-58063-101-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous "voice" of Flipper was actually the doctored song of a [[kookaburra]] bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Arthur|first=Nicole |date=2003-01-31 |title=Day of the Dolphin |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2003/01/31/day-of-the-dolphin/493063d2-ef69-42d5-952a-73e7a8b4c20b/ |work=Washington Post |access-date=2017-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===

The show's theme tune was credited to [[Henryk Wars|Henry Vars]] with lyrics by [[By Dunham]]. In France the melody was known as "La Romance de Paris" ("The Love Song of Paris"). The first five episodes of the second season featured a different version of the theme, with [[Frankie Randall (singer)|Frankie Randall]] singing new lyrics. After those episodes, the original style of the theme was brought back. The background music of the long underwater sequences was inspired by [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]''.

=== Broadcast history ===

Filming began in the early summer of 1964, and the first episode of Season 1 was broadcast on September 19, 1964, with the series ending with the 28th episode of Season 3 being broadcast on April 15, 1967; showing on NBC Saturday nights 7:30–8:00 pm, making 88 episodes in total. NBC continued broadcasts with repeats from season 3 until September 1967. One episode (episode 3 in Season 1 called "SOS Dolphin") was filmed earlier in 1964 as a pilot immediately after the filming of ''[[Flipper's New Adventure]]'' was completed. [[Brian Kelly (actor)|Brian Kelly]] appeared in all 88 episodes, [[Luke Halpin]] in 85 and [[Tommy Norden]] in 84 episodes. Later, reruns of the first two seasons aired January 1968 – June 1968, NBC, Sunday 6:30–7:00 pm and June 1968 – September 1968, NBC, Sunday 7:00–7:30 pm.

In its debut season in the [[1964–65 United States network television schedule]], Flipper was a considerable ratings success, rating in the Top 25 especially going up against the long-standing and popular ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' on CBS. Ratings declined only slightly in Season 2 [[1965–66 United States network television schedule]] buoyed by its proximity to NBC's popular new Saturday night shows ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[Get Smart]]''. Ratings fell sharply in Season 3 against the strong rise in ratings for Gleason's show.

== Characters and cast ==

=== Animal cast ===
[[File:Flipper 1964 2.jpg|thumb|Flipper the Dolphin.]]
* '''Flipper'''. Flipper is a [[dolphin]] and the [[companion animal]] of the Ricks family. Flipper is an extraordinarily intelligent dolphin who helps enforce regulations in the Preserve, assists Porter Ricks with rescues at sea, and keeps a watchful eye on Sandy and Bud, who he has rescued or helped rescue from danger on numerous occasions. Flipper was portrayed by five different dolphins; the most commonly used ones were named "Kathy" and "Susie."
* '''Pelican Pete'''. A [[pelican]] named Pete, depicted in the original movie as Sandy's pet before he met Flipper, had a [[recurring role]] on the show and appeared in several episodes.
* '''Additional animal cast members'''. Other animals appearing on the show included a [[Chesapeake Bay Retriever]] named Spray (real name was Chobee from [[Okeechobee, Florida]]) (seen only in a few early episodes), a [[pinniped|seal]], a baby [[elephant]], [[alligator]]s, a female [[albino]] dolphin (whose baby Flipper fathered during her only appearance, in the "White Dolphin" episode); and another female dolphin, introduced at the end of the second season, dubbed "Lorelei" by the Ricks family. Lorelei became Flipper's "girlfriend".

* '''Porter Ricks'''. [[Brian Kelly (actor)|Brian Kelly]] fills the show's moral center with his portrayal of Porter Ricks, a loving father, conscientious government employee, rugged outdoorsman, and all-around good guy. Porter is a widowed father with two sons, Sandy and Bud, and is employed as Chief Warden and Park Ranger at the fictional Coral Key Park and Marine Preserve in southern Florida. Kelly replaced Chuck Connors (the original Porter Ricks in the first movie ''[[Flipper (1963 film)|Flipper]]'') in the second movie ''[[Flipper's New Adventure]]'' although he was then only at Park Ranger training school. Reflecting on Porter being single, Brian Kelly told ''TV Guide'' (July 9, 1966): "I'm going to bring a couple of bikini girls on. I want some groovy-lookin' girls because a lot of fathers who see the show say, "Where are the chicks?". Porter's parenting style is firm yet fun as he involves his boys (particularly the older son Sandy) in his various exciting water borne tasks as Park Ranger all the while gladly allowing Flipper to befriend his sons and help with various crucial rescue efforts. 
* '''Sandy Ricks'''. [[Luke Halpin]] plays Porter's elder son Sandy. Sandy begins Season 1 as a 15-year-old outdoorsy athletic teenager sometimes given to boyish mishaps and poor choices (although usually more responsible than his impish younger brother Bud) and ends Season 3 as an 18-year-old old enough for adult responsibilities and duties. Sandy often accompanies his father on dangerous adventures and rescues at, and under the, sea. The character of Sandy is carried over from both the feature films (Halpin was the sole lead actor/character to appear in both movies and the entire TV series), where he was the one who first met Flipper and became his special friend. Halpin became an expert diver and thus was able to perform the extensive water related scenes throughout the series largely without stunt doubles. Halpin's role as Sandy Ricks catapulted him to the rarefied atmosphere of teen super-stardom, a status bolstered by his frequent appearances in just cut-down blue jeans showing his tanned athletic swimmer's build, his trademark mop of blond hair and model-quality telegenic looks. 
* '''Bud Ricks'''. Redheaded, freckle-faced [[Tommy Norden]] portrayed Porter Ricks's younger son. Bud (a character created specifically for the TV series) begins Season 1 as an impish 10-year-old boy who has a difficult time staying out of trouble. Many episodes revolve around mistakes made by Bud, intentionally or unintentionally, and his need to be rescued from the consequences. Bud is gullible and easily swallows the tall tales Hap Gorman feeds him. Bud is at home on or near the sea and loves animals of all sorts. Flipper is his special companion and he ends Season 3 as a 13-year-old able to do more of the work that his older brother Sandy does.
* '''Hap Gorman''', [[Andy Devine]] appeared five times in the show's first season as an old salt and marine carpenter named Hap Gorman. Hap was something of a bungler who tried Porter's patience. Hap, in the traditional vein for Andy Devine, enjoyed spinning yarns and tall tales about bejeweled maharajahs, faraway kingdoms and exotic ports for the amusement of skeptical Sandy and gullible Bud.
* '''Ulla Norstrand'''. Swedish-born actress [[Ulla Strömstedt]] appeared twelve times in the second season as Ulla Norstrand, an oceanographer whose work frequently took her to Coral Key Park and Marine Preserve. She was often instrumental in enforcing the park's regulations. One of her trademarks was her miniature yellow submarine she was often seen using in her oceanographic explorations, and which was sometimes pivotal in storylines. She was a potential love interest for Porter Ricks, although no serious relationship was ever shown to develop.
* '''Warden Ed Dennis''' was portrayed by Miami actor Dan Chandler. The recurring role of a Coral Key Park game warden was created by writer Maria K. Little, who needed a sidekick to play off of Porter Ricks. Dennis performed such sidekick chores as helping find a kidnapped Flipper and saving Porter Ricks from murderous lobster-poachers.  Chandler also appeared in the feature films ''[[Flipper (1963 film)|Flipper]]'' and ''[[Flipper's New Adventure]]''.
* '''Sheriff''', also '''Old Man Coleman''', were two roles portrayed by actor Eric Applewhite appearing in five episodes across all three seasons of the TV Series. His older brother George Applewhite apprised the role of '''Sheriff''' in the original feature film ''[[Flipper (1963 film)|Flipper]]''.

=== Notable guest stars ===
''Flipper'' was notable for the casting of a number of guest actors, a good portion of whom went on to stardom in later years or had already had a stellar acting career.

== Plot ==
[[File:Ricks cottage, Flipper (1964 TV series).JPG|thumb|The Ricks cottage at Coral Key Park and Marine Preserve]]
The series follows a Bottlenose Dolphin named Flipper who is the wild pet of Porter Ricks, a park warden, and his sons Sandy (15) and Bud (10). Flipper lives in a lagoon near the Ricks cottage at Coral Key Park and Marine Preserve. With the Ricks family, Flipper helps protect the park and preserve and its wild inhabitants. He is also instrumental in apprehending criminals and thugs in the park. Flipper is generally recognized by the characters in the show (and the theme song) as being a particularly intelligent and capable dolphin.  Flipper is the special companion of the youngest member of the Ricks family, Bud, and several episodes feature Flipper rescuing Bud from dangerous situations. Flipper is able to somehow communicate through different chatter like tones, head nods and shakes and others attention seeking antics with Sandy and Bud and draw their (and Porter's) attention to danger or in the direction of people needing help.  There are few women in the lives of the Ricks males but in the first season, Porter does have a date while Sandy falls for the girl operator of a floating zoo who appears in four episodes. A female oceanographer enters the series in the second season to add a feminine touch to the proceedings but little more than mild flirtations and fondness between her and Porter ensues. Promotional material for the third season announced a new girlfriend for Sandy, although she only appeared in one episode and he has an innocently flirtatious scene with another girl in a separate episode. The series is distinguished for its lush photography of subtropical Florida and its colorful underwater sequences.

== Cancellation and subsequent history ==
The last first-run episode of ''Flipper'' aired April 15, 1967. In the conclusion of a two-part episode, the characters of Sandy and Bud are written out of the show (by that time both actors [[Luke Halpin]] and [[Tommy Norden]] had grown out of their roles), as it is detailed how each plans to leave Coral Key — Sandy has been accepted to the Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut, and Bud will be attending a private school remedially in Massachusetts, as arranged by their Aunt Martha. At the same time, a new family (the Whitmans) moves to the area: a widowed mother (portrayed by [[Karen Steele]]) and her young son and daughter (portrayed by [[Stuart Getz]] and Chris Charney). The two new children are depicted as unfamiliar with maritime life, but they promptly befriend Flipper, and promise to be his new companions after Sandy and Bud leave. Plans were made for a fourth season; revolving around the Whitman children taking the role of Flipper's guardians/playmates and their mother becoming involved in a serious relationship with Porter.  It would be assumed that Sandy and Bud would make a cameo visit in an episode or two.  All this was for naught, however, as Ivan Tors chose not to continue to make a fourth season in this new format, so NBC cancelled it.&lt;ref name="smile1988"&gt;Ric O' Barry and Keith Coulbourn, ''Behind the Dolphin Smile'', Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1988, {{ISBN|0-912697-79-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Flipper'' has seen periodic [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] since its NBC [[cancellation (television)|cancellation]]. The show has aired on [[cable television|cable]]'s [[Freeform (TV channel)#Early history .281977.E2.80.9398.29|Family Channel]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Animal Planet]], [[Discovery Kids]], in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] on [[Direct-broadcast satellite television|satellite provider]] [[Voom HD Networks|Voom]]'s Family Room channel, and on [[digital subchannel]] [[Antenna TV]]. Most of the images of Flipper jumping against a skyline were not in the originally aired version, as the filming took place in an enclosed lagoon.  They were filmed at the end of the series and added for syndication.&lt;ref name="smile1988"/&gt;

The rights to ''Flipper'' were later acquired by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]], and in turn acquired by [[MGM Television]] (the company that originally produced the series). [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] owns full rights to the series; the series copyright is held by MGM's subsidiary [[Orion Pictures]] (whose own holdings include the Goldwyn library).

Flipper appears as a character in the [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[The Annoying Orange]]''.

As of November 2016, ''Flipper'' airs as one of a handful of classic TV series (alongside Ivan Tors' earlier series ''[[Sea Hunt]]'') on the primarily movie-oriented digital subchannel [[This TV]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thistv.com/view/series/673/Flipper%20(1964)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''Flipper'' and ''Sea Hunt'' began airing together on [[Light TV]].

The series was broadcast in the early 1970s in the [[USSR]] and the show was well received by the Soviet people, both old and young alike.

== Merchandise ==
''Flipper'' merchandise generated for the juvenile market during the show's first run is now scarce and collectible. ''Flipper'' vintage [[collectible]]s include: [[lunch box]]es, [[song book]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[coloring books]], a [[Whitman Publishing|Whitman novel]], [[Big Little Book]]s, [[souvenir spoon]]s, [[Whitman Publishing|Whitman]] frame tray [[puzzle]]s, a [[board game]], [[Viewmaster]] reels (based on the two-part episode "Dolphin Love"), a battery-operated "spouting dolphin" water toy, children's swim trunks with the Flipper logo, and a 1966 Bradley glow-in-the-dark watch. ''Dolphin Paradise'' is a Hangame app based on the Flipper television series.

=== Home media ===
Flipper received an incomplete VHS release during the 1990s under the title "''Flipper–Original Series''". [[MGM Home Entertainment]] (distributed by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]) released the first season on DVD on April 24, 2007. They subsequently released season 2 as an 8 disc set in June 3, 2010. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively from Amazon.com.

As of February 2017 the series is available on Blu-ray in Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=Unable to locate any blu-ray|date=March 2017}}

== Awards and recognition ==
The [[Miami Seaquarium]] celebrated the 50th Anniversary of "Flipper" in late 2013 with Tommy Norden and Ricou Browning participating along with a series of commemorative events through 2014. A previous event celebrating the 40th anniversary of ''Flipper'' in 2004 was also held with Luke Halpin and Tommy Norden. ''Flipper'' was nominated for two [[TV Land]] awards: in 2004 for the TV Land Favorite Fauna Award and, in 2003, for the TV Land Favorite Pet-Human Relationship Award. ''Flipper'' appeared twice on ''[[TV Guide]]'' covers.

==Controversy==
While the TV show itself was not controversial, several controversies have spun off of it. [[Ric O'Barry]], the head trainer of the Flipper [[Dolphins]] (and also [[Luke Halpin]]'s occasional [[stunt double]]&lt;ref name="smile1988" /&gt;), became a world-renowned animal activist after the death of the dolphin who portrayed Flipper most often. O'Barry stars in the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] award-winning documentary [[The Cove (film)|''The Cove'']], which features dolphin capture and captivity. He also wrote of his time with the Flipper movies and TV series and subsequent animal rights activism in a book entitled ''Behind the Dolphin Smile''.

'''''From Hell''''' is a [[graphic novel]] by writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Eddie Campbell]], originally published in serial form from 1989 to 1998 and collected in 1999. 

Set during the [[Whitechapel murders]] of the late [[Victorian era]], the novel speculates upon the identity and motives of [[Jack the Ripper]]. The novel depicts several true events surrounding the murders, although portions have been fictionalised, particularly the identity of the killer and the precise nature and circumstances of the murders. 

The title is taken from the first words of the [[From Hell letter|"From Hell" letter]], which some authorities believe was an authentic message sent from the killer in 1888. The collected edition is 572 pages long. The 2000 and later editions are the most common prints. The comic was loosely adapted into a [[From Hell (film)|film]], released in 2001. It was banned in Australia for a couple of months in 2000.

==About the book==
''From Hell'' was originally serialized as one of several features in ''[[Taboo (comic)|Taboo]]'', an anthology comic book published by [[Stephen R. Bissette|Steve Bissette's]] Spiderbaby Grafix. After running in ''Taboo'' #2–7 (1989–1992), Moore and Campbell moved the project to its own series, published first by [[Tundra Publishing]], then by [[Kitchen Sink Press]]. The series was published in ten volumes between 1991 and 1996, and an appendix, ''From Hell: The Dance of the Gull-catchers'', was published in 1998.  The entire series was collected in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] and published by Eddie Campbell Comics in 1999; trade paperback and hardcover versions are now published by [[Top Shelf Productions]] in the United States and [[Knockabout Comics]] in the UK. A fully colorized Master Edition was serialized starting in September 2018&lt;ref&gt;[https://ew.com/books/2018/05/31/eddie-campbell-from-hell-color/ Eddie Campbell explains why he's coloring From Hell for the first time]&lt;/ref&gt;.

''From Hell'' takes as its premise [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]'s theory that the Jack the Ripper murders were part of a [[Jack the Ripper conspiracy theories|conspiracy]] to conceal the birth of an illegitimate [[British monarchy|royal]] baby fathered by [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence]], slightly modified: the involvement of [[Walter Sickert]] is reduced, and Knight's allegation that the child's mother was a Catholic has been dropped. Knight's theories have been described as "a good fictional read" whose "conclusions have been disproved numerous times".&lt;ref&gt;[http://casebook.org/ripper_media/book_reviews/non-fiction/finalsol.html Casebook: ''Jack The Ripper: The Final Solution'']&lt;/ref&gt; In an appendix added to the collected ''From Hell'', Moore writes that he did not accept Knight's theory at face value (and he echoed the then-growing consensus that such claims were likely hoaxes), but considered it an interesting starting point for his own fictional examination of the Ripper murders, their era and impact. However, in the serialised publication of ''Dance of the Gull-Catchers'' Moore included an "author's statement" which consisted of a blown-up panel from the prologue, depicting the psychic [[Robert James Lees]] confessing that although his visions were fraudulent, they were accurate: "I made it all up, and it all came true anyway. That's the funny part."

Moore and Campbell conducted significant research to ensure plausibility and [[verisimilitude]]. The collected ''From Hell'' features over forty pages of page-by-page notes and references, indicating which scenes are based wholly on Moore's own imagination and which are based upon specific named sources. Moore's opinions on the reliability of those references are also listed. The annotations are followed by an epilogue in comics format, ''The Dance of the Gull-Catchers'', in which Moore and Campbell expand on the various theories of the Ripper crimes and the likelihood—or rather, the near-impossibility—of the true identity of the culprit ever being established.

==Plot overview==

[[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence]], also known as Prince Eddy, marries and fathers a child with Annie Crook, a shop girl in London's [[East End]]. Prince Eddy had visited the area under an assumed name and Annie is unaware of her husband's royal position. [[Queen Victoria]] becomes aware of the marriage and has Albert separated forcibly from his wife, whom she places in an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]]. Victoria then instructs her royal physician Sir [[William Gull]] to impair Annie's sanity, which he does by damaging or impairing her [[thyroid gland]]. The prince's daughter is taken to Annie's parents by the artist [[Walter Sickert]], a friend of Eddy's who had accompanied him on his trips to the East End. Her father believes the child to be his through an [[incest]]uous relationship with his daughter. Sickert reluctantly leaves the child with Annie's parents.

The potentially scandalous matter is resolved, until a group of prostitutes — Annie's friends [[Mary Jane Kelly|Mary Kelly]], [[Polly Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman|Anne Chapman]], and [[Liz Stride]] — who are aware of the illegitimate child and its royal connections, attempt to [[blackmail]] Sickert to pay off a gang of thugs who are threatening them. After Queen Victoria learns of the blackmail attempt, Gull is once again enlisted, this time to silence the group of women who are threatening the crown. The police are complicit in the crimes&amp;nbsp;— they are granted prior knowledge of Gull's intentions, and are adjured not to interfere until the plot is completed.

Gull, a high-ranking [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], begins a campaign of violence against the four women, brutally murdering them with the aid of a carriage driver, [[John Netley]]. While he justifies the murders by claiming they are a Masonic warning to an apparent [[Illuminati]] threat to the throne, the killings are, in Gull's mind, part of an elaborate mystical ritual to ensure male societal dominance over women. While targeting Kelly, Gull also kills [[Catherine Eddowes]], who was using Kelly's name as an alias. As the killings progress, Gull becomes more and more psychologically unhinged, until he finally has a full psychic vision of the future while murdering Kelly.

The story also serves as an in-depth character study of Gull; exploring his personal philosophy and motivation, and making sense of his dual role as royal assassin and [[serial killer]]. Though rooted in factual biographical details of Gull's life, Moore admitted taking substantial fictional license: for example, the real-life Gull suffered a stroke; Moore fictionalises this event as a [[theophany]], with Gull seeing "[[Jahbulon]]", a masonic figure, fundamentally altering Gull's [[world view]] and indirectly leading to the murders.

Gull takes Netley on a tour of London landmarks (including [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]'s churches), expounding on their hidden mystical significance, which is lost to the modern world. Later, Gull forces the semi-literate Netley to write the infamous [[From Hell letter]] which lends the work its title. Following this, several people write letters to the police claiming to be the murderer, and the nickname "[[Jack the Ripper]]" becomes a household name. Gull has a number of [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] experiences in the course of the murders, culminating with a vivid vision of what London will be like a century after the last murder. It is implied that, through his grisly activities, male dominance over femininity is assured, and the 20th century is thus given its dominant form, though Gull finds it disgusting nevertheless.

Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] investigates the Ripper crimes without success until a fraudulent psychic, [[Robert James Lees]], acting on a personal grudge against Gull, identifies him as the murderer. Gull confesses, and Lees and Abberline, shocked, report the matter to superiors within the police, who cover up the discovery. They inform both Abberline and Lees that Gull was operating alone, and gripped by insanity. Abberline later discovers through chance Gull's actual intentions to cover up the matter of the royal "[[Illegitimacy|bastard]]" fathered by the Duke of Clarence, and resigns from the [[Metropolitan Police]], protesting the official cover-up of the murders.

Gull is tried by a secret Freemasonic council, which determines he is insane; Gull, for his own part, refuses to submit to the council, informing them that no man amongst them may be counted as his peer, and may not therefore judge the "mighty work" he has wrought. A phony funeral is staged, Gull is imprisoned under a pseudonym "Thomas Mason", and the Freemasons frame boarding school teacher [[Montague Druitt]] as a suspect, killing him and making it look like suicide. Years later, and moments before his death, Gull has an extended mystical experience, where his spirit [[time travel|travels through time]], observing the crimes of the [[London Monster]], instigating or inspiring a number of other killers ([[Peter Sutcliffe]], [[Moors murders|Ian Brady]]), causing Netley's death, as well as serving as the inspiration for both [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' and [[William Blake]]'s painting "[[The Ghost of a Flea]]". The last experience his spirit undergoes before it "becomes God" is a view of a woman, who, in the novel's appendices, is implied to be Mary Kelly. She is apparently able to see his spirit and abjures him to begone "back to Hell".

==Interpretations and themes==
''From Hell'' was partly inspired by the title of [[Douglas Adams]]' novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in that it explores the notion that to solve a crime [[holism|holistically]], one would need to solve the entire society in which it occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Windett, Jenni Scott &amp; Guy Lawley, "Writer From Hell: the Alan Moore Experience" (interview), ''Comics Forum'' 4, p. 46, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's take on the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders is not a "[[whodunit]]": he spells out his culprit, [[William Gull]], and the ostensible reasons for his actions very early on. But as Gull remarks, "Averting Royal embarrassment is but the fraction of my work that's visible above the waterline."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Moore &amp; Eddie Campbell, ''From Hell'' Chapter 4, page 33, panel 4&lt;/ref&gt; The murders are an [[occult]] ritual, a complex [[human sacrifice]] using [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London itself as an altar. The symbolism of London's landmarks is explored in the fourth chapter, in which Gull explains his motives to his uncomprehending coachman, and employs [[psychogeography]] to tie together these landmarks with the city's history.

Gull is depicted as a [[misogynist]] who opposes [[women's suffrage]], along with other progressive movements of his time. Women had power over men once, Gull believes, and the irrational, [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] unconscious mind once dominated the rational, [[Apollo]]nian conscious mind. Moore cites writers such as [[Marilyn French]] and [[Robert Graves]], who argue (as the fictional Gull does) that women held both political and religious power prior to the rise of patriarchal religions such as Christianity. Gull is reason's lunatic: he believes he is carrying out an act of magic to enforce the rational, masculine hegemony.

''From Hell'' also explores Moore's ideas on the nature of time. Early on, Gull's friend [[James Hinton (surgeon)|James Hinton]] discusses his son [[Charles Howard Hinton|Howard]]'s theory of the "fourth dimension", which proposes that time is a spatial dimension. All time co-exists, and it is only the limits of our perception that make it appear to progress. Sequences of related events can be seen as shapes in the fourth dimension: history can "be said to have an architecture", as Gull puts it.&lt;ref&gt;Moore &amp; Campbell, ''From Hell'' chapter 2, page 15, panel 4&lt;/ref&gt; Gull's experiences seem to confirm this: he has visions of the 20th century during the murders, and as he is dying he experiences, and appears to influence, past and future events. Moore had earlier explored similar ideas in ''[[Watchmen]]'', where [[Doctor Manhattan]] perceives past, present and future simultaneously, and describes himself as "a puppet who can see the strings".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Moore &amp; Dave Gibbons, ''Watchmen'' issue 9, page 5, panel 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most elaborate theme in ''From Hell'' stems from Moore's statement&lt;ref&gt;Groth, Gary. ''Last Big Words&amp;nbsp;— Alan Moore on "Marvelman," "From Hell," "A Small Killing," and being published.'' ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' 140, February 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; that "the Ripper murders&amp;nbsp;— happening when they did and where they did&amp;nbsp;— were almost like an apocalyptic summary of... that entire Victorian age. Also, they prefigure a lot of the horrors of the 20th century." In Moore's reading of the works of contemporary artists including [[Émile Zola]] and the [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionist]] painters, the prostitute had become an icon of the working lives of the impoverished and disenfranchised. He notes that the 1880s saw the [[Mahdi]] uprisings, the first time the Western world had to face militant [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; physicists were beginning to make discoveries that would pave the way to the [[atomic bomb]]; and the growth of both [[Zionism]] and [[anti-Semitism]]. The period of the killings coincides with the conception of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the final scene alludes to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. After the final murder, during which Gull has an extended vision of 1990s England, Gull says, "It is beginning, Netley. Only just beginning. For better or worse, the twentieth century. I have delivered it."&lt;ref&gt;Moore &amp; Campbell, ''From Hell'' chapter 10, page 33, panel 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation in ''From Hell'' can be attributed to Moore's embrace of [[gnosticism]], which takes a more central role in his other work, most notably his comic series ''[[Promethea]]''.

On a more prosaic level, Moore indicts the inequalities of Victorian society, contrasting Gull and the wealthy circles he moves in with the hand-to-mouth existence of the women he targets; the moral disgust shown at the peccadilloes of the poor with the depths to which the rich are prepared to sink to protect the image of propriety; and the imaginary [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] conspiracy theories which divert the police's investigations with the real conspiracy that controls them. During one murder, scenes from the killing are interspersed with scenes from a nearby meeting of a [[socialist]] club, addressed by [[William Morris]], where a portrait of [[Karl Marx]] comes to dominate the scene. In his appendix, Moore sardonically expresses regret that England never had a [[French Revolution|revolution]] as France did.

Just about every notable figure of the period is connected with the events in some way, from "Elephant Man" [[Joseph Merrick]] to [[Oscar Wilde]], from the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] writer [[Black Elk]] to [[William Morris]], the artist [[Walter Sickert]] to [[Aleister Crowley]], who makes a brief appearance as a young boy in short trousers, sucking on a candy cane, and lecturing the police about magic.

According to his notes in his appendix, Moore was somewhat inconsistent with how "historically accurate" the events within the graphic novels are. On one hand, he revealed that he had actually written an entire scene where Abberline gets into an argument with [[Buffalo Bill]] and [[Annie Oakley]]; he rewrote it after research revealed that Buffalo Bill had left England by the time of the murders. On the other hand, again according to his own notes, he had [[William Morris]] appear in London on the night of one of the murders, although historical records show he was out of town that night. Morris, however, does not interact with any of the characters, but is simply seen reading his poem "Love Is Enough", while Gull murders Elizabeth Stride in the alley below.

In ''The Dance of the Gull Catchers'' Moore reports that he had been drawn into and even obsessed with the particulars of the Ripper murders. The Ripperologists—or "Gull Catchers" as he refers to them—are depicted as unhinged men running about with large butterfly nets, chasing details and connections, however tenuous. Initially, Moore observes them from a distance, but eventually—while researching and writing ''From Hell''—he joins them. Moore compares the multitude of increasingly outlandish Ripper theories to a [[Koch snowflake]], where a finite, fixed location, event and era (London, in late 1888) can have an [[infinity|infinite]] number of nooks and crannies. Ultimately, Moore observes that the longer the Gull Catchers chase after the Ripper, the more the ground underneath them becomes churned and unrecognisable mud; their attempts to uncover the truth only serve to obscure it and cause further confusion.

==Awards==
''From Hell'' has won several [[Eisner Awards]], including "Best Serialized Story" (1993),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner93.php 1993 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt; "Best Writer" (1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner95.php 1995 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt; 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner96.php 1996 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt; 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner97.php 1997 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt;), and "Best Graphic Album – Reprint" (2000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner00.php 2000 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt;

It also won the "[[Prix de la critique]]" at the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]] in 2001, for the French edition published by [[Delcourt (publisher)|Éditions Delcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acbd.fr/919/grands-prix-de-la-critique/2001/ Prix de la Critique 2001], [[Association des Critiques et des journalistes de Bande Dessinée|ACBD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ganapati Chakraborty''' ({{lang-bn|গণপতি চক্রবর্তী}}) (1858 - 20 November 1939) was an magician from Kolkata known for his mesmerizing tricks. He is considered to be the pioneer of modern magic in Bengal.&lt;ref name="samsad"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor1-last=Sengupta |editor1-first=Subhodh Chandra |editor2-last=Basu |editor2-first=Anjali |encyclopedia=Samsad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Bibliographical Dictionary) |title=গণপতি চক্রবর্তী |trans-title=Ganapati Chakraborty |language=Bengali |edition=4th |date=January 2002  |publisher=Shishu Sahitya Samsad |volume=Volume 1 |location=Kolkata |isbn=81-85626-65-0 |pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the mentor of [[P. C. Sorcar]] and [[K Lal]].

== Early life ==
Ganapati was born in a zamindar family in the village of Chhatra near [[Serampore]] in Hooghly district. In his childhood, he was not interested in studies. He was rather interested in singing and music. At the age of 17 or 18, he left his home for the company or Hindu monks in order to learn esoteric knowledge and supernatural healing techniques. He also came in touch with one or two magicians.&lt;ref name="samsad"/&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Great Bengal Circus members.jpg|thumb|left|Ganapati Chakraborty (seated 3rd from left) with the members of Great Bengal Circus.]]
Ganapati began his career at the Great Bengal Circus as comedian where he became famous through his fun tricks. Soon he began to show magic tricks. His two acts "Illusion Box" and "Illusion Tree" mesmerized the audience. During his 1908 Singapore tour with Professor Bose's Circus, his tricks with the cards and his vanishing act proved to be successful.&lt;ref name="sfp15101908"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=singfreepressb19081015-1.2.43|title=Bose's Circus|date=15 October 1908|work=The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser|accessdate=5 March 2015|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed his famous trick "Kangsha Karagar".&lt;ref name="samsad"/&gt; The audience believed that he was endowed with supernatural powers. He earned the accolade of the best performer in Professor Bose's Circus. He was a man of short temper and unruly speech. Because of this nature, his colleagues bestowed upon him the sobriquet - Durbasa Muni.&lt;ref name="samsad"/&gt;

Later on, he left Professor Bose's Circus and formed his own circus company with few performers from the former. He toured all over India with his own circus and earned lot of fame and money.&lt;ref name="samsad"/&gt;

== Later life ==
In his later life, Ganapati built a house and a temple in Baranagar near Kolkata. His spent the rest of his life in spiritual pursuit. He penned in book in Bengali titled 'যাদুবিদ্যা'. He decided to donate this property to Sri Bhupendra Nath Roy Chowdhury&lt;ref name="samsad"/&gt;

'''George Carl''' (7 May 1916 &amp;ndash; 1 January 2000) was a "[[vaudeville|vaudevillian]]" style comic &amp; [[clown]].  Carl was born in [[Ohio]], and started his [[comedy]] career traveling with a variety of circuses during his teenage years.  In time, Carl would become internationally famous as a clown and [[visual]] comedian.  [[Johnny Carson]], a fan of Carl's, invited him to appear on [[The Tonight Show]] on March 21, 1985 when Carl was 69.  His appearance was so well received that he was asked back within weeks for a second appearance which also received raves from viewers.
He appeared again on May 27, 1986 doing essentially his same act and received great laughter from an obviously appreciative audience.

With hardly any props,&lt;ref name="Bouissac2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Bouissac|title=The Semiotics of Clowns and Clowning: Rituals of Transgression and the Theory of Laughter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AO2CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13|date=28 May 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-2508-6|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; except for a microphone, a mic stand, his hat, and sometimes a harmonica, Carl would seemingly accidentally become tangled up in the mic cord,&lt;ref name="Schechter2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Schechter|title=The Pickle Clowns: New American Circus Comedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srrIxji0PvQC&amp;pg=PA55|year=2001|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2357-9|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; get his thumb stuck in the microphone stand and, through a flurry of silent bits, wind up accomplishing nothing at all in the time spent onstage.

At the age of 79, George Carl made his screen debut in the 1995 film ''[[Funny Bones]]'' also starring [[Jerry Lewis]].  He played an old music-hall comedian, one of the Parker brothers, who never spoke until a scene in which his character explains the reason performers perform;

"Our suffering is special. The pain we feel is worse than anyone else. But the sunrise we see is more beautiful than anyone else. The Parkers is...like the moon. There's one side forever dark. Invisible. As it should be. But remember, the dark moon draws the tides also."

Comedians using similar visual material include [[Bill Irwin|Charlie Frye, Bill Irwin]], [[Geoff Hoyle]], [[Barry Lubin]], [[Chipper Lowell]], Rob Torres, and [[Avner the Eccentric]].

Carl died of cancer in Las Vegas on January 1, 2000. &lt;ref name="lvsun"&gt;{{cite news|title=George Carl, comic performer, dies at 83|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2000/jan/02/george-carl-comic-performer-dies-at-83/|publisher=Las Vegas Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hand of Fate''''' is an [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed and published by Defiant Development for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], released in February 2015. A [[PlayStation Vita]] version was announced but ultimately cancelled due to development issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2015/07/03/hand-of-fate-ps-vita-version-cancelled/|title=Hand of Fate PS Vita Version Cancelled|date=July 3, 2015|website=PlayStation Lifestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hand of Fate'' has the player work their way through randomized dungeons, generated by cards selected from customizable decks, to try to reach a final boss of each dungeon. Most of the game is played through an in-game tabletop tableau, with the player's actions narrated and executed by the mysterious Dealer, at times requiring the player to make choices to proceed. When combat occurs, the game switches to a third-person perspective brawler-style game, requiring the player to time attacks, blocks, dodges, and other abilities to defeat enemies without losing all their health. As the player progresses, they can earn tokens, which, upon completion of a dungeon (successfully or not), gain them additional cards that they can used to customize their decks for the next dungeon run.

''Hand of Fate'' received generally positive reviews, and led to the successful [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] physical variation of the game. A sequel, ''Hand of Fate 2'', was released in November 2017.

==Gameplay==
''Hand of Fate'' is an [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] with [[roguelike]] and [[Deck-building game|deck-building]] elements. The player takes the role of a nameless hero that meets a strange Dealer voiced by Anthony Skordi, in a "cabin at the end of the world". This dealer narrates the player's adventure, dealing the game's cards, rewards, penalties, lore, and commentary. He also serves as the primary antagonist for the game.

On starting a new game, the player is given a starting deck of cards, consisting of equipment, hero class, and encounter cards. The player earns more cards as they progress in the game, which they can use to customize their deck up to a fixed size. Furthermore, the dealer has his own deck from which surprising elements such as more challenging encounters and monsters are drawn that also grows as the player gains cards and progresses through the game.

In the game's Story Mode, the player must defeat thirteen bosses: twelve court cards and the Dealer himself. These bosses, representing the royalty of each [[Suit (cards)|suit]], must be defeated in order, but the player can return to previous bosses to challenge again and unlock new rewards. After a certain number of these bosses are defeated, the player also unlocks Endless Mode, which provides an infinite number of "floors" of increasing difficulty for the player to challenge with every card they have collected up to that point.

To progress in Story Mode, the player must complete a "dungeon" by exploring two or more "floors" created by a tableau of randomized, face-down encounter cards dealt from the combined deck of ''both'' player and Dealer. In addition to random encounters, each floor also includes either an exit encounter that lets the player reach the next floor, or a boss encounter on the final floor of that dungeon. The player starts with a limited amount of health, food, and initial equipment, modified by the player's selected class card and certain conditions obtained over the course of the story. To navigate each floor of the dungeon, the player moves a token across the tableau one card at a time, revealing it if face down. When each card is encountered, the Dealer narrates the event and resolves its effects.

Events can include meeting non-player characters, shops to buy and sell cards that benefit the player for the remainder of that dungeon, enemy encounters, or chance events that may benefit or hinder the player. Some of these events include a tree of options that the player can choose, while chance is presented as four shuffled cards representing rates of success or failure. Each movement step consumes food, and certain events can cause the player to gain or lose health, food, gold, blessings, curses, or equipment. The latter three can augment the player's attack power, defensive power, health, speed, or provide special abilities or conditions both inside and out of combat.

If the player encounters a monster or maze of traps, the number and type of enemy are determined by cards drawn by the Dealer (if any). The game then enters a third-person perspective action mode, where the player can attack, dodge, reflect and counterattack enemies and traps represented by the cards that were drawn. Damage taken is reflected in the player's overall health, which can be recovered normally with food or at certain shops and healers. On completing some encounters, the Dealer will present special tokens representing new cards that the player will receive at the conclusion of that dungeon, regardless of whether they won or were defeated.

If the player's character loses all of their health (i.e., by encounter or starvation) or chooses to forfeit from the in-game menu, they lose that dungeon, and the board is reset after they receive their tokens. If the player successfully beats the dungeon's boss, they progress one step forward in the story. The Dealer awaits the player for the final showdown and confrontation, so the player must pay close attention to [[Deck-building game|deck-building]], strategy, tactics, and chance in order to succeed.

==Development==
''Hand of Fate'' was first shown at the 2013 [[Game Developers Conference]].  A playable demo build was shown to the public at [[PAX Australia]] in July 2013.  By this point, the game had been in development for under six months.&lt;ref name="unity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/showcase/case-stories/hand-of-fate | title=Roll Your Own | work=[[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] | date=January 5, 2015 | accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/blogs/screenplay/hand-of-fate-brisbane-indie-talks-crowdfunding-design-and-inspiration-20131212-2z6uu.html| title=Screen Play: Hand of Fate: Brisbane indie talks crowdfunding, design, and inspiration| author=James Dominguez| work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| date=2013-12-12| accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defiant Development are a team of approximately fifteen based in [[Brisbane]], they described ''Hand of Fate'' as their "first big push" onto PC platforms following their previous [[Mobile game|mobile projects]].  Like all other Defiant games, ''Hand of Fate'' is built in [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]].&lt;ref name="unity" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/12/the-kickstarter-pitch-hands-of-fate/| title=The Kickstarter Pitch: Hands Of Fate| author=Mark Serrels| work=[[Kotaku|Kotaku Australia]]| date=2013-12-06| accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was part funded through a [[Kickstarter]] crowdfunding campaign.  It was one of the first Australian projects to launch on Kickstarter.  The campaign launched in November 2013 and concluded in December 2013, achieving its {{AUD|50,000|link=yes}} target.  Not only was the campaign a financial success, it also allowed Defiant to build an audience and get feedback on pre-release builds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pcauthority.com.au/News/363993,aussie-game-hand-of-fate-launches-on-kickstarter.aspx| title=Aussie game Hand of Fate launches on Kickstarter| author=David Hollingworth| work=[[Atomic (magazine)|Atomic]]| date=2013-11-13| accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/defiant/hand-of-fate-a-card-game-that-comes-to-life/description| title=Hand of Fate, a card game that comes to life| author=Defiant Development| publisher=[[Kickstarter]]| date=2013-11-12| accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Greenlight campaign was launched simultaneously so that the game could be released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]], and the game was approved in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/190389431/1384298233 | title=Hand of Fate is now on Kickstarter | work=Steam Community | first=Morgan | last=Jaffit | date=November 12, 2013 | accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/190389431/1389138668 | title=We're Greenlit! | work=Steam Community | first=Morgan | last=Jaffit | date=January 14, 2014 | accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Board game===
Defiant worked with the board game development company Rule &amp; Make to transition the video game into a [[deck-building game]] called ''Hand of Fate: Ordeals''. The board game allows for one to four players to cooperatively work together to process through quests in a similar manner as the video game. They sought about $22,000 in crowd-funding for publication via a Kickstarter campaign in May 2017; the campaign surpassed its goal within a day, and ended with more than $360,000 pledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/05/hand-of-fate-board-game-passes-kickstarter-goal-in-a-day/ | title = Hand Of Fate Board Game Passes Kickstarter Goal In A Day | first = Alex | last = Walker | date =  May 25, 2017 | accessdate = June 21, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
In July 2016, Defiant Development partnered with [[IndieBox]] to produce an exclusive, custom-designed, physical release of ''Hand of Fate''. This individually-numbered collector’s box included a themed [[USB flash drive|USB drive]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; with [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free copy of the game, official soundtrack, instruction manual, [[Steam (software)|Steam]] key, and several custom-made collectibles.

[[File:Home zone in Wonford.jpg|thumb|350px|Entrance to a home zone in [[Wonford]]]]
A '''home zone''' is a [[living street]] (or group of streets) as implemented in the [[United Kingdom]], which are designed primarily to meet the needs of [[pedestrian]]s, [[cyclist]]s, children and residents and where the speeds and dominance of the [[car]]s is reduced.

==History==

===Background===
Legislation was introduced by the [[Highway Act 1835]] which banned the playing of football and games on the highway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm|title=Origins of Rugby|work=Rugby Football History|accessdate=2010-04-14|quote="football for the common man was being suppressed, notably by the 1835 highways act which forbade the playing of football on highways and public land - which is where most games took place"}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a maximum penalty of up to forty [[shillings]] (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2|1835|2015|r=2}}}} as of 2015{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[#opsi1835|Parliament (1835)]] para 72&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 [[Taverner John Miller]], MP for Colchester reported to the House of Commons that in the previous year 44 children had been sent to prison in London and [[Middlesex]] for failure to pay fines for playing in the street, highlighting the case of a 12-year-old boy sent to prison for 5 days for playing [[rounders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1860/apr/20/observations|title=Observations|publisher=Hansard|quote=The House would be surprised to hear that under that Act, no fewer than forty-four children were sent to prison in the metropolis last year, and since the commencement of this year twenty-five had been sent to prison. He would mention particularly two or three of these cases. George Dunn, aged twelve years, was sent to gaol for five days for playing at a game called "rounders" in which the boys stood in a ring and knocked a hall from one to another.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Nancy Astor]] MP noted in the Commons that "There is no more pitiable sight in life than a child which has been arrested for playing in the street".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1926/apr/28/recreation-facilities-urban-areas#S5CV0194P0_19260428_HOC_361|title=RECREATION FACILITIES (URBAN AREAS)|work=Hansard|quote=There is no more pitiable sight in life than a child which has been arrested for playing in the street.

The other night, I went to see 50 of these children, tiny children some of them, ranging from 10 years of age}},&lt;/ref&gt; By 1935 over 2,000 young people under the age of seventeen are prosecuted for playing in the streets.&lt;ref name=PlayStreetsInLondon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonplay.org.uk/file/1333.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090729220406/http://www.londonplay.org.uk/file/1333.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-07-29|title=Play Streets in London timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] became Transport Minister and initiated a number of [[road safety]] schemes in response the rising number of [[Reported Road Casualties Great Britain|Road Casualties in Great Britain]]; these included the [[zebra crossing]] and a proposal to introduce play streets to the UK, which had been successfully operating in the USA.&lt;ref name=PlayStreetsInLondon/&gt; Following a trial of 200 Play Streets in [[Manchester]] and [[City of Salford|Salford]] from 1936, the Street Playground Act 1938 allowed councils to designate streets as playgrounds where games could be played.

In 1957 the Transport Minister was asked in the Commons if he was aware that playground streets regulations were being ignored and were frequently used by through traffic; the Minister responded saying that the size of Playground Streets signs had recently been increased in size to make them more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1957/apr/03/play-streets#S5CV0568P0_19570403_HOC_134|title=Play Streets|quote=Mr. Page asked the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation whether he is aware of the dangers to children in streets designated as "play streets", when those streets are used by through traffic and whether he will take steps by means of the Highway Code or otherwise, to draw the attention of drivers to the fact 387 that it is an offence to drive a vehicle in a play street except when calling at premises in the street}}&lt;/ref&gt; Play street legislation was included in section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/16/section/49/enacted|title=Road Traffic Act 1960 Section 49 - Power of local authorities to prohibit traffic on roads to be used as playgrounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1965/jun/29/play-streets#S5CV0715P0_19650629_CWA_90|title=Play Streets|work=Hansard|quote=Local authorities were advised in a Ministry of Transport Circular No. 787 dated 12th July, 1961, to consider using the powers to make Street Playground Orders under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1960, as a contribution to the safety of children in urban areas where there is insufficient recreational space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963 there were 750 such streets around the country,&lt;ref name=Marles1963/&gt; but there was also growing conflict between the needs of children and the needs of motorists. In that year [[Ernest Marples]], the Transport minister, was asked in the Commons if he could make a statement about the issue of car parking in play street; he responded by indicating that he had only occasionally received complaints about parking issues in play streets.&lt;ref name=Marles1963&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1963/jul/10/play-streets|title=Play Streets|quote=Mr. Spriggs asked the Minister of Transport what evidence he has of car parking in official play streets; and if he will make a statement on the working of the Street Playgrounds Act, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year a petition was presented in the Commons from residents objecting to the illegal use of their playground street in Westminster being used by through-traffic and by people parking cars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/aug/01/passmore-street-city-of-westminster|title=Passmore Street, City of Westminster|work=Hansard|quote=I wish to present a Petition to this honourable House on behalf of 20 residents in Passmore Street in the City of Westminster. The Petition relates that this is an official street playground, but children play there at risk of their lives because of the abuse by motorists, and parkers of cars}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the minister was also questioned in the Commons about a recently approved Playgrounds Street Order for a number of streets in Newcastle which was reported to have been opposed by all residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1963/aug/01/play-streets-newcastle-upon-tyne#S5CV0682P0_19630801_CWA_189|title=Play Streets, Newcastle-upon-Tyne|quote=Mr. R. W. Elliott asked the Minister of Transport whether he is aware that in confirming the Newcastle-upon-Tyne (Street Playgrounds) (No. 1) Order, 1963, he ignored the objections of nearly all of the residents of the three streets named in the order}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 [[Trevor Huddleston]], the [[Bishop of Stepney]] commented that Britain appeared to prefer motor cars to children ‘by cluttering up Play Streets with parked cars'.&lt;ref name=PlayStreetsInLondon/&gt; By the 1980s Playgrounds Streets had been largely forgotten; there were streets which retained the signage and accompanying traffic restrictions, however residents' parked cars left no space for play.&lt;ref name=PlayStreetsInLondon/&gt;

===Current legislation===
The main enabling legislation for home zones is given in section 268 of the [[Transport Act 2000]] which allows the creation of 'use orders' which are orders that 'permit the use of a road for purposes other than passage'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/38/section/268|title=Transport Act 2000 Section 268}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Farley Bank, a [[cul-de-sac]] in Hastings was designated as a Play Street giving children traffic-free space for play between 8am and sunset.&lt;ref name=PlayStreetsInLondon/&gt;

Further guidelines relating to England in circular 02/2006: 'The Quiet Lanes and Home Zones (England) Regulations 2006'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/homezones/circular22006thequietlanesan5740?version%3D1|title=circular22006thequietlanesan5740|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070130011647/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/homezones/circular22006thequietlanesan5740?version=1|archivedate=30 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
These principles are similar to those of the ''[[shared space]]'' type schemes, which apply also to a wider range of environments and follow closely the pattern of the Dutch [[woonerf]] schemes.

Encouraging children's play is an important aim of many home zone schemes. Home zones have a very good safety record, but are not primarily designed as road safety schemes.

Home zones are encouraged by the UK Government as part of new residential areas. Although it is not possible for prospective residents to be involved in the design of new streets, steps can be taken to involve them in their maintenance and management.  Residents must be need to be consulted by the local Traffic Authority on the precise uses that can take place on the street (specified through a 'Use Order') and the appropriate speed of traffic on the street (specified through a 'Speed Order') before the home zone can be legally designated and signed.

Home zones often involved the use of shared space, where the street is not strongly divided into exclusive pedestrian and traffic areas.  Concerns have been expressed over the inability of blind and partially sighted people to use shared space streets.  Providing a clear route for pedestrians that is kept free of traffic, by using street furniture for example, is one way of meeting the needs of the visually impaired.

Well-designed home zones often include features such as benches, tables and play equipment to encourage social interaction.  Street trees and areas of planting, ideally maintained by residents, will often feature. On-street parking also forms part of the layout in most schemes.

Traffic speeds are kept low - with a typical target speed being around 20&amp;nbsp;km/h (10-15&amp;nbsp;mph) - through the overall design of the street and features such as sharp changes of direction for traffic and narrowings where only one motor vehicle can pass at a time.  Traditional [[traffic calming]] features such as road humps can also be used, but should be integrated into the design rather than being added as an engineered afterthought.

Examples of UK practice include [[Staiths South Bank]] in [[Gateshead]], which at over 600 homes was the largest newbuild home zone development in the UK at the time it received planning consent. Most contemporary UK schemes have involved public realm works to existing streets in older Victorian housing areas, often to meet regeneration or traffic calming objectives.

This has effectively been the situation since the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]]. Many films using [[computer generated imagery]] have featured synthetic images of human-like characters [[digital compositing|digitally composited]] onto the real or other simulated film material.

{{main|History of computer animation|Timeline of computer animation in film and television}}
* '''In 1971''' [[Henri Gouraud (computer scientist)|Henri Gouraud]] made the first [[Computer graphics|CG]] [[geometry]] [[digitization|capture]] and representation of a human face. Modeling was his wife Sylvie Gouraud. The 3D model was a simple [[wire-frame model]] and he applied [[Gouraud shading|the Gouraud shader he is most known for]] to produce the first known representation of human-likeness on computer [http://interstices.info/jcms/c_25256/images-de-synthese-palme-de-la-longevite-pour-lombrage-de-gouraud (view images)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Images de synthèse : palme de la longévité pour l’ombrage de Gouraud|url=http://interstices.info/jcms/c_25256/images-de-synthese-palme-de-la-longevite-pour-lombrage-de-gouraud}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''1972''' short film ''[[A Computer Animated Hand]]'' by [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Fred Parke]] was the first time that [[computer-generated imagery]] was used in film to simulate moving human appearance. The film featured a computer simulated hand and face [http://vimeo.com/16292363 (watch film here)].
* The '''1976''' film ''[[Futureworld]]'' reused parts of ''A Computer Animated Hand'' on the big screen.
* The '''1983''' [[Musique Non-Stop#Music video|music video for song Musique Non-Stop]] by German band [[Kraftwerk]] aired in 1986. Created by the artist [[Rebecca Allen (artist)|Rebecca Allen]], it features non-realistic looking, but clearly recognizable computer simulations of the band members.
* The '''1994''' film [[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]] was the first film production to make use of digital compositing of a computer simulated representation of a face onto scenes filmed using a [[body double]]. Necessity was the muse as the actor [[Brandon Lee]] portraying the protagonist was tragically killed accidentally on-stage.
* In '''[[SIGGRAPH]] 2000''' [[Paul Debevec]] et al. of [[University of Southern California|USC]] presented a method to capture the reflectance field over the human face with their first version of a [[light stage]].&lt;ref name="Deb2000"/&gt; 
[[File:BSSDF01_400.svg|thumb|right|300px|BRDF vs. subsurface scattering inclusive BSSRDF i.e. [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function#Overview of the BxDF functions|Bidirectional scattering-surface reflectance distribution function]]]]
* In '''2003''' [[audience]] debut of photo realistic human-likenesses in the 2003 films ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' in [[The Matrix Reloaded#Visual effects|the burly brawl sequence]] where up-to-100 [[Agent Smith]]s fight [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and in ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' where at the start of the end showdown Agent Smith's [[cheekbone]] gets punched in by Neo leaving the digital look-alike unnaturally unhurt. The Matrix Revolutions bonus [[DVD]] documents and depicts the process in some detail and the techniques used, including [[facial motion capture]] and [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]al [[motion capture]], and [[wikt:projection|projection]] onto models.
* In '''2003''' [[The Animatrix#Final Flight of the Osiris|''The Animatrix: Final Flight of the Osiris'']] a [[state-of-the-art]] want-to-be human likenesses not quite fooling the watcher made by [[Square Pictures#Square Pictures|Square Pictures]].
* In '''2003''' digital likeness of [[Tobey Maguire]] was made for movies ''[[Spider-man 2]]'' and ''[[Spider-man 3]]'' by [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]].&lt;ref name="Pig2005"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''2009''' Debevec et al. presented new digital likenesses, made by [[Image Metrics]], this time of actress [[Emily O'Brien]] whose reflectance was captured with the USC light stage 5&lt;ref name="Deb2009"&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_debevec_animates_a_photo_real_digital_face.html In this TED talk video] at 00:04:59 you can see ''two clips, one with the real Emily shot with a real camera and one with a digital look-alike of Emily, shot with a simulation of a camera - &lt;u&gt;Which is which is difficult to tell&lt;/u&gt;''. Bruce Lawmen was scanned using USC light stage 6 in still position and also recorded running there on a [[treadmill]]. Many, many digital look-alikes of Bruce are seen running fluently and natural looking at the ending sequence of the TED talk video.&lt;/ref&gt; Motion looks fairly convincing contrasted to the clunky run in the [[Animatrix#Final Flight of the Osiris|''Animatrix: Final Flight of the Osiris'']] which was [[state-of-the-art]] in 2003 if photorealism was the intention of the [[animators]].
* In '''2009''' a digital look-alike of a younger [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was made for the movie ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' though the end result was critiqued as unconvincing. Facial geometry was acquired from a 1984 mold of Schwarzenegger.
* In '''2010''' [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released a sci-fi sequel entitled ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' with a digitally rejuvenated digital look-alike of actor [[Jeff Bridges]] playing the [[antagonist]] [[List of Tron characters#CLU|CLU]].
*In '''SIGGGRAPH 2013''' [[Activision]] and USC presented a [[real time computing|real time]] "Digital Ira" a digital face look-alike of Ari Shapiro, an ICT USC research scientist,&lt;ref name="reform_youtube2015"&gt;

== Key breakthrough to photorealism: reflectance capture ==
In [[SIGGRAPH]] 2000 [[Paul Debevec]] et al. of USC presented their method to [[reflectance capture|capture the reflectance field]] with their extremely simple [[light stage]].&lt;ref name="Deb2000"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Debevec
  | first = Paul
  | author-link = Paul Debevec
  | title = Acquiring the reflectance field of a human face
  | work =
  | publisher = ACM
  | year = 2000

  | format =
  | doi = 10.1145/344779.344855
  | accessdate =  2017-05-24}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific breakthrough required finding the [[subsurface scattering|subsurface light component]] (the simulation models are glowing from within slightly) which can be found using knowledge that light that is reflected from the oil-to-air layer retains its [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and the subsurface light loses its polarization. So equipped only with a movable light source, movable video camera, 2 polarizers and a computer program doing extremely simple math and the last piece required to reach photorealism was acquired.&lt;ref name="Deb2000"/&gt;

For a believable result both light [[Reflection (computer graphics)|reflected]] from skin ([[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function|BRDF]]) and within the skin (a special case of [[Bidirectional transmittance distribution function|BTDF]]) which together make up the [[bidirectional scattering distribution function|BSDF]] must be captured and simulated.

== Capture ==
[[File:VIUscan handheld 3D scanner in use.jpg|thumb|360px|right|Hand held [[3D scanning|three-dimensional scanner]].]]
* The 3D [[geometry]] and [[texture mapping|textures]] are captured onto a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[computer model|model]] by [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] the target by means of [[3D scanning]] with an [[RGB]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|XYZ]] scanner such as [[Arius3d]] or [[Cyberware (company)|Cyberware]] (textures from photos, not pure RGB XYZ scanner), [[Photogrammetry#Stereophotogrammetry|stereophotogrammetrically]] from [[multi-camera setup|synchronized photos]] or even from enough repeated non-simultaneous [[photography|photos]]. 
* For believable results also the [[reflectance field]] must b.e captured or an approximation must be picked from the libraries to form a 7D reflectance model of the target.

== Synthesis ==
The whole process of making digital look-alikes i.e. characters so lifelike and realistic that they can be passed off as pictures of humans is a very complex task as it requires photorealistically [[3D modeling|modeling]], [[animating]], [[cross-mapping]], and [[3D rendering|rendering]] the [[soft body dynamics]] of the human appearance.

Synthesis with an [[actor]] and suitable [[algorithm]]s is applied using powerful [[computer]]s.  The actor's part in the synthesis is to take care of mimicking human [[Facial expression|expressions]] in still picture synthesizing and also human movement in [[motion picture]] synthesizing. Algorithms are needed to simulate laws of [[physics]] and [[physiology]] and to map the models and their appearance, movements and interaction accordingly.

Often both [[physics]]/[[physiology]] based (i.e. [[skeletal animation]]) and [[image-based modeling and rendering]] are employed in the synthesis part. Hybrid models employing both approaches have shown best results in realism and ease-of-use.

Using [[displacement mapping]] plays an important part in getting a realistic result with fine detail of skin such as [[Sweat gland|pore]]s and [[wrinkle]]s as small as 100 [[micrometre|µm]].

== Applications ==

Main applications fall within the domains of [[virtual cinematography]], computer and [[video games]] and [[covert]] [[disinformation]] [[Offensive (military)|attack]]s.

Furthermore, some research suggests that it can have [[Therapy|therapeutic effects]] as "[[psychologist]]s and [[Mental health counselor|counselor]]s have also begun using [[avatar (computing)|avatars]] to deliver therapy to clients who have [[phobias]], a history of [[Trauma (psychology)|trauma]], [[addiction]]s, [[Asperger’s syndrome]] or [[social anxiety]]."&lt;ref name="Mur2011"/&gt; The strong memory imprint and brain activation effects caused by watching a digital look-alike avatar of yourself is dubbed the [[doppelgänger effect]].&lt;ref name="Mur2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The doppelgänger effect can heal when covert disinformation attack is exposed as such to the targets of the attack.

The [[speech synthesis]] is verging on being completely indistinguishable from a real human's voice with the 2016 introduction of audio generation software [[Adobe Voco]], a prototype slated to be a part of the [[Adobe Creative Suite]] and [[DeepMind WaveNet]], a prototype from [[Google]].&lt;ref name=deepmind.com2016&gt;

This coupled with the fact that (as of 2016) techniques which allow [[Real-time computing#Near real-time|near real-time]] [[forgery|counterfeiting]] of [[facial expressions]] in existing 2D video have been believably demonstrated increases the stress on the disinformation situation.&lt;ref name=Thi2016/&gt;

== Products ==

=== Introduction ===
Since Kakao Friend's character products have been growing mainly in the market of Kidult culture, Kakao Friends officials stated that they will make character goods by paying attention to these parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.the-pr.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=12992|title=‘카톡개’ 힘받은 다음카카오, 캐릭터 사업 확 키운다 - 더피알|access-date=2017-05-30|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Distribution ===
In July 2014, the Daum Kakao partnered with [[Samlip Food]] and launched four kinds of "Shanni Kakao Friends Bread". In the early four species, there were about 130 kinds of sticky cacao friends' strips. In February 2015, they launched a brand of toothpaste with Kakao friend characters on it, in collaboration with LG H &amp; H. An industry official stated that although they had put their company's character on children's products before, this was the first attempt to put their characters on adult products.
=== Foods ===
In May 2015, [[Burger King]] collaborated with Kakao Friends and offered a Kakao Friend Doll if one made an order for more than a certain price in the store. [8] [[Baskin Robbins]] has also sold ice cream cakes that featured Apeach and Muzi's faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?SCD=JC21&amp;newsid=02663366609367936&amp;DCD=A00302&amp;OutLnkChk=Y|title=식품 프랜차이즈, 캐릭터 활용 마케팅 `봇물`|last=무단전재|first=Ⓒ 종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리-상업적|last2=금지|first2=재배포|date=2015-05-11|website=edaily|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Game ===
In August 2015, the Daum Kakao launched 'Friend's Pop', the first mobile game that utilized the Kakao Friend character, and launched 'Friends Run', the sequel, in May 2016. Both games were rated top 10 in the Google Play sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=201605316100v|title='프렌즈런'도 Top10 진입… 카카오프렌즈 연타석 홈런|date=2016-05-31|work=hankyung.com|access-date=2017-05-30|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finance ===
In November 2014, the Daum Kakao collaborated with Woori Bank to launch the 'Woori Bank Wallet Kakao Bankbook', a design account book with a bank account and a Kakao friends character account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fntimes.com/paper/view.aspx?num=135084|title=우리·하나 ‘뱅크월렛카카오’ 앞선 출시|last=FNTIMES|website=한국금융신문|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, in conjunction with Hana Card, KakaoPay's exclusive check card was launched using the Kakao Friend character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.viva100.com/main/view.php?key=20150603010000630|title=다음카카오, 카카오프렌즈 담은 ‘하나 체크카드’ 출시|website=100세시대의 동반자 브릿지경제|language=ko|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Friends shop ==
Beginning in Sinchon in April 2014, the company opened a store in the form of a pop-up store in major department stores in major cities such as Daegu and Busan, and several stores were established as regular stores. In addition to the character products sold in stores, KaKao Friends characters are used in collaboration with other companies in other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://store.kakaofriends.com/en/index|title=KAKAO FRIENDS|website=store.kakaofriends.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minnesang''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmɪnəˌzaŋ|lang}}, "love song") was a tradition of lyric- and song-writing in Germany that flourished in the [[Medieval German literature#Middle High German|Middle High German period]]. This period of [[medieval German literature]] began in the 12th century and continued into the 14th. People who wrote and performed {{Lang|de|Minnesang}} were known as '''Minnesänger''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmɪnəˌzɛŋɐ|lang}}, ''minnesingers''), and a single song was called a '''{{Lang|de|Minnelied}}'''. 

The name derives from ''[[wikt:Minne#German|minne]]'', the [[Middle High German]] word for love, as that was Minnesang's main subject.  The ''Minnesänger'' were similar to the [[Occitan language|Provençal]] [[troubadour]]s and northern [[French language|French]] ''[[trouvère]]s'' in that they wrote love poetry in the tradition of [[courtly love]] in the [[High Middle Ages]].

==Social status==
In the absence of reliable biographical information, there has been debate about the social status of the ''{{Lang|de|Minnesänger}}''. Some clearly belonged to the higher [[nobility]] – the 14th century [[Codex Manesse]] includes songs by dukes, counts, kings, and the Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]]. Some ''Minnesänger'', as indicated by the title ''[[Meister]]'' (master), were clearly educated commoners, such as Meister [[Konrad von Würzburg]]. It is thought that many were ''[[ministerialis|ministeriales]]'', that is, members of a class of lower nobility, [[vassal]]s of the great lords. Broadly speaking, the ''Minnesänger'' were writing and performing for their own social class at court, and should be thought of as courtiers rather than professional hired musicians. [[Friedrich von Hausen]], for example, was part of the entourage of [[Friedrich Barbarossa]], and died on crusade. As a reward for his service, [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] was given a [[fief]] by the Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

Several of the best known Minnesänger are also noted for their epic poetry, among them [[Heinrich von Veldeke]], [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] and [[Hartmann von Aue]].

==History==
The earliest texts date from perhaps 1150, and the earliest named Minnesänger are [[Der von Kürenberg]] and [[Dietmar von Aist]], clearly writing in a native German tradition in the third quarter of the 12th century. This is referred to as the Danubian tradition.

From around 1170, German lyric poets came under the influence of the Provençal [[troubadour]]s and the French ''[[trouvère]]s''. This is most obvious in the adoption of the [[strophic form]] of the ''[[canzone]]'', at its most basic a seven-line strophe with the rhyme scheme ab|ab|cxc, and a musical AAB structure, but capable of many variations.

A number of songs from this period match ''trouvère'' originals exactly in form, indicating that the German text could have been sung to an originally French tune, which is especially likely where there are significant commonalities of content. Such songs are termed [[contrafacta]]. For example, [[Friedrich von Hausen]]'s "Ich denke underwilen" is regarded as a contrafactum of [[Guiot de Provins]]'s "Ma joie premeraine".

By around 1190, the German poets began to break free of Franco-Provençal influence. This period is regarded as the period of Classical Minnesang with [[Albrecht von Johansdorf]], [[Heinrich von Morungen]], [[Reinmar von Hagenau]] developing new themes and forms, reaching its culmination in [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], regarded both in the Middle Ages and in the present day as the greatest of the Minnesänger.

The later Minnesang, from around 1230, is marked by a partial turning away from the refined ethos of classical minnesang and by increasingly elaborate formal developments. The most notable of these later ''Minnesänger'', [[Neidhart von Reuental]] introduces characters from lower social classes and often aims for humorous effects.

==Melodies==
Only a small number of Minnelied melodies have survived to the present day, mainly in manuscripts dating from the 15th century or later, which may present the songs in a form other than the original one. Additionally, it is often rather difficult to interpret the [[musical notation]] used to write them down. Although the contour of the [[melody]] can usually be made out, the [[rhythm]] of the song is frequently hard to fathom.

There are a number of recordings of Minnesang using the original melodies, as well as Rock groups such as [[Ougenweide]] performing songs with modern instruments.

==Later developments==
In the 15th century, Minnesang developed into and gave way to the tradition of the [[Meistersinger|Meistersänger]]. The two traditions are quite different, however; Minnesänger were mainly aristocrats, while Meistersänger usually were commoners.

At least two [[opera]]s have been written about the Minnesang tradition: [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' and [[Richard Strauss]]' ''[[Guntram]]''.

== History ==
Nue Agency was founded in 2008 by Jesse Kirshbaum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infinitemag.net/2014/04/jesse-kirshbaum-renaissance-man-2/#sthash.D6DUMdfX.dqYb4Seh.dpbs |title= Jesse Kirshbaum – The Renaissance Man |publisher=Infinite Mag |date=2014-04-07 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1563099/jesse-kirshbaum-talks-flashfwd-awards-music-tech-more |title= Jesse Kirshbaum Talks FlashFWD Awards, Music Tech, More |publisher=Billboard |date=2013-05-21 |accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; who still serves as the company’s CEO. Soon after, Alex Kirshbaum (Jesse’s brother) would agree to join the company and move back to New York from Florida where he was working in finance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2842">Kolektiv '''Narobov''' is a performing arts collective from Ljubljana, Slovenia. In their very beginnings, the members of the collective have been trained in the Northamerican style of theatre improvisation, influenced by some of its most notable practitioners, such as [[Keith Johnstone]], [[Del Close]], [[Action Theatre (Ruth Zaporah)|Ruth Zaporah]], Randy Dixon, and others. However, ever since they have been developing their unique approach to improvisation, combining theatre improvisation techniques with the influences of physical theatre, contemporary dance and clowning. Kolektiv Narobov has made significant steps in applying the principles of spontaneous composition and live interaction with the audience, as done in theatre improvisation, into various other styles and media. These range from experimental theatre, clown and cabaret pieces to site-specific performances and radio plays, all the way to film.

Since the founding of the collective in 2004, Kolektiv Narobov has reached international acclaim, touring, guest-performing and teaching all across Europe, Canada and the United States.

In 2013, Kolektiv Narobov has joined Zavod Federacija Ljubljana, a big network of Slovenian artists who offer each other organisational, artistic and production support.

'''Pan-kun''' (パン君, born October 1, 2001) is a young [[chimpanzee]] in Japan often featured on the [[Nippon Television|NTV]] television show ''Tensai! Shimura Dōbutsuen'' (''天才！志村動物園'', lit. ''Genius! Shimura Zoo'') and the TBS program ''Dōbutsu Kisō Tengai!'' (''どうぶつ奇想天外!'', lit. ''Unbelievable Animals!'').  Most of the segments feature him and his [[bulldog]] friend, James, embarking on a variety of "human" tasks, like buying groceries, planting a rice paddy, or catching insects.

Pankun is now owned by Cuddly Dominion, a zoo located beside the volcano [[Mount Aso]], in the [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] of [[Kyūshū]]. After moving in, Pankun has turned into the main event of the zoo, featuring daily stage shows of various themes in Japanese.

== Attack ==

In 2012 when Pankun was performing for the Aso Cuddly Dominion Zoo, he attacked a student trainee staff and severely injured her. The attack was sudden and it left "cuts on her forehead, ears, ankles, and back." The woman was flown by a helicopter to a hospital where she was hospitalized for weeks.  As a result, Pankun was forced to retire from the show business in the Cuddly Dominion zoo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japanprobe.com/2012/09/07/famous-performing-chimpanzee-pan-kun-viciously-mauls-woman/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peta.org/blog/woman-mauled-aggravated-ape-performer/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy of the show ==

The show has also been translated into international versions; for Nickelodeon in India as ''The Munnabhai Show'', for JET TV in Taiwan (狗狗猩猩大冒險), for [[Modern Nine TV|Modern Nine]] in Thailand (ขำกลิ้งลิงกับหมา) and TVB in Hong Kong (阿笨與阿占) as ''[[The Adventures of Pan and James: Chimpanzee and Bulldog on Errands]]'', winning Best Foreign Purchased Program at the 2006 [[TVB Anniversary Awards]].

The '''Playing Cards Act''' is a law in [[Thailand]] that prohibits individuals from owning more than 120 [[playing cards]] that have not been registered by the Excise Department.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thailawforum.com/laws/Playing%20cards.pdf|title = PLAYING CARDS ACT, B.E. 2486 (1943) (unofficial translation)|date = |access-date = 2016-02-04|website = |publisher = Thai Law Forum|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current law was passed in 1943, superseding previous acts. The Playing Cards Acts are part of Thailand's strict anti-gambling laws dating back to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Thai police arrest elderly bridge players in Pattaya|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-35491852|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure legal possession of playing cards, under Section 12 of the law, a competent official has the power to enter anywhere between sunrise and sunset to conduct a search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WAGERING YOUR FREEDOM; Part three|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/377807/|accessdate=29 July 2017|work=Bangkok Post|issue=Spectrum|date=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite strict laws governing playing cards, Thailand has a long history of card playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wintle|first1=Simon|title=Playing Cards in Thailand|url=http://www.wopc.co.uk/thailand/index|website=The World of Playing Cards|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To meet the demand for cards and to control their availability, under the aegis of the Excise Department of the Thai Finance Ministry, a state enterprise called the Playing Cards Factory was authorised in 1938.&lt;ref name="PCF"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us: History| url=https://www.playingcard.or.th/en/profile/201.html|website=Playingcard Factory (Thailand)|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory produces over 400,000 decks of cards per month.&lt;ref name="WOPC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wintle|first1=Simon|title=Thai Playing Cards Manufacturing Factory|url=http://www.wopc.co.uk/thailand/playing-cards-factory|website=The World of Playing Cards|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A factory-produced brochure shows the card brands manufactured by the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playing Card Brochure|url=http://www.wopc.co.uk/images/countries/thailand/PlayingCardBrochure.pdf|website=Playingcard Factory (Thailand)|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Playing Cards Factory also serves as a printer for the Thai government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vision-Mission|url=https://www.playingcard.or.th/en/profile/205.html|website=Playingcard Factory (Thailand)|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RT America''' is an [[United States|American]] [[pay television]] channel based in [[Washington, D.C.]], and part of the [[RT (TV network)|RT network]], a global multilingual television news network based in [[Moscow]], Russia, and funded by the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].&lt;ref name="Wahl"/&gt; Much like public broadcasters [[PBS]] in the USA and BBC in the UK, RT America has studios and bureaus in [[New York City]], [[Miami]], and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="RT America"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rt.com/usa|title=Usa – Rt|publisher=Rt.com|date=|accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RT America Tumblr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rtamerica.tumblr.com/about|title=RT America  – About|publisher=rtamerica.tumblr.com|date=|accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel is the home and the production base of RT's U.S.-based programs.

RT America focuses on covering news in the United States from a Russian perspective. Programs are hosted by American journalists. Similarly, most guests are American (and sometimes [[Canadians|Canadian]]) activists, academics, speakers and analysts with alternative perspectives on "mainstream" issues. The channel covers issues that see lesser coverage in the [[mainstream media]], such as using non-[[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] ingredients in foods, capitalism, growing wealth inequality, corruption in politics, peace and environmental issues.  It maintains a separate schedule of programs each weekday from 4 p.m. to 12 midnight Eastern Time, and like its counterpart in the UK, it simulcasts RT International at all other times.

RT America is the channel for RT content delivery to the United States subscription providers. The channel is also available on Canadian pay TV providers. In addition, the channel is also available worldwide through various means including: online through RT's primary website, [[Pluto TV|Pluto.tv]], mobile phone apps, and channel apps on platforms such as [[Roku]] and [[Apple TV]].

The channel is registered as a "foreign agent" with the [[United States Department of Justice]] under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]]. A 2017 report by the [[United States Intelligence Community]] characterized RT as "The Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet" and said that RT America had been set up as an autonomous [[nonprofit organization]] "to avoid the Foreign Agents Registration Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf|title=Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections|publisher=United States Intelligence Community|date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Ewing, [https://www.npr.org/2017/02/10/514551968/5-things-on-michael-flynn-russia-and-donald-trump 5 Things On Michael Flynn, Russia and Donald Trump], NPR (February 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The channel was launched in February 2010 as RT was looking to increase its footprint. It was launched along with [[Rusiya Al-Yaum]] in 2007, the Spanish language channel [[RT Actualidad]] in 2009, and the [[RT Documentary]] channel in 2011.&lt;ref name="vonTwickel"&gt;Nikolaus von Twickel, [https://rbth.com/articles/2010/03/23/230310_rt.html "Russia Today courts viewers with controversy"], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', March 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 13, 2013, RT previewed [[Larry King]]'s new Thursday evening political talk show ''[[Politicking with Larry King]]'' with a discussion of [[Edward Snowden]]'s leaking of the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM surveillance program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/shows/politicking-larry-king/nsa-scandal-snowden-schock-675/ "Politicking: Larry King talks NSA scandal fallout"], RT.com, June 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; King's programs on RT America are produced by [[Ora TV]]. RT later added notable figures such as former [[Governor of Minnesota]] [[Jesse Ventura]] and [[Ed Schultz]], formerly of [[MSNBC]], as hosts in primetime. Schultz died in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kfgo.com/news/articles/2018/jul/05/ed-schultz-dead-at-64/|title=Ed Schultz dead at 64|last=Inc.|first=Midwest Communications|website=The Mighty 790 KFGO|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. elections]] and the subsequent [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|investigation]] into the matter, on November 13, 2017, the [[United States Department of Justice]] insisted that RT America register as a "foreign agent" under the [[Foreign Agent Registration Act]] (FARA). On the same day, RT's editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, said that it would comply with the demand in order to avoid further legal action by the U.S. government, and registered the company as a foreign agent.&lt;ref name=Reuters-13Nov2017&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-media-restrictions-rt/russias-rt-registers-as-foreign-agent-in-usa-editor-idUSKBN1DD25B|title=Russia's RT America registers as 'foreign agent' in U.S.|date=November 13, 2017|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under FARA, RT is required to disclose financial information. The network's congressional press credentials were revoked following the network's registration as a foreign agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/29/media/rt-capitol-credentials-revoked/index.html|title=Congressional press office yanks RT's credentials|last=Gold|first=Hadas|work=CNNMoney|accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
===Abby Martin statement===
On March 4, 2014, ''Breaking the Set'' host [[Abby Martin]] (whose show was at the time produced by RT America), speaking directly to her viewing audience during the show's closing statement, said that even though she worked for RT, she was against Russia's [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|intervention in Ukraine]]. She said that "what Russia did is wrong", as she is against intervention by any nation into other countries' affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/04/world/europe/russia-news-anchor-ukraine/|title=State-funded news anchor Abby Martin: 'What Russia did is wrong' – CNN.com|author=Greg Botelho, CNN|date=March 5, 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Martin asserted that RT still supported her despite her differences of opinion with the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/shows/breaking-set-summary/ukraine-conflict-perspectives-usa-885/|title=Ukraine conflict perspectives and Washington's shadow lobbyists|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; RT's press office suggested that Martin would be sent to [[Crimea]] and responded to accusations of propaganda, stating "the charges of propaganda tend to pop up every time a news outlet, particularly RT, dares to show the side of events that does not fit the mainstream narrative, regardless of the realities on the ground. This happened in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], this is happening in Ukraine".&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Lucia (March 4, 2014) [http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/rt-defends-host-abby-martin-responds-to-accusations-of-pro-putin-propaganda-20140304 RT Defends Host Abby Martin, Responds to Accusations of Pro-Putin Propaganda], [[National Journal]] retrieved April 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See [[Information war during the Russo-Georgian war]] and [[2014 Crimean crisis]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glenn Greenwald]] said that American media elites love to mock Russian media, especially RT, as being a source of shameless pro-Putin propaganda, where free expression is strictly barred. Agreeing the "network has a strong pro-Russian bias", he suggested that Martin's action "remarkably demonstrated what 'journalistic independence' means".&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, Glenn (March 4, 2014) [https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/04/rt-host-abby-martin-condemns-russian-incursion-crimea-rt/ RT Host Abby Martin Condemns Russian Incursion Into Crimea – On RT] ''[[The Intercept]]'' Retrieved March 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wahl resignation===
[[File:Liz Wahl on RT America.png|thumb|left|RT America broadcast with former anchor [[Liz Wahl]]]]

====Wahl's on-air statement====
On March 5, 2014, RT America anchor Liz Wahl resigned on air, claiming RT was a propaganda machine for [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26468837|title=Russia Today TV presenter Liz Wahl quits on air|publisher=BBC News|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was recorded as saying&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RT America|title=RT America's Liz Wahl resigns live on air|date=2014-03-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h79v9uirLY|accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wahl"&gt;Liz Wahl, [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/03/liz-wahl-quit-russia-today-putins-pawn-104888.html I Was Putin's Pawn], ''[[Politico]]'', March 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin. I am proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth. And that is why, after this newscast, I am resigning.&lt;ref name="Wahl" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wahl stated that what "broke" her was that RT censored a question from her interview with [[Ron Paul]] about "Russia's ''intervention'' in Ukraine". In response, RT released a statement: "When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional. But when someone makes a big public show of a personal decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt. We wish Liz the best of luck on her chosen path".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/rt-reacts-liz-wahl-042/|title=RT reacts to anchor Liz Wahl quitting on air|work=RT International|accessdate=2017-04-14|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2014 ''[[Politico]]'' article, Wahl expanded on that statement, saying, "For about two and a half years. I’d looked the other way as the network smeared America for the sake of making the Kremlin look better by comparison, while it sugarcoated atrocities by one brutal dictator after another."&lt;ref name="Wahl" /&gt;

When asked about a clip of her interviewing a guest on RT by [[Brian Stelter]], host of CNN's ''[[Reliable Sources]]'', Wahl responded,
{{quote|They get these extreme voices on that have this kind of hostile toward the West viewpoints towards the world, very extremist. These are the people that they have on. And when I was on the anchor desk, they would instruct you to egg on these guests and try to get them, you know, rallied up, to really fire off their anti-American talking points. Listen, I'm all about exposing government corruption. I'm all about being critical of the government. But this is different. This is promoting the foreign policy of somebody that has just invaded a country, has invaded the country and is then lying about it, is using the media as a tool to fulfill his foreign policy interests. And RT is part of Putin's propaganda network and it's very, very troubling in the wake of what is going on in Ukraine today.&lt;ref name="Reliable Sources"&gt;{{cite news|title=Putin TV in Chaos|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/03/23/rs-putin-tv-in-chaos.cnn|&lt;!--http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1403/23/rs.01.html--&gt;|publisher=CNN|date=March 24, 2014|author=Brian Stelter}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===C-SPAN interruption===
On January 12, 2017, during a live [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] debate on the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] [[C-SPAN]] 1's live broadcast was suddenly interrupted by a cut in of RT America. C-SPAN explained the interruption as a technical malfunction blaming it on an internal routing error which moved the RT America feed from an internal monitor within C-SPAN used to monitor the network alongside others to the broadcast feed for C-SPAN 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/business/media/cspan-russia-today.html|title=C-Span Online Broadcast Interrupted by Russian Network|last=Bromwich|first=Jonah Engel|date=2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RT stated that while it was testing its systems in preparation for the [[inauguration of Donald Trump]], its signal was "mistakenly routed onto the primary encoder feeding C-SPAN 1's signal to the internet, rather than to an unused backup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/facebook-blocks-rt-posting-trump-inauguration-1201963757/|title=Facebook Restores Kremlin-Funded RT Posting Privileges After Temporary Block|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2017-01-19|work=Variety|accessdate=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Shochiku Company Limited'''|松竹株式会社|Shōchiku [[Kabushiki gaisha]]}} ({{tyo|9601}}) is a Japanese [[movie studio]] and production company for [[kabuki]]. It also produces and distributes [[anime]] films. Its best remembered directors include [[Yasujirō Ozu]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Mikio Naruse]], [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] and [[Yoji Yamada|Yōji Yamada]]. It has also produced films by highly regarded independent and "loner" directors such as [[Takashi Miike]], [[Takeshi Kitano]], [[Akira Kurosawa]] and [[Taiwan]]ese [[Cinema of Taiwan|New Wave]] director [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]]. Shochiku is a member of the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (MPPAJ) and the oldest of Japan's "Big Four" film studios.

==History==

===As Shochiku Kinema===
[[File:Otani Takejiro &amp; Shirai Matsujiro 1932.jpg|thumb|left|Otani Takejiro &amp; Shirai Matsujiro in 1932]]

The company was founded in 1895 as a [[kabuki]] production company, which makes it the oldest company in Japan involved in film production,&lt;ref name=Jasper/&gt; although [[Nikkatsu]] is older as a pure film studio.  Founded by the brothers Takejirō Ōtani (大谷竹次郎) and Matsujirō Shirai (白井松次郎), it was named “Matsutake” in 1902 after the combined ''[[kunyomi]]'' reading of the ''[[kanji]]'' ''take'' ([[bamboo]]) and ''matsu'' ([[pine]]) from their names, reflecting the traditional three symbols of happiness: bamboo, pine, and plum. The ''[[onyomi]]'' reading of ''Shōchiku'' first appeared in 1920 with the founding of the film production subsidiary "Shōchiku Kinema Gōmei-sha".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shochiku.com/about/identity.html The Corporate Identity of Shochiku Co., Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shochiku grew quickly in the early years, expanding its business to many other Japanese live theatrical styles, including ''[[Noh]]'' and ''[[Bunraku]]'', and established a near monopoly due to its ownership of theaters, as well as ''kabuki'' and ''[[shimpa]]'' drama troupes.&lt;ref name=Jasper&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharpe |first=Jasper |date=2011 |title=Historical Dictionary of Japanese Cinema |url= |location= |publisher=Scarecrow Press |pages= 222–225|isbn=978-0-8108-7541-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company began making films in 1920, about a decade after its main rival Nikkatsu. The company sought to break away from the prevailing pattern of ''[[jidai-geki]]'' and to emulate [[Hollywood]] standards. It was the first film studio to abandon the use of female impersonators and brought new ideas, including the [[Star system (film)|star system]] and the [[sound stage]] to Japan. It built its main studio at [[Kamata, Ōta, Tokyo|Kamata]], between Tokyo and Yokohama, and hired [[Henry Kotani]], a Japanese who had worked in Hollywood as an actor and cameraman to direct its first film, ''Island Woman'' (''Shima no Onna'', 1920). It also hired the prominent theater director [[Kaoru Osanai]] to head a school at the studio, which produced the film ''[[Souls on the Road]]'' (1921), a film directed by [[Minoru Murata]] which is considered "the first landmark film in Japanese history".&lt;ref name="Cousins"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Cousins|title=The Story of Film|date=4 October 2006|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-1-56025-933-6|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Shochiku's early history was difficult, as audiences preferred the more action-packed ''jidai-geki'' historical swashbucklers over the [[shinpa]] [[melodrama]]s, and its [[Kamata, Ōta, Tokyo|Kamata]] studios were destroyed by the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], forcing a temporary relocation to [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name=Jasper/&gt;

With the reopening of its Kamata studios, Shochiku also introduced the ''[[shomin-geki]]'' genre,&lt;ref name="Jacoby"&gt;Alexander Jacoby, ''A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors'', 2008, Berkeley: Stone Bridge Press, p.381.&lt;/ref&gt; with stories reflecting the lives of the lower-middle urban classes. These dramas proved immensely popular, and marked the start of the careers of many prominent directors (including Ozu, Naruse, and [[Hiroshi Shimizu (director)|Hiroshi Shimizu]]) and actors (including [[Kinuyo Tanaka]]).

In 1931, Shochiku released the first “[[sound film|talkie]]” made in Japan: ''[[The Neighbor's Wife and Mine]]'' ''(Madamu to nyōbō'', 1930). Filming became increasing difficult at the [[Kamata, Tokyo|Kamata]] studios during the 1930s with the rapid industrialization of the surrounding area with munitions factories and metal foundries, and Shochiku decided to close the studio and relocate to [[Ōfuna Station|Ofuna]], near [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] in 1936. The following year, Shochiku Kinema was merged with its parent company, Shochiku Entertainment, and adopted the new name of Shochiku Corporation.&lt;ref name=Jasper/&gt;

===As Shochiku Corporation===
[[File:Shochiku.jpg|200px|thumb|An old Shochiku ident until 2003.]]
During the war years, Shochiku's President, [[Shiro Kido]], helped establish the Dai Nippon Eiga Kyokai (Greater Japan Film association), whose purpose was to coordinate the industry's efforts with Japanese government policy. From the mid-1930s until 1945, the films produced by Shochiku and other Japanese movie companies were [[propaganda|propagandistic]].

After the [[surrender of Japan]], Kido and Shochiku's co-founder Otani were arrested and charged with [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Class-A war crimes]] by the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|Allied occupation authorities]].&lt;ref name=Jasper/&gt;

In 1953, after the end of the [[Occupation of Japan|occupation]], Kido returned to Shochiku and revived the melodramatic style of films which had been a Shochiku trademark in the pre-war era. Directors associated with Shochiku in this era included Ozu, [[Keisuke Kinoshita]], [[Noboru Nakamura]] and [[Hideo Oba]]. Many of the films during the 1950s were aimed primarily at female audiences. In particular, Hideo Oba’s three-part “[[What is Your Name?]]” (Kimi no na wa?, 1953) was the most commercially successful film of the period.&lt;ref name=Jasper/&gt; Ozu's ''[[Tokyo Story]]'', made in 1953, later earned considerable accolades, being selected in the 2012 [[Sight &amp; Sound]] international critics poll as the third best film of all time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critics’ top 100: BFI|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics|website=www.bfi.org.uk|accessdate=27 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 1960s, Shochiku’s films were criticized as “old-fashioned” with the popularity of rival [[Nikkatsu]]’s ''Taiyo-zoku'' youth-orientated movies. The studio responded by launching the [[Japanese New Wave]] (''Nuberu bagu'') which also launched the career of [[Nagisa Oshima]] among others,&lt;ref name="Jacoby"/&gt; though Oshima soon went independent; the films of Oshima and other film makers were not financially successful and the company changed its policies.&lt;ref name="Jacoby"/&gt;

However, the growing threat of television led to the bankruptcy of Shochiku’s competitors, [[Shintoho]] in 1961 and [[Daiei Film|Daiei]] in 1971, whereas [[Nikkatsu]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]] turned to [[crime film|gangster movies]] and [[pink film|soft pornography]] to maintain attendance. Shochiku continued to maintain its family-orientated audience largely due to the phenomenal success of the ''[[Otoko wa Tsurai yo]]'' series directed by [[Yoji Yamada]] from 1969 through 1997. However, with the death of its star [[Kiyoshi Atsumi]], the series came to an end, and the company faced increasing financial difficulties.&lt;ref name=Jasper/&gt;

The Ofuna studio was briefly transformed into a theme park, Kamakura Cinema World, but this was closed in 1998 and the site was sold off in 2000 to [[Kamakura Women's University|Kamakura Women's College]].

Since that time, Shochiku has relied on its film studio and [[backlot]] in Kyoto.

Yamada’s “[[The Twilight Samurai]]” (Tasogare Seibei, 2002) was nominated for an Oscar as Best Foreign Language Picture.&lt;ref name=Jasper/&gt;

Shochiku has also served as a distributor of theatrical [[anime]]. Major titles have included the ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura]]'' films, ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' movies, ''[[Origin: Spirits of the Past]]'', ''[[Piano no Mori]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos]]'', ''[[Sword of the Stranger]]'', ''[[Fairy Tail the Movie: Phoenix Priestess]]'' and ''[[Jungle Emperor Leo]]''.

He is rescued and sent to a local hospital where he is treated by a male nurse who cares for him and later discovers the secrets of his past.

''Speechless'' is the third feature film by director Simon Chung. His previous films were ''Innocent'', released in 2005, and ''End of Love'', in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.festivalscope.com/director/chung-simon Simon Chung]. Publisher:''Festival Scope.com'' Retrieved: 28 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film premiered at the BFI 26th [[London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]], on 28 March 2012,&lt;ref name=Polari&gt;[http://www.polarimagazine.com/filmtvreviews/speechless/ Speechless].

==Plot==
A man is found naked by the side of a river in Wuhan in mainland China. His name is Luke, but he appears to be unable to speak, and is sent to a local hospital for diagnosis. Unable to determine the cause of Luke's condition, the hospital decides that he must be sent elsewhere. Soon, Luke's male nurse, Xiao Jiang, discovers that his superiors have decided to transfer Luke to a mental asylum. He then decides that he must rescue him and smuggle him out to his uncle's village, where they will have to evade capture from the local police.

Slowly, the reason for Luke's speechlessness becomes clear. Xiao Jiang discovers that Luke had previously had a romantic affair with a young male university student, called Han Dong, whom he had met at the university campus, together with Han Dong's girlfriend, Xiao Ning. Xiao Jiang accidentally discovers a secret that provides a key to Luke's past, enabling him to subsequently track down Xiao Ning to find out more. Although she proves to be unhelpful and deceitful, he begins to be able to piece together the mystery of Luke's inability to speak. He learns that Luke's romantic relationship with Han Dong had been discovered by Xiao Ning, who is a devout Christian, and had decided to punish her boyfriend by 'outing' him and publicly humiliating him at church. During Xiao Jiang's unravelling of this mystery, Luke suddenly disappears from the accommodation he had secretly shared with Xiao Jiang. As a result, Xiao Jiang asks for the help of a female friend, Lan, to try to locate Luke, and help resolve once and for all the central mystery of Luke's inability to speak.&lt;ref name=Polari /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesweggreview.org/Articles.aspx?ID=1527 Speechless (Wu Yan) - Words fail me] Author: S.

==Production==
''Speechless'' was filmed in secret in mainland China: in the small city of [[Shantou]], on the East coast of [[Guangdong Province]], and in the northern countryside of Guangdong, in Southern China. The university campus scene, introducing one of the film's most important characters, Han Dong, and his girlfriend, Xiao Ning, was filmed at [[Shantou University]].

The man playing the role of Han Dong is mainland China model, actor and magician Jian Jiang, who is from [[Guangzhou]], while the woman playing his girlfriend, Xiao Ning, is Indonesian-born and Australian-educated actress Yung Yung Yu. Both of the main actors, Pierre-Matthieu Vital and Qilun Gao, are indirect friends of the film's director, Simon Chung. Vital, who plays Luke, is from France, but lives and works in Guangzhou and regularly visits Hong Kong, where he first met Simon Chung. Vital is not a fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese, and so Chung had to help train him to speak his lines.&lt;ref name=SDGLN&gt;[http://sdgln.com/news/2012/05/28/filmout-simon-chung-director-speechless#sthash.MceKvLuY.QshJ9Sno.dpbs FilmOut: Q&amp;A with Simon Chung, director of “Speechless”]. Publisher: ''San Diego Gay and Lesbian News.com''. Published: 28 May 2012. Retrieved: 27 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The actor playing Vital's attentive nurse, Xiao Jiang, is Beijing actor Qilun Gao, who had previously appeared in another Hong Kong film.&lt;ref name=SDGLN/&gt;

As filming in China was unofficial, the film was unable to secure a theatrical release in its country of production,&lt;ref name=EF/&gt; although it has been screened once in China, to students at Shantou University, and released in cinemas across Hong Kong. Chung says he wanted his film to explore both a Western perspective of China as well as a Chinese perspective of the West.&lt;ref name=SDGLN/&gt;

The inspiration for the film came from a real-life case known as the “Piano Man,” in which a man  washed up off the eastern coast of England several years ago.&lt;ref name=SDGLN/&gt;

Parks enjoyed writing poems and songs and even created a newspaper with her brother, called the "Daily Daily".&lt;ref name="HM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/par1bio-1|title = Suzan-Lori Parks Biography|date = November 11, 2013|accessdate = August 3, 2015|website = Academy of Achievement A Museum of Living History|publisher = Academy of Achievement|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140106050746/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/par1bio-1|archivedate = January 6, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 her father, a career officer in the [[United States Army]], was stationed in [[West Germany]] where she attended middle school and attended German high school.&lt;ref name=HM /&gt; The experience showed her "what it feels like to be neither white nor black, but simply foreign".&lt;ref name="HM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100115040630/http://spinner.cofc.edu/temples/parks.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; Suzan-Lori Parks (Archived from January 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the United States Parks lived and attended school in several states such as Kentucky, Texas, California, North Carolina, Maryland, and [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name=HM /&gt; Parks says her constant relocation could have influenced her writing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Interview with Suzan-Lori Parks|jstor = 3299177|journal = [[Callaloo (journal)|Callaloo]]|date = 1996-01-01|pages = 309–317|volume = 19|issue = 2|first = Shelby|last = Jiggetts|first2 = Suzan-Lori|last2 = Parks}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated high school at [[The John Carroll School]] in 1981 while her father was stationed in [[Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="connections"&gt;{{cite news| title=Connections| pages=4| publisher=John Carroll School| date=Spring 2007| url=http://johncarroll.org/data/files/gallery/ParentFiles/April_2007_Connections.pdf| format=PDF| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808153956/http://johncarroll.org/data/files/gallery/ParentFiles/April_2007_Connections.pdf| archivedate=2007-08-08| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement" /&gt;

In high school, Parks was discouraged from studying literature due to a teacher criticising her spelling. However, upon reading [[Virginia Woolf]]'s [[To the Lighthouse|''To the Light House'']], Parks found herself veering away from her initial interest in chemistry, gravitating towards writing.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Parks attended and graduated from [[Mount Holyoke College]] in 1985 with a B.A. in English and German literature while a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. She studied under [[James Baldwin]], who encouraged her to become a playwright. James Baldwin describes Parks during this time as, "an utterly astounding and beautiful creature who may become one of the most valuable artists of our time."&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.idvl.org/thehistorymakers/Bio321.html|title = Biography Page for Suzan-Lori Parks|date = November 21, 2006|accessdate = August 5, 2015|website = The History Makers|publisher = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032832/http://www.idvl.org/thehistorymakers/Bio321.html|archivedate = September 24, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parks then studied acting for a year at [[Drama Studio London]] in order to better understand the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Als |first=Hilton |authorlink=Hilton Als|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/30/the-show-woman |title=The Show-Woman |work=The New Yorker |date=October 30, 2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Suzan-Lori Parks Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/suzan-lori-parks-37703|website=biography.com|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TookHerCue"&gt;{{cite web| title=Suzan-Lori Parks '85 Took Her Cue from Five College Professor James Baldwin| publisher=Mount Holyoke College| url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/reasons.shtml?num=5 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713222641/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/reasons.shtml?num=5 |archivedate=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Parks credits the impact of Mount Holyoke on her career later in life.&lt;ref name="CollegeStreetJournal"&gt;{{cite web| title =Suzan-Lori Parks '85 Wins Pulitzer Prize for Drama| publisher =College Street Journal| date =April 12, 2002| url =http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/041202/parks.shtml| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20051129163321/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/041202/parks.shtml| archivedate =November 29, 2005| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since acting at the [[Drama Studio London|Drama Studio]], Suzan-Lori Parks has received 11 awards, being the first female African-American to receive the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her play ''[[Topdog/Underdog]]'' in 2002. She has also received a number of grants including the [[MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant|MacArthur Foundation "Genius" Grant]] in 2001, the same year as the production of her play "[[Topdog/Underdog]]".&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement" /&gt;

While she was an undergraduate, her Mount Holyoke English professor [[Mary McHenry]] introduced Parks to [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]].&lt;ref name="achievement"&gt;{{cite web| title =Suzan-Lori Parks Interview| publisher =Academy of Achievement| date =June 22, 2007| url =http://www.achievement.com/autodoc/page/par1int-5| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090108080211/http://www.achievement.com/autodoc/page/par1int-5| archivedate =January 8, 2009| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parks was initially opposed to theater, thinking that it was "where a lot of people with too much attitude wore funny clothes and funny little costumes, and they talked with funny little voices even though they were from, like, New York or New Jersey. And I didn't respect that."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Parks began to take classes with Baldwin and, at his behest, began to write plays.&lt;ref name="achievement"/&gt; She was still out of touch with theater; the only plays she was familiar with were those of [[Shakespeare]], only because she was a German/English major.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Parks also noted that she was inspired by [[Wendy Wasserstein]], a 1971 Mount Holyoke graduate who won the Pulitzer in 1989 for her play ''[[The Heidi Chronicles]]''.&lt;ref name="CollegeStreetJournal" /&gt; Parks also credited another Mount Holyoke professor, [[Leah Blatt Glasser]], with her success.&lt;ref name="CSJ"&gt;{{cite web| title=In the News: Traditions and communications| work=College Street Journal| date=May 24, 1996| url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/960524/news.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050323015424/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/960524/news.html| archivedate=March 23, 2005| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks' first screenplay was for [[Spike Lee]]'s 1996 film ''[[Girl 6]]''. She later worked with [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Productions]] on screenplays for ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God (2005 television)|Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Great Debaters]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/847213.html 'Debaters' makes its case] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413173159/http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/847213.html |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Dana and Brodesser, Claude (2004).

Parks is often noted for her unique voice in the way she experiments and explores with language and dialect, stating how she tries to capture emotion and expression through language: "The difference between 'k' and 'o.k.' is not just what one might call Black English versus standard English, for example.... It's just getting more specific, letting the words hold the emotion. Instead of some parenthetical stage direction."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
 
She is a winner of the 2017 Poets, Essayists and Novelists (PEN) America Literary Awards in the category Master American Dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam.

=== ''Betting on the Dust Commander'' ===
Although ''Betting on the Dust Commander'' was not the first play Parks wrote, it was the first of her plays to be produced. Her first play ''The Sinner's Place'', which she wrote for her senior project at Mount Holyoke, was rejected for production by her college's drama department as they considered it too experimental since she wanted to have dirt on the stage during the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americantheatre.org/2000/10/01/the-possession-of-suzan-lori-parks/|title=The Possession of Suzan-Lori Parks|last=Garrett|first=Shawn Marie|date=2000-10-01|work=AMERICAN THEATRE|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When her second play, ''Betting on the Dust Commander,'' first premiered, it ran for three nights in a bar in Manhattan's Lower East Side called ''Gas Station.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/30/the-show-woman|title=The Show-Woman|last=Als|first=Hilton|date=2006-10-30|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short, one-act play set in Kentucky, centering around the lives of a couple, Mare and Lucius, who have been married for 110 years. Parks's unique voice is displayed throughout the text via her use of specific dialect and incorporation of the sounds of sniffling and sneezing as part of the dialogue. The play's title comes from the horse that won the Kentucky Derby in 1970, [[Dust Commander|Dust Commande]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r. As the play goes on, we discover that Dust Commander's Derby is responsible for bringing Mare and Lucius together, and through the couple's discussion of him they think back over their many years of memories together. The motif of dust along with many of the play's lines are intentionally repeated throughout the text, in addition to this Parks does not give the audience any information on how these two characters have managed to live for so long, in this way she destabilizes any linear sense of memory and time. Parks complicates the audience's view of history, relationships, and the past; some argue that Parks's incorporation of these elements and the repetitive style of the text is reminiscent of African rituals and the way that their retelling of stories often incorporate the past in a literal manner. &lt;ref&gt;Kolin, Philip C.

===''Topdog/Underdog''===
One of her best-known works is ''[[Topdog/Underdog]]''. This play marked a departure from the heightened language she usually wrote. Parks is an admirer of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and believed he left a legacy for descendants of slaves. ''Topdog/Underdog'' explains what that legacy is. It tells the story of two African-American brothers: Lincoln and Booth. Lincoln works at a boardwalk arcade, dressing up like Abraham Lincoln and letting the tourists shoot him with plastic guns. He got this job because he could be paid less than the white man who had the job before. Parks does not judge Lincoln in this play, but rather enjoys bringing him into the other characters' lives and seeing how they are affected. She said, "Lincoln is the closest thing we have to a mythic figure. In days of Greek drama, they had [[Apollo]] and [[Medea]] and [[Oedipus]] – these larger than life figures that walked the earth and spoke – and they turned them into plays. Shakespeare had kings and queens that he fashioned into his stories. Lincoln, to me, is one of those." Parks also believes that Lincoln "created an opening with that hole in his head." She makes the case that everything we do has to pass through everything else, like the eye of a needle. She says we have all passed through the hole in Lincoln's head on our journey to whatever lies ahead. Like many of her other plays, ''Topdog/Underdog'' takes her characters on a quest to find out who they are and to examine the stories and experiences that have shaped their lives. More than anything, she believes that we have an important relationship with the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/theater/theater-beyond-a-black-and-white-lincoln.html|title=Theater; Beyond a Black-and-White Lincoln|last=Shenk|first=Joshua Wolf|date=2002-04-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===365 Plays/365 Days===
Parks decided that she wanted to give herself the task of writing 365 plays in 365 days, hence her play ''365 Plays/365 Days''. This decision was made shortly after one of her books, ''[[Getting Mother's Body]]'', was published. She kept herself on schedule and succeeded. She wrote anywhere she had to: on the road, hotel rooms, and modes of transportation. The end result has been produced by more than 700 theaters around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/par1bio-1|title=Suzan-Lori Parks Biography -- Academy of Achievement|website=www.achievement.org|access-date=2016-04-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106050746/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/par1bio-1|archivedate=2014-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plays were presented by 725 performing arts groups, taking turns until the entire cycle was performed. The performances started in 2006, and included venues such as the Denver Center Theatre Company, colleges in England and Australia and the Steel City Theatre Company in [[Pueblo, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, John.

The plays were presented at the [[Public Theater]], New York City in November 2006, directed by Michael Greif.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Campbell.

''Father Comes Home From the Wars, Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3'' premiered [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Public Theater]] on March 14, 2014 and closed on March 22, 2014 in a developmental production. Directed by Jo Bonney, the cast featured [[Sterling K. Brown]] (Hero), Peter Jay Fernandez (Oldest Old Man), Russell G. Jones (Leader/Runaway), and Jacob Ming-Trent (Runaway slave / Odyssey Dog / Fourth).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/5805 " ''Father Comes Home From the Wars, Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3'' March"], lortel.org, retrieved January 14, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The play returned to the Public Theater on October 14, 2014 and ran to December 7, 2014, with the same director and cast.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Parks married blues musician [[Paul Oscher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.com/musicworld/entry/335031 Suzan-Lori Parks and Paul Oscher]&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 2011. She is currently engaged to Christian Konopka. They have a child now.

Parks noted in an interview that her name is spelled with a "Z" as the result of a misprint early in her career:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was doing one of my first plays in [[Greenwich Village|the East Village]], we had fliers printed up and they spelled my name wrong. I was devastated. But the director said, 'Just keep it, honey, and it will be fine.'

| ShortSummary    = Angela wants peace and quiet to practise playing the guitar, but Tom and Hank keep making noise until it gets so bad Angela has to play on top of the tallest tree of the island, which fails since Tom and Hank jump up high and annoy her until she falls from the tree and gets her head stuck in the sand. The boys get worried if she is hurt, but then Angela just plays the guitar, prompting them to play the tambourine and maracas.

'''''The Bugaloos''''' is an [[United States|American]] children's television series, produced by brothers [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], that aired on NBC on Saturday mornings from 1970 to 1972. Reruns of the show aired in daily syndication from 1978 to 1985 as part of the "Krofft Superstars" package with six other Krofft series.

The show features a [[musical group]] composed of four British-accented teenagers, who live in fictional Tranquility Forest. They wear insect-themed outfits with antennae and wings that allow them to fly, although they are occasionally shown flying on surfboards.  They are constantly beset by the evil machinations of Benita Bizarre, played by comedian [[Martha Raye]]. Bizarre, being untalented and ugly herself, is covetous of the Bugaloos' musical prowess.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons’ Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and airing==
[[File:The Bugaloos in Tranquility Forest.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Bugaloos in Tranquility Forest.]]
Touted as the British version of ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]],'' ''The Bugaloos'' attracted more than 5,000 young actors and actresses to audition for the show's four lead roles, each having to demonstrate aptitude in dance, singing, and acting. Among those auditioning in spring 1970 were [[Elton John]]'s future manager [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], and [[Phil Collins]], who joined the [[art rock]] band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] later that year.&lt;ref name="itzkoff"&gt;Dave Itzkoff. "A Band With the Life Span of an Ant." ''[[The New York Times]],'' July 30, 2006, page 28, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phil Collins listing on imdb.com [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002015/otherworks] (Accessed October 17, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid and Collins had been two of the three finalists for the role of "I.Q." given to [[Scottish people|Scottish]] musician [[John McIndoe (musician)|John McIndoe]]. "If one of those guys had gotten it instead of me, rock-'n'-roll history might have changed," McIndoe later joked. "Whenever I see them, I say, 'Hey guys, you were lucky you didn't get the part.'"&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;Mike Hughes. "Phil Collins on 'Live By Request.'" ''The Seattle Times,'' October 1, 1998, page E4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was taped in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Seventeen episodes of the series were produced. Like its predecessor ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'' (1969), ''The Bugaloos'' ran for only one season (1970–1971), with reruns airing the following year (1971–1972). Following production of the first, and only, season, the Kroffts tried shooting for a second season, and also had a movie deal in the works with [[Columbia Pictures]]. However, miscommunication between the Kroffts and the actors resulted in them returning to England that December against the Kroffts' wishes. As a result, a potential second season was ultimately scrapped, along with plans for a movie which was shelved due to the bankruptcy of Columbia Pictures.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Although the show featured British actors, it was not screened on British television.

Like most children's television shows of the era, ''The Bugaloos'' contained a [[laugh track]]. Cast members John Philpott and Caroline Ellis discussed its usage while viewing an episode of the show for DVD commentary.

==Premise==

Though peace-loving and [[hippie]]-like, The Bugaloos are pursued by the ugly, evil, jealous old crone named Benita Bizarre who lives in a gigantic [[jukebox]], and uses it to broadcast her own brand of blaring, obnoxious, unpleasant "music." A dreadful singer, she is furious at the popularity of The Bugaloos's more melodic, upbeat sound, and she plots elaborate, unsuccessful schemes to destroy or enslave them. She frequently makes use of a powerful ultrasonic weapon called the Stereo Zapper, which can render its victim unconscious in seconds.

== Characters ==
===The Bugaloos===
'''Actor / Character Name / Role In the Band'''
* [[Wayne Laryea]] / '''Harmony''' (a [[bumblebee]]) / keyboards

* '''Woofer''' and '''Tweeter''' (portrayed by Joy Campbell and [[Van Snowden]]), [[anthropomorphic]] stereo speakers - Benita's two bumbling henchman
* '''Funky Rat''' (portrayed by [[Sharon Baird]]), Benita's German-accented chauffeur and chief flunky 

Raye also appeared the same year in the [[HR Pufnstuf]] [[Pufnstuf (film)|movie]] as Boss Witch. The Funky Rat costume was also used for essentially the same role (Boss Witch's Chauffeur).

===Supporting characters===

* '''The Grapevine''', a bunch of talking grapes who aid Bluebell in giving the Bugaloos the latest bad news — a visual take on the hit [[Motown]] song "[[I Heard it Through the Grapevine]]."

Voice characterizations for the various characters in the series were provided by [[Joan Gerber]] and [[Walker Edmiston]].

The Bugaloos were sometimes seen traveling around in their "Bugaloo Buggy", a custom-built and very colorful one-of-a-kind dune buggy made specifically for the show by the famous custom car builder, [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bugaloos.com/barris.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's music director was Hal Yoergler, who also wrote many of the show's songs and produced the ''Bugaloos'' album released in 1970. The title song's lyrics were written by [[Norman Gimbel]], and its music was composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]]. Gimbel and Fox were also the songwriters of "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and the theme songs to films and programs such as ''[[Last American Hero]]'' ("[[I Got A Name]]," sung by [[Jim Croce]]), ''[[Happy Days]],'' ''[[Laverne and Shirley]],'' and ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Wonder Woman]].'' A cover of the Bugaloos theme performed by [[Collective Soul]] is included on the 1995 [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]],'' produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[MCA Records]].

The Bugaloos released an album in 1970 ([[Capitol Records]] ST-621), featuring studio-recorded versions of some of the songs performed on the show. The track list is as follows:

Side 1
# "If You Become a Bugaloo"
# "The Senses of Our World"
# "For a Friend"
# "Believe"
# "It's New to You"

Side 2
# "Fly Away With Us"
# "Older Woman"
# "Just the Memory Stays Around"
# "Gna Gna Gna Gna Gna"
# "Castles in the Air"
# "The Bugaloos (Theme Song)"

One single was released in conjunction with the album: "For a Friend"/"The Senses of Our World" (Capitol 2946). "For a Friend" charted as a minor hit.  Billboard Bubbling Under week of December 18, 1970 #118 for one week.

The track "Just the Memory Stays Around" did not appear in any episode, and is available only on the LP.  The LP was re-released on CD in January 2000 by Vivid Sound in Japan and in 2006 by [[Cherry Red Records]] of London.

The Bugaloos recorded 15 songs. In addition to the 11 that appear on the released album, four additional songs appeared on the television show, but remain unreleased:
# "Sparky"
# "I'm As Happy As Can Be"
# "I Really Love You"
# "Flicker Town"

The music of the Bugaloos suffered the same typecasting fate which met the music of [[The Partridge Family#Music|The Partridge Family]], despite excellent production values in both cases. "Just the Memory Stays Around", "The Senses of Our World" and "Castles in the Air" (not to be confused with other songs of the same title) deserve particular note. Their lyrics were far above typical children's television fare:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"Let your heart see the colors all around you, and the darkness that you fear will disappear... (from "The Senses of Our World")"&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"Even when you're down on the ground, let a part of your heart reach for castles in the air... (from "Castles in the Air")"&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[Doll|doll maker]] in China crafts a puppet which he is convinced is lifelike. He takes it to exhibit at a public event, but is outraged to find an even more convincing and beautiful doll there. It is in fact a real woman pretending to be a doll, but he becomes so obsessed he attempts to steal her and the film ends with her rescue and his tragic death.&lt;ref&gt;Jung &amp; Schatzberg p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

The film had its [[film premiere|premiere]] in [[Berlin]] in November 1923. It received a universally negative reception from critics who were particularly unimpressed by the attempt to portray Chinese culture using German actors.&lt;ref&gt;Jung &amp; Schatzberg p.104-105&lt;/ref&gt; The film continues a wider theme in the director Robert Wiene's work which contrasts [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern culture]]s.

'''''The Marionettes''''' (1963) (variously translated as "The Puppets" as well) is a [[puppetry]] play by [[Bahram Beyzai]], and one of the most important plays of the Persian language. It has been staged numerous times in various languages around the world. Together with two subsequent plays, namely ''[[Evening in a Strange Land]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Story of the Hidden Moon]]'' (1963), ''The Marionettes'' constitutes the playwright's puppet trilogy.

== Text ==
The play was composed in 1962-1963 and first published in [[Tehran]] early in 1963 by [[Bahram Beyzai|the playwright]] in a volume along with another play of his named ''Matarsak-ha dar Shab'' (i.e. "Scarecrows at Night").&lt;ref&gt;http://opac.nlai.ir/opac-prod/bibliographic/838785&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year ''The Marionettes'' was again printed by the playwright; this time as the opening play of his puppet trilogy with two new puppet plays. This volume was reprinted by Negah Publishing in the spring of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;http://opac.nlai.ir/opac-prod/bibliographic/640895&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a revised version of the play appeared in 2003 in the first volume of Beyzai's collected works, published by Roshangaran Publishing in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;بیضایی، بهرام. «سالشمار زندگی و آثار بهرام بیضایی». مجلّه ''سیمیا'' زمستان ۱۳۸۶ شماره ۲. صفحه ۱۶.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;بیضایی، بهرام. ''دیوان نمایش/۱''. صفحه شش vi. تهران: روشنگران و مطالعات زنان. ۱۳۸۲.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gisèle Kapuscinski's English translation was published in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;http://opac.nlai.ir/opac-prod/bibliographic/940623&lt;/ref&gt; soon to be followed by another translation into English by M. R. Ghanoonparvar and John Green in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;http://opac.nlai.ir/opac-prod/bibliographic/944625&lt;/ref&gt; both in the [[United States]]. Still a third translation by Parvin Loloi and Glyn Pursglove appeared in [[Salzburg]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17189809W/The_Marionettes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poetrysalzburg.com/marionettes.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In ''The Marionettes'', "the dramatis personae are of universal character, almost myth-types;" as [[Yarshater]] explains.&lt;ref&gt;Yarshater, Ehsan. "The Modern Literary Idiom." ''Critical Perspectives on Modern Persian Literature''. Edited and Compiled by Thomas M. Ricks. Washington, D. C: Three Continents Press. 1984. page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; They include Hero, Demon, Girl and such other types as Black Man, Merchant, Poet, etc. and of course the puppeteer is ever present. The central theme is the perennial fight between Hero and Demon. Both the central theme and the characters reoccur in the two subsequent puppet plays too,&lt;ref&gt;Yarshater, Ehsan. "The Modern Literary Idiom." ''Critical Perspectives on Modern Persian Literature''. Edited and Compiled by Thomas M. Ricks. Washington, D. C: Three Continents Press. 1984. page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and all the three pieces are "meant to be performed by actors as well."&lt;ref&gt;''The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre'', Volume 5 (ASIA/PACIFIC).

The master puppeteer sets out to amuse the audience with his puppets. He promises that the time for Hero's fight against Demon has come. But Hero, weary of unending and futile combats with Demon, avoids engagement. He loves Girl, for the sake of which he has waged an eternal battle: against himself. In the meantime, there comes the news of the appearance of a demon at the city gate. So, to urge the Hero into combat against it, three townspeople come to him imploring to break his vow. Hero will not give in. A fortuneteller girl arrives to warn him of his inevitable and imminent death. Recovering a long, dormant love and sorrow at the sight of the fair girl, Hero sets out to war against the demon. He slays his foe and is mortally wounded himself. None of the townspeople is strong enough to pick his fallen sword up. Black Man, a loyal friend to Hero, drops his gay mood and rejects master puppeteer's requests about amusing the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bahram Beyzai|Beyza'i, Bahrām]]. ''The Marionettes''.

'''''The Smurfs''''' ({{lang-fr|Les Schtroumpfs}}) is a Belgian comic series, created by cartoonist [[Peyo]] (pen name of Pierre Culliford). The titular creatures were introduced as supporting characters in an already established series, ''[[Johan and Peewit]]'' in 1958, and starred in their own series from 1959. Thirty ''Smurf'' [[comic album]]s have been created, 16 of them by Peyo. Originally, the ''Smurf'' stories appeared in ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine with reprints in many different magazines, but after Peyo left the publisher [[Dupuis]], many comics were first published in dedicated ''Smurf'' magazines, which existed in French, Dutch and German. A number of short stories and one page gags have been collected in comic books next to the regular series of 30. By 2008, ''Smurf'' comics have been translated into 25 languages, and some 25 million albums have been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Lichfield |title=Smurfs celebrate their 50th birthday |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/smurfs-celebrate-their-50th-birthday-969506.html |publisher=The Independent |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

In 1952, Peyo created a series in ''Spirou'' magazine titled ''Johan et Pirlouit'' (''[[Johan and Peewit]]''), set in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. Johan serves as a brave young page to the [[monarch|king]], and Pirlouit (pronounced Peer-loo-ee) functions as his faithful, if boastful and cheating, [[midget]] [[sidekick]].

On October 23, 1958, Peyo introduced a new set of characters to the ''Johan et Pirlouit'' story ''La flûte à six trous'' (tr. "''The Flute with Six Holes''").&lt;ref name=BDO-s&gt;{{Cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Spirou année 1958|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalspirou/annees/1958.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alone caused no great excitement, as the brave duo constantly encountered strange new people and places. This time, they had the mission of recovering a magic flute, which required some sorcery by the wizard Homnibus. And in this manner, they met a tiny, blue-skinned humanoid creature in white clothing called a "Schtroumpf," followed by his numerous peers who looked just like him, with an elderly leader who wore red clothing and had a white beard called ''Papa Smurf''. The characters proved to be a huge success, and the first independent [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] Smurf stories appeared in ''Spirou'' in 1959, together with the first merchandising.

==Albums==
This is the list of the original French-language comic issues. Some of them are anthologies of several stories. A number of them were translated into English by [[Anthea Bell]] and [[Derek Hockridge]], and published by [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] (Random House in the USA). The late comic artist [[Pascal Garray]] contributed to seventeen editions of ''The Smurf'' comics between 1990 and 2017.&lt;ref name=nos&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Smurfen-tekenaar Pascal Garray overleden |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2153482-smurfen-tekenaar-pascal-garray-overleden.html |work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] |publisher= |date=2017-01-17 |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rtc&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Pascal Garray, dessinateur des Schtroumpfs, s'est éteint |url=http://www.rtc.be/article/culture/pascal-garray-dessinateur-des-schtroumpfs-s-est-eteint_1493759_325.html |work=[[RTC-Télé Liège]] |publisher= |date=2017-01-17 |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rtbe&gt;{{cite news|first=Jacques|last=Schraûwen |title=Pascal Garray, le dessinateur des Schtroumpfs, est décédé  |url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/liege/detail_pascal-garray-le-dessinateur-des-schtroumpfs-est-decede?id=9505081 |work=[[RTBF]] |publisher= |date=2017-01-17 |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garray last comic, ''[[Les Schtroumpfs et les haricots Mauves]]'', is scheduled to be released in September 2017.&lt;ref name=nos/&gt;&lt;ref name=rtc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rtbe/&gt;

==In popular culture==

In the [[Belgian Comic Strip Center]] in [[Brussels]] the permanent exhibition brings homage to the pioneers of [[Belgian comics]], among them Peyo. In the room dedicated to his work various objects, comic book pages, sketches,... from "The Smurfs" comics can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tento.be/sites/default/files/tijdschrift/pdf/OKV1992/Belgisch%20Centrum%20van%20het%20Beeldverhaal%20Brussel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smurfs is among the many Belgian comics characters to jokingly have a Brussels street named after them. The Rue des Sables/ Zandstraat has a [[commemorative plaque]] with the name ''Rue Schtroumpfs/ Smurfstraat'' placed under the actual street sign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebru.be/Other/Strips/bruxelles-1000-noms-de-rue-bd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 a statue of a Smurf building a statue of [[Smurfette]] was revealed in [[Middelkerke]]. It was sculpted by Monique Mol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standbeelden.be/standbeeld/908&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Grasmarkt in Brussels a five metres high statue of a Smurf on a [[toadstool]] can be seen. It was sculpted by Maryline Garbe and revealed on June 25, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://visitbrussels.be/bitc/BE_en/monument/8656/smurf-statue.do&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brusselnieuws.be/nl/nieuws/smurf-store-en-reuzenbeeld-centraal-station&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trapdoor Inc.''' was a Canadian [[video game developer]] based in [[Montreal]]. Founded in August 2008 by Ken Schachter, the company developed ''[[Warp (2012 video game)|Warp]]'' and co-published [[Polytron Corporation]]'s ''[[Fez (video game)|Fez]]'', both in 2012. A third title, ''Heist'', was cancelled mid-development. Trapdoor dissolved in December 2012.

== History ==
Trapdoor was established in August 2008 by Ken Schachter, formerly [[chief technology officer]] for [[American Apparel]] and later [[studio manager]] of [[Gameloft Montreal]].&lt;ref name="Gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/111695/Ubisoft_Gameloft_Vets_Form_Independent_Studio.php |title=Ubisoft, Gameloft Vets Form Independent Studio |first=Eric |last=Caoili |date= |website=gamasutra.com |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October that year, the company also employed former [[game designer]] at Gameloft Montreal and [[Ubisoft Montreal]], Alex Charbonneau, as lead game designer.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra" /&gt; Trapdoor stated that they would strictly follow the [[International Game Developers Association]]'s developer crediting standard in their upcoming games.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra" /&gt; Their first game would be an original [[intellectual property]] for [[personal computer]]s, [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref name="Gamasutra" /&gt; By May 2011, Trapdoor employed 15 people, with Schachter managing the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/124299/Interview_Trapdoor_Studios_On_Warp_And_SmallScale_Development.php |title=Interview: Trapdoor Studios On  Warp  And Small-Scale Development |first=Andrew Vanden |last=Bossche |date= |website=gamasutra.com |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1739">'''Vibe rock''' (also called '''Vibe music''', or simply '''Vibe''') is a broad term consisting of music that differs in its sound, context and regional roots. Genres under the Vibe rock umbrella consist of but not limited to: [[Alternative Music|Alternative]], [[Rock Music|Rock]], [[Pop Rock]], [[Folk Rock]], and [[Electronic Music|Electronic]]. Vibe rock has been identified as a response to the often "disempowering story telling and violent messages" that is prevalent in today's modern popular music. 

Vibe Rock is a musical movement that holds the belief that we can all get along, communicate, respect and harmonize with one another. A movement that allows a space for both light and dark to come together in the middle to Rock with a smile, dance with abandon and release the human spirit authentically. Because both light and dark forces want to feel strong and vibrant. Vibe Rock is that meeting place for both sides (light and dark forces) to engage in life-affirming music that helps foster strength and vibrancy. The ultimate goal of the Vibe Rock movement is to increase the awareness that we are all truly one voice of the Universe, a chorus of high and low voices that are equally important to the song, just as the dark and light colors are necessary for the painting upon the canvas to become a masterpiece. 

Vibe Rock has been described as a diverse, non-religious musical movement dedicated to producing music that is lyrically [[Nietzschean affirmation|life-affirming]] [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/01/health/la-he-0301-brain-music-therapy-20100301]. 

A popular Vibe Rock mantra: Good Vibes in, Good Vibes out

Examples of Vibe Rock artists: Shine Nine, PAX, Embrace the Waves

The '''Vilnius TV Tower''' ({{lang-lt|Vilniaus televizijos bokštas}}) is a {{convert|326.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[tower]] in the [[Karoliniškės]] [[microdistrict]] of [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]].  It is the tallest structure in Lithuania, and is occupied by the SC Lithuanian Radio and Television Centre ({{lang-lt|AB Lietuvos radijo ir televizijos centras}}).

==Design and construction==
{{stack|[[File:Utsikt over vilnius tv-torn.jpg|thumb|right|View from Vilnius TV tower]]}}
The tower was designed by V. Obydovas and the engineering section by K. Balėnas. The construction of the tower started on 31 May 1974 and finished on December 30, 1980. The construction was funded by the 11th Five Year Plan of the Soviet Union, which had earmarked funds for strategic investment in the then Lithuanian SSR. The weight of the whole structure is estimated at {{convert|25000|to(-)|30000|MT|lb}}. The structure is composed of a concrete base, a {{convert|190|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long hollow [[reinforced concrete]] pipe, a reinforced concrete saucer, and a {{convert|136|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long steel spike.  Radio transmitters are housed in the lower part of the concrete tower with antennas attached to the steel spike.

The observation deck {{convert|165|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} from the ground houses the cafe "Paukščių takas" ({{lang-en|[[Milky Way]]}}), offers a picturesque view of the city and its surroundings, and sports a rotating platform that revolves once every 45 minutes.  High-speed elevators reach the cafe from ground level in 40 seconds. On clear days, visibility can extend as far as [[Elektrėnai]], a city approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west, where power plants produced much of the electricity for Vilnius in Soviet times.

==Museum==
The TV tower played a major role in the [[Vilnius massacre|events of 13 January 1991]], when 14 unarmed civilians lost their lives and 700 were injured opposing the Soviet military seizure of the tower. A small museum dedicated to the January 1991 battle is housed on the ground floor, and various markers in the surrounding area indicate places where Lithuanian citizens died while trying to maintain the blockade against [[Soviet]] troops.
[[File:Decorated Vilnius TV Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Decorated Vilnius TV Tower]]

==Decoration==
Since 2000, the tower has been decorated to look like a [[Christmas tree]] each Christmas season. During the [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006 World Basketball Championship]] it was decorated with a large basketball net. Vilnius TV Tower became [http://www.lithuaniatribune.com/2011/08/05/vilnius-tv-tower-to-become-biggest-basketball-hoop-in-the-world/ the biggest basketball hoop in the world] during the 2011 FIBA European Basketball Championship. The hoop was 35 metres in diameter with a 40&amp;nbsp; metre-high net, assembled at a height of 170&amp;nbsp;metres. The lighting of the giant hoop took 2,560&amp;nbsp;metres of lighting cable and 545 bulbs.
[[Bungee jumping|Bungee jumps]] are available to the public from the roof of the observation deck.
