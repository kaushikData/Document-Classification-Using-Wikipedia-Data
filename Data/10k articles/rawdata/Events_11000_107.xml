==Plot==
[[Anders Behring Breivik]] dresses in a police uniform, loads a van with home-made explosives, and drives to [[Regjeringskvartalet]], the executive government quarter in [[Oslo]], Norway. He leaves the van outside the office of Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]]. Moments later, it explodes, causing several casualties. 

On the island of [[Utøya]] in [[Tyrifjorden]], [[Buskerud]], teenagers have arrived for [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Workers' Youth League]] (AUF) summer camp, organised by the ruling [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]. When they learn of the bombing, one student, Viljar Hanssen, calls his parents to make sure they are unhurt.

Breivik arrives at the ferry landing and tells staff he is a police officer sent to secure the island following the attack. The camp director transport him to the island by boat. Breivik instructs the staff to gather the children in one location. When the head of security asks for ID, Breivik shoots him and the director dead. The children flee as Breivik opens fire, murdering dozens.

Viljar and his brother Torje hide on a rocky embankment on the beach. Viljar calls his mother to tell him a shooting is in progress. Breivik finds the group and starts shooting. Viljar is shot multiple times, but Torje escapes unharmed. Breivik surrenders to a tactical team and is brought inland for interrogation. 

Breivik claims he is the leader of a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] group called the Knight's Templar and that more attacks will happen on his signal. He requests the aid of lawyer [[Geir Lippestad]], who defended a [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]]. Lippestad is morally conscientious of his client and professionally bonded by his ethics as a lawyer. Lippestad tries to argue an [[insanity defense]] for Breivik, which draws criticism as it means he will be institutionalized instead of imprisoned. Breivik tells Lippestad he wants to be declared competent to legitimize his attacks. 

Viljar wakes from a coma with life-changing injuries. He learns to walk again, but is haunted by memories of the attack. With the support of his mother, and another survivor of the attack on Utøya, he appears in court as a witness and delivers an account of the massacre. Breivik is sentenced to life imprisonment.

'''Antalas''' ({{Lang-ber|ⴰⵏⵜⴰⵍⴰⵙ}};{{lang-el|Ἀντάλας}}; c. 500 – after 548) was a [[Berber people|Berber]] tribal leader who played a major role in the wars of the [[Byzantine Empire]] against the Berber tribes in [[praetorian prefecture of Africa|Africa]]. Antalas and his tribe, the [[Frexenses]] of [[Byzacena]], initially served the Byzantines as allies, but after 544 switched sides. With the final Byzantine victory in 548, Antalas and his Christian tribe once again became Byzantine subjects. The main sources on his life are the epic poem ''Iohannis'' of [[Flavius Cresconius Corippus]] and the ''Histories of the Wars'' of [[Procopius of Caesarea]].

==Life==
Antalas was born c. 500, and was the son of a certain Guenfan, according to [[Corippus]]. He belonged to one of the [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes of [[Byzacena]] (central [[Tunisia]]), most likely the Christian Frexenses. Corippus reports that Antalas' career began at the age of seventeen, stealing sheep. He soon gathered followers around him and became a brigand, fighting against the [[Vandals]]. By 530, he had become leader of the Berbers in Byzacena, and in the same year led them to a decisive victory against the Vandals.{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=86}}

Following the [[Vandalic War]] (533–534) and the capture of the [[Vandalic Kingdom]] by the [[Byzantine Empire]], Antalas became an ally of the empire, receiving subsidies and supplies in exchange. In 543, however, a revolt broke out among the Berbers of Byzacena, which resulted in the execution of his brother Guarizila and the cessation of the subsidies by the Byzantine governor, [[Solomon (Byzantine general)|Solomon]]. This treatment alienated Antalas, and when the [[Leuathae]] rebelled in [[Tripolitania]] in the next year, he and his followers joined them. The united tribes inflicted a heavy defeat on the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Cillium]], where Solomon himself was killed.{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=86, 1175–1176}}{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=145}}

[[File:East Numidia.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Roman and Byzantine  Africa, with the provinces of [[Byzacena]], [[Zeugitana]] and [[Numidia]]]]
With the death of the capable Solomon, his nephew Sergius, whose arrogant treatment of the Leuathae had prompted their rebellion in the first place, was appointed governor in Africa. [[Stotzas]], a renegade Byzantine soldier who had led an unsuccessful rebellion a few years earlier, now joined Antalas from his refuge in [[Mauretania]]. Antalas wrote to the Byzantine emperor, [[Justinian I]], asking for Sergius' dismissal, but in vain. Justinian only dispatched the [[patrikios|patrician]] Areobindus in early 545 to share command with Sergius, but both were militarily incompetent and spent their time bickering with each other.{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=86}}{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=146}} While Sergius remained inactive at [[Carthage]], Antalas and Stotzas led their troops north and managed to trick Himerius, the commander of [[Hadrumetum]], into leaving the town with his troops and rendezvous with another Byzantine commander, [[John (son of Sisinniolus)|John]]. Himerius fell into the trap, and while his soldiers mutinied and joined Stotzas, he was forced to betray Hadrumetum to save his life.{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=86, 599–600}} Finally, in late 545 Areobindus ordered the reluctant John to advance and meet the joint army of Antalas and Stotzas, which was encamped at [[Sicca Veneria]]. John's troops were considerably outnumbered by the rebel forces, and in the [[Battle of Thacia]] his army was routed and he himself was killed, but not before mortally wounding Stotzas in a [[duel]].{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=146}}{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=86, 641}}

After the defeat at [[Thacia]], Sergius was relieved and Areobindus replaced him. At this time, the ambitious [[Byzantine]] ''[[dux]]'' of [[Numidia]], [[Guntarith|Guntharic]] contacted the various [[Berbers|Berber]] leaders in a bid to unseat Areobindus. Antalas was promised the rule of [[Byzacena]], half the treasure of Areobindus and 1,500 [[Byzantine]] troops as his command. In order to increase pressure on Areobindus, the Berbers and the renegade followers of Stotzas approached [[Carthage]]. At the same time, Areobindus himself had secret contacts with another Berber leader, [[Cutzinas]], leader of the Numidian Berbers. Cutzinas had promised to murder Antalas once battle was joined, but Guntharic revealed this plan to Antalas. In the event, due to Areobindus' timidity, a battle did not take place; in March Guntharic seized Carthage and murdered Areobindus.{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=146}}{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=86–87, 108–109}}

Now master of Carthage, Guntharic refused to honour his agreement with Antalas, and the latter withdrew his men into Byzacena. There, in an effort to reconcile himself with the emperor, he contacted the ''dux'' of Byzacena, Marcentius, who had fled to an offshore island, proposing to make common cause against Guntharic. Guntharic sent an army under Cutzinas and [[Artabanes (general)|Artabanes]] against Antalas and defeated him.{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=87, 818}} Guntharic himself was murdered soon after (May 546) by a conspiracy headed by Artabanes, and Carthage and the army returned to the Empire's allegiance. Justinian now sent an experienced soldier, [[John Troglita]], to impose order on the troubled African provinces.{{sfn|Bury|1958|pp=146–147}} Gathering his forces, Troglita marched out of Carthage into Byzacena. Antalas sent an embassy to the Byzantine general, but the latter rejected his demands and imprisoned the envoys. Shortly after, he sent an emissary of his own, who placed Antalas before the choice of battle or immediate submission. Antalas refused to submit, and the two armies confronted each other somewhere in Byzacena in late 546 or early 547. The battle resulted in a crushing Byzantine victory: the Berbers suffered heavy losses, and the battle-standards lost at Cillium were recovered by the Byzantines.{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=87, 647}}{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=147}}

In the summer, however, Antalas joined the Berbers of Tripolitania (though he is not mentioned by Corippus, [[Procopius]] records his presence) and inflicted a heavy defeat on Troglita at the [[Battle of Marta]]. After their victory, the Berbers raided even to the outskirts of Carthage.{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=147}}{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=87, 647–648}} In the next year, Antalas again joined the Tripolitanian Berbers, under their leader [[Carcasan]], when they invaded Byzacena. In contrast to the impetuous Carcasan, Antalas advocated a more cautious [[scorched earth]] tactic when Troglita marched forth to meet them. Nevertheless, when the two adversaries met later in the summer in the [[Battle of the Fields of Cato]], the result was a decisive Byzantine victory: Carcasan fell, and the Berber revolt was crushed as Antalas and the surviving leaders submitted to Troglita. Nothing further is known of him after that.{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=147}}{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=87, 648–649}}

'''''Assassins''''' is a [[Musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[Libretto|book]] by [[John Weidman]], based on an idea by [[Charles Gilbert, Jr.]] It uses the premise of a murderous [[carnival game]] to produce a [[revue]]-style portrayal of [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots|men and women who attempted (successfully or not) to assassinate]] [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]]. The music varies to reflect the popular music of the eras depicted.

The musical first opened [[Off-Broadway]] in 1990, and the 2004 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production won five [[Tony Award]]s.

==History and productions==
As a panelist at producer [[Stuart Ostrow]]'s Musical Theater Lab, Sondheim read a script by playwright [[Charles Gilbert, Jr.]] Sondheim asked Gilbert for permission to use his idea. Gilbert consented and offered to write the book; but Sondheim declined, having already had collaborator John Weidman in mind. Weidman had written the book for ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' and would work with Sondheim again on ''[[Road Show (musical)|Road Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Cerveris|title=Story of Assassins|url=http://www.amazing-journey.com/assassins_story.htm|work=Amazing Journey|year=2008|accessdate=2008-08-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802041854/http://www.amazing-journey.com/assassins_story.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roundabout Theater Company]]'s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production was originally scheduled for 2001 but was postponed to April 22, 2004, because the content was sensitive in light of the events of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ernio Hernandez|title=The Shots Heard Round the World: Musical Assassins Opens on Broadway|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/85711.html|work=Playbill|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Beaumont|title=Something Just Broke|url=http://www.sondheim.com/news/something_just_broke.html|work=Sondheim.com|date=December 14, 2003|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 101 performances at [[Studio 54]], ''Assassins'' closed on July 18, 2004.

== Versions ==
The three versions (original, London and Broadway) were not identical, as roles were combined, and the song "Something Just Broke" was new to the London production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Assassins | url=http://www.sondheim.com/shows/assassins | work=Sondheim.com | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, [[Theatre Communications Group]] published the [[libretto]], which did not feature "Something Just Broke".

The current licensed version of the musical reflects the 2004 Broadway revival. Although the script does not combine The Balladeer and Oswald into a single role, many productions have followed the revival in doing so.

== Synopsis ==
This synopsis reflects the current licensed version of the show. The published script of the 1992 Off-Broadway production is slightly different.

The play opens in a fairground shooting gallery where, amid flashing lights, human figures trundle past on a conveyor belt. One by one, a collection of misfits enters the stage, where the Proprietor of the game entices them to play, promising that their problems will be solved by killing a President ("Everybody’s Got the Right"). [[Leon Czolgosz]], [[John Hinckley, Jr.|John Hinckley]], [[Charles J. Guiteau|Charles Guiteau]], [[Giuseppe Zangara]], [[Samuel Byck]], [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]], and [[Sara Jane Moore]] are given their guns one by one. [[John Wilkes Booth]] enters last and the Proprietor introduces him to the others as their pioneer before he begins distributing ammunition. The assassins take aim as "[[Hail to the Chief]]" heralds [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s offstage arrival. Booth excuses himself, a shot rings out and Booth shouts, "''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]!''"

The Balladeer, a personification of the American Dream, appears and begins to tell John Wilkes Booth's story ("The Ballad of Booth"). The scene changes to Richard H. Garrett's barn in 1865. Booth, mudstained and with a broken leg, is attempting to write his reasons for killing Lincoln in his diary but cannot hold the pen. He forces his associate [[David Herold]] to write for him at gunpoint. As Booth dictates, blaming Lincoln for the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] and for destroying the South, the Balladeer interjects that Booth's motives really had more to do with his personal problems. When a Union soldier calls for Booth's surrender, Herold abandons him and surrenders. In desperation, Booth throws the Balladeer his diary so that he can tell his story to the world. The Balladeer reads out Booth’s justifications, and Booth laments that the act for which he has given up his life will not be enough to heal the country. As the Union soldiers set fire to the barn, Booth commits suicide, and the Balladeer concludes that Booth was a madman whose treacherous legacy only served as inspiration for other madmen like him to damage the country. The Balladeer rips Booth's rationale from his diary and burns the pages.

The Assassins gather in a bar. Guiteau toasts to the Presidency of the United States, speaking of his ambition to become [[United States Ambassador to France|Ambassador to France]]. Zangara complains about his stomach pains, and Booth suggests fixing them by shooting [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Hinckley accidentally breaks a bottle, and Czolgosz flies into a rage, describing the horrors he sees in the bottle factory he works in, and how many men die or are injured just to make a bottle like the one Hinckley has just broken. Guiteau jokingly tells Czolgosz to find another job, and the two begin to argue about the American Dream, with Guiteau defending America and Czolgosz dismissing the "land of opportunity" as a lie. Czolgosz becomes enraged and grabs a bottle, barely stopping himself from throwing it across the room. Booth urges Czolgosz to take control of his fate by breaking a bottle himself, but Czolgosz cannot.

A radio broadcast, narrated by the Proprietor, describes Zangara's failed attempt to assassinate Roosevelt. He misses Roosevelt and accidentally kills Chicago Mayor [[Anton Cermak]] instead. Five Bystanders are interviewed in turn, telling the audience their personal versions of the event; each is convinced that he or she personally saved the President ("How I Saved Roosevelt"). From an electric chair, Zangara sings his refusal to be afraid and that he hadn't cared whom he killed as long as it was one of the men who control the money. Peeved that as an "American Nothing" he has no photographers at his execution, Zangara is electrocuted as the Bystanders preen for the cameras.

American [[anarchist]] leader [[Emma Goldman]] gives a lecture from offstage as Leon Czolgosz listens, enraptured. He introduces himself to her and declares his love, but she tells him to redirect his passion to the fight for social justice. She gives him a leaflet that she tells him contains an idea that is "not mine alone, but mine". As she prepares to leave, Czolgosz offers to carry her bag, to which Goldman protests by saying, "They make us servants, Leon. We do not make servants of each other." Czolgosz, in his first display of assertiveness, still insists.

Fromme and Moore meet on a park bench and share a joint. Fromme speaks of the apocalyptic preachings of [[mass murderer]] [[Charles Manson]], remembering how they met and declaring herself his lover and slave. Juggling her purse, a can of [[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] and a bucket of [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], Moore claims she is an informant for the [[FBI]] (or used to be), has been a [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] and had five husbands and three children. They connect over their shared hatred of their fathers, and using [[Colonel Sanders]] as a [[Idolatry|graven image]], they give the bucket of chicken the evil eye and then shoot it to pieces while laughing hysterically. Moore realizes that she had known Manson in high school, and the scene ends as the women scream in delight over their memories of the charismatic killer.

Czolgosz reflects on how many men die in the mines, the steel mills and the factories just to make a gun. Booth, Guiteau and Moore enter one by one and join him in a [[barbershop quartet]] in which they honor a single gun's power to change the world ("The Gun Song"). Czolgosz decides his gun will claim one more victim: the President.

Czolgosz arrives at the 1901 [[Pan American Exposition]] and sees that [[William McKinley]] is shaking visitors' hands in the Temple of Music Pavilion. The Balladeer sings "The Ballad of Czolgosz" as Czolgosz joins the receiving line, and upon reaching McKinley, he shoots him.

Samuel Byck sits on a park bench in a dirty Santa suit with a picket sign and a shopping bag. He talks into a tape recorder, preparing a message to [[Leonard Bernstein]] telling Bernstein he can save the world by writing more love songs, and explaining that he is going to change things by crashing a 747 into the White House and killing [[Richard Nixon]]. Then he accuses Bernstein of ignoring him, just like the other celebrities he has recorded tapes for, such as [[Hank Aaron]] and [[Jonas Salk]]. After flying into an expletive-laden rage, Byck stands up on the bench and angrily sings the chorus to ''[[West Side Story]]''{{'}}s song "[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]" before storming offstage.

John Hinckley sits in his [[Recreation room|rumpus room]], aimlessly playing a guitar. Lynette Fromme enters and tries to convince him to play her a song (asking for "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]"), but he refuses. Fromme notices a picture of [[Jodie Foster]], who Hinckley claims is his girlfriend. When Fromme realizes the picture is a publicity photo from a film, she pulls out a picture of Charles Manson and mocks Hinckley for being in love with a woman he's never met, which makes him throw her out in a fit of rage. Alone, he swears that he will win Foster's love "with one brave, historic act" and sings a love song to her while Fromme individually does the same to Manson ("Unworthy of Your Love"). An image of [[Ronald Reagan]] appears on a wall in the back of the stage, and an enraged Hinckley shoots it over and over again, but the picture keeps reappearing. The Proprietor mocks Hinckley by quoting Reagan's famous quips about the assassination as Hinckley fires and fires, missing each time.

Back at the Proprietor's shooting range, Charles Guiteau flirts with Sara Jane Moore while giving her marksmanship tips before trying to kiss her. When she rebuffs him, he becomes suddenly enraged and attempts to attack her. Her gun goes off in his ear, and he backs off, angrily proclaiming that he is extraordinary and will be the next Ambassador to France. The scene changes to a train station, where Guiteau goes to meet [[James Garfield]]. He asks to be made Ambassador to France, but Garfield mockingly refuses, prompting Guiteau to shoot him.

Guiteau is arrested and sent to the gallows, where he recites a poem he wrote that morning titled "[[I am Going to the Lordy]]". When Guiteau finishes, the Balladeer enters and sings about Guiteau's trial and sentencing while Guiteau merrily [[cakewalks]] up to the noose, getting more and more desperately optimistic with each verse. Guiteau sings along with the Balladeer about Guiteau's optimism before he is finally hanged ("The Ballad of Guiteau").

Squeaky Fromme and Sara Jane Moore prepare to assassinate [[Gerald Ford]]. Moore has brought along her nine-year-old son and her dog (which she accidentally shoots), which causes an argument between the two women, who briefly turn on each other. Moore accidentally spills her gun's bullets just as President Ford enters the stage. Not recognizing him at first, the two women allow him to help them, but upon discovering who he is, Fromme tries to shoot him, but her gun jams. Having no other resource left, Moore tries to throw her bullets at Ford, shouting "bang" as she does so.

Samuel Byck is driving to the airport to hijack a plane, which he plans to crash into the [[White House]]. Growing completely unhinged, he records a message addressed to [[Richard Nixon]], complaining about contemporary American life, how the American public is constantly lied to, and announces that killing him is the only solution.

The assassins congregate in the Proprietor's shooting range once again and enumerate their reasons for taking action. Led by Byck, they lament that they haven't gotten the rewards they were "promised". The Balladeer tells them that their actions didn't solve their problems or the country's and that if they want their prizes they must follow the American Dream. The assassins realize that they will never get their prizes, that no one will ever care if they live or die, and briefly sink into absolute desperation until Byck and the Proprietor lead them in "Another National Anthem," a song for all Americans dispossessed by the dream. The Balladeer attempts to convince them to be optimistic and seek other ways to be happy, but the Anthem grows louder and louder until the assassins force the Balladeer offstage (in the 2004 revival and many productions that followed, the Assassins all surround the Balladeer, transforming him into Lee Harvey Oswald).

The scene changes to the sixth floor of the [[Texas School Book Depository]]. The ghosts of [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[Leon Czolgosz]], [[Charles J. Guiteau|Charles Guiteau]], and other "would be" assassins including [[John Hinckley]], [[Arthur Bremer]], [[Sirhan Sirhan]] and [[James Earl Ray]], appear before a suicidally depressed [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], and convince him that the only way for him to truly connect with his country is to share his pain and disillusionment with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/07/19/specials/sondheim-assassins.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar |title=Theater: Sondheim's 'Assassins': Insane Realities of History | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; They slowly and carefully attempt to convince him not to become his own victim and to instead assassinate [[John F. Kennedy]]. Booth tells Oswald that by joining them he will finally make a difference, but Oswald refuses. Booth tells him that in the future, when Hinckley’s room is searched, Oswald's biographies will be found. Booth tells Oswald that the key to the future is in his hands. Oswald tries to leave, but Zangara addresses him passionately in Italian, his words translated by the other assassins, imploring him to act so their own acts can come alive again. They tell him that he has the power to cause worldwide grief and inspire global passion about himself, a man the world has never cared or heard about. Calling themselves his family, the assassins sing, imploring Oswald to act. He crouches at the window and shoots ("November 22, 1963").

After the assassinations, a group of citizens recount what they were doing when they heard that the President had been killed and lament that even though only a single man died, the nation has changed forever ("Something Just Broke").

The assassins regroup once more at the shooting range, now with Oswald among their ranks, and they proudly restate their motto, "Everybody's got the right to be happy," before loading their guns and opening fire on the audience ("Everybody's Got the Right (Reprise)").

== Cultural impact ==
Sondheim has said that he expected backlash from the public due to the content. "There are always people who think that certain subjects are not right for musicals...[w]e're not going to apologize for dealing with such a volatile subject. Nowadays, virtually everything goes," he told ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Mervyn|title=Sondheim's 'Assassins': Insane Realities of History|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/07/19/specials/sondheim-assassins.html|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By developing the characters of historic assassins out of the slim biographical information found in the daily news, ''Assassins'' prompts us to consider their motivation. "(Sondheim) confronts pain in order to cauterize the decay and heal the sicknesses which lurk at the core of our society". Departing from the humanism of his previous musical ''[[Into the Woods]]'', Sondheim suggests that political murderers are a product of the American political culture ([[Joanne Gordon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gordon | first=Joanne | title=Art Isn't Easy: The Theater of Stephen Sondheim | pages=318, 337 | edition=First | location=New York | publisher=DaCapo Press, Inc | year=1990 | isbn=0-306-80468-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian and commentator [[Sarah Vowell]] introduced her 2005 analysis of the Lincoln, McKinley, and Garfield murders, ''[[Assassination Vacation]]'', with a journey from New York City into New England to attend a performance of ''Assassins'', the musical prompting her writing of the book.

Although ''Assassins'' had not run on Broadway prior to 2004, the 1992 West End production and 1991 Off-Broadway production led to a ruling by the Tony Awards Administration Committee that the musical is a revival instead of an original musical.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew. [https://archive.is/20130131144604/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/86039-Tony-Rulings-Assassins-Deemed-a-Revival "Tony Rulings: ''Assassins'' Deemed a Revival".] Playbill.com, May 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recordings ==
Recordings of both the Off-Broadway production and the 2004 revival are commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;The Off-Broadway production is audio CD ASIN: B000003F3N and the revival is ASIN: B0002B161Y.&lt;/ref&gt; The Off-Broadway version does not include the song 'Something Just Broke', which was added to the show for the subsequent London production.

While the original Off-Broadway production used just three musicians, the original cast recording was fully orchestrated by [[Michael Starobin]], with 33 musicians directed by [[Paul Gemignani]].&lt;ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Awa Dance Festival'''|阿波踊り|Awa Odori}} is held from 12 to 15 August as part of the [[Obon|Obon festival]] in [[Tokushima Prefecture]] on [[Shikoku]] in [[Japan]]. Awa Odori is the largest dance festival in Japan, attracting over 1.3 million tourists every year.&lt;ref&gt;http://web-japan.org/atlas/festivals/fes19.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of choreographed dancers and musicians known as ''ren'' (連) dance through the streets, typically accompanied by the [[shamisen]] lute, [[taiko]] drums, [[shinobue]] flute and the [[kane (musical instrument)|kane]] bell. Performers wear traditional obon dance costumes, and chant and sing as they parade through the streets.

[[Awa Province (Tokushima)|Awa]] is the old [[feudal|feudal administration]] name for Tokushima Prefecture, and [[Japanese traditional dance|odori]] means dance.

==History==
The earliest origins of the dance style are found in the [[Japanese Buddhist]] priestly dances of [[Nembutsu]]-odori and ''hiji-odori''{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;!--In fact Google does not know about such a thing; and even about ひじおどり --&gt; of the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333), and also in ''kumi-odori'', a lively harvest dance that was known to last for several days.&lt;ref&gt;Miyoshi Shōichirō (2001) Tokushima Hanshi Tokuhon&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awa Odori festival grew out of the tradition of the [[Bon Odori]] which is danced as part of the [[Bon Festival|Bon]] "Festival of the Dead", a [[Japanese Buddhist]] celebration where the [[spirits]] of deceased [[ancestors]] are said to visit their living [[Kinship|relatives]] for a few days of the year. The term "Awa Odori" was not used until the 20th century, but Bon festivities in Tokushima have been famous for their size, exuberance and anarchy since the 16th century.

Awa Odori's independent existence as a huge, citywide dance party is popularly believed to have begun in 1586 when Lord [[Hachisuka Iemasa]], the ''[[daimyō]]'' of Awa Province hosted a drunken celebration of the opening of [[Tokushima Castle]].  The locals, having consumed a great amount of [[sake]], began to drunkenly weave and stumble back and forth.  Others picked up commonly available [[musical instrument]]s and began to play a simple, rhythmic song, to which the revelers invented [[lyrics]]. The lyrics are given in the 'Song' section of this article.

This version of events is supported by the lyrics of the first verse of "Awa Yoshikono Bushi", a local version of a popular [[folk music|folk song]] which praises [[Hachisuka Iemasa]] for giving the people Awa Odori and is quoted in the majority of tourist brochures and websites.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/indepth/history/traditionalevents/a46_fes_awa.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to local historian Miyoshi Shoichiro, this story first appeared in a ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' newspaper article in 1908 and is unsupported by any concrete evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Miyoshi Shoichiro (2001:35) Tokushima Hanshi Tokuhon&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the song [[lyrics]] were written before or after this article appeared.

Some evidence of the festival's history comes from edicts issued by the [[Tokushima Domain|Tokushima-han]] feudal administration, such as this one dating from 1671:&lt;ref&gt;Miyoshi 2001: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. The [[bon-odori]] may be danced for only three days.&lt;br /&gt;2. [[Samurai]] are forbidden to attend the public celebration. They may dance on their own premises but must keep the gates shut.  No quarrels, arguments or other misbehaviour  are allowed.&lt;br /&gt;3. The dancing of bon-odori is prohibited in all temple grounds.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This suggests that by the 17th century, Awa's bon-odori was well established as a major event, lasting over three days—long enough to be a major disruption to the normal functioning of the city.  It implies that [[samurai]] joined the festival alongside [[peasants]] and merchants, disgracing themselves with brawling and unseemly behaviour. In 1674, it was "forbidden for dancers or spectators to carry [[sword]]s (wooden or otherwise), [[dagger]]s or [[Polearm|poles]]".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}} In 1685 revelers were prohibited from dancing after midnight and dancers were not allowed to wear any head or face coverings,&lt;ref&gt;Wisneiwski, Mark (2003:2) "The Awa Odori Trilogy" in ''Awa Life''&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that there were some serious public order concerns.

In the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912) the festival died down as the Tokushima's [[indigo dye|indigo]] trade, which had financed the festival, collapsed due to imports of cheaper chemical dyes.&lt;ref&gt;Wisneiwski, Mark (2003) "The Awa Odori Trilogy" in ''Awa Life''.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was revitalised at the start of the [[Shōwa period]] (1926) when Tokushima Prefectural authorities first coined the name "Awa Odori" and promoted it as the region's leading tourist attraction.

==Song==
[[File:Awa-Odori-kikusui-narimono.JPG|240px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;{{nihongo|Narimono players|鳴り物|Narimono}}]]
The song associated with Awa Odori is called ''Awa Yoshikono'' and is a localised version of the [[Edo period]] popular song ''Yoshikono Bushi''.  Parts of it are sung, and others are chanted.  The origins of the melodic part have been traced to [[Kumamoto]], [[Kyūshū]], but the Awa version came from [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], from where it spread back down to [[Nagoya]] and [[Kansai]].&lt;ref&gt;Wisniewski, Mark (2003:3) "The Awa Odori Trilogy" in ''Awa Life''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lyrics]] of the first verse are:

''Awa no tono sama Hachisuka-sama ga ima ni nokoseshi Awa Odori''&lt;br /&gt;What Awa's Lord Hachisuka left us to the present day is Awa Odori

The song is usually sung at a point in the parade where the dancers can stop and perform a stationary dance &amp;mdash; for example a street intersection or in front of the ticketed, amplified stands which are set up at points around the city.  Not every group has a singer, but dancers and musicians will frequently break out into the Awa Yoshikono chant as they parade through the streets:

The dancers also chant ''hayashi kotoba'' call and response patterns such as "Yattosa, yattosa", "Hayaccha yaccha", "Erai yaccha, erai yaccha", and "Yoi, yoi, yoi, yoi".  These calls have no [[semantic]] meaning but help to encourage the dancers.

== Dance ==
During the daytime a restrained dance called ''Nagashi'' is performed, but at night the dancers switch to a frenzied dance called ''Zomeki''. As suggested by the lyrics of the chant, spectators are often encouraged to join the dance.

Men and women dance in different styles. For the men’s dance: right foot and right arm forward, touch the ground with toes, then step with right foot crossing over left leg. This is then repeated with the left leg and arm. Whilst doing this, the hands draw triangles in the air with a flick of the wrists, starting at different points.  Men dance in a low crouch with knees pointing outwards and arms held above the shoulders.

The women's dance uses the same basic steps, although the posture is quite different. The restrictive [[kimono]] allows only the smallest of steps forward but a crisp kick behind, and the hand gestures are more restrained and graceful, reaching up towards the sky. Women usually dance in tight formation, poised on the ends of their [[geta (footwear)|geta]] sandals.

Children and adolescents of both sexes usually dance the men's dance. In recent years, it has become more common to see adult women, especially those in their 20s, dancing the men's style of dance.

Some of the larger ''ren'' (dance groups) also have a ''yakko odori'', or [[kite]] dance. This usually involves one brightly dressed, acrobatic dancer, darting backwards and forwards, turning [[cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]] and somersaults, with freestyle [[choreography]]. In some versions, other male dancers crouch down forming a sinuous line representing the string, and a man at the other end [[mimes]] controlling the kite.&lt;ref&gt;Awa Odori video available from Tokushima Prefecture International Exchange Association (TOPIA)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awa Dance Festivals elsewhere ==
[[Kōenji]], an area of [[Tokyo]], also has an [[Kōenji Awa Odori|Awa Dance Festival]], modeled on Tokushima's, which was started in 1956 by urban migrants from [[Tokushima Prefecture]]. It is the second largest Awa Dance Festival in Japan, with an average of 188 groups composed of 12,000 dancers, attracting 1.2 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koenji-awaodori.com/en/more/ Official Koenji Awa Odori Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122134717/http://www.koenji-awaodori.com/en/more/ |date=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese production company Tokyo Story produced a version of Awa Odori in 2015 in Paris by bringing dancers from Japan in order to promote Awa Odori and the Japanese "matsuri" culture abroad.

==In popular culture==
''Awa dance'' is a 2007 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese movie]] starring [[Nana Eikura]].
The festival is also prominently featured in the 2007 movie [[Bizan]] starring [[Matsushima Nanako]]. Posters representing popular anime characters practicing the Awa dance are also printed every year for the festival. They have featured '''Fate/stay night''' for example in [http://ilovetokushima.com/?p=3933 2014].

The '''Battle of Suiyang''' ({{lang|zh|睢陽之戰}}) was a battle in [[Suiyang District|Suiyang]] during the [[An Shi Rebellion]], between the rebel [[An Lushan]]'s [[Yan (Anshi)|Yan]] army and the loyalist forces of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] army.  Although the battle was ultimately won by Yan, it suffered [[attrition warfare|a major loss of manpower and time]]. The battle was noted for Tang army's determination to fight to the last man, and also due to the [[cannibalism]] that occurred during the siege.

==Background==
In January 757 AD, An Lushan was killed by his own son [[An Qingxu]]. In the same month, An Qingxu ordered general [[Yin Ziqi]] ({{lang|zh|尹子奇}}) to besiege Suiyang. Yin Ziqi joined with Yang Chaozong before the siege, with a total army size over 130,000 men. The governor of Suiyang at the time, [[Xu Yuan (Tang Dynasty)|Xu Yuan]] ({{lang|zh|許遠}}), heard of [[Zhang Xun (Tang Dynasty)|Zhang Xun]]'s fortress defence abilities in the [[Battle of Yongqiu]] and asked him for help. Zhang Xun knew that if Suiyang fell, the rest of Tang's territory south of the [[Yangtze River]] would be threatened. He agreed to help immediately.

==Process==

===Beginning===

The united army of Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan, around 7,000 men, prepared to defend Suiyang with their lives. Xu Yuan focused on supplies management and after-battle repairs. Zhang Xun, on the other hand, focused on battle tactics.

Despite daily sieges by the Yan army, the Tang soldiers never let up. Zhang Xun's troops played the war-drums during the night, acting as if they were going to fight (a tactic that army apparently had used before). Consequently, the Yan army were forced to stand on guard during the night, and suffered from the lack of sleep. Eventually, some troops did not bother to put on their armor when they heard these [[battle drum]]s, and kept sleeping. After the Yan army lowered their defenses, Zhang Xun's forces ambushed them very successfully.

Zhang Xun had long wanted to give the Yan morale a major blow, and the best way to do this would be to hurt or kill the Yan general Yin Ziqi. However, in an age before [[photography]], the problem was that Zhang had no idea what Yin Ziqi looked like, not to mention he would be in a mix of soldiers. Zhang therefore turned to psychology. He ordered his troops to shoot weeds, instead of arrows, at a few enemy soldiers. When these soldiers noticed that they were being shot by weeds, hence were not killed, they were overjoyed. They promptly ran to Yin Ziqi to report that the Tang army had already run out of arrows. Zhang Xun noticed where the soldiers ran and ordered his best archers to shoot at Yin Ziqi. One such arrow hit Yin Ziqi in his left eye, throwing the Yan army instantly into chaos. The siege ended with the expected major blow to the Yan morale.

After 16 days of siege and ambush, Yan had already lost 20,000 men. Yin Ziqi decided that his army was too tired to fight, so he ordered a temporary retreat to regroup. Yin Ziqi returned to besiege Suiyang two months later, with an additional 20,000 fresh troops.

[[Image:ChinaHenanShangqiu.png|200px|right|thumb|Location of [[Shangqiu]], where Suiyang was]]
Originally, Xu Yuan had prepared for the upcoming battle by storing 1 year of food supply inside of Suiyang. But the district governor had insisted that he share the large food supply with other nearby fortresses, and hence the food supply became much less than what Xu Yuan originally planned. By July, the Tang soldiers had fallen into a serious food shortage. Tang soldiers were given very small daily rations of rice. If they wanted more food, they would need to settle for whatever animals, insects, and tree roots that could be found in their vicinity.

Yin Ziqi noticed the [[famine]] that was plaguing the Tang army; he therefore ordered more troops to surround Suiyang. He made many siege attempts with siege ladders, but they were all repelled by the determined Tang troops. Yin Ziqi even used hooked pulled carts, to try to pull down the towers of the fortress, with limited success. The Tang soldiers were able to destroy the hook of these carts, before major damage was made. But even with the battle success, Zhang Xun knew that with only around 1,600 soldiers left, and most of them sick or hungry, the battle would soon be a lost cause.

By August, all of the insects, animals and vegetation in the besieged area had been eaten. Zhang Xun ordered 30 of his best soldiers, including his best soldier captain [[Nan Jiyun]] ({{lang|zh|南霽雲}}), to break through and ask for help from nearby fortresses. Nan Jiyun and 26 others successfully broke through. However, none of the nearby local governors were willing to offer troops and food supplies. Finally, Nan Jiyun asked for help from [[Helan Jinming]] ({{lang|zh|賀蘭進明}}), governor of the nearby [[Linhuai]] ({{lang|zh|臨淮}}). Helan had long been jealous of Zhang Xun's abilities.  He also wanted to preserve his forces, so he refused to assist Zhang Xun. Instead, he offered Nan Jiyun a large feast, to try to convince him to join his ranks. Nan replied, "The reason why I risked my life to come here is because the local civilians and my comrades have no food to eat for over a month. How can I eat such a huge feast when I know that my comrades are facing? Although I failed my mission, I will leave a finger with you, as evidence that I did come here." Immediately after, Nan Jiyun cut off (or, in some versions, bit off) one of his own fingers. He then rode away.

Nan Jiyun's bravery finally convinced a local governor [[Lian Huan]] ({{lang|zh|廉垣}}) to lend 3,000 soldiers to him. Both of them fought their way through the Yan ranks back into Suiyang. Fighting through the numerous Yan army was damaging, and only about 1,000 of the soldiers from the outside made it inside the fortress.

The starving Tang soldiers, numbering about 1,600 in total and with no chance of outside help, fell into despair. Almost everyone tried to convince Zhang Xun to surrender, or find some way of escape south. Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan discussed this, and Xu Yuan concluded, "If Suiyang falls, Yan will be free to conquer the rest of southern China. And on top of it, most of our soldiers are too tired and hungry to run. The only choice we have left is to defend for as long as possible, and hope that a nearby governor will come and help us."  Zhang Xun agreed with him. Zhang Xun announced to his remaining troops, "The nearby governors might be inelegant, but we cannot be disloyal. Another day that we can hold out is another day for the rest of the Tang to prepare defenses. We will fight till the very end."

===Cannibalism===

At this time, besieged Suiyang had long been in a state of famine. The Old Book of Tang says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|zh|尹子奇攻圍既久，城中糧盡，易子而食，析骸而爨，人心危恐，慮將有變。巡乃出其妾，對三軍殺之，以饗軍士。曰：“諸公為國家戮力守城，一心無二，經年乏食，忠義不衰。巡不能自割肌膚，以啖將士，豈可惜此婦，坐視危迫。”將士皆泣下，不忍食，巡強令食之。乃括城中婦人；既盡，以男夫老小繼之，所食人口二三萬，人心終不離變。}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starblvd.com/mem/l/a/lastwit/war-state/oldtonshu/old194.htm 舊唐書 列傳第一百三十七 忠義下] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050923123431/http://www.starblvd.com/mem/l/a/lastwit/war-state/oldtonshu/old194.htm |date=September 23, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Yin Ziqi had besieged the city for a long time. The food in the city had run out. The dwellers traded their children to eat and cooked bodies of the dead. Fears were spread and worse situations were expected. At this time, Zhang Xun took his concubine out and killed her in front of his soldiers in order to feed them. He said, "You have been working hard at protecting this city for the country wholeheartedly. Your loyalty is uncompromised despite the long-lasting hunger. Since I can't cut out my own flesh to feed you, how can I keep this woman and just ignore the dangerous situation?" All the soldiers cried, and they did not want to eat. Zhang Xun ordered them to eat the flesh. Afterwards, they caught the women in the city. After the women were run out, they turned to old and young males. 20,000 to 30,000 people were eaten. People always remained loyal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Xu Yuan also killed his servants, which was recorded in The New Book of Tang:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|zh|...遠亦殺奴僮以哺卒...}}&lt;ref name="新唐書 列傳第一百一十七 忠義中"&gt;[http://www.angelibrary.com/oldies/xts/205.htm 新唐書 列傳第一百一十七 忠義中]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
...(Xu) Yuan also killed servants to feed the soldiers...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An explanation for people still staying loyal is accounted in The New Book of Tang:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|zh|被圍久，初殺馬食，既盡，而及婦人老弱凡食三萬口。人知將死，而莫有畔者。城破，遺民止四百而已。}}&lt;ref name="新唐書 列傳第一百一十七 忠義中"/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After the city was besieged for a long time, at the beginning, the horses were eaten. After horses ran out, they turned to the women, the old, and the young. 30,000 people in total were eaten. People knew their death was close, and nobody rebelled. When the city fell, only 400 people were left.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is possible that all dead soldiers and civilians were also eaten after this incident.

===Fall of Suiyang===

The Tang soldiers fought bravely until early October. Finally, with fewer than 400 men alive, and the men without the strength to shoot arrows, Suiyang fell to the Yan army. Zhang Xun said before the fall, "We are out of strength, and can no longer defend the fortress. Although we have failed the emperor in life, we hope to keep killing enemies after death."

Zhang Xun, Nan Jiyun and Xu Yuan were all captured. Yin Ziqi asked,"I heard that every time you fight, you open your eyelids until they rip, and you bite your teeth until they crack. Why do you do that?" Zhang Xun answered, "I want to eat you traitors alive. The damages to my eyes and teeth are nothing." Yin Ziqi used a dagger to hold open Zhang Xun's mouth, and to his surprise, all but three of Zhang Xun's teeth were indeed cracked. Zhang Xun finally said, "I die for my emperor, so I will die in peace."

Yin Ziqi admired Zhang Xun's bravery and commanding abilities. But no matter how hard Yin tried to persuade Zhang Xun, Nan Jiyun, and Xu Yuan, they would not join the Yan ranks. At the end, fearing further dangers, Yin killed all 3 men, along with 33 other loyal elite soldiers.

==Aftermath==
Zhang Xun was able to repel many overwhelming Yan attacks, with less than 10,000 soldiers during each battle. Because of Zhang Xun's determination, the resource-laden southern China did not come under threat from the rebels for almost 2 years. With such a large Yan army held at bay, Tang was able to use the resources to gather more troops for combat. This gave Tang enough time to regroup and strike back at Yan.

To Yan, the losses were enormous, although Yan won this series of battles. Before the Battles of Yongqiu and Suiyang, Yan had intended to conquer all of the Tang Dynasty. Their total army size, across the whole country, was well over 300,000 men, greatly outnumbering what the Tang army could have offered at the time. After these two battles, however, the tide had turned and the Tang army held the upper hand in both manpower and equipment. If Yan had conquered the whole Suiyang district even one year earlier, the Tang Dynasty might have ended by 757AD. The Suiyang campaign marked the turning point of [[An Shi Rebellion|the war]].

==Overview==
It is one of [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s ten principle capabilities (see [[capabilities approach]]). She defines bodily integrity as: "Being able to move freely from place to place; being able to be secure against violent assault, including [[sexual assault]] ... having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex and Social Justice''. Oxford UP, 1999. 41–42. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and law==

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], bodily integrity has been recognised by the courts as an [[Unenumerated rights|unenumerated right]], protected by the general guarantee of "[[personal rights]]" contained within Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]]. In ''Ryan v Attorney General'' it was pronounced that ""you have the right not to have your body or [[personhood]] interfered with. This means that the State may not do anything to harm your life or health. If you are in custody, you have a right not to have your health endangered while in prison".&lt;ref&gt;Ryan v Attorney General [1965] 1 IR 294 at 295. Judgement by Kenny J: "That the general guarantee of personal rights in section 3 (1) of Art. 40 extends to rights not specified in Art. 40.

=== United States ===
The [[United States Constitution]] does not contain any specific provisions regarding the rights one has with respect to his or her physical body or the specific extent to which the state can act upon bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie. "Bodily Integrity, Reproductive Liberty and Legal Personhood authored by Lane, Julie." All Academic Inc. 2005. 05 Apr. 2011 http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/5/0/pages85503/p85503-3.php&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has upheld [[right to privacy]], which, as articulated by Julie Lane, often protects rights to bodily integrity. In ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965) the Court supported women's rights to obtain birth control (and thus, retain reproductive autonomy) without marital consent. Similarly, a woman's right to privacy in obtaining [[abortion]]s was protected by ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973). In ''[[McFall v. Shimp]]'' (1978), a Pennsylvania court ruled that a person cannot be forced to donate bone marrow, even if such a donation would save another person's life.

Conversely, the Supreme Court has also protected the right of governmental entities to infringe upon bodily integrity. Examples include laws prohibiting the use of drugs, laws prohibiting [[euthanasia]], laws requiring the use of seatbelts and helmets, [[strip search]]es of prisoners, and forced [[Blood test|blood tests]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie. "Bodily Integrity, Reproductive Liberty and Legal Personhood authored by Lane, Julie." All Academic Inc. 2005. 05 Apr. 2011 http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/5/0/pages85503/p85503-14.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In general, the Canadian [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] defends personal liberty and the right not to be interfered with. However, in certain unique circumstances government may have the right to temporarily override the right to physical integrity in order to preserve the life of the person. Such action can be described using the principle of supported autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socscience.com/social-sciences/7327.html | title=琪琪布电影网}}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that was developed to describe unique situations in mental health (examples include the [[forced feeding]] of a person dying from the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]], or the temporary treatment of a person living with a [[psychotic disorder]] with [[antipsychotic]] medication).

One unique example of a Canadian law that promotes bodily integrity is the [[Ontario Health Care Consent Act]]. This Ontario law has to do with the capacity to [[consent]] to medical treatment.  The HCCA states that a person has the right to consent to or refuse treatment if they have mental capacity. In order to have capacity, a person must have the ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of the treatment decision. The law says that a person is capable with respect to a treatment, admission to a care facility or a personal assistance service if the person is able to ''understand'' and ''appreciate'' the information that is relevant to making such a decision.

== Human rights ==

Two key international documents protect these rights: the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].

The Human Rights and Constitutional Rights project, funded by Columbia Law School, has defined four main areas of potential bodily integrity abuse by governments. These are: Right to Life, [[Slavery]] and Forced Labor, Security of One's Person, [[Torture]] and Inhumane, [[cruel and unusual punishment |Cruel or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]].

== Women's rights ==
Though bodily integrity is (according to the [[capabilities approach]]) afforded to every human being, women are more often affected in violations of gender-based violence.[citation needed] These include [[sexual assault]], unwanted pregnancy, [[domestic abuse]], and limited access to [[contraception]]. These principles were addressed in the CCL Working Conference on Women's Rights as Human Rights. The conference defined bodily integrity as a right deserved by all women: "bodily integrity unifies women and that no woman can say that it does not apply to them".

As defined by the conference participants, the following are bodily integrity rights that should be guaranteed to women:
* [[Freedom of movement]]
* [[Security of person]]s
* [[Reproductive rights|Reproductive and sexual rights]]
* [[Women's health]]
* Breaking women's [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]]
* [[Education]]
* Networking&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Niamh. "Bodily Integrity and Security of Person." Women's Human Rights Campaign Ireland. 05 Apr. 2011 &lt;http://whr1998.tripod.com/documents/icclbodily.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's rights ==
{{see also|Children's rights|Child grooming}}
=== United States ===
The debate over children's rights to bodily integrity has grown in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, Patricia. ''Researching Children's Rights to Integrity'' in ''Children's Childhoods: Observed And Experienced''. The Falmer Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the highly publicized [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal|Jerry Sandusky trial]],&lt;ref&gt;''

''I don't own my child's body''. CNN, 20 July 2015. &lt;http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/20/living/give-grandma-hug-child/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of increasing children's sense of bodily autonomy include:
* Allowing children to choose when to give hugs/kisses
* Encouraging children to communicate about [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]]
* Offer alternative actions (e.g. a [[high five]], handshake, etc.)

In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."

'''CCGS ''Sir William Alexander'''''{{efn|name=prefix}} is a {{sclass-|Martha L. Black|icebreaker|0}} [[icebreaker|light icebreaker]]. Entering service in 1987, the vessel is currently assigned to CCG Maritimes Region and is [[homeport]]ed at CCG Base Dartmouth, in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]]. The vessel is named after [[Scotland|Scottish]] explorer Sir [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling]], who was an early colonizer of [[Nova Scotia]].

==Description and design==
Designed as a light icebreaker and [[buoy tender]], ''Sir William Alexander'' and [[sister ship]] {{ship|CCGS|Edward Cornwallis}} differ from the rest of the class by having one less deck in the superstructure and their buoy-handling derricks mounted forward. ''Sir William Alexander'' had her derricks replaced by a crane in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Maginley and Collin, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sir William Alexander'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaces]] {{convert|4662|LT|t}} fully loaded with a {{GT|3727.2|disp=long}} and a {{NetT|1503.0|disp=long}}. The ship is {{convert|83.0|m|ftin}} [[Length overall|long overall]] with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|16.2|m|ftin}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin}}.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;Saunders, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wacg1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/Fleet/Vessel?vessel_id=101 |title=CCG Fleet: Vessel Details – Sir William Alexander |publisher=Canadian Coast Guard |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vessel is powered by is propelled by two fixed pitch propellers and [[bow thruster]]s powered by three [[Alco]] 251F [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] engines creating {{convert|8,847|hp|lk=in}} and three Canadian GE generators producing 6 megawatts of AC power driving two Canadian GE motors creating {{convert|7040|hp}}.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;&lt;ref name=wacg1/&gt; The ship is also equipped with one [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] 3306 emergency generator. This gives the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|16|kn|km/h|lk=in}}. Capable of carrying {{convert|784.0|LT|t}} of [[diesel fuel]], ''Sir William Alexander'' has a maximum range of {{convert|6500|nmi|km|lk=in}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|13.7|kn|km/h}} and can stay at sea for up to 120 days. The ship is certified as [[Ice class#Arctic classes|Arctic Class 2]].&lt;ref name=wacg1/&gt;

The icebreaker is equipped with one [[Racal Decca]] Bridgemaster navigational radar operating on the I band. The vessel is equipped a {{convert|980|m3|abbr=on}} cargo hold. ''Sir William Alexander'' is equipped with a [[flight deck]] and a [[hangar]] that can house two light helicopters of the [[MBB Bo 105]] or [[Bell 206|Bell 206L]] types.&lt;ref name=wacg1/&gt; However, the vessel is only allotted one helicopter.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;&lt;ref name=wacg1/&gt; The ship has a complement of 26, with 10 officers and 16 crew. ''Sir William Alexander'' has nine additional berths.&lt;ref name=wacg1/&gt;

==Operational history==
The ship was constructed by [[Marine Industries]] at their yard in [[Sorel-Tracy|Tracy]], [[Quebec]] with the yard number 451.&lt;ref name=miramar&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=8320482|shipname=Sir William Alexander |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sir William Alexander'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 October 1986 and entered service on 13 February 1987.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;&lt;ref name=miramar/&gt;  The ship is [[Port of registry|registered]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], and homeported at [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;&lt;ref name=wacg1/&gt;

{{see|Canadian response to Hurricane Katrina}}

On 6 September 2005, CCGS ''Sir William Alexander'' left [[Halifax Harbour]], together with the Canadian [[warship]]s {{HMCS|Athabaskan|DDG 282|2}}, {{HMCS|Ville de Québec|FFH 332|2}} and {{HMCS|Toronto|FFH 333|2}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/martin-praises-katrina-relief-efforts/article1123408/ |title=Martin praises Katrina relief efforts |first=Terry |last=Weber |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=6 September 2005|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to participate in a [[humanitarian aid]] mission named Operation Unison, which provided relief to part of the devastated [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast of the United States following [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sir William Alexander'' participated in the mission as a supply vessel, and also to effect repairs to aids to navigation (navaids). The decision to assign ''Sir William Alexander'' to the Operation Unison task force was unprecedented in Canadian Coast Guard history as no icebreaker from the service has operated for an extended period of time in southern tropical waters such as the Gulf of Mexico, aside from transiting the [[Panama Canal]] to and from [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=mwl&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.vos.noaa.gov/MWL/apr_06/canada.shtml |title=Canadian Beacon-Operation Unison |last=Evanson |first=Christopher |magazine=Mariners Weather Log |volume=50 |number=1 |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |date=April 2006 |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2005, it was announced that the three warships were no longer needed in the Gulf of Mexico, given the massive U.S. military response as well as increasing civilian aid flowing into the region. ''Sir William Alexander'' was exempted from returning to Canada however, as her heavy lift capabilities were considered useful for ongoing repairs to aids to navigation which were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, and later [[Hurricane Rita]] (23 September).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1758 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129030802/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1758 |archivedate=29 November 2005 |title=Operation Unison Draws Down |publisher=[[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] |date=18 September 2005 |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September, the [[Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada)|Minister of Fisheries and Oceans]] announced that ''Sir William Alexander'' was being retasked from relief efforts and navigation systems repair to assist the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in repairing the damaged network of [[weather buoy]]s along the Gulf of Mexico, [[Caribbean Sea]], and Atlantic coasts. She returned to CCG Base Dartmouth from Operation Unison on 24 October 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Post-Katrina operations===
''Sir William Alexander'' was involved in a fatal towing incident involving the fishing vessel ''[[L'Acadien II]]'' during the [[2008 Canadian commercial seal hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/eng/CCG/Fleet-Home/Report-Events-lAcadienII |title=Report on the Events Related to the Capsizing and Sinking of L'ACADIEN II off the Coast of Cape Breton – 28 and 29 March 2008 |work=Canadian Coast Guard |year=2013 |accessdate=8 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001233131/http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/eng/CCG/Fleet-Home/Report-Events-lAcadienII |archivedate=1 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 September 2014, a [[Canadian Armed Forces]] [[Bell CH-146 Griffon]] helicopter clipped ''Sir William Alexander''{{'}}s antenna during a training exercise in Mahone Bay. The helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing in [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1240117-military-chopper-lands-on-island-after-clipping-coast-guard-ship-s-antenna |title=Military chopper lands on island after clipping coast guard ship's antenna |newspaper=The Chronicle Herald |last=Fairclough |first=Ian |date=30 September 2014 |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, ''Sir William Alexander'' was dispatched to aid the merchant vessel ''Thorco Crown'', which had caught fire in the [[Cabot Strait]]. The engine room fire was extinguished but the merchant was disabled. When a [[tugboat]] arrived to take ''Thorco Crown'' in tow, the tugboat was unable to secure the towline. ''Sir William Alexander'' then took ''Thorco Crown'' in tow during the night, transferring the tow to the tugboat in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1440700-coast-guard-aids-ship-after-fire |title=Coast Guard aids ship after fire |newspaper=The Chronicle Herald |date=10 February 2017 |accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a great many of methods to acquire [[credit card]] and associated financial and personal data. The earliest known carding methods have also included [[Information diving|'trashing']] for financial data, raiding [[Letter box|mail boxes]] and [[Inside job|working with insiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=Target Admits Massive Credit Card Breach; 40 Million Affected|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/12/target-hack-hits-40-million/|accessdate=8 August 2015|date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trash" /&gt;{{dubious|The first sentence in the "Structure" section|date=September 2015}} Some [[bank card number]]s can be semi-automatically generated based on known sequences via a 'BIN attack'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Card Bin Attack Fraud|url=http://www.syswaregroup.com/resource-centre/case-studies/banking/credit-card-fraud/|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carders might attempt a 'distributed guessing attack' to discover valid numbers by submitting numbers across a high number of ecommerce sites simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reporters|first1=Telegraph|title=Hacked in just six seconds: How criminals only need moments to guess card number and security code|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/02/hacked-just-six-seconds-criminals-need-moments-guess-card-number/|accessdate=2 December 2016|date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, various methodologies include [[Credit card fraud#Skimming|skimmers]] at [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]], [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] an [[ecommerce]] or [[Payment processor|payment processing]] site or even intercepting card data within a [[point of sale]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ilascu|first1=Ionut|title=Russian Point-of-Sale Hacker Pleads Not Guilty in US Court|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Russian-Point-of-Sale-Hacker-Pleads-Not-Guilty-in-US-Court-454539.shtml|accessdate=14 September 2015|date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randomly calling hotel room phones asking guests to 'confirm' credit card details is example of a [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] attack vector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weisbaum|first1=Herb|title=Summer travel alert: Scammer target hotel guests|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43662080/ns/business-consumer_news/t/summer-travel-alert-scammers-target-hotel-guests/|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stolen data may be bundled as a 'Base' or 'First-hand base' if the seller participated in the theft themselves. Resellers may buy 'packs' of dumps from multiple sources.

Sellers will advertise their dump's 'valid rate', based on estimates or checker data. Cards with a greater than 90% valid rate command higher prices. 'Cobs' or changes of billing are highly valued, where sufficient information is captured to allow redirection of the registered card's billing and shipping addresses to one under the carder's control.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeller JR|first1=Tom|title=Black Market in Stolen Credit Card Data Thrives on Internet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/technology/black-market-in-stolen-credit-card-data-thrives-on-internet.html|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=21 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent vendors are referred to as 'rippers', vendors who take buyer's money then never deliver. This is increasingly mitigated via forum and store based [[Reputation system|feedback systems]] as well as through strict site invitation and referral policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vijayan|first1=Jaikumar|title=The identity underworld: How criminals sell your data on the Dark Web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2015/0506/The-identity-underworld-How-criminals-sell-your-data-on-the-Dark-Web|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cash out ==
Funds from stolen cards themselves may be cashed out via buying [[Stored-value card|pre-paid cards]], [[gift card]]s or through [[Parcel mule scam|reshipping goods though mules]] then reselling through [[online marketplace]]s like [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=Brian|title=How Carders Can Use eBay as a Virtual ATM|url=https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/how-carders-can-use-ebay-as-a-virtual-atm/|accessdate=5 November 2015|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westin|first1=Ken|title=Stolen Target Credit Cards and the Black Market: How the Digital Underground Works|url=http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/vulnerability-management/how-stolen-target-credit-cards-are-used-on-the-black-market/|accessdate=11 August 2015|date=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased law enforcement scrutiny over reshipping services has led to the rise of dedicated criminal operations for reshipping stolen goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=Brian|title=Shady Reshipping Centers Exposed, Part I|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/10/shady-reshipping-centers-exposed-part-i/|accessdate=23 August 2015|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="label"/&gt;

== Money laundering ==
The 2004 investigation into the [[ShadowCrew]] forum also led to investigations of the online payment service [[E-gold]] that had been launched in 1996, one of the preferred money transfer systems of carders at the time. In December 2005 its owner Douglas Jackson's house and businesses were raided as a part of 'Operation Goldwire'. Jackson discovered that the service had become a bank and transfer system to the criminal underworld. Pressured to disclose ongoing records disclosed to law enforcement, many arrests were made through to 2007. However, in April 2007 Jackson himself was indicted for money laundering, conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. This led to the service freezing the assets of users in 'high risk' countries and coming under more traditional financial regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=Bullion and Bandits: The Improbable Rise and Fall of E-Gold|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/06/e-gold/|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, [[Liberty Reserve]] had become a popular service for cybercriminals. When it was seized in May 2013 by the US government, this caused a major disruption to the cybercrime ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halpern|first1=Jake|title=Bank of the Underworld|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/05/bank-of-the-underworld/389555/|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, some carders prefer to make payment between themselves with [[bitcoin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiell|title=A Carder’s First Experience|url=https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/12/11/a-carders-first-experience/|accessdate=18 August 2015|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kujawa|first1=Adam|title=FBI Takes Down Poorly Secured Carders|url=https://blog.malwarebytes.org/cyber-crime/2014/01/fbi-takes-down-poorly-secured-carders/|accessdate=23 August 2015|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2015}}{{failed verification|reason=sources are not reliable, and they do not contain any statement about preferences of carders|date=October 2015}} as well as traditional wire services such as [[Western Union]], [[MoneyGram]] or the Russian [[WebMoney]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=PULKKINEN|first1=LEVI|title=Piles of cash, bunches of bling and a public defender?|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Piles-of-cash-bunches-of-bling-and-a-public-6021422.php|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=Brian|title=Feds Charge Carding Kingpin in Retail Hacks|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/07/feds-charge-carding-kingpin-in-retail-hacks/|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=no information about preferences of carders, only Seleznev mentioned|date=October 2015}}

In the context of carding fraud, using stolen credit card data to purchase gift cards is becoming an increasingly common money laundering tactic. Another way gift card fraud occurs is when a retailer's online systems which store gift card data undergo brute force attacks from automated bots. 

[[Tax]] refund fraud is an increasingly popular method of using identify theft to acquire prepaid cards ready for immediate cash out.&lt;ref name="label" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=Brian|title=IRS: 330K Taxpayers Hit by ‘Get Transcript’ Scam|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/irs-330k-taxpayers-hit-by-get-transcript-scam/|accessdate=23 August 2015|date=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular [[coupon]]s may be counterfeited and sold also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Joseph|title=Dark Web Vendor Sentenced for Dealing Counterfeit Coupons|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dark-web-vendor-sentenced-for-dealing-counterfeit-coupons|accessdate=24 January 2016|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cashing out in gift cards is very common as well, as "discounted gift cards" can be found for sale anywhere, making it an easy sale for a carder, and a very lucrative operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/risk-based-security-for-executives/risk-management/gift-card-fraud-how-its-committed-and-why-its-so-lucrative/|title=Gift Card Fraud: How It’s Committed and Why It’s So Lucrative|date=2015-06-24|work=The State of Security|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s–1999 ===
Since the 1980s&lt;ref name=eighties&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Cards for fun and profit!|url=http://textfiles.com/anarchy/CARDING/credit|website=[[textfiles.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the days of the [[Bulletin board system|dial-up BBSes]], the term ''carding'' has been used to describe the practices surrounding credit card fraud. Methods such as [[Information diving|'trashing']], raiding [[Letter box|mail boxes]] and [[Inside job|working with insiders]] at stores were cited as effective ways of acquiring card details. Use of [[Dead drop|drops]] at places like abandoned houses and apartments or with persuadable neighbors near such a location were suggested.

Started in 1989, by 1990 [[Operation Sundevil]] was launched by the United States Secret Service to crack down on use of BBS groups involved in credit card fraud and other illegal computer activities, the most highly publicised action by the US federal government against hackers at the time.&lt;ref name="Sterling3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sterling |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Sterling |title=[[The Hacker Crackdown]]: Law And Disorder On The Electronic Frontier |accessdate=2009-03-08 |year=1994 |publisher=Bantam Books |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56370-X |chapter=Part Three: Law and Order |chapterurl=http://www.farcaster.com/sterling/part3.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the crack down was so much that the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] was formed in response to the violation of civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12717261.300-crackdown-on-hackers-may-violate-civil-rights-.html|title=Crackdown on hackers 'may violate civil rights' |last=Charles|first=Dan|date=1990-07-21|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s with the rise of [[AOL]] dial-up accounts, the [[AOHell]] software became a popular tool for [[phishing]] and stealing information such as credit card details from new Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LANGBERG|first1=MIKE|title=AOL ACTS TO THWART HACKERS|url=http://simson.net/clips/1995/95.SJMN.AOL_Hackers.html|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=8 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such abuse was exacerbated because prior to 1995 AOL did not validate subscription credit card numbers on account creation.&lt;ref name="aol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phishing: General Information|url=http://www.anti-abuse.org/phishing-general-information/|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse was so common AOL added "''no one working at AOL will ask for your password or billing information''" to all instant messenger communications. Only by 1997 when [[warez]] and phishing were pushed off the service did these types of attacks begin to decline.&lt;ref name="aol" /&gt;

December 1999 featured an unusual case of [[extortion]] when Maxim, a Russian 19-year-old, stole the 25,000 users' card details from [[CD Universe]] and demanded $100,000 for its destruction. When the ransom was not paid, the information was leaked on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MARKOFF|first1=JOHN|title=Thief Reveals Credit Card Data When Web Extortion Plot Fails|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/10/business/thief-reveals-credit-card-data-when-web-extortion-plot-fails.html|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=10 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first books written about carding, ''100% Internet Credit Card Fraud Protected'', featured content produced by 'Hawk' of carding group 'Universal Carders'. It described the spring 1999 hack and credit card theft on [[CyberCash, Inc.|CyberCash]], the stratification of carder proficiencies ([[script kiddie]] through to professionals) common purchases for each type and basic [[phishing]] schemes to acquire credit card data.&lt;ref name="hundredpercent"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vesper|title=100% Internet Credit Card Fraud Protected|date=2000|isbn=1552125343|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPU6DcS9MN0C|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1999, United States offline and online credit card fraud annual losses were estimated at between $500,000 and $2 million.&lt;ref name="hundredpercent" /&gt;

=== 2000–2006 ===
From the early 2000s, sites like '[https://web.archive.org/web/20040912012235/http://www.counterfeitlibrary.com/ The Counterfeit Library]', also functioning as a [[diploma mill]], grew to prominence, with many of its members going on to join larger cybercrime websites in later years until its closure around September 2004.&lt;ref name="historystuff" /&gt;

In 2001 Russian speaking hackers founded CarderPlanet in [[Odessa]] which would go on to be one of the most notorious forums of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farivar|first1=Cyrus|title=Ukrainian fraudster and CarderPlanet "Don" finally sentenced to 18 years|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/12/ukranian-fraudster-and-carderplanet-don-finally-sentenced-to-18-years/|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2003, separate [[US secret service]] and [[FBI]] investigations led to the arrest the top administrator [[Albert Gonzalez]] of the large [[ShadowCrew]] carding forums, turned [[informant]] as a part of 'Operation Firewall'. By March 2004, the administrator of 'CarderPlanet' disappeared with Gonzalez taking over. In October 2004 dozens of ShadowCrew members were busted across the US and Canada. Carder's speculate that one of the USSS infiltrators might have been detected by a fellow site member causing the operation to be expedited.&lt;ref name="historystuff" /&gt; Ultimately, the closure of ShadowCrew and CarderPlanet did not reduce the degree of fraud and led to the proliferation of smaller sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=Crime Boards Come Crashing Down|url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/02/72585?currentPage=all|accessdate=11 August 2015|date=1 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=9 Years After Shadowcrew, Feds Get Their Hands on Fugitive Cybercrook|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/bulgarian-shadowcrew-arrest/|accessdate=11 August 2015|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ShadowCrew admin Brett Shannon Johnson managed to avoid being arrested at this time, but was picked up in 2005 on separate charges then turned informant. Continuing to commit tax fraud as an informant, 'Operation Anglerphish' embedded him as admins on both ScandinavianCarding and CardersMarket. When his continued carding activities were exposed as a part of a separate investigation in 2006, he briefly went on the run before being caught for good in August of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=Secret Service Operative Moonlights as Identity Thief|url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/2007/06/secret_service?currentPage=all|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005 the credit card processing company [[CardSystems Solutions|CardSystems]] was hacked in what was at the time the largest personal information breach in history with many of the stolen information making its way to carding sites.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Later in 2007 the [[TJX Companies]] breach perpetuated by [[Albert Gonzalez]] (who was still an informant at the time)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/tjx-hacker-charged-with-heartland/TJX|title=4 Years After TJX Hack, Payment Industry Sets Security Standards|first=Kim|last=Zetter|date=|website=wired.com|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; would only come to the public's attention after stolen cards detected being misused to buy large amounts of gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hines|first1=Matt|title=Stolen TJX data used in Florida crime spree|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2544011/security0/stolen-tjx-data-used-in-florida-crime-spree.html|date=21 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzalez's 2008, intrusion into [[Heartland Payment Systems#Security breach|Heartland Payment Systems]] to steal card data was characterized as the largest ever criminal breach of card data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Rachael|title=Lessons from the Data Breach at Heartland|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2009-07-06/lessons-from-the-data-breach-at-heartlandbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|accessdate=8 June 2014|date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in June 2005, [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based carders were found to be collaborating with [[Russian mafia]] and arrested as a result of a [[National Hi-Tech Crime Unit]] investigation, looking into [[Eastern europe|Eastern European]] crime syndicates.&lt;ref name="historystuff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phishing pair jailed for ID fraud|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4628213.stm|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=29 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time in 2005, J. Keith Mularski from the [[NCFTA|National Cyber-Forensics &amp; Training Alliance]] headed up a sting into popular English language site [[DarkMarket|DarkMarket.ws]]. One of the few survivors of 'Operation Firewall', Mularski was able to infiltrate the site via taking over the handle 'Master Splyntr', an Eastern European spammer named Pavel Kaminski. In late 2006 the site was hacked by [[Max Butler]], who detected user 'Master Splyntr' had logged in from the NCFTA's offices, but the warning was dismissed as inter-forum rivalry. In 2007 details of the operation was revealed to German national police, that the NCFTA had successfully penetrated the forum's inner 'family'. By October 4, 2007 Mularski announced he was shutting the site due to unwanted attention from a fellow administrator, framed as 'too much attention' from law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poulsen|first1=Ken|title=Cybercrime Supersite ‘DarkMarket’ Was FBI Sting, Documents Confirm|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/10/darkmarket-post/|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years following site closure multiple arrests were made internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Caroline|title=Welcome to DarkMarket – global one-stop shop for cybercrime and banking fraud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/14/darkmarket-online-fraud-trial-wembley|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findikoğlu, a Turkish national, with a Russian wife, Alena Kovalenko, avoided capture by obscuring his cyber fingerprints and avoiding the reach of American law, but he went to Germany in December 2013, was arrested, lost a court challenge, was extradited. Findikoğlu, as a youngster honed his skills in cyber cafes, the Turkish military, and then masterminded three complex, global financial crimes by hacking into credit card processors, eliminating the limits on prepaid cards then sending PINs and access codes to teams of cashers who, within hours withdrew cash from ATMs. In December 2012, 5,000 cashers in 20 countries withdrew $5 million, $400,000 in 700 transactions from 140 New York ATMs, in 150 minutes. Stolen cash was kicked back via wire transfers and deliveries to Turkey, Romania and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/f57cbc7d748741ffa1eb32e478092379/us-judge-sentence-prolific-hacker-55m-scam|title=Foreign hacker gets 8 years in $55M US scam case|author=|date=|website=apnews.com|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3422">'''Civil Emergency Message''' ([[Specific Area Message Encoding|SAME]] code: CEM) is a warning issued through the [[Emergency Alert System]] (EAS) in the [[United States]] to warn the public of a significant in-progress or imminent threat to public safety. It is typically issued by a local or state authority and is relayed by the [[National Weather Service]]. The warning is a higher priority than a [[Local Area Emergency]] (LAE), but it's less specific than a [[Civil Danger Warning]] (CDW). For example, the warning could be used to describe an alert issued by the [[National Terrorism Advisory System]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4674">The '''Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents''' is a [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (ECE) convention signed in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], on 17 March 1992, that entered into force on 19 April 2000. The Convention is designed to protect people and the environment against industrial accidents. The Convention aims to prevent accidents from occurring, or reducing their frequency and severity and mitigating their effects if required. The Convention promotes active international cooperation between countries, before, during and after an industrial accident.

The Convention helps its Parties – that is, States or certain regional organizations that have agreed to be bound by the Convention – to prevent industrial accidents that can have transboundary effects and to prepare for, and respond to, accidents if they occur.{{how|date=April 2016}} The Convention also encourages its Parties to help each other in the event of an accident, to cooperate on research and development, and to share information and technology.

The Conference of the Parties was constituted as the Convention's governing body at its first meeting in Brussels on 22-24 November 2000. 

As of August 2013, the Convention has 41 parties, including the European Union, [[Russia]], and most other countries in all parts of Europe, as well as [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. The treaty has been signed but not ratified by [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].

At its third meeting, in 2004, the Conference of the Parties adopted an Assistance Programme to support the countries from Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia and South Eastern Europe in implementing the Convention.  

The '''Protocol on Civil Liability for Damage and Compensation for Damage Caused by Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents on Transboundary Waters''', was adopted in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] on 21 May 2003. The Protocol is a joint instrument to the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents and to the [[Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes]]. The Protocol was signed by 24 European states but as of 2013, the Protocol has been ratified only by [[Hungary]] and is not in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/teia/welcome.html Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accident (Helsinki, 1992)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968–69'''''&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968–69'' ([[Statutes of Canada|SC]] 1968–69, c 38.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[omnibus bill]] that introduced major changes to the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. An earlier version was first introduced as '''Bill C-195''' by then [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] in the second session of the [[27th Canadian Parliament]] on December 21, 1967.&lt;ref name="parl.canadiana.ca.2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.HOC_2702_114_01/574?r=0&amp;s=1|title=House of Commons Journals, 27th Parliament, 2nd... - Image 574 - Canadian Parliamentary Historical Resources|last=Canadiana|website=parl.canadiana.ca|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Bill C-195''' was modified and re-introduced as '''Bill C-150''' by then [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] [[John Turner]] in the first session of the [[28th Canadian Parliament]] on December 19, 1968.&lt;ref name="parl.canadiana.ca.3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.HOC_2801_115_01/524?r=0&amp;s=1|title=House of Commons Journals, 28th Parliament, 1st... - Image 524 - Canadian Parliamentary Historical Resources|last=Canadiana|website=parl.canadiana.ca|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parl.canadiana.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC2801_08/673?r=0&amp;s=1|title=House of Commons Debates, 28th Parliament, 1st ... - Image 673 - Canadian Parliamentary Historical Resources|last=Canadiana|website=parl.canadiana.ca|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 14, 1969, after heated debates, Bill C-150 passed third reading in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] by a vote of 149 (119 [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], 18 [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrats]], 12 [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]]) to 55 (43 [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], 11 ''[[Ralliement créditiste|Créditistes]]'', 1 [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]). The bill was a massive 126-page, 120-clause amendment to the criminal law and criminal procedure of Canada.

The bill decriminalised [[homosexuality]] and allowed [[abortion]] under certain conditions.  A related bill, introduced and passed at the same time, decriminalised the sale of [[contraceptive]]s. The Act also regulated [[lotteries]], tightened the rules for [[gun possession]] and introduced new offences relating to [[drinking and driving]], [[harassing]] phone calls, [[misleading advertising]] and [[cruelty to animals]].

[[John Turner]], Trudeau's successor as Minister of Justice, described the bill as "the most important and all-embracing reform of the criminal and penal law ever attempted at one time in this country."&lt;ref name="parl.canadiana.ca"/&gt; Trudeau famously defended the bill by telling reporters that "there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation", adding that "what's done in private between adults doesn't concern the Criminal Code".&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite video | title = Trudeau's Omnibus Bill: Challenging Canadian Taboos  | url = http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/topics/538/ | medium = TV clip | publisher = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] | location = Canada |date = 1967-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968–69'' is known in [[French language|French]] under the title ''Loi de 1968–69 modifiant le droit pénal''.

:&lt;small&gt;a. John Mercer Reid was elected as a member of the [[Liberal-Labour (Canada)|Liberal-Labour Party]], but caucused with the Liberal Party of Canada until the [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972 general election]], when he rejoined the main political party.&lt;/small&gt;

== Abortion and contraception ==
===Abortion===
Bill C-150 legalized [[therapeutic abortion]] under certain conditions. Abortion was previously a criminal offence in Canada, which was still largely influenced by the [[Catholic Church]]'s moral positions on this issue. Bill C-150 made it legal for women to get an abortion if a [[therapeutic abortion committee]] of three doctors felt the pregnancy endangered the mental, emotional or physical well-being of the mother.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; In a 1999 speech celebrating the 30th anniversary of the bill's passage, [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] [[Lucie Pépin]] argued that the new freedom provided by Bill C-150 "proved to be a stepping stone for many other freedoms and options that have altered women's place in [Canadian] society — self-esteem, education, jobs, a voice and empowerment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pépin | first = Lucie | authorlink = Lucie Pépin | title = Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968 - Thirtieth Anniversary of Proclamation | work = Canadian Senate Speeches | publisher = [[Senate of Canada]] | date = 1999-11-16 | url = http://www.sen.parl.gc.ca/lpepin/index.asp?PgId=980 | accessdate = 2008-04-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110610054935/http://www.sen.parl.gc.ca/lpepin/index.asp?PgId=980 | archivedate = 2011-06-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abortion legislation in Canada]] was further liberalized in 1988 with the ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'' ruling, which left Canada without any laws regulating abortion through all nine months of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=CBCtime&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2009/01/13/f-abortion-timeline.html Abortion rights: significant moments in Canadian history], CBC news (accessed 2011-08-29)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contraceptives===
Prior to 1968, the Criminal Code made it an offence to offer to sell, advertise, or have in one's possession for the purpose of sale any "medicine, drug, or article intended or represented as a method of preventing conception or causing abortion or miscarriage."&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code, SC 1953-54, c 51, s 15(2)(c).&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the package of reforms contained in the ''Criminal Law Amendment Act,'' the government also introduced Bill S-15, which decriminalised contraceptives and brought them under the regulatory power of the ''[[Food and Drugs Act]]'', which governs medicines and medicinal devices.  Bill S-15 repealed the reference to contraceptives in the Criminal Code, but left [[abortifacient]]s criminalised.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to amend the Food and Drugs Act and the Narcotic Control Act and to make a consequential amendment to the Criminal Code, SC 1968-69, c 41, ss 1-3, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill S-15 received royal assent on June 27, 1969, the same day as the ''Criminal Law Amendment Act''.

== Homosexuality ==
Bill C-150, decriminalized homosexual acts between men over the age of consent of 21. The [[British Parliament]]'s adoption of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], influenced Trudeau's decision to include amendments to the Criminal Code concerning homosexuality in Bill C-150.&lt;ref name="parl.canadiana.ca"/&gt; Opposition to homosexuality was so intense that the Catholic ''[[Créditistes]]'' of [[Quebec]] held up debate for three weeks.&lt;ref name="parl.canadiana.ca"/&gt; The ''Créditistes'' suggested that [[communism]], [[socialism]] and [[atheism]] were behind the proposed changes relating to homosexuality and abortion; they demanded that a public [[referendum]] be held on these issues and staged a [[filibuster]] of Parliament over the amendments concerning abortion.&lt;ref name="parl.canadiana.ca"/&gt;

== Gambling ==
Prior to Bill C-150, Criminal Code exemptions that permitted small scale gambling on behalf of [[charities]] were introduced. Between 1892 and 1969, Canadians could wager on [[horse races]] or gamble at summer fair midways. These charitable experiences with gambling eventually led Bill C-150 to give the [[Canadian federalism|provincial and federal governments]] the opportunity to use [[lotteries]] to fund worthwhile activities (e.g. [[1976 Montreal Olympics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Rhys | last = Stevens | title = Legalized Gambling in Canada | version = (updated on 2005-02-15) | publisher = Alberta Gaming Research Institute | date = 2002-02-08 | url = http://www.abgaminginstitute.ualberta.ca/pdfs/Gambling_in_Canada.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2008-04-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081002193316/http://www.abgaminginstitute.ualberta.ca/pdfs/Gambling_in_Canada.pdf | archivedate = 2008-10-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gun control ==
[[Gun politics in Canada]] were also affected by Bill C-150, which for the first time made it illegal to provide [[firearms]] to persons of "unsound mind" or criminals under [[prohibition]] orders. The law also expanded the definition of a "firearm", which, prior to 1969, included only [[handguns]] and automatic firearms, and introduced non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited firearm categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dauvergne | first = Mia | title = Homicide in Canada, 2001 | journal = Juristat | volume = 22 | issue = 7 |page=10 | publisher = [[Statistics Canada]] | date = 2002-09-25 | url = http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/85-002-XIE/0070285-002-XIE.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | issn = 1209-6393 | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drunk Driving==
Bill C-150 also addressed the issue of [[drunk driving]]. The bill made it an offence to drive with a [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC) in excess of 80&amp;nbsp;mg/100 ml of blood. Refusal of a police officer's demand to provide a breath sample was made an offence at the same time and both began as summary conviction offences, with a mandatory minimum $50 [[Fine (penalty)|fine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights | title = Toward Eliminating Impaired Driving — Chapter 2: Legislative Background | publisher = [[Parliament of Canada]] | date = May 1999 | url = http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/Content/HOC/committee/361/juri/reports/rp1031597/jurirp21/09-ch2-e.htm#0.2.5FPCNZ.3YC5UE.7ZN1CF.D3 | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5790">The '''December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack''' took place on 23 December 2015 and is considered to be the first known successful [[cyberattack]] on a [[power grid]]. Hackers were able to successfully compromise information systems of three energy distribution companies in [[Ukraine]] and temporarily disrupt electricity supply to the end consumers.

Most affected were consumers of «Prykarpattyaoblenergo» ({{lang-uk|Прикарпаттяобленерго}}; servicing [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]]): 30 substations were switched off, and about 230 thousand people were left without electricity for a period from 1 to 6 hours.&lt;ref name="ty"&gt;{{cite web

 | date = 2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time consumers of two other energy distribution companies, «Chernivtsioblenergo» ({{lang-uk|Чернівціобленерго}}; servicing [[Chernivtsi Oblast]]) and «Kyivoblenergo» ({{lang-uk|Київобленерго}}; servicing [[Kyiv Oblast]]) were also affected by a cyberattack, but at a smaller scale. According to representatives of one of the companies, attacks were conducted from computers with IP addresses allocated to the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name="mpe.12"&gt;{{cite web

==Description==
The cyberattack was complex and consisted of the following steps:&lt;ref name="mpe.12"/&gt;
* prior compromise of corporate networks using [[spear-phishing]] emails with BlackEnergy malware;
* seizing [[SCADA]] under control, remotely switching substations off;
* disabling/destroying [[IT infrastructure]] components ([[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]], [[modem]]s, RTUs, commutators);
* destruction of files stored on servers and workstations with the KillDisk malware;
* denial-of-service attack on call-center to deny consumers up-to-date information on the blackout.

In total, up to 73&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity was not supplied (or 0.015% of daily electricity consumption in the Ukraine).&lt;ref name="mpe.12"/&gt;

Cyber attacks on the energy distribution companies took place during an ongoing [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian-Ukrainian war]] and is attributed to a Russian [[advanced persistent threat]] group known as "Sandworm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Background ==
=== Apprehension of Francisco Granados ===
Granados was an assiduous consumer of [[cocaine]], had a long criminal record in the [[United States]], consisting mainly of low-impact crimes such as illegal entry and residence in the country and consumption and possession of illicit substances; there are records that indicate that Francisco's first arrest was made in 1995, when he was 16 years old, on charges of illegal stay in the country and resisting arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.banderasnews.com/0608/nw-usrevolvingdoor.htm|title="Suspect in Mexican Killings Underscores Revolving Door at US-Mexico Border"|author=Jay Root-McClatchy|publisher=News from Around the Americas (Flags NEWS)|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he was detained by the police in [[El Paso, Texas]], the [[Texas Ranger Division]], under the charge of illegal stay in the country.&lt;ref name=feminicide&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n911981.htm|title=Satanist confesses to ten feminicides|publisher=Chihuahua News|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=24 February 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Confessions ===
While in the custody of the Texas police in 2006, Granados confessed to having participated in at least 10 murders of women, perpetrated between 1993 and 2003.&lt;ref name=feminicide/&gt; In his statements he indicated that he was not fully aware of what he did, as he committed his crimes while drugged:
{{cquote|quote="...I told some cousins, a cousin bought me a pizza and asked me what I had, I told him it was because of the deaths in Juárez, that I felt used and that I was threatened as a minor and drugged with [[benzos]] twice. I told him that I had killed two women, he looked at me and said 'It's not true, do not tell me anything...'|source=Francisco Granados during a press conference in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/0040b737a39dc5ab49b345a8c128312e|title="I was not aware of what we did"|publisher=Police (Millenium)|date=4 November 2008|accessdate=24 February 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He identified Edgar Ernesto Álvarez Cruz as the alleged mastermind of between 10 and 17 murders. He also mentioned of the participation of a third man,  '''Alejandro Delgado Valles''', known as ''El Calas'', who was later exonerated. He indicated that Álvarez used to provide him drugs during the crimes, so he did not remember the exact events.
== Crimes ==
According to statements by Francisco Granados, the women were kidnapped or taken with deception to unpopulated areas of the outskirts of the city inside Álvarez's car, an eighties-model [[Renault]], where they were tied and raped, then mutilated and murdered in the midst of [[satanism|satanistic]] rituals chaired by Álvarez, who used to dissect the hearts of his victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citebook|url=http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=2bUAIrwHJjkC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=edgar+%C3%A1lvarez+cruz+y+francisco+granados+de+la+paz&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bm8pUe-6IKKe2wX66YCQCg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title="13.

In later investigations, a corpse was exhumed on the premises of Álvarez's home.&lt;ref name=murder&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.elagora.com.mx/Delata-feminicida-mas-crimenes,8654.html|title=Delata femicide plus crimenes|publisher=elagóra.com.mx|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=24 February 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Possible victims ===
In his confession Granados identified 6 murdered women, and mentioned a sixth and seventh victim whom he partially identified only under their supposed names:&lt;ref name=feminicide/&gt;
* Mayra Juliana Reyes Solís
* Esmeralda Herrera Monrreal
* Laura Berenice Ramos Mónarrez
* Claudia Ivette González
* Verónica Martínez Hernández
* Guadalupe Luna de la Rosa
* Rosario ("Chayito"): she supposedly died when she was intentionally ran over by Álvarez with his car.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;
== Court proceedings ==
=== Intervention of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ===
The intervention of the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] was based on requests from victims' relatives, who filed a complain against the Mexican State, motivated by the lack of response from the same.

In 2005 the Inter-American Court approved and admitted the case, and in January 2007 it accumulated the files of González, Monrreal and Mónarrez, whose bodies were found in Juárez's cotton fields.

On November 16, 2009, the court issued a judgment against the Mexican State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campoalgodonero.org.mx/sites/default/files/descargables-estatico/Sentencia_Campo_Algodonero.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the sentence that was issued the following recommendations were highlighted:
 1. Conduct the criminal process properly
 2. Publicly acknowledge their international responsibility
 3. Unveil a monument in memory of the victims

'''Fenway Sports Management (FSM)''' is a company headquartered in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] established by [[Fenway Sports Group]] (FSG) in 2004.  It styles itself as a "new kind of [[sports marketing]] agency," created by FSG to expand its footprint beyond its most famous holdings, the [[Boston Red Sox]] of [[Major League Baseball]] and [[Fenway Park]]. Fenway Sports Management specializes in sponsorship sales and brand management consulting, and serves as the global sports sponsorship sales arm of Fenway Sports Group.

During its first year, FSM entered into an exclusive sponsorship sales agreement with [[MLB Advanced Media]] and [[Boston College Eagles|Boston College's major intercollegiate sports]].&lt;ref name="Sponsorship of Boston College Athletics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bceagles.com/sponsorship.html |title=Sponsorships at Boston College |publisher=BCEagles.com |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210013812/http://www.bceagles.com/sponsorship.html |archivedate=2014-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, FSM has continued to create sponsorship programs for some of the world’s most prestigious brands and as of 2014 counts the Red Sox, [[Liverpool Football Club|Liverpool F.C.]], [[LeBron James]], [[Johnny Manziel]], Boston College, [[Roush Fenway Racing]], MLB.com, the PGA Tour's [[Deutsche Bank Championship]], [[New England Sports Network|NESN]], and [[Salem Red Sox|the Salem Red Sox]] among its client base. FSM’s consulting clients include [[Dunkin’ Donuts]], [[Gulf Oil]], [[JetBlue]], &amp; [[Grupo Santander|Santander]].

In addition, FSM purchased the [[Salem Avalanche]], a [[minor league baseball]] franchise in the High Class A [[Carolina League]], in December 2007. On September 19, 2008, FSM announced that the Salem franchise, eventually renamed the Salem Red Sox, would replace the [[Lancaster JetHawks]] as Boston's High A affiliate in 2009.

In October 2009, [[Sam Kennedy (baseball executive)|Sam Kennedy]] was promoted to succeed [[Mike Dee]] (who became [[chief executive officer]] of the [[Miami Dolphins]] in May 2009) as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Red Sox, and president of Fenway Sports Management.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, FSG announced a new partnership with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] of the [[Premier League|English Premiership]], with shirt sponsorship to start in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2ae48cb8-bc46-11de-9426-00144feab49a.html?nclick_check=1 |title=/ UK - Fulham strikes marketing deal with Boston Red Sox group |publisher=Ft.com |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, FSM became the sole marketer of the global rights of [[NBA]] superstar [[LeBron James]], in a management partnership deal with James and his manager Maverick Carter. As part of the deal, James and Carter both became minority stake holders in FSG's [[Liverpool F.C.]].&lt;ref name=WSJLeBrondeal&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703280904576246640754493456 |title=LeBron James in Deal With Fenway Sports |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, FSM negotiated a sponsorship agreement between Liverpool F.C. and [[Warrior Sports]] worth £25 million per season as of the 2012/13 season, overtaking the English club record of £23.3 million paid by Nike for supplying Manchester United Football Club and the previous deal from Adidas worth £13 million.

In January 2014, FSM became the marketer of the global rights of 2012 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and [[Cleveland Browns]] quarterback [[Johnny Manziel]], in a management partnership deal with LRMR Management.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobeManzielFSMdeal&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/01/15/fenway-sports-management-represent-johnny-football/0FFGu2Fof4mKzl7EN849XK/story.html |title=Fenway Sports Management to represent "Johnny Football" |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, FSM became an investor in the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] of the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[International League]], when a new ownership group led by then-Red Sox president/CEO [[Larry Lucchino]] (and including two limited partners in Fenway Sports Group) acquired the PawSox from the heirs of late owner [[Ben Mondor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20150223&amp;content_id=110149688&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_t533&amp;sid=t533 Pawtucket Red Sox official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2015, Lucchino announced his pending retirement as president/CEO of the Boston Red Sox, with Sam Kennedy promoted to president of the baseball club. Kennedy was signed to a new five-year contract as president and CEO of both the Red Sox and Fenway Sports Management on August 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chronis|first=Evan|title=Sam Kennedy elevated to CEO of Red Sox|date=August 3, 2017|publisher=Boston Red Sox official web site|work=|url=http://m.redsox.mlb.com/news/article/245980866/sam-kennedy-elevated-to-ceo-of-red-sox/|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Not to be confused with [[Feronia (mythology)|Feroniae]] in November.''

'''Ferālia''' {{IPAc-en|f|ᵻ|ˈ|r|eɪ|l|i|ə}} was an ancient Roman public festival&lt;ref name=Dumezil&gt;[[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil, Georges]]. ''Archaic Roman Religion''. pg 366.&lt;/ref&gt;  celebrating the [[Manes]] (Roman spirits of the dead, particularly the souls of deceased individuals)&lt;ref&gt;''Brill's New Pauly''. "Di Manes."&lt;/ref&gt; which fell on 21 February as recorded by [[Ovid]] in Book II of his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]''.&lt;ref name=Dumezil/&gt; This day marked the end of [[Parentalia]], a nine-day festival (13–21 February) honoring the dead ancestors.&lt;ref name=cult&gt;''Brill's New Pauly''. "Dead, cult of the."&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman citizens were instructed to bring offerings to the tombs of their dead ancestors which consisted of at least "an arrangement of wreaths, a sprinkling of grain and a bit of salt, bread soaked in wine and violets scattered about."&lt;ref name=OvidII&gt;[[Ovid]]. ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Book II.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional offerings were permitted, however the dead were appeased with just the aforementioned.&lt;ref name=OvidII/&gt; These simple offerings to the dead were perhaps introduced into the [[Latium]] by [[Aeneas]], who poured wine and scattered violet flowers on [[Anchises]]' tomb.&lt;ref name=L922&gt;Littlewood. ''Latomus'', pg. 922&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid tells of a time when [[Roman citizenship|Romans]], in the midst of war, neglected Feralia, which prompted the spirits of the departed to rise from their graves in anger, howling and roaming the streets.&lt;ref name=OvidII/&gt; After this event, tribute to the tombs were then made and the ghastly hauntings ceased. To indicate public mourning, marriages of any kind were prohibited on the Feralia, and Ovid urged mothers, brides, and widows to refrain from lighting their wedding torches. Magistrates stopped wearing their insignia&lt;ref name=Dumezil/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parentalia&gt;''Brill's New Pauly''. "Parentalia."&lt;/ref&gt; and any worship of the gods was prohibited as it "should be hidden behind closed temple doors; no incense on the altar, no fire on the hearth."&lt;ref name=OvidII/&gt;

==Rites and tradition==
As concerns public rites nothing of them survives,&lt;ref name=Dumezil367&gt;Dumézil. ''Archaic Roman Religion.'' pg. 367&lt;/ref&gt; however on this day as described by Ovid, an old drunken woman (''anus ebria'')&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne. ''Experiencing Old Age in Ancient Rome.''  pg. 145 (from google books. see References).&lt;/ref&gt; sits in a circle with other girls performing rites in the name of the mute [[goddess]] [[Dea Tacita|Tacita]]&lt;ref name=OvidII/&gt; who is identified with the nymph Lara or [[Larunda]].&lt;ref&gt;''Brill's New Pauly.'' "Tacita."&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual consists of the old woman placing three bits of incense, with three of her fingers, beneath  a threshold where a mouse is unknowingly buried. She then rolls seven black beans in her mouth, and smears the head of a fish with pitch, impaling it with a bronze needle, and roasting it in a fire. After she formally declaims the purpose of her actions, as customary in Greco-Roman magic ritual,&lt;ref name=L922/&gt; saying, "I have gagged spiteful tongues and muzzled unfriendly mouths" (''Hostiles linguas inimicaque uinximus ora''),&lt;ref name=L922/&gt; she departs intoxicated.&lt;ref name=OvidII/&gt; The use of the black beans in the old woman's ritual may be related to rites that lend themselves to another festival of the dead in the month of May, called [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref name=Dumezil367/&gt;&lt;ref name=OvidV&gt;Ovid. ''Fasti'', Book V.&lt;/ref&gt; During Lemuria the dead ancestor spirits, particularly the unburied, called [[lemures]], emerge from their graves and visit the homes in which they had lived. It was then necessary to confront the unwelcome spirits and lure them out of one's house using specific actions and chants.&lt;ref name=Dumezil367/&gt; According to [[Ovid]], this includes the involvement of black beans to lure a spirit out of the home. "And after washing his (the householder)  hands clean in spring water, he turns, and first he receives black beans and throws them away with face averted; but while he throws them, he says: 'These I cast; with these beans I redeem me and mine.' This he says nine times, without looking back: the shade is thought to gather the beans, and to follow unseen behind. Again he touches water, and clashes Temesan bronze, and asks the shade to go out of his house. When he has said nine times, 'Ghosts of my fathers, go forth!' he looks back, and thinks that he has duly performed the sacred rites."&lt;ref name=OvidV/&gt; Perhaps the black beans carried with them connotations of warding away or dispelling bad things in general, whether it be unwelcome spirits haunting a household as seen during Lemuria, or preventing undesired gossip towards an individual as in the old hag's [[ritual]] during Feralia. Also, in the context of sacrifices, the black beans are similar to the black animals used in sacrifice to the 'chthonic deities'.&lt;ref name=cult/&gt;

It is implied through Ovid's choice of words, ''"hostiles linguas"'' and ''"inimicaque ora"'', that the ritual is intended to curb gossip about a girl's reputation.&lt;ref name=L922/&gt; Gossip of such a nature and its consequences are the subject for the cause, which Ovid offers, of the Dea Tacita festival, which was held on the same day as the Feralia.&lt;ref name=L922/&gt; Ovid then tells a story to explain the origins of Dea Tacitia, starting with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'s untamed lust for the [[nymph]] [[Juturna]]. Juturna, aware of Jupiter's lust for her, hid within the Hazelwood forest and dove into her sisters' waters. Jupiter then gathered all the nymphs in [[Latium]] seeking their help in capturing Juturna, saying, "Your sister is spiting herself by shunning her own advantage, an entanglement with the highest god. Look out for us both. What will be a great pleasure for me will be in your sister's great interest. Block her as she flees at the bank of the river to keep her from jumping into its waters."&lt;ref name=OvidII/&gt; One of the informed nymphs, [[Larunda|Lara]], could not hold her tongue and warned Juturna to flee. In addition, she approached Jupiter's wife [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], saying, "Your husband loves the [[Naiad]] Juturna."&lt;ref name=OvidII/&gt; As a result, Jupiter rips out Lara's tongue in anger and summons [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] to escort her to be a nymph in the [[Underworld]]. During this mission, Mercury becomes lustful of Lara and rapes her, begetting twins. These twins become the [[Lares]], the guardians of intersections who watch over the city of [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=OvidII/&gt;

'''Frederick William Hahneman''' (July 5, 1922 – December 17, 1991) was a Honduras-born US citizen convicted of hijacking [[Eastern Airlines]] Flight 175 from [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] to [[Miami, Florida]], on May 5, 1972.

Hahneman parachuted from the plane over his native [[Honduras]] after extorting $303,000 from Eastern Airlines. Evading a manhunt by the [[FBI]] and Honduran police and with a $25,000 bounty on his head, Hahneman went on the run for 28 days before finally surrendering to the US [[Embassy]] in [[Tegucigalpa]]. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for [[aircraft hijacking]], [[kidnapping]] and [[extortion]], serving 12 years.

Speculation still surrounds Hahneman's motives for the crime.

==Background==
Hahneman was born in [[Puerto Castilla, Honduras]], to a Honduran mother, Delia Pastore Ordóñez, and an American father, the late William Frederick Hahneman, of San Francisco. It is not known when he was naturalized{{fact|date=March 2016}} but he had lived in Easton, Pennsylvania, since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;The Dispatch, Lexington, N.C. 2 June 1972. Kurt Lassen, p12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an engineer and married to Mary Jane Hahneman. They had two sons.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbours of the couple told investigators later that Hahneman was a "mystery" to them and that Mary, going blind, raised the children alone.&lt;ref&gt;The Dispatch, Lexington, N.C. 2 June 1972. Kurt Lassen, p12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
The period 1967–1972 saw a spate of aircraft hijackings in the United States and worldwide. There had been 26 attempted hijackings in 1971 alone, 11 of them successful. So common were they that the May 8 ''[[Evening Chronicle]]'' editorial of 1972 stated, "They often command little more than one-column, six-paragraph stories on page 8 of most daily newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hijackings were a mixture of [[terrorism]] and crime for profit. The most infamous of these hijackings is arguably that of [[D. B. Cooper]], which occurred just six months prior to Hahneman boarding Flight 175.

==The hijacking==
On May 2, 1972 Hahneman checked into the Americus hotel in Allentown as a well dressed businessman under the assumed name George Ames. Staff remembered him as "polite" but got the impression that Ames had "put up a wall around himself". After asking directions to a travel agent, staff later reported Ames saying he was "going to take a plane" later that morning.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ABE terminal (2).JPG|thumb|right|Main terminal at [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]], then known as A-B-E International.]]

On the morning of May 5 at [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]] (known at the time as '''A'''llentown–'''B'''ethlehem–'''E'''aston International Airport), Hahneman managed to board Eastern Airlines Flight 175, a [[Boeing 727]] jet, armed with a handgun. Shortly after take-off, Hahneman threatened the crew and informed the pilot, Captain W.L. Hendershott, that he was taking over the plane and wanted $303,000 from the airline.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the captain informed the 48 passengers that "there is an armed man aboard", Hahneman held the chief stewardess hostage at the rear of the plane. One of the passengers, ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Neil Amdur, wrote later, "From the moment the captain uttered those chilling words...I felt a sense of fear I had never known."&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The captain would later tell FBI investigators that Hahneman "talked like there was another country and he wanted the money for a cause."&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2002), 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other passengers, Frank Valek, a safety inspector for Western Electric, and Robert Palazzo, the mayor of Columbia, N.J., both found Hahneman's gun pressed into their stomachs as they went to the rest room and magazine rack, respectively. Other passengers prayed.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flight 175 was scheduled to land at [[Washington DC|Washington]]'s [[National Airport]] but Hahneman ordered the captain to land at [[Dulles International Airport]]. He did so at 11:15am. No passengers were allowed to leave the plane while Eastern Airlines worked to meet Hahneman's demands.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; These were $303,000 in cash, six parachutes, two bush knives, two jump suits, two crash helmets,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2002), 129&lt;/ref&gt; fuel, food&lt;ref&gt;The Dispatch, Lexington, N.C. 2 June 1972. Kurt Lassen, p12.&lt;/ref&gt; and two cartons of his favourite [[Benson and hedges|Benson and Hedges]]&lt;ref&gt;Wikileaks cable 1973STATE088847_b&lt;/ref&gt; cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2002), 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Satisfied that his demands had been met, at 1:13pm Hahneman allowed the passengers to disembark one by one, including one stewardess. The rest of the 6&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2002), 129&lt;/ref&gt; crew he kept hostage and ordered the captain to take off again at 1:50pm. Soon after becoming airborne Hahneman decided he didn't like the $100 bill denominations given to him by Eastern. He ordered the plane to return to Dulles and demanded the money in larger bills. It took Eastern four hours to comply with this difficult demand, with some of the bills being flown in from Miami.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rwr727tail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing 727]] with the aft airstair open, Hahneman's means of escape.]]

Satisfied once again, Hahneman ordered the captain to take off and fly to the [[Central American]] republic of Honduras, his country of birth. However, en route the plane's hydraulic pump developed a problem and the captain told Hahneman they had to divert to New Orleans. Hahneman was angry and when they landed in New Orleans he demanded another plane from Eastern. When it was ready he put a noose around Captain Hendershott's neck and forced the crew out at gunpoint,&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; using them as a human shield&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2002), 129&lt;/ref&gt; to get safely onto the new plane.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of Flight 175 passed without incident and on May 6, around 4am, over the pitch dark Honduran jungle, Hahneman ordered the captain to slow the plane's airspeed. He put on one of the parachutes he'd demanded and opened the rear door. Clutching his money-filled attache case, Frederick Hahneman jumped from the aft airstair into the dense undergrowth below, and disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manhunt==
In the US the story faded from the news but in Honduras, Hahneman was on the run from the FBI and the Honduran police. He moved around between friends and family, trying to stay one step ahead.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Airlines put up a $25,000 reward for his capture leading to a tip off that Hahneman was still in Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2002), 129&lt;/ref&gt; With his picture now everywhere in Honduras and exposure close, Hahneman sought refuge with his old friend and fellow engineer, José Gómez Rovelo.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, Acting [[FBI Director]] [[L. Patrick Gray III]] obtained a warrant in the [[US District Court]] of Alexandria, Va., for Hahneman's arrest. The FBI had put together biographical information Hahneman had let slip to the crew during their 20-hour ordeal, with a photograph they possessed, to identify Hahneman as their prime suspect. They said Hahneman's movements in rural Honduras had been tracked by the Honduran police.&lt;ref&gt;The Dispatch, Lexington, N.C. 2 June 1972. Kurt Lassen, p12.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the net closing, Rovelo convinced Hahneman that he was too old to be on the run. Hahneman agreed. At 1am on June 2, Hahneman and Rovelo walked into the US embassy in Tegucigalpa and Hahneman surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Hahneman was in custody but the money was not. He told authorities that he had deposited the ransom in "the Chinese Communist Bank in Hong Kong", via a mysterious Panamanian "contact".&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2002), 129&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 1972, Hahneman waived his right to a jury trial&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and plead guilty to a charge of air piracy, kidnapping and extortion.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2002), 129&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to life imprisonment on September 29, 1972 in the US District Court in Alexandria, Va,&lt;ref&gt;Wikileaks cable 1973STATE088847_b&lt;/ref&gt; and sent to the federal prison in Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he left the federal building for prison, Hahneman was asked by a reporter what he'd done with the money. "None of your bloody business," he replied.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 1973 the FBI announced they had recovered the $303,000 ransom. In the press release they said, "Upon recovery of the money a check was made of the [[National Crime Information Center]], FBI Headquarters, Washington D.C., which determined the serial numbers tallied with the ransom money paid in connection with the hijacking."&lt;ref&gt;Wikileaks cable 1973STATE088847_b&lt;/ref&gt; They provided no further details of how or where they recovered the money.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bureau of Prisons]] records show Frederick Hahneman was paroled on March 13, 1984. On August 17, 1984 he was discharged. The Bureau has no further records of him.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculation about motives==
Hahneman's arrest reignited interest in the case and his quiet Easton neighbourhood was alive with agents and reporters asking questions. His blind wife and his sons' lives were spread across the local press. Fed by the FBI's reluctance to reveal details of how and where they recovered the money, along with Hahneman's political claims while in custody and the statement from the captain, there was much speculation about Hahneman's frequent foreign trips,&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; rumours that he'd deposited the $303,000 in a communist bank,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books; 1st edition (April 1, 2002), 129&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that Hahneman and his cousin Roberto Martínez Ordóñez, a delegate with the Honduran mission to the [[United Nations]], were plotting a [[revolution]] in Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Hahneman maintained that she had no contact with her husband and didn't even know he'd been released. Asked after his 1984 discharge, she said, "I still don't know why he did it. If you ever find out, will you please tell me?"&lt;ref&gt;The Morning Call. Frank Whelan. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 30 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Audience response at GAIA Chamber Music Festival.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Audience response at GAIA]]

The '''GAIA Music Festival''' founded by the violinist [[Gwendolyn Masin]] is described as one of the most important festivals in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaia-festival.com/downloads/05_GAIA_ENSUITE_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is hosted in [[Oberhofen am Thunersee|Oberhofen]] on Lake Thun, usually in the month of May. The Festival is non-profit. The Festival's director since 2015 is Jacqueline Keller. From 2010 until 2014, the Patron of the Festival was [[David Zinman]].

==History==

The GAIA Chamber Music Festival was founded in 2006, and hosted near [[Stuttgart]], where it was rewarded by two consecutive years of highly praised programmes and sold-out halls. The Festival was honoured with the Göppinger Kulturpreis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swp.de/goeppingen/lokales/goeppingen/Preis-fuer-herausragende-Kulturarbeit;art5583,262798 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125242/http://www.swp.de/goeppingen/lokales/goeppingen/Preis-fuer-herausragende-Kulturarbeit%3Bart5583%2C262798 |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for its outstanding impact on the cultural landscape. In 2009, the Festival made its debut in and around Thun. In 2014, the Festival was renamed to GAIA Music Festival. In 2015, the Festival made Oberhofen on the Lake of Thun its central location.

Compositions or transcriptions of works by [[Kurt Atterberg]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Ernest Bloch]] and Cesar Viana were premiered in 2011.

In 2012, transcriptions of works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] received premieres.

2013, the fifth birthday of GAIA in Thun, saw a celebration of new works and transcriptions played for the first time by composers such as [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Astor Piazzolla]], Andrei Pushkarev, [[Franz Schubert]], and by the group Yurodny.

In 2014, Bagatelle of [[Benjamin Britten]] for violin, viola and piano and works by [[Paul Juon]] received their Swiss premier.

2016 saw the first inclusion of premieres of works of literature, as well as music. [[Lukas Hartmann]] wrote texts to [[Telemann]]’s "Burlesque de Quixotte"; [[Stravinsky]]’s "Suite italienne" as well as [[Mussorgsky]]’s "Pictures at an Exhibition". The latter also received its Swiss premiere in a version for string quintet and piano.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/im-konzertsaal/gaia-musikfestival-musik-und-wort&lt;/ref&gt;
Further works to receive international premieres were by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Manuel de Falla]], in arrangements written by [[Raymond Deane]] for [[Gwendolyn Masin]]'s ORIGIN.

The festival programme of 2017 also included several world premieres.

For the background information, causes, effects and policy responses see [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]]. For a timeline see [[Subprime crisis impact timeline]]. 

{{see_also|Blue Monday Crash 2009}}
On the evening of January 18, the [[Denmark|Danish]] Parliament agreed to a financial package worth 100 billion [[Danish kroner]] (17.6 billion [[USD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denmark agrees on 13.4-bln-euro line of credit to banks: govt|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090118-denmark-agrees-134-bln-euro-line-credit-banks-govt-0|publisher=''[[France 24]]''|year=2009|accessdate=2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, markets panicked yet again. On January 22, the editorial board of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' wrote that the four largest U.S. banks "have lost half of their value since January 2."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0122/p08s01-comv.html "Obama's First Crisis: Dud Banks", ''The Christian Science Monitor'' (January 22, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-month period from January 1-February 27 represented the worst start to a year in the history of the [[S&amp;P 500]] with a drop in value of 18.62%. By March 2, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] Index had dropped more than 50% from its October 2007 peak.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/29428424/site/14081545 Dow Down 50% Since Peak, Major Indices Approach New Lows], 27 Feb 2009, CNBC.com&lt;/ref&gt; The decline has been compared to that of the 1929 Great Depression, which was 53% between September 1929 and March 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/business/worldbusiness/03markets.html Steep Market Drops Highlight Despair Over Rescue Efforts]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, the Bank of England announced up to 150 billion pounds of [[quantitative easing]], increasing the risk of inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialpost.com/careers/story.html?id=1356326 BoE cuts rate to 0.5%, embraces 'quantitative easing']. [[Financial Post]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Blackstone Group CEO [[Stephen Schwarzman]] said that up to 45% of global wealth had been destroyed by the global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE52966Z20090310 45 percent of world's wealth destroyed: Blackstone CEO]. Reuters. March 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 9, 2009, the Dow had fallen to 6440, a percentage decline exceeding the pace of the market's fall during the [[Great Depression]] and a level which the index had last seen in 1996. On March 10, 2009, a countertrend [[bear market rally]] began, taking the Dow up to 8500 by May 6, 2009. Financial stocks were up more than 150% during this rally. By May 9, financial stocks had rallied more than 150% in just over two months.

On June 22 the [[World Bank]] projected that the global production for 2009 would fall by 2.9%, the first decline since the second world war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/html/extdr/financialcrisis/ World Banks projection of June 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hairspray Live!''''' is a television special that aired [[Live television|live]] on [[NBC]] on December 7, 2016. Produced by [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], and hosted by [[Darren Criss]], it is a performance of a new adaptation of the 2002 Broadway musical ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]''.

==Premise==
''Hairspray Live!'' takes place in 1962 Baltimore. Teenager Tracy Turnblad’s dream is to dance on The Corny Collins Show, a local TV program. When, against all odds, Tracy wins a role on the show, she becomes a celebrity overnight and meets a colorful array of characters, including Link, the resident dreamboat; Amber, the ambitious mean girl; Seaweed, an African-American boy she meets in detention; and his mother, Motormouth Maybelle, owner of a local record store. Tracy’s mother is the indomitable Edna Turnblad, and she eventually encourages Tracy on her campaign to integrate the all-white Corny Collins Show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=Jennifer Hudson &amp; Harvey Fierstein To Topline NBC’s ‘Hairspray Live’|url=http://deadline.com/2016/04/jennifer-hudson-harvey-fierstein-nbc-hairspray-live-1201743160/|website=Deadline|accessdate=March 31, 2018|date=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Development===
''Hairspray Live!'' served as NBC's fourth entry in its series of made-for-TV musical telecasts, behind  ''[[The Wiz Live!]]'',  ''[[Peter Pan Live!]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]''. As with its predecessors, it was executive produced by [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]]. The project was revealed by NBC's entertainment head [[Bob Greenblatt]] during a [[Television Critics Association]] press tour in January 2016. In response to early reports that NBC was considering a live version of ''[[The Music Man]]'', ''[[West Side Story]]'' or ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella]]'', Greenblatt stated that "people have been saying to me since ''The Wiz'', 'Do this show, do that show.' I've heard obscure titles and famous titles. Not everything's going to be a big name to the whole audience. I don’t think there's an infinite number of these that can be done. But we're still doing it." He explained that the production would not try to emulate the [[Hairspray (2007 film)|2007 film]] (also produced by Zadan and Meron),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Craig Zadan and Neil Meron Signed to Produce New Line Cinema's Musical Film Version of Hairspray |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |date=2004-11-29 |url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,832538,00.html |accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that he would have been thrilled if [[John Travolta]] reprised his role in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abrams|first1=Natalie|title=Hairspray live musical coming to NBC in December|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 13, 2016|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/13/hairspray-nbc-live-musical|accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenny Leon]] returned in his role as director from ''The Wiz'', and was joined by Alex Rudzinski—who co-directed ''[[Grease: Live]]'' for Fox.&lt;ref name="vf-hslive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hairspray Live Is Figuring Out How to Perfect the Live Musical|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/hairspray-live-nbc-ariana-grande-jennifer-hudson-director-interview|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="playbill-newsongs"/&gt; The musical was adapted for television by [[Harvey Fierstein]] from the original book by [[Mark O'Donnell]] and [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]]. [[Jerry Mitchell]], the choreographer of the Broadway version of ''Hairspray'', was also involved with the adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/kenny-leon-jerry-mitchell-and-harvey-fierstein-will-bring-hairspray-to-life-for-nbc-broadcast-date-set-387509# "Kenny Leon, Jerry Mitchell and Harvey Fierstein Will Bring 'Hairspray' to Life for NBC; Broadcast Date Set "], Playbill, February 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to NBC's previous musicals, ''Hairspray Live!'' was produced from the [[Universal Studios]] [[Universal Studios Lot|backlot]]; Greenblatt explained that a "fair amount" of the show would be staged in outdoor settings, and thus "have a real exuberance in the open air." Additionally, live audiences were integrated into relevant scenes as extras on-stage, such as bystanders in Baltimore, and as the studio audience of ''The Corny Collins Show''.&lt;ref name="playbill-newsongs"&gt;Clement, Olivia. [http://www.playbill.com/article/exclusive-hairspray-live-to-feature-live-audience-and-new-songs# "Exclusive: 'Hairspray Live! 'to Feature Live Audience and New Songs"], Playbill, April 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Two numbers written for the 2007 film, "Ladies' Choice” and "Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)", were incorporated into the production. "The Big Dollhouse", from the Broadway show, was cut, while "The New Girl In Town", written for the stage show but cut and only used in the film, was not added.&lt;ref name=music&gt;Gioia, Michael. [http://www.playbill.com/article/musical-numbers-for-hairspray-live-revealed# "Musical Numbers for 'Hairspray Live!' Revealed"], Playbill, November 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; (An instrumental version of the song is, however, heard very briefly as a bit of background music.)

===Casting===
In addition to adapting the book, Fierstein reprised his performance of Edna Turnblad from the Broadway musical; Greenblatt felt that his performance of Edna was "iconic", and that his involvement with ''Hairspray Live!'' made it "come full circle".&lt;ref name="playbill-newsongs"/&gt; NBC cast the lead role of Tracy Turnblad through an open call in New York City, hoping to repeat the "phenomenal discovery" of Shanice Williams for ''The Wiz''. The role went to college sophomore Maddie Baillio, as her first professional role.&lt;ref name="ew-casted"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hairspray Live! casts newcomer Maddie Baillio as Tracy Turnblad|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/07/hairspray-live-nbc-maddie-baillio-tracy-turnblad|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, it was announced that [[Ricki Lake]] and [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] (who portrayed Tracy Turnblad in the [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 film]] and the Broadway version respectively) would make cameo appearances;&lt;ref name="playbill.com"&gt;Gioia, Michael.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote: "NBC lassoed some talented performers with fine singing voices but sacrificed cohesion by cramming the evening with too much interstitial fluff.... Only Jennifer Hudson, who played Motormouth Maybelle, found the real strength of this Tony-winning musical, delivering a knockout rendition of 'I Know Where I've Been'..." He noted that Baillio "did pretty well, though no novice is going to compete with voices like those of Ms. Hudson and Kristin Chenoweth..."&lt;ref&gt;Genzlinger, Neil. [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/arts/television/review-hairspray-live.html?rref=collection/sectioncollection/arts "Review: ‘Hairspray Live!’ Had Power Voices but Still Lacked Power"] ''The New York Times'', December 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer wrote that it "took a few musical numbers to settle into a rhythm. But once it did (the energy seemed to kick in with "Welcome to the ‘60s") the musical easily became the best NBC has attempted. It's hard to imagine better casting for the production. Jennifer Hudson stole the show... Ariana Grande, certifiable pop star, came away as the show's MVP, acting as both reliably overlook-able sidekick and, once the situation required it, showstopping diva. Harvey Fierstein was predictably great... Martin Short... found the right profile for himself as Wilbur."&lt;ref&gt;Saraiya, Sonia.

The TV Ratings Guide reviewer wrote that the production "was truly a great experience through and through." They praised the entire cast, stating "the casting was just top notch", and praised Grande and Hudson in particular. They named 'You Can't Stop the Beat' the best musical moment of the night and stated that "they really knocked it out of the park." They stated that "NBC really put together something amazing here." &lt;ref&gt;Bunch, Rebecca. [http://www.tvratingsguide.com/2016/12/hairspray-live-spoiler-free-review-nbcs.html "Hairspray Live! (Spoiler-Free) Review: NBC's Live Musical is A-mazing’"] ''The TV Ratings Guide'', December 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The A.V. Club]]'s reviewer wrote that "As a piece of social commentary, tonight’s production of Hairspray Live! was just about flawless." They stated that Dove Cameron and Ephraim Sykes were "consistently fun to watch", and that Chenoweth and Hudson "were the biggest scene-stealers." They said that Fierstein, Short, and Martin "were all wonderful as well." They rated the telecast a B+.&lt;ref&gt;Siede, Caroline.

"'''He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)'''" is a song written by [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]] for [[girl group]] [[the Crystals]] under the guidance of [[Phil Spector]] in 1962. Goffin and King wrote the song after discovering that their babysitter and singer [[Little Eva]] was being regularly [[domestic violence|beaten]] by her boyfriend.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt; When they inquired why she tolerated such treatment, Eva replied, with complete sincerity, that her boyfriend's actions were motivated by his love for her.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;

==Production==

[[Phil Spector]]'s arrangement was ominous and ambiguous.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;

{{quote|It was a brutal song, as any attempt to justify such  violence must be, and Spector’s arrangement only amplified its  savagery, framing Barbara Alston’s lone vocal amid a sea of  caustic strings and funereal drums, while the  backing vocals almost trilled their own belief that the boy had done nothing wrong. In more ironic hands (and a more understanding age), 'He Hit Me' might have passed at least as satire. But Spector showed no sign of appreciating that, nor did he feel any need to. No less than the song’s  writers, he was not preaching, he was merely documenting.|Dave Thompson&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t1072015|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Release==
Upon its initial release, "He Hit Me" received some airplay, but then there was a widespread protest of the song, with many concluding that the song was an endorsement of spousal abuse.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt; Soon, the song was played only rarely on the radio, as now.

The 1930 [[Frank Borzage]] film ''[[Liliom]]'' contains the line "He hit me and it felt like a kiss" in its final scene. The film was not a success and nothing suggests that Goffin or King had seen it.  ''[[Liliom (1934 film)|Liliom]]'', originally a play by Hungarian playwright [[Ferenc Molnár]], was the basis for the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical classic, ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''.  While King and Goffin may not have seen ''Liliom'', it is possible that they were familiar with the successful 1956 film version of ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'', which contains essentially the same line. However, King has stated that their friend who inspired the song had used that exact phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = For Carole King, Songwriting Is A 'Natural' Talent | url = https://www.npr.org/2012/04/11/150418594/for-carole-king-songwriting-is-a-natural-talent | accessdate = 2012-04-24 | series = Fresh Air | serieslink = Fresh Air | last = Gross | first = Terry (host) | network = NPR | station = WHYY | location = Boston, Massachusetts | date = 2011-04-11 | minutes = 36 | quote = But Gerry wrote that lyric after hearing an African-American woman that we knew… just come right out and say that. | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carole King, in that same radio interview, said that she was sorry she had ever had anything to do with the song.  She was a survivor of repeated domestic abuse (but not from Goffin, who had been her husband from 1959 to 1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005580/bio|title=Carole King (I) - Biography|accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In 1994, Hole released a cover of the song as a b-side to their single "Softer, Softest".  In 1995 the band covered the song live for MTV Unplugged.
*In 2005, the [[United Kingdom|British]] band [[Spiritualized]] recorded a song called [[Amazing Grace (Spiritualized album)|"She Kissed Me (It Felt Like a Hit)"]].
*The [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]] song "She's the One" quotes the song's title.
*The [[My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult]] song "Glamour Is a Rocky Road" quotes the song's title.
*The song was played in its entirety on the September 26, 2007, episode of [[The Tom Leykis Show]] titled 'The One They Won't Play'. The subject of the show's hour was in relation to [[Phil Spector]]'s writing and production of the song, and the fact that he got married in the period between being accused of the murders and the end of his trial.
*The ''[[Batman]]'' graphic novel ''[[The Batman Adventures: Mad Love|Mad Love]]'' alludes to this song. When [[Harley Quinn]] is asked how it felt to give everything to [[Joker (comics)|a man who abused her]], she said "it felt like a kiss".
*[[Amy Winehouse]] had frequently mentioned the song as one of her all-time favourite tracks and biggest influences.
*In 2008, [[Glasvegas]] released a Christmas EP titled "A Snowflake Fell and It Felt Like A Kiss," the title track being a homage to The Crystals.
*[[The Cardigans]] song "And Then You Kissed Me" rewrites and reinterprets "He Hit Me".
*The [[Antony and the Johnsons]] song "Fistful of Love" deals with nearly identical themes of love and abuse, yet in this version the genders of the song's characters are ambiguous.
*[[Amy Rigby]]'s song "Dancing With Joey Ramone" lists "He Hit Me (and It Felt Like a Kiss)" as one of the songs they danced to in her dream.
*''[[Mad Men]]'' used the song as the closing credit bump on the April 8, 2012, episode titled "[[Mystery Date (Mad Men)|Mystery Date]]."
*[[The Nation of Ulysses]] song "The Sound of Jazz to Come" reworks the song's title into "she hit me it felt like a kiss" after riffing on John Coltrane's "A Love Supreme."
*[[Lana Del Rey]] uses the line "Hit me and it felt like a kiss" in her 2014 song "[[Ultraviolence (song)|Ultraviolence]]" from the album of the same name. Prior to this, she used it in her unreleased song "Beautiful Player."
*[[Nicole Dollanganger]] released her own version of the song, which was included on her album "Ode to Dawn Weiner: Embarrassing Love Songs" under the same name. Her version turns the theme into that of a consensual [[BDSM]]-type relationship. The original plays in both the beginning and the end of her version.

'''Hi-Ex''' (short for the '''Highlands International Comics Expo''') was the name given to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[comics convention]] held from 2008–2012. It was held early in the year in [[Eden Court Theatre]], [[Inverness]]. The organisers were Richmond Clements (editor at [[FutureQuake|FutureQuake Publishing]]) and Vicky Stonebridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7194176.stm First superheroes expo for north], [[BBC]], 18 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scotsimpact&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7195730.stm Scots' impact on comics examined], [[BBC]], 22 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highland-news.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/3177/Comic_book_heroes_set_for_city_expo.html Comic book heroes set for city expo], ''Highland News'', 29 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/5032/Inverness_a_big_draw_for_comic_fans.html Inverness a big draw for comic fans], ''Inverness Courier'', 1 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention was the centre of a range of other events organised to promote comics in the region, including "outreach visits" to schools (involving [[Kev F. Sutherland]]), with the help of the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Highland Council]] and [[Scottish Arts Council]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/8362014.stm Comic event secures council help], [[BBC]], 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=northings&gt;[http://www.hi-arts.co.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-hianewnfj.RefLocID-hiacg5005.Lang-EN.htm Northings review]&lt;/ref&gt; and an exhibition of comic art in Eden Court's gallery.&lt;ref name=scotsimpact /&gt;

== History ==
The idea for the convention emerged from the lack of a major comics convention in the area and a discussion Richmond Clements and Vicky Stonebridge had with Eden Court's Judith Aitken, about possibly bringing in a few guest speakers. Through contacts made because of their involvement with the [[British small press comics]] they were able speak to a wide number of professional comic creators and the event rapidly grew into full weekend. They also received advice from people with experience in running conventions, including [[Michael Carroll (author)|Michael Carroll]], who runs [[Octocon]],&lt;ref name=broadband&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7373125.stm Catwalks and comic book heroes], [[BBC]], 1 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Comic Expo]]'s Mike Allwood.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;[http://www.hi-arts.co.uk/jan08-feature-hi-ex.html Interview with organisers], ''Northings'', January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Hi-Ex has been used by the [[BBC]] as an example of how the Internet has helped facilitate developments in the [[Highlands and Islands]]. Clements is quoted as saying "Practically the entire event was organised through e-mail."&lt;ref name=broadband /&gt;&lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

''Northings'', the Highlands and Islands Art Journal, described the first convention as "inspirational," and said that "by the end of the weekend I felt like a door had been opened on a whole genre of art that I hadn’t really engaged with before."&lt;ref name=northings /&gt; Of those that attended, [[Gary Erskine]] declared it a "complete success."&lt;ref&gt;[http://garyerskine.blogspot.com/2008/02/hi-ex-success.html Hi-Ex success!] by [[Gary Erskine]], 5 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no Hi-Ex convention in 2011 due to lack of sponsorship;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbitsonline.com/2010/10/28/no-hi-ex-2011-convention/ "No Hi-Ex! 2011 Convention,"] Comics Bits website. Accessed 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the show returned in 2012. Hi-Ex 2013 was scheduled for 6–7 April 2013, at Eden Court Theatre, Inverness, but was cancelled.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==2014 'Heresy, Truth and the Future'==

HTLGI 2014 attracted a footfall of over 35,000 across 450 events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefestivalcalendar.co.uk/festivals/How_The_Light_Gets_In_2015&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers and performers included [[Roger Penrose]], [[Brooke Magnanti]], [[Bruce Parry]], [[Doon Mackichan]], [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]], [[David Nutt]], [[Molotov Jukebox]], [[Moulettes]], [[Natalie Bennett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/natalie-bennett/education-competition_b_5420235.html|title=Let's Get Heretical on Education: Competition Has Failed|website=HuffPost UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mr Scruff]].

==2012 'Uncharted Territory: Progress for a New Era'==

The 2012 festival&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/06/07/how-the-light-gets-in-2012-video_n_1577150.html|title=A Summer Festival ...Of Philosophy?!|date=2012-06-07|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-10-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to question existing notions of progress through an exploration of issues surrounding political, economic and ethical advance in the West. By acknowledging the uncertainty of the future and its values, do we need to establish new ideas of progress or is such a suggestion inherently flawed?

It was held in [[Hay-on-Wye]] and ran between 31 May and 10 June 2012. The festival staged almost five hundred sessions across the site’s five venues.

Amongst the speakers on the festival’s programme were musician [[Brian Eno]], founder of Glastonbury festival [[Michael Eavis]], literary theorist and critic [[Terry Eagleton]] and independent scientist and inventor [[James Lovelock]]. Musical highlights included performances from [[Charlotte Church]], [[Emmy the Great]], and [[Jeffrey Lewis]] and the Junkyard, as well as a twelve-hour painting marathon from artist [[Stella Vine]] to accompany a performance by alternative rock band [[The Chapman Family]].

London's Open Gallery, an institution dedicated to the medium of [[video painting]], also staged a series works by filmmaker Roz Mortimer entitled, ‘Sites of Memory’.

==2011 ‘New Gods: Icons and Ideas in a Changed World’==
[[file:HowTheLightGetsIn.jpg|thumb|HowTheLightGetsIn Festival 2011]]

The 2011 festival questioned whether the great narratives that have built and sustained the West are under threat and, if so, what are the new gods that will replace them?

Speakers at the festival included critical theorist [[Leela Gandhi]], Times columnist [[David Aaronovitch]], poet [[Simon Armitage]], New Statesman culture editor [[Jonathan Derbyshire]] and screenwriter [[Jez Butterworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/how-did-they-get-in-hay-festivals-success-spawns-its-own-fringe-2292894.html|title=How did they get in? Hay Festival's success spawns its own fringe|date=2011-06-04|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-10-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural highlights ranged from [[Ghostpoet]], [[Mount Kimbie]] and [[The Correspondents (band)|The Correspondents]], to comedy and the screening of documentaries from around the world with [[BBC Four]].

==2010 ‘Being Human’==

The 2010 festival posed the questions: What is it to be alive? What is essential to our humanity and what is peripheral? What is truly important in life?

Author of Politics of Fear [[Frank Furedi]], filmmaker [[David Bond (filmmaker)|David Bond]], author [[Philip Pullman]] and Labour politician [[Jon Cruddas]], were amongst the speakers on the line up.

The Open Gallery explored the boundary between the human and the natural. [[The Wellcome Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; Identity Project presented an exhibition and two days of events on the topic of Identity. Notably, The School of Life&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theschooloflife.com/&lt;/ref&gt; hosted a series of philosophy breakfasts with leading thinkers over the 10-day festival.

Radio 1’s [[Huw Stephens]] and John Rostron, the duo behind the Sŵn Festival, curated a night of cutting-edge music, which was accompanied by live performances from [[Johnny Flynn (musician)|Johnny Flynn]], Cate le Bon and Radio 1’s [[Bethan Elfyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/4cedc3be-34d0-3f69-bc3c-1b1bba08addf|title=Review: How The Light Gets In festival, Hay on Wye|date=2010-06-09|website=Wales|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''intelligence gathering network''' is a system through which information about a particular entity is collected for the benefit of another through the use of more than one, inter-related source.{{according to whom|date=February 2015}} Such information may be gathered by a [[military intelligence]], [[government intelligence]], or [[commercial intelligence]] network.

[[Intelligence assessment]] employs [[intelligence analysis]] to refine information. Foreign [[embassies]] subscribe to the newspapers and keep tabs on the news channels of their host countries &amp;mdash; the information doesn't have to be classified to be considered useful intelligence; indeed, so-called OSINT, or [[open-source intelligence]], is increasing in both quantity and utility with the ascendancy of digital media. Researchers may also be employed to dig through archives and check facts. An important form of intelligence is so-called "[[signals intelligence]]", which attempts to intercept electronic communications and other signals sent between parties working for a hostile, or potentially hostile, entity, or between neutral or even friendly parties but ''discussing'' that entity.

In established intelligence agencies, such networks usually follow a [[linear]] rather than distributed structure. An [[agent handling|agent handler]] directs the activities of a number of persons and sources in order to obtain the necessary facts about the target of the intelligence gathering operation.  The two main [[HUMINT]] agent types used are ''infiltration'' and ''penetration'' agents.  An infiltration agent is someone who enters the target of the operation from the outside, but on a suitable pretext so that they are not suspected of espionage.  A penetration agent would already be in place in the target area, and is recruited by the handler, often by means of the [[Counterintelligence#Counter-HUMINT|MICE principle]]. The information so gathered is processed by one or more analysts and turned into an intelligence product.  Information is conveyed between nodes of the network by a variety of secure/clandestine means, be they physical or electronic.

==History==

===Turkey===

At the turn of the twentieth century, the last Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, demanded daily intelligence reports called &lt;I&gt;djournals&lt;/i&gt; (from the word "journal). After decades, he had saved millions of them in "a whole building to itself in the War Office, where a Government Commission is now," Francis McCullagh wrote in 1910, "wading slowly through this amazing accumulation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCullagh|first1=Francis|title=The Fall of Abd-ul-Hamid|date=1910|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co.

The '''International Latin American Dance Championships''' were created after the [[Second World War]] in England by [[Elsa Wells]], and are now organised by ''Dance News'' special events. The current full title is the '''''Elsa Wells International Dance Championships''''', and includes all categories in Standard and Latin American ballroom dance.

The series of Latin American International Championships were started once the initial choreography, teaching and adjudications standards for these dances were stabilised. This occurred in the 1950s, after a period of debate and discussion initiated by [[Monsieur Pierre]] and his associates. Although English in origin and organisation, the championships were open to the world, as is the case today for all the major ballroom championships held in England. There are two main series, one for professionals, and another for amateurs, plus various age-limited categories. The division between amateur and professional has persisted in ballroom dance long after it disappeared in most other sports and pastimes.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Frank and Peggy 1968. ''Come dancing''. Allen, London; which was also the initial source for the list.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stages for both Amateur and Professional Standard and Latin American titles are always held at the [[Albert Hall]] in London. Qualification for these final stages, and the championships for other categories (Juvenile, Under 14, Junior, Under 21, Senior, Pro Rising Stars) are held at a preliminary two-day event before the main finals at [[Brentwood, Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dance News'' #2138, August 27th 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-English adjudicators are always included in the adjudication panels. It is one of the largest regular, and genuinely international, events in the ballroom dance world.

This list (and competition) is not the same as the later [[World Dance Council|WDC World Championships]]. The International Professional Latin and Standard Championships are now part of the World Dance Council's ''World Super Series''.

== The dances ==
The Latin American competition comprises five dances: [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]], [[Samba (ballroom dance)|samba]], [[Rhumba|rumba]], [[Pasodoble|paso doble]], and [[Jive (dance)|jive]],&lt;ref&gt;In that order in each round; and Jive is only danced in the semi-finals and finals.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted in line with [[British Dance Council]] (BDC) regulations;&lt;ref&gt;The ''British Dance Council Rulebook'' summarises the points,&lt;/ref&gt; the basis of the dances is described in standard texts.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Walter 2003. ''The Laird technique of Latin dancing''. International Dance Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced choreography has, however, broken through the traditional limitations of social dancing, and more obviously in the Latin and American dances than in ballroom (Modern or Standard).&lt;ref&gt;McMains, Juliet 2006. ''Glamour addiction: inside the American ballroom dance industry''. Weslyan University Press, Middletown CT.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adjudication ==
The qualifying and lesser events days at Brentwood had, in 2009, three adjudication panels of eight former champions and other significant professionals. Early rounds had one panel of eight, alternating. Semi-finals and finals of lesser events had both panels. At the Albert Hall, there were four panels, each of 19 adjudicators. The semi-finals and finals of the amateur and professional titles were each adjudicated by a separate panel.&lt;ref&gt;Programme of the 2009 International Championships&lt;/ref&gt; This may be contrasted favourably with the number of judges used for those [[Olympic Games]] events which depend upon adjudication, such as [[ice dancing]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]]. Results and adjudication details (marks for each finalist by each adjudicator) are posted after the event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dance-news.co.uk/news_detail.php?news_id=61{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009 entrants ==
In the Professional Championship there were 150 couples from 34 countries of affiliation (countries of origin not listed). In the Amateur Championship there were 289 couples from 31 countries of affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;For comaparison, there are 51 countries listed as full members by the [[World Dance Council|WDC]], of which some political units are listed more than once. China is represented not only by the Peoples' Republic, but also by Hong Kong (which was listed long before China) and Taiwan; the UK is represented by two listings: Great Britain (effectively, England), and Scotland. Also, individual dancers may change affiliation during their careers.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries such as China, Japan, Russia and Italy sent multiple entries to all competitions. The countries listed in the table below are countries of ''origin'', where known.

==Critical reception==
Overall, the tour received praise from both music critics and its spectators. Jon Bream (''[[Star Tribune]]'') notes despite Wynonna's vocal problems, the duo were still able to pull off a fantastic show at the sold out Mystic Showroom. He elaborates, "As Wynonna handed lead vocal chores to her backup singers, it seemed appropriate&amp;mdash;for more reasons than one&amp;mdash;that the Judds ended their Last Encore show with ''Silent Night''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=111091404 |title=High notes out of reach, Judds still touched hearts |author=Bream, Jon |date=1 December 2010 |work=Star Tribune |accessdate=27 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z27JRFcj?url=http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=111091404 |archivedate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Budzak (''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'') called the evening a success for the Columbus audience. He states, "On more than 30 songs that spanned a quarter-century, The Judds have proved they still had the wherewithal to charm the crowd, whether it was Wynonna hugging a 4-year-old girl on stage; or Naomi kissing her husband, bass singer Larry Strickland, on a cover of ''Don't Be Cruel''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/arts/stories/2010/12/03/review_judds.html |title=Another successful 'encore' |author=Budzak, Gary |date=3 December 2010 |work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |accessdate=27 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z27YOztC?url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/arts/stories/2010/12/03/review_judds.html |archivedate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The praise continued with Kevin C. Johnson (''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''). The concert at the Family Arena served as a fitting finale for the duo. He explains, "This is The Last Encore tour, positioned as the final go-round for country music's most successful mother-daughter duo, which doesn't bode well for future Juddheads. Then again, we've already learned final doesn't always mean the end when it comes to the Judds, so time will tell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/music/article_5105938a-00b8-11e0-9eaa-0017a4a78c22.html |title=Judds deliver playful show at Family Arena |author=Johnson, Kevin C. |date=6 December 2010 |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |accessdate=27 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z27eyWYx?url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/music/article_5105938a-00b8-11e0-9eaa-0017a4a78c22.html |archivedate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the EnergySolutions Arena, Tom Wharton (''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'') says that the Judds were "going out in styles". He further comments, "The pair utilized a video screen behind them for retrospective moments, showing family photos and highlights from their career, as well as two big screens on either side of the stage that allowed an appreciative crowd of about 5,000 a chance to enjoy closeup views of the performers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50847253-76/wynonna-daughter-naomi-judds.html.csp |title=Last Encore by the Judds is rousing success |author=Wharton, Tom |date=9 December 2010 |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |accessdate=27 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z27pYGBb?url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50847253-76/wynonna-daughter-naomi-judds.html.csp |archivedate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ARCO Arena, Carla Meyer (''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'') notes The Judds provided an intimate show, reminding the audience of the "good ol' days" She continues, "But the familiarity goes beyond song. Naomi, 64, and Wynonna, 46, long ago charmed and confided their ways into fans' hearts by publicly discussing their health woes, tricky family dynamics and Wynonna's weight battles and bad luck with men. Whether through their many appearances on "Oprah" or osmosis, you feel like you know them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2010/12/14/3254918/much-like-old-times-for-the-judds.html |title=Much like old times for the Judds in charming show at Arco |author=Meyer, Carla |date= |work=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |accessdate=27 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z28092o6?url=http://www.sacbee.com/2010/12/14/3254918/much-like-old-times-for-the-judds.html |archivedate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially started by Nafis Ahmed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NAFIS AHMED At the Root of Live Square|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/nafis-ahmed-at-the-root-of-live-square/|website = The Daily Star|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was a student in his sophomore year at [[Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka|IBA-DU]], LiveSquare became known with a series of lounge concerts under the banner of [[The Wireless Sessions]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Livesquare Experiences|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/livesquare-experiences/|website = The Daily Star|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring bands such as [[Arbovirus (band)|Arbovirus]], [[Shunno]], [[Artcell]], [[Cryptic Fate]] and [[Nemesis (Bangladeshi band)|Nemesis]], in a time when the lounge music scene in [[Dhaka]] was in its infancy.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news |title=Return of The Wireless Sessions |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/01/wireless.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; LiveSquare also organized and executed several one-off concerts during this time, including a fundraising concert for the victims of the hurricane [[Cyclone Sidr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amader Gaan &amp; ADTL Unplugged Concert 08'|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2008/01/03/feature_concert.htm|website = archive.thedailystar.net|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; LiveSquare went on a year-long hiatus in 2010 following Ahmed's graduation and subsequent employment at a reputed marketing agency.

==Date==
Lohri is linked to the [[Bikrami]] calendar, and is celebrated the day before the festival of [[Maghi]] celebrated in [[India]] as [[Makar Sankranti]]. Lohri falls in the month of [[Paush]] and is set by the solar part of the lunisolar [[Punjabi calendar]] and in most years it falls on 13 January of the [[Gregorian calendar]].

==Origins==
[[File:Lohri.jpg|thumb|left|Lohri]]
There are many folklores about Lohri. Lohri is the celebration of the arrival of longer days after the [[winter solstice]]. According to folklore, in ancient times Lohri was celebrated at the end of the traditional month when [[winter solstice]] occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/kids/what-a-wonderful-world/article4282523.ece|title=What a wonderful world|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/chandigarh/bless-the-girl/article1-988618.aspx Hindustan Times 12 01 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; It celebrates the days getting longer as the sun proceeds on its northward journey. The day after Lohri is celebrated as [[Maghi]] [[Sankranti|Sangrand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Punjabi-pockets-warm-up-for-Lohri-bonfires/articleshow/45839012.cms|title=Punjabi pockets warm up for Lohri bonfires - Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its origins, Lohri is an ancient mid winter Hindu festival, in regions near the Himalayan mountains where winter is colder than the rest of the subcontinent. Hindus traditionally lit bonfires in their yards after the weeks of the ''rabi'' season cropping work, socialized around the fire, sang and danced together as they marked the end of winter and the onset of longer days. After the night of bonfire celebrations, the Hindu would mark Makar Sankranti and go to a sacred water body such as a river or lake to bathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Gordon Melton|author2=Martin Baumann|title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2yiyLLOj88C&amp;pg=PA1769 |year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-204-3|page=1769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punjabi woman smile.jpg|thumb|right|Punjabi woman waiting to participate in Gidda]]
However, instead of celebrating Lohri on the eve of when [[winter solstice]] actually occurs, Punjabis celebrate it on the last day of the month during which [[winter solstice]] takes place. Lohri commemorates the passing of the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/fashion/brighten-your-lohri-with-a-touch-of-tradition/article1-1305929.aspx Hindustan Times 12 January 2015 Snigdha Ahuja]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===
The ancient significance of the festival is both as a winter crop season celebration&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HO4n549SLIgC&amp;dq=lohri+winter+crop+celebration&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=lohri+ Harvest Celebrations, Volume 4, (2002) World Book]&lt;/ref&gt; and a remembrance of the Sun deity (''[[Surya]]''). Lohri songs mention the Indian Sun god asking for heat and thanking him for his return. Other legends explain the celebration as a folk reverence for fire (''[[Agni]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lohrifestival.org| title = THE LEGENDS OF LOHRI |publisher= Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the goddess of Lohri.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, AnjaliGera  (2017) Bhangra Moves: From Ludhiana to London and Beyond. Routledge  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tCgxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT177&amp;dq=lohri+goddess&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvq7mk2tnYAhWmOsAKHRPmDZkQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=lohri%20goddess&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another folklore links Lohri to the tale of [[Dulla Bhatti]]. The central theme of many Lohri songs is the legend of Dulla Bhatti, whose real name was Abdullah Bhatti and lived in Punjab during the reign of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar]].&lt;ref name="PuriNesbitt2013p34"/&gt; He was regarded as a hero in Punjab, for rescuing Hindu girls from being forcibly taken to be sold in slave market of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lohrifestival.org| title = THE ORIGINS OF LOHRI |publisher= Society for the Confluence of Festivals in India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PuriNesbitt2013p34"/&gt; Amongst those he saved were two girls Sundri &amp; Mundri, who gradually became a theme of Punjab' folklore. As a part of Lohri celebrations, children go around homes singing the traditional folk songs of Lohri with "Dulla Bhatti" name included. One person sings, while others end each line with a loud "Ho!" sung in unison. After the song ends, the adult of the home is expected to give snacks and money to the singing troupe of youngsters.&lt;ref name="PuriNesbitt2013p34"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kailash Puri|author2=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Pool of Life: The Autobiography of a Punjabi Agony Aunt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_NWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|year=2013|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-78284-067-1|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations: Bonfire and festive foods==
Lohri is celebrated with a bonfire. The lighting of bonfire during this winter festival is an ancient tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Page 17: From Kartik month the Sun is moving away from the earth. Ancient people lit the bonfire to reignite the return of longer days. This is a very ancient tradition.

[[File:(2) Raw sugar jaggery gud Punjab India.jpg|thumb|right|''Gurh'', solidifiedand unrefined sugarcane juice is a traditional festive sweet.]]
In Punjab, the harvest festival Lohri is marked by eating sheaves of roasted corn from the new harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zG1H75z0EYYC&amp;pg=RA2-PA99&amp;dq=lohri+harvest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi07rSX68zTAhVGBMAKHci3BfwQ6AEITTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=lohri%20harvest&amp;f=false Albala, Ken  (2011) Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO]&lt;/ref&gt; The January sugarcane harvest is celebrated in the Lohri festival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9vMj4E6OKtQC&amp;q=sugarcane+lohri+harvest&amp;dq=sugarcane+lohri+harvest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_8Z6M7czTAhWqB8AKHU49B0AQ6AEISzAI Sinclair, Toby (1994) India.Odyssey]&lt;/ref&gt; Sugarcane products such as gurh and gachak are central to Lohri celebrations, as are nuts which are harvested in January. The other important food item of Lohri is radish which can be harvested between October and January. Mustard greens are cultivated mainly in the winter months because the crop is suitable to the agro-climatic conditions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cxhNAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=sag+lohri&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+lohri Indian Food Packer, Volume 49 (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, mustard greens are also a winter produce. It is traditional to eat [[Gajak]], [[Sarson da saag]] with [[Makki di roti]], [[radish]], ground nuts and [[jaggery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99jan13/head6.htm#3| title=Lohri page|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also traditional to eat "til rice" which is made by mixing [[jaggery]], sesame seeds and rice.&lt;ref&gt;Sundar Mundarye ho by Assa Singh Bhuman Waris Shah Foundation {{ISBN|81-7856-043-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, this dish is called 'Tricholi.'

===Collecting Lohri items and trick or treating===
In various places of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], about 10 to 15 days before Lohri, groups of young and teenage boys and girls go around the neighbourhood collecting logs for the Lohri bonfire. In some places, they also collect items such as grains and jaggery which are sold and the sale proceeds are divided amongst the group.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Sundar mundarye ho by Assa Singh Ghuman Waris Shah Foundation ISBN B1-7856-043-7&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular activity engaged in by boys is to select a group member to smear his face with ash and tie a rope around his waist! The idea is for the selected person to act as a deterrent for people who refrain from giving Lohri items. The boys will sing Lohri songs asking for Lohri items. If not enough is given, the householder will be given an ultimatum to either give more or the rope will be loosened. If not enough is given, then the boy who has his face smeared will try to enter the house and smash clay pots or the clay stove!&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Practices==
During the day, children go from door to door singing folk songs. These children are given sweets and savories, and occasionally, money. Turning them back empty-handed is regarded inauspicious. Where families are welcoming newly-weds and new borns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/Lohri-brightened-by-festive-spirit/articleshow/45878319.cms|title=Lohri brightened by festive spirit - Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the requests for treats increases.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The collections gathered by the children are known as ''Lohri'' and consist of til, gachchak, crystal sugar, gur (jaggery), moongphali (peanuts) and phuliya or popcorn. Lohri is then distributed at night during the festival. Till, peanuts, popcorn and other food items are also thrown into the fire. For some, throwing food into the fire represents the burning of the old year and start the next year on [[Makar Sankranti]]

The bonfire ceremony differs depending on the location in Punjab. In some parts, a small image of the folk Lohri goddess is made with gobar (cattle dung) decorating it, kindling a fire beneath it and chanting its praises. The folk Lohri goddess is believed to be an ancient aspect of the celebration,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and is part of a long tradition of [[Winter solstice]] celebrations manifesting as a god or goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/yulethelongestnight/a/Winter_Sol_Gods.htm|title=Who Are the Deities of the Winter Solstice?|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other parts, the Lohri fire consists of cow dung and wood with no reference to the Lohri goddess.

The bonfire is lit at sunset in the main village square. People toss sesame seeds, gur, sugar-candy and ''rewaries'' on the bonfire, sit around it, sing and dance till the fire dies out. Some people perform a prayer and go around the fire. This is to show respect to the natural element of fire,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/47133/bringing-home-sun-god.html] FirozBakht Ahmed Deccan Herald 18/01/2010&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition common in [[winter solstice]] celebrations. It is traditional to offer guests til, gachchak, gur, moongphali (peanuts) and phuliya or popcorn. Milk and water is also poured around the bonfire by [[Hindus]] to thank the Sun God and seeking his continued protection.

Among some sections of the [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] community, the festival is traditionally celebrated as  [[Lal Loi]]. On the day of Lal Loee children bring wood sticks from their grand parents and aunties and light a fire burning the sticks in the night with people enjoying, dancing and playing around the fire. The festival is gaining popularity amongst other Sindhis where Lohri is not a traditional festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/Lohri-gaiety-warms-all/articleshow/11468901.cms? Nidhin Singhi "Lohri gaiety warms all"Times of India 13 01 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lohri and the financial year==
Historically, during the 19th century, revenue for winter crops was collected either on Lohri or [[Maghi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PSpuAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=punjabi+collect+rent+on+lohri&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=lohri Proceedings - Punjab History Conference (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations==
In houses that have recently had a marriage or childbirth, Lohri celebrations will reach a higher pitch of excitement. Punjabis usually have private Lohri celebrations, in their houses. Lohri rituals are performed, with the accompaniment of special Lohri songs.

Singing and dancing form an intrinsic part of the celebrations. People wear their brightest clothes and come to dance the [[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]] and [[gidda]] to the beat of the [[dhol]]. Punjabi songs are sung, and everybody rejoices. Sarson da saag and makki di roti is usually served as the main course at a Lohri dinner. Lohri is a great occasion that holds great importance for farmers. However, people residing in urban areas also celebrate Lohri, as this festival provides the opportunity to interact with family and friends.

==Lohri songs==
There are many Lohri songs. For example, the following song which has words to express gratitude to Dulla Bhatti (the 'ho's are in chorus):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lohrifestival.org/lohri-boys-songs.html | title = Dhulla Bhatti Song}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other legends of the origin of Lohri festival==
Some people believe that Lohri has derived its name from Loi, the wife of Saint Kabir. There is a legend amongst some people that Lohri comes from the word 'loh', which means the light and the warmness of fire. Lohri is also called lohi in rural Punjab. According to another legend Holika and Lohri were sisters. While the former perished in the Holi fire, the latter survived with Prahlad. Eating of til (sesame seeds) and rorhi is considered to be essential on Lohri day. Perhaps the words til and rorhi merged to become tilorhi, which eventually got shortened to Lohri.

==Other parts of India==
Lohri coincides with the festivals of [[Pongal]], [[Bhogali Bihu]] and [[Bhogi]].

The day preceding Pongal in Tamil Nadu and Makara Sankranti in Andhra Pradesh is called [[Bhogi]](భోగి)  this is when people discard old and derelict things and concentrate on new things causing change or transformation. At dawn people light a bonfire with logs of wood, other solid-fuels and wooden furniture at home that are no longer useful. The disposal of derelict things is where all old habits, vices, attachment to relations and material things are sacrificed in the sacrificial fire of the knowledge of Rudra, known as the "Rudra Gita Gyana Yagya". It represents realization, transformation and purification of the soul by imbibing and inculcating divine virtues.

==Similar festivals in other countries==
[[Winter solstice]] festivals have been incorporated into other festivals which are celebrated in various regions around the world. The festival of [[Yule]] is observed during [[Christmas]] celebrations whereby a log is burnt to commemorate the [[winter solstice]].

The festival of [[Hogmanay]] is celebrated on new year’s day. The fire festival of Stonehaven in [[Scotland]] is the direct descendant of lighting winter solstice bonfires.&lt;ref name="The History of Hogmanay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/The-History-of-Hogmanay/|title=The History of Hogmanay|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another event is observed every 11 January when the flaming Clavie (a barrel full of staves) is carried round in Burghead and is wedged on the Doorie Hill. When it is  burnt out, people take the smouldering embers to bring good luck for the coming year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UViEbWQOSd0C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Clavie+at+Burghead+winter+solstice&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kgSsriEtSD&amp;sig=yNrnt2YaiRzVGxxWyjOvhWu-DyU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Ou4VKqaDIzV7Qbwq4DYBw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Clavie%20at%20Burghead%20winter%20solstice&amp;f=false] the Magic Arts in Celtic Britain Lewis Spence&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Cecilia Rogers''' (born c. 1820 – found dead July 28, 1841) was an American [[murder]] victim whose story became a national sensation.

Rogers was a noted beauty who worked in a New York [[tobacco]] store, which attracted the custom of many distinguished men, clearly on her account. When her body was found in the Hudson River, she was assumed to have been the victim of [[gang]] violence. However, one witness swore that she was dumped after a failed abortion attempt, while her boyfriend's suicide-note suggested possible involvement on his part. Rogers' death remains unexplained. She inspired [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s pioneering [[detective fiction|detective story]] "[[The Mystery of Marie Rogêt]]".

==Early life==
Mary Rogers was probably born in 1820 in [[Lyme, Connecticut]], though her birth records have not survived.&lt;ref name=Stashower&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beautiful Cigar Girl |last=Stashower |first=Daniel |publisher=PenguinBooks |location=New York |year=2006 |pages=20–23 |isbn=0-525-94981-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a beautiful young woman who grew up as the only child of her widowed mother. At the age of twenty, Mary lived in the [[boarding house]] that was run by her mother, although it was her amazing beauty that made her the talk of the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Romeo&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beautiful Cigar Girl |last=vitelli |first=Romeo  |location=Toronto |year=2011  |url=http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2011/05/the-mary-rogers-case.html |isbn=0-525-94981-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died in a steamboat explosion when she was 17 years old and she took a job as a [[clerk]] in a tobacco shop owned by John Anderson in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Sova&gt;{{cite book |title=Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z |last=Sova |first=Dawn B. |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York |edition=Paperback |year=2001 |pages=212–213 |isbn=0-8160-4161-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson paid her a generous wage in part because her physical attractiveness brought in many customers. One customer wrote that he spent an entire afternoon at the store only to exchange "teasing glances" with her. Another admirer published a poem in the ''[[New York Herald]]'' referring to her [[heaven]]-like smile and her star-like eyes.&lt;ref name=Stashower/&gt; Some of her customers included notable literary figures [[James Fenimore Cooper]], [[Washington Irving]], and [[Fitz-Greene Halleck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McNamara |first=Joseph |title=The Justice Story: True Tales of Murder, Mystery, Mayhem |publisher=Sports Publishing LLC |year=2000 |page=99 |isbn=1-58261-285-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First disappearance==
On October 5, 1838, the [[newspaper]] New York ''[[The Sun (New York)|Sun]]'' reported that "Miss Mary Cecilia Rogers" had disappeared from her home.&lt;ref name=Sova/&gt; Her mother, Phoebe, said she found a [[suicide]] note which the local [[coroner]] analyzed and said revealed a "fixed and unalterable determination to destroy herself".&lt;ref name=Stashower/&gt; The next day, however, the ''Times and Commercial Intelligence'' reported that the disappearance was a [[hoax]] and that Rogers only went to visit a friend in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=Sova/&gt; The ''Sun'' had previously published a story known as the [[Great Moon Hoax]] in 1835, causing controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis |first=Jim |title=100 Media Moments that Changed America |year=2010 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |isbn=978-0-313-35517-2 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggested this return was actually the hoax, evidenced by Rogers's failure to return to work immediately. When she finally resumed working at the tobacco shop, one newspaper suggested the whole event was a publicity stunt managed by Anderson.&lt;ref name=Stashower/&gt;

==Murder==
On July 25, 1841, Rogers told her [[Engagement|fiancé]], Daniel Payne, that she would be visiting her aunt and other family members.&lt;ref name=Sova/&gt; Three days later, on July 28, the police found her [[Cadaver|corpse]] floating in the [[Hudson River]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe 1809–1849 |last1=Thomas |first1=Dwight |last2=Jackson |first2=David K. |publisher=G.

A remorseful note was found among the papers on his person where he died near [[Sybil's Cave]] on October 7, 1841, reading: "To the World – here I am on the very spot. May [[God]] forgive me for my misspent life." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/mary_rogers/5.html|title=The Murder Mystery of Mary Rogers|author=Douglass MacGowan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730060532/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/mary_rogers/5.html|archivedate=July 30, 2008|website=www.trutv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Michaud Affair''' (in French '''''l'Affaire Michaud''''') was a [[political]] controversy in [[Quebec]] that began in 2000. It revolved around  the comments of [[Parti Québécois]] supporter [[Yves Michaud]], those of the [[Jewish Quebecer|Quebec Jewish community]] (through the [[B'nai B'rith]] organization) and the subsequent [[censure]] motion from the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] members of parliament.

==The Affair==

===CKAC Interview===
What has been called the "Michaud Affair" started on December 5, 2000, in an interview on the [[Montreal]] radio station [[CKAC]]. Talk show host [[Paul Arcand]] asked: "Don't you feel that there is a lack of interest of a good part of the population on the question of sovereignty and the national question, people who have had enough, for whom it is all over, (who say) let's move on to something else?".

To which Yves Michaud replied: "Well, I will tell you an anecdote. I was... I went to get my hair cut about a month ago. There was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Senate of Canada|senator]] who I will not name who doesn't speak [French]... even though he represents a French-speaking riding and who asked me: 'Are you still a separatist, Yves?' I said 'Yes, yes I am separatist just as you are Jewish. It took 2000 years for your people to have its homeland in Israel.' I said: 'Me, whether it takes 10, 50, or 100 more years it can wait.' So he told me: 'It's not the same.'"

"It's never the same for them. So I said: it is not the same? The [[Armenian Genocide|Armenians]] did not suffer, the Palestinians did not suffer, the [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwandans]] did not suffer. It's always (just) you. You are the only people who suffered in the history of humanity."

"After that, I was fed up. And here we are, I am completely indignant... that some suggested to rename the [[Montreal Metro|metro]] station [named after] [[Lionel Groulx]], who was the spiritual father of two generations of Quebecers and is almost a Quebec idol. It's the [[B'nai B'rith]] that did that, which was the extremist phalange... There has been world Zionism... "{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The Senator mentioned was [[Leo Kolber]], Michaud later revealed.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/michaud/20.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estates-General===
On December 12, 2000, the director of B'nai B'rith's Quebec chapter, [[Robert Libman]], sent a memo to then Premier [[Lucien Bouchard]] requesting that he stop Michaud from being the PQ's candidate in the Mercier riding.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/michaud/20.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/michaud/30.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2000, Michaud presented a memorandum to Quebec's "[[Estates-General on the situation of the French language]]". He abandoned some parts of his text to say this, in front of members of the [[B'nai B'rith]] who were waiting their turn to speak:{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

"[[Lionel Groulx|Groulx]] invited us 'to have, like the Jews, their rough will to survive, their invincible spirit of solidarity, their imperishable moral armor'. And the historian was giving the example of the Jewish people as a model to be followed so that Quebecers affirm their own national identity and fully assume the heritage of their history. Groulx, who is one of the intellectual guides of two generations of Quebecers and one whose name some wanted to see removed from the [[Lionel-Groulx (Montreal Metro)|Lionel-Groulx station]] a few years ago, to probably replace it by the "[[Mordecai Richler]]" station, the [[René Lévesque Boulevard]] by, no doubt, "[[Ariel Sharon]]" boulevard, the [[Jacques-Cartier Place]] by the "[[Howard Galganov|Galganov]]" place, and so on. It is a little satirical, it is a little bit jokingly that I say that, but I think that some others are exaggerating and going a little too far. Immigrants, we want some. Yes, as much as possible and pushing up to the limit of our capacities to welcome them. Immigrants who will not only have rights but also responsibilities with regard to one of the most generous societies in the world which welcomes them with open arms and wallets, immigrants with responsibilities, that is, understanding and speaking our language, open to our culture, our way of working, of doing things, of interpreting the world in the French language and accompanying us on the road which leads us to the control of all the tools for our development (...) There is an ethnic vote against the sovereignty of the people of Quebec. If we do not integrate our immigrants, well then, we will enter on the slope of the Louisianization, and folklorization of our society."{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Condemnation by the National Assembly===

On December 13, 2000, the leader of the opposition [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], [[Jean Charest]], presented to the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] a motion condemning references to "an ethnic vote against the sovereignty of the people of Quebec" and speaking of B'nai Brith as "an extremist group against quebecers and against sovereignty",&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/michaud/08.htm&lt;/ref&gt; as  expressed by Yves Michaud at the Estates-General.

The Premier at the time, Lucien Bouchard, affirmed that he had been aware of similar remarks made by Michaud three (sic) days earlier and that he had asked Michaud to tone down his remarks in the Estates-General. Since Michaud did not do so and even added fuel to the fire, Bouchard therefore condemned the remarks in the name of his party and the government. The motion was adopted unanimously by the National Assembly.

==Interpretation==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2013}}
The Michaud Affair re-awakened the bitter, very emotional and controversial divisions within the Parti Québécois between proponents of "soft nationalists" (aka "nationalistes modérés") versus "hard liners" (aka "purs et durs"). 
&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/michaud/13.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/michaud/14.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/michaud/15.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This Affair must be interpreted in the context of long-standing historical tensions between some more radical factions within the Quebec nationalist movement and the English-speaking and Jewish communities of Quebec ("Anglophones"). Consequently, whereas most members of the Anglophone community and the general media consider Michaud's allegations to lean towards antisemitism,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} to Michaud supporters within the PQ and the sovereigntist movement generally the Michaud Affair is the result of censorship and defamation against the "ethnic Quebecer" minority and its "rightful quest for political independence and autonomy".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Thus, this question is an emotional one for both the PQ's ethnic-nationalist fanatics and the Anglophone zealots.

==Aftermath==
On December 19, 2000, former Quebec Premier [[Jacques Parizeau]] and many others signed an open letter condemning the hasty resolution and supporting Michaud's. The letter was published in several newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/michaud/09.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, [[Jacques Brassard]], the parliamentary leader of the government at the time, answered also in an open letter to the newspapers,{{Which|date=October 2013}} that the motion was not against Yves Michaud himself, but on his comments made as a public person seeking office in the government. He said that the National Assembly had the right to condemn unacceptable propositions made in a political context. He also stated that freedom of speech was not a one-way proposition.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/michaud/18.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The event, which is said to have been a reason for [[Lucien Bouchard]]'s resignation on January 11, 2001,{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} was not listed in B'nai Brith's annual compilation of anti-semitic events.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} 
During an [https://web.archive.org/web/20041206084118/http://www.voir.ca/actualite/actualite.aspx?iIDArticle=14890 interview for ''Voir'' magazine] for the week of March 1, 2001, Robert Libman stated that he did not think Yves Michaud was an anti-semite and that his remarks had been distorted.

Some less-involved observers in the media{{Who|date=October 2013}} have expressed the view that although Michaud's comments were borderline and controversial as they could be interpreted as trivialization of the Shoah, the comparisons made by his accusers to notable antisemites like [[Ernst Zündel]] were excessive and exaggerated Michaud's intent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Michaud has been battling in court to defend his reputation since that time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

'''Night Visions''' is a biannual [[film festival]] focusing on [[horror film|horror]], [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[cult film|cult]] [[Film|cinema]]. The festival is held twice a year in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. The festival also showcases [[documentary film|documentaries]] and [[short films]]. The first Night Visions festival was organized in November 1997.

== History ==
The first Night Visions festival was organized in Halloween 1997. The roots of the festival lay in Gorehound, a film [[zine]] focusing on genre cinema, whose readership and staff were responsible for the first Night Visions Film Festival. The current festival director Mikko Aromaa is former editor-in-chief of Gorehound. The first festival was a one night event of an overnight screening of genre films showed back to back on one screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hokkanen|first1=Melissa|title=Night Visions on mannaa elokuvafanaatikolle|url=http://www.city.fi/kulttuuri/night+visions+on+mannaa+elokuvafanaatikolle/5741|website=City.fi|publisher=City Digital Oy|accessdate=10 December 2014|language=Finnish|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 onwards, Night Visions film festival has been arranged twice a year, with '''Back to Basics''' in mid-April and '''Maximum Halloween''' on [[Halloween]] weekend. The Maximum Halloween event was extended from one night event to a weekend event in 2005, showing movies on three different nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Night Visions laajenee kolmipäiväiseksi|url=http://www.ts.fi/kulttuuri/1073969115/Night+Visions+laajeneekolmipaivaiseksi|accessdate=10 December 2014|work=[[Turun Sanomat]]|publisher=TS-Yhtymä Oy|date=27 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 the film festival was awarded the Cultural Achievement Award 2012 from the City of [[Helsinki]]. The festival was credited for its bold, original and first-rate program, along with its unique atmosphere in overnight movie marathons. The judges also added that many of the films would never be seen in [[Finland]] without the festival. The winner was chosen by the Helsinki Board of Culture from nearly thousand nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koppinen|first1=Maija|title=Elokuvafestivaali Night Visions sai Helsingin kulttuuriteko -palkinnon|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/a1305641179805|accessdate=10 December 2014|work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]]|publisher=Sanoma Media Oy|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Natri|first1=Santtu|title=Night Visions palkittiin Helsingissä vuoden kulttuuritekona|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/night_visions_palkittiin_helsingissa_vuoden_kulttuuritekona/6464927|accessdate=10 December 2014|work=[[YLE|YLE Uutiset]]|publisher=Yleisradio Oy|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Navajo Wars}}
{{Campaignbox American Indian Wars (1898–1918)}}

The '''Padre Canyon incident''' was a skirmish in November 1899 between a group of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] hunters and a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of [[Arizona]] lawmen. Among other things, it was significant in that it nearly started a large-scale [[American Indian Wars|Indian war]] in [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]] and it led to the expansion of the [[Navajo Reservation]]. It was also the final armed conflict during a land dispute between the Navajo and American settlers, as well as one of the bloodiest.&lt;ref name="azdailysun.com"&gt;{{Cite web | title=MNA exhibit revives memory of Padre Canyon Incident of 1899| work=Betsy Bruner| url=http://azdailysun.com/article_c054bb54-3c54-523f-85b3-e87dbd099a37.html| accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Two Guns, Arizona by Gladwell Richardson| work=Gladwell Richardson| url=http://www.hkhinc.com/arizona/twoguns/platinum.htm| accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iverson, pg. 71-76"&gt;{{cite book | last=Iverson| first=Peter| authorlink=|author2=Monty Roessel| title=Diné: A History of the Navajos| publisher=University of New Mexico Press| series=| year=2001| doi=| isbn=9780826327154}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 1880s and 1890s, the Navajo band of [[Tribal chief|Chief]] B'ugoettin were fighting a minor, undeclared war with local [[Cowman (profession)|cattlemen]] for control of what was later known as the Leupp Extension, a large area of rangeland between Flagstaff, the [[Hopi Reservation]], and the [[Colorado River]], which would later become part of the Navajo Reservation. When the trouble began, the Leupp Extension was owned by the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]], which acquired the land from the federal government through a [[Land grant|grant]]. Like other railroads in the [[American Frontier|Old West]], the Atlantic and Pacific sold unused land to [[American pioneer|pioneers]], but, due to the Navajo presence in the Leupp Extension, pioneers were reluctant to buy land from them.&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iverson, pg. 71-76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="landgrant.org"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Railroad land grant forfeiture by George Draffan| work=George Draffan| url=http://www.landgrant.org/forfeiture.html| accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, cattlemen began moving their herds into the area, which only added tension to an already uneasy situation. Initially, the Navajo pleaded to the federal government for their help, but when that failed they retaliated by raiding for livestock. The cattlemen responded in a like manner, but for the most part the violence was minimal. Usually, when the Navajo captured a thief they would beat him up and then send him on his way. As was the case in 1899.&lt;ref name="azdailysun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iverson, pg. 71-76"/&gt;

William Henry Montgomery was a nineteen-year-old [[cowboy]] employed by William Roden, Jr. According to some accounts, on November 6, Montgomery was caught trying to steal some ponies from a group of Navajo hunters so three of the natives assaulted him in the usual manner. Wanting revenge, Montgomery went to Flagstaff and persuaded the county to have warrants issued for the arrest of the three natives. Other accounts say that the posse was responding to allegations of deer [[poaching]] and the theft of horses from William Roden's ranch, but the exact cause for the issuing of the warrants remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="azdailysun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iverson, pg. 71-76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive.com1"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Newark Daily Advocate, November 13, 1899 : Front Page : NewspaperARCHIVE.com| work=| url=https://newspaperarchive.com/newark-daily-advocate/1899-11-13/| accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To serve the warrants, [[Deputy Sheriff]] Dan Hogan formed a posse consisting of himself, William Montgomery, William Roden and Walter Durham, who was another cowboy from the Roden Ranch.&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"/&gt;

==Incident==
On the morning of November 11, Hogan and Montgomery left Flagstaff and headed to the Roden Ranch, where they recruited Roden and Durham. From there the posse went east towards Padre Canyon. Later that afternoon, at the edge of Elliott Canyon, the posse spotted a small Navajo camp in the brush down below near the junction of Padre Canyon and [[Canyon Diablo (canyon)|Canyon Diablo]]. After dismounting and making their way down the canyon wall, they stealthily advanced on a [[Wigwam|wickiup]] that was occupied by an elderly man who was [[Buckskin (leather)|tanning]] deer hide.&lt;ref name="azdailysun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"/&gt;

At this time, four other Navajo men spotted Montgomery as they were walking back to camp from a hunting trip. Assuming he was there to steal horses, the Navajos immediately opened fire on Montgomery, striking him in the heart and killing him instantly. A shootout ensued and it was later described by the ''Coconino Sun'' as being "one of the most desperate conflicts ever to be fought in the Southwest."&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iverson, pg. 71-76"/&gt;

The Navajo fire was accurate so the posse was forced to retreat at sundown. Fearing they would be too exposed by climbing back up the canyon wall, the possemen made their way south to a nearby railroad and on the following morning they succeeded in stopping a train for a ride back to Flagstaff.&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"/&gt;

Two of the Navajos were killed and one other was wounded. Deputy Hogan received a "long gash" across his shoulders as he was bending over to take cover and Roden received a shot to the groin. Montgomery was dead and Durham escaped with the other survivors unharmed.&lt;ref name="azdailysun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive.com2"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Eau Claire Leader , November 14, 1899 : Front Page : NewspaperARCHIVE.com| work=| url=https://newspaperarchive.com/eau-claire-leader/1899-11-14/| accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
News of the shooting quickly spread throughout Arizona and the rest of the nation, but it took nearly a month before the federal government responded. During that time, both the Navajo and the Americans feared that the other side would launch a campaign of reprisal. As result, Flagstaff was fortified by the town [[militia]].&lt;ref name="azdailysun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hkhinc.com"/&gt;

Eventually, the hunters who were involved in the fight were told to report to Flagstaff for a hearing in court, which they refused to do at first. Instead, Chief B'ugoettin assembled 300 heavily armed warriors and led them to Flagstaff. His plan was to conceal his force in the woods outside of town and then go in unarmed with two men to return the posse's horses, attacking only if they were placed in jail. Fortunately, however, [[Reverend]] William R. Johnston helped defuse the situation and he promised B'ugoettin that the three hunters would receive an adequate defense if they surrendered now. B'ugoettin agreed so the attack on Flagstaff never came.&lt;ref name="azdailysun.com"/&gt;

The trial was held in the Coconino County Courthouse in September 1900, during which, the wounded Navajo hunter, Haastiin Biwoo Adin, impressed [[Judge]] [[Richard E. Sloan]] with his address so much so that he found all three of the hunters innocent. Reverend Johnston's nine-year-old son, [[Philip Johnston (code talker)|Philip]], translated the Navajo's speech for the court.&lt;ref name="azdailysun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iverson, pg. 71-76"/&gt;

After the trial, a Navajo delegation was sent to [[Washington, D. C.]] to petition the government for the creation of the Leupp Extension. Ultimately, the delegation was successful in convincing [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who issued his executive order on November 14, 1901. The Leupp Extension was named after Roosevelt's commissioner of Indian affairs, [[Bureau of Indian Affairs#Commissioners and Assistant Secretaries|Francis E. Leupp]], and it led to the founding of the town [[Leupp, Arizona|Leupp]]. Also, B'ugoettin rewarded Reverend Johnston by permitting him to build a [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] at Tolchaco, which was located about seven miles south of Leupp.&lt;ref name="azdailysun.com"/&gt;

==Description==
The holiday was originally celebrated on April 19, the actual anniversary of the battles (fought in 1775). Since 1969, it has been observed on the third Monday in April in [[Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cishol/holidx.htm|title=Massachusetts Legal Holidays|work=Citizen Information Service|publisher=Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/bhr/rules_policies/policy_manual/12_5.htm|title=Holidays|work=Human Resources Policy and Practices Manual|publisher=Maine Bureau of Human Resources|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which until the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 was part of Massachusetts).  The Monday holiday creates a three-day [[long weekend]]. It is also the first day of a vacation week for public schools in both states and a school holiday for many local colleges and universities, both public and private.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The day is a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] observance day in [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpi.wi.gov/eis/observe.html|title=Wisconsin Public School Observance Days|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction|accessdate=April 10, 2007|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044215/http://dpi.wi.gov/eis/observe.html|archivedate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Florida law also encourages people to celebrate it, though it is not treated as a public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;§683.14, Fla.

[[File:Isaac Davis Trail March 2012.jpg|thumb|Acton Minutemen and citizens marching from Acton to Concord on Patriots' Day 2012]]
Observances and re-enactments of the battles occur annually at [[Lexington Green]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] (around 6:00 am) and the [[Old North Bridge]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] (around 9:00 am). In the morning, mounted re-enactors with state police escorts retrace the [[Paul Revere#midnight ride|Midnight Rides]] of [[Paul Revere]] and [[William Dawes]], calling out warnings the whole way.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The most significant celebration of Patriots' Day is the [[Boston Marathon]], which has been run every Patriots' Day since April 19, 1897 to mark the then-recently established holiday, with the race linking the [[Athens|Athenian]] and American struggles for liberty&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/the-history-of-the-boston-marathon-a-perfect-way-to-celebrate-patriots-day/275023/|title= The History of the Boston Marathon: A Perfect Way to Celebrate Patriot's Day|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[marathon]]s being so named after the Greek [[Battle of Marathon]]).

==History==
In 1894 the Lexington Historical Society petitioned the Massachusetts State Legislature to proclaim April 19 as "Lexington Day." Concord countered with "Concord Day." Governor [[Frederic T. Greenhalge]] opted for a compromise: Patriots' Day. 
Patriots' Day was first proclaimed in Massachusetts in 1894 by Gov. Greenhalge replacing [[Fast Day]] as a public holiday.&lt;ref name=KenneJourn /&gt;  The idea was introduced to the Governor by the statesman from Lowell, Isaac Henry Paige.  It was established on April 19, commemorating the date of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in 1775, and consolidating the longstanding municipal observances of Lexington Day and Concord Day. It also marked the first bloodshed of the [[American Civil War]] in the [[Baltimore riot of 1861]], during which four members of the Massachusetts militia were slain and 36 injured. The dual commemoration, Greenhalge explained, celebrated "the anniversary of the birth of liberty and union." In 1938, with the generation that had fought in the Civil War largely off the voter rolls, the Massachusetts legislature passed a bill establishing the holiday "in commemoration of the opening events of the War of the Revolution."&lt;ref name=Atlantic /&gt;

Maine followed Massachusetts in 1907 and replaced its Fast Day with Patriot's Day.&lt;ref name=KenneJourn /&gt;
On June 10, 2017, Governor [[Dannel Malloy]] signed a bill establishing Patriots' Day as a statewide unpaid holiday in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Sampson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sampson|first1=Rob|title=Patriots' Day Becomes Official Statewide Holiday!|url=http://www.cthousegop.com/sampson/2017/07/13/84190/|website=State Representative Rob Sampson|accessdate=November 27, 2017|location=Wolcott, Southington, Connecticut|date=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 2018 Connecticut became the 4th state to recognize the holiday.&lt;ref name="Rep-Am"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patrick|first1=Mike|title=Patriots Day Coming to Connecticut|url=https://www.rep-am.com/news/news-local/2017/07/03/patriots-day-coming-to-connecticut/|accessdate=July 4, 2017|publisher=Waterbury Republican-American|date=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kinney|first1=Jim|title=Patriots' Day 2018: What's open, what's closed, details on extended tax deadline, Boston Marathon, MBTA service and more|url=http://www.masslive.com/expo/erry-2018/04/24eb478c406568/patriots_day_2018_whats_open_w.html|accessdate=25 April 2018|agency=Advance Local|publisher=MassLive|date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sporting events==
The [[Boston Marathon]] is run on Patriots' Day every year, since its inception in 1897, even during the [[World War]] years.&lt;ref name=Atlantic /&gt; Therefore, sometimes the holiday is referred to as "Marathon Monday".&lt;ref&gt;[http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/04/17/who-to-watch-on-marathon-monday/ Who To Watch On Marathon Monday]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Boston Red Sox]] have been scheduled to play at home in [[Fenway Park]] on Patriots' Day every year since 1959.  The games were postponed due to weather in 1959, 1961, 1965, 1967, 1984, and 2018, canceled in 1995 because of [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|the late start to the season]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1995.  Boston Red Sox Box Scores|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/1995.shtml|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|accessdate=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not in 2013 due to the [[Boston Marathon bombing]]. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?date=2013-04-15 From 1968 to 2006 the games started early, in the morning, around 11:00 am. The early start to these games usually resulted in the game ending just as the marathon is heading through [[Kenmore Square]]. However, since 2007 the marathon has started between 9:30 am and 10:00 am, resulting in the racers going through Kenmore towards the middle of the Red Sox game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061222&amp;content_id=1766797&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|title=Patriots' Day game may start earlier|publisher=[[Boston Red Sox]]|date=June 19, 2012|accessdate=October 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008221017/http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061222&amp;content_id=1766797&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|archivedate=October 8, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
"There is only one thing I fear in life, my friend... One day the black will swallow the red."&lt;ref name=donmar /&gt;

[[Mark Rothko#Seagram Murals–Four Seasons restaurant commission|Mark Rothko]] is in his New York studio in 1958/59, having been commissioned to paint a group of murals for the expensive and exclusive [[The Four Seasons Restaurant|Four Seasons restaurant]]. He gives orders to his assistant, Ken, as he mixes the paints, makes the frames, and paints the canvases. Ken, however, brashly questions Rothko's theories of art and his acceding to work on such a commercial project. For his part, Rothko dislikes the rise of [[pop art]].

Ultimately, Rothko stops working on the project and decides to return the money. He explains to Ken that the Four Seasons is an inappropriate place for his murals to be seen.

==Reception==
Reviews for the London production were mixed for the play but positive for Molina's performance. [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote: "Alfred Molina, with his large frame and beetling eyebrows, has exactly the fierce intensity of an artist whose paintings were a dynamic battle between [[Apollo and Dionysus]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/dec/09/theatre-review-red-donmar-warehouse "Review: ''Red''"] by [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the Broadway production, [[Michael Kuchwara]] of the [[Associated Press]] wrote: "They are the tantalizing first words of ''Red'', John Logan's engrossing, often enthralling new play about art, an artist and the act of creation." Those first words were "What do you see?" ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that "Alfred Molina is majestic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.didhelikeit.com/shows/red-review.html "''Red'' reviews"], didhelikeit.com, retrieved May 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sha’ar LaMatchil''''' (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] '''שער למתחיל''', ''Gateway for the Beginner''), was a weekly [[Israel]]i newspaper written in easy [[Hebrew]].  Publication has ceased as of April 2012 and it remains unclear if and when the paper will return.

The weekly was founded in 1956 by the "Department for Language Endowment" of the [[Israeli Ministry of Education]]. The newspaper is intended for [[olim]] and other newcomers to Israel who are learning the [[Hebrew Language]], and is also designed for those who are studying Hebrew at an [[ulpan]]. The newspaper addresses many different topics in varying degrees of language complexity. It is written with [[nikud]]ot and a large [[typeface]].

The newspaper is edited in [[Tel Aviv]], and is part of the [[Yediot Ahronot]] publishing group.

== History ==
The newspaper was founded in the 1950s and initially comprised two separate newspapers: "Gateway" and "To Begin." In 1978 the two newspapers were combined under a new name. The newspaper was originally published by the [[Jerusalem Post]] before it was transferred to [[Yedioth Ahronot]]. In 2012 the newspaper was discontinued and is no longer published.

==Digital Edition==

In January 2009, Sha’ar La’Matchil launched an online version.

In addition to written articles, the digital edition contains audio files of selected articles, which are recorded in clear Hebrew to help learners of the language.

'''Silibil N' Brains''' are a [[Scottish hip-hop]] duo consisting of Gavin Bain and Billy Boyd. They are best known for masquerading as American rappers from [[California]] to secure a record deal,&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/meet-the-two-scottish-rappers-who-conned-the-world|title=Meet The Two Scottish Rappers Who Conned The World|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Magazine]]|date=|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a story which formed the basis of Bain's 2010 memoir ''California Schemin&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (later reprinted as ''Straight Outta Scotland'') and was adapted into the documentary film ''[[The Great Hip Hop Hoax]]''.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23047119|title=The great hip hop hoax - How the 'rapping Proclaimers' lived a lie|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=9 September 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 2000s, Bain and Boyd were working together in Scotland, but found that the idea of Scottish rap was not taken seriously in London. After being dismissed as "rapping [[Proclaimers]]" during auditions because of their accents,&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/apr/18/silibil-n-brains-california-schemin|title= Silibil N' Brains: the end of authenticity|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/07/16/128567769/the-fake-american-rappers-who-fooled-everyone|title=The Fake 'American' Rappers Who Fooled Everyone|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/dundee-duo-caught-la-on-the-hop-8527826.html|title=Dundee duo caught LA on the hop|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=10 March 2013|accessdate=14 September 2013|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt; they decided to take on American identities, pretending to be from [[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]] in California. They created the personas of Silibil (Boyd, a play on "silly Bill" and "syllable") and Brains (Bain).

Under their new identity, they were more successful getting attention in London. They moved to the city and secured live work. They rapidly got management with [[Jonathan Shalit]] and later a record deal with [[Sony Music UK]] for two singles and an album. The pair worked on recording material and continued to perform live, including opening for [[D12]], and appearing on [[MTV]]. Their Scottish identity was known only to a small circle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{BBC programmes|b03cxf8y|Storyville - The Great Hip-Hop Hoax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sony's merger and subsequent job losses left them without supporters in the record company and their planned first single was delayed for at least 6 months as the label focused on other acts. Boyd had got married and his wife, still in Scotland, was expecting a child. With work having dried up, he left the group, moving back to Scotland, and getting work in the oil industry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Bain continued performing as Brains on a smaller scale. He subsequently came out and revealed the hoax.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The duo subsequently reunited and released an EP in October 2013 called ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/scots-fake-hip-hop-duo-set-to-launch-first-album-1-3061993|title=Scots fake hip-hop duo set to launch first album|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|date=|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/rap-duo-make-it-after-faking-it.22096846|title=Rap duo make it after faking it|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|date=|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/hub-culture/film/the-scots-rappers-who-fooled-an-industry/0124|title=The Scots rappers who fooled an industry|date=11 October 2013|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Takarabune by Hiroshige.png|thumb|Coloured woodblock print of the ''Takarabune'' by [[Hiroshige|Utagawa Hiroshige]].]]
In [[Japanese folklore]], the '''''Takarabune''''' (宝船) or Treasure Ship is a mythical ship piloted through the heavens by the [[Seven Lucky Gods]] during the first three days of the [[New Year]]. A picture of the ship forms an essential part of traditional [[Japanese people|Japanese]] New Year celebrations.

==The ship==
During the first three days of the New Year the Seven Lucky Gods are said to pilot through the heavens and into human ports a mythical ship called the Takarabune, or Treasure Ship.  The gods carry with them ''takaramono'', or treasure things, including the hat of invisibility (''kakuregasa''), rolls of brocade (''orimono''), the inexhaustible purse (''kanebukuro''), the secret keys to the treasure shed of the gods (''kagi''), the scrolls of books of wisdom and life (''makimono''), the magic mallet (''kozuchi''), the lucky raincoat (''kakuremino''), the robe of fairy feathers (''hagoromo''), and the bag of fortune (''nunobukuro'').&lt;ref name="Chiba"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40117755 |title=The Seven Lucky Gods of Japan |first=Reiko |last=Chiba |date=1966 |publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co |pages=9-10 |oclc=40117755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Woodblock prints==

In the event of an unpleasant dream, the print may be disposed of by tossing it into a river.&lt;ref name="Kiritani"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/777374916 |title=Vanishing Japan: Traditions, Crafts &amp; Culture. |last=Elizabeth |first=Kiritani |date=1995 |publisher=Tuttle Pub |isbn=9781462904273 |location=New York |chapter=Dreams of Revenge |oclc=777374916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of putting a picture under the pillow started around the [[Muromachi period]]. It was initially popular among the nobility, and spread to commoners during the later [[Edo period]]. Street vendors sold cheap woodblock prints, intended for single use.&lt;ref name="Kiritani"/&gt;

Many Takarabune prints show a crane above and a turtle below, representative of longevity and felicity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52086161|title=Handbook of Japanese Mythology|first=Michael|last=Ashkenazi|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=1576074676|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|pages=266|oclc=52086161}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as  a [[palindrome|palindromic]] poem which tells of a long night in a boat.&lt;ref name="Kiritani"/&gt;  On awaking at dawn, everyone hears the sound of waves and sees smooth sailing ahead.&lt;ref name="Kiritani"/&gt;

"'''Tear down this wall!'''" is a line from a speech made by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[West Berlin]] on June 12, 1987, calling for the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], to open up the [[Berlin Wall|barrier]] which had divided West and [[East Berlin]] since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronald Reagan speech, Tear Down This Wall|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/speeches/reagan_berlin.htm|website=USAF Air University|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|Peter Robinson]], the White House speechwriter who drafted the address, said its most famous line was inspired by a conversation with Ingeborg Elz of West Berlin who had mentioned it in a conversation with him.

==Background==
The "tear down this wall" speech was not the first time Reagan had addressed the issue of the [[Berlin Wall]]: in a visit to West Berlin in June 1982, he'd stated "I'd like to ask the Soviet leaders one question [...] Why is the wall there?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UeTcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA764&amp;dq=%22I%27d+like+to+ask+the+Soviet+leaders+one+question%22+%22Why+is+that+wall+there%3F%22 |title=Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Ronald Reagan, 1982 |accessdate=October 27, 2015 |work=Remarks on Arrival in Berlin | date=June 11, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1986, 25 years after the construction of the wall, in response to [[West Germany|West German]] newspaper ''[[Bild|Bild-Zeitung]]'' asking when he thought the wall could be "torn down", Reagan said, "I call upon those responsible to dismantle it [today]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EOfcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1070&amp;dq=%22I+would+like+to+see+the+wall+come+down+today,+and+I+call+upon+those+responsible+to+dismantle+it%22 |title=Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Ronald Reagan, 1986 |accessdate=October 27, 2015 |work=Written Responses to Questions Submitted by Bild-Zeitung of the Federal Republic of Germany | date=August 7, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day before Reagan's 1987 visit, 50,000 people had demonstrated against the presence of the American president in Berlin. During the visit itself, wide swaths of Berlin were closed off to prevent further anti-Reagan protests. The district of [[Kreuzberg]], in particular, was targeted in this respect, with movement throughout this portion of the city in effect restrained completely (for instance the [[U1 (Berlin U-Bahn)|subway line 1]] was shut down).&lt;ref name="Cowboy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/cowboy-und-indianer/867014.html|title=Cowboy und Indianer|date=June 10, 2007|accessdate=January 23, 2015|work=der Tagesspiegel|author=van Bebber, Werner}} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech was also a source of considerable controversy within the Reagan administration itself, with several senior staffers and aides advising against the phrase, saying anything that might cause further East-West tensions or potential embarrassment to Gorbachev, with whom President Reagan had built a good relationship, should be omitted. American officials in [[West Germany]] and presidential [[speechwriter]]s, including [[Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|Peter Robinson]], thought otherwise. Robinson traveled to West Germany to inspect potential speech venues, and gained an overall sense that the majority of West Berliners opposed the wall. Despite getting little support for suggesting Reagan demand the wall's removal, Robinson kept the phrase in the speech text. On May 18, 1987, President Reagan met with his speechwriters and responded to the speech by saying, "I thought it was a good, solid draft." White House Chief of Staff [[Howard Baker]] objected, saying it sounded "extreme" and "unpresidential", and Deputy U.S. National Security Advisor [[Colin Powell]] agreed. Nevertheless, Reagan liked the passage, saying, "I think we'll leave it in."&lt;ref name="Seizing the Moment"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070610/18speeches.htm|last=Walsh|first=Kenneth 2T|date=June 2007|title=Seizing the Moment|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|pages=39–41|accessdate=June 27, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614042154/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070610/18speeches.htm|archivedate=June 14, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief speechwriter [[Anthony Dolan]] gives another account of the line's origins, however, attributing it directly to Reagan.  In an article published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in November 2009, Dolan gives a detailed account of how in an Oval Office meeting that was prior to Robinson's draft Reagan came up with the line on his own.  He records vivid impressions of his own reaction and Robinson's at the time.&lt;ref name= "Four Little Words"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704795604574522163362062796|last=Dolan|first=Anthony|date=November 2009|title=Four Little Words|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a friendly exchange of letters between Robinson and Dolan over their differing accounts, which ''The Wall Street Journal'' published.&lt;ref name= "Robinson Letter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704402404574527764020693266|last=Robinson|first=Peter|date=November 2009|title=Looking Again at Reagan and 'Tear Down This Wall'|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Dolan Letter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704431804574538002351222272|last=Dolan|first=Anthony|date=November 2009|title=Speechwriters' Shouts of Joy in Reagan's Oval Office|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in Berlin on June 12, 1987, President and Mrs. Reagan were taken to the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], where they viewed the wall from a balcony.&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/reagans-famous-tear-down-this-wall-speech-turns-20/a-2584812|title=Ronald Reagan's Famous "Tear Down This Wall" Speech Turns 20|accessdate=November 8, 2014|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan then made his speech at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] at 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm, in front of two panes of [[bulletproof glass]].&lt;ref name="raze"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1F30F930A25755C0A961948260|title=Raze Berlin Wall, Reagan Urges Soviet|author=Boyd, Gerald M.|date=June 13, 1987|accessdate=February 9, 2008|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the spectators were West German President [[Richard von Weizsäcker]], Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], and West Berlin Mayor [[Eberhard Diepgen]].&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

That afternoon, Reagan said,
{{quote|We welcome change and openness; for we believe that freedom and security go together, that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace. There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&lt;ref name="text"/&gt;}}

[[File:Berlin-Memorial to the Victims of the Wall-1982.jpg|thumb|A section of the wall mentioned in the speech.]]
Later on in his speech, President Reagan said, "As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag, that embodiment of German unity, I noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young Berliner, 'This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality.' Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom."&lt;ref name="text"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1987/061287d.htm|title=Remarks on East-West Relations at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin|accessdate=May 29, 2011|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another highlight of the speech was Reagan's call to end the [[arms race]] with his reference to the Soviets' [[RSD-10 Pioneer|SS-20]] nuclear weapons, and the possibility "not merely of limiting the growth of arms, but of eliminating, for the first time, an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth."&lt;ref name="raze"/&gt;

==Response and legacy==

The speech received "relatively little coverage from the media", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine claimed 20 years later.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1631828,00.html |title=20 Years After 'Tear Down This Wall'  |accessdate=February 19, 2008 |work=Time | date=June 11, 2007 | first=Romesh | last=Ratnesar}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John C. Kornblum|John Kornblum]], senior US diplomat in Berlin at the time of Reagan's speech, and US Ambassador to Germany from 1997 to 2001, said "[The speech] wasn't really elevated to its current status until 1989, after the wall came down."&lt;ref name="DW" /&gt; The muted response in the Western media contrasted with the reaction from the East: East German Politburo member [[Günter Schabowski]] considered the speech to be "absurd",&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-06-12-reagan-speech_N.htm |title=Reagan's 'tear down this wall' speech turns 20 |accessdate=February 19, 2008 |work=USA Today | date=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Soviet press agency [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] accused Reagan of giving an "openly provocative, war-mongering speech."&lt;ref name="raze"/&gt; It was Schabowski who two and a half years later, on 9 November 1989, became the person to open the wall by providing a slightly mistaken answer on a press conference about changes in travel regulations for East German citizens.

Former West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] said he would never forget standing near Reagan when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. "He was a stroke of luck for the world, especially for Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-06-07-reagan-world_x.htm|title=Reagan remembered worldwide for his role in ending Cold War division|work=[[USA Today]] |date=June 7, 2004 |author=Jason Keyser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Reagan himself, he recalls the East German police not allowing people to get near the wall, which prevented the citizens from experiencing the speech at all.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; The fact that West German police acted in a similar way has, however seldom, been noted in accounts such as these.&lt;ref name="Cowboy" /&gt;

[[Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|Peter Robinson]], the White House [[speech writer|wordsmith]] who drafted the address, said its most famous line was inspired by a conversation with Ingeborg Elz of West Berlin who had remarked in a conversation with him, "If this man Gorbachev is serious with his talk of ''Glasnost'' and ''perestroika'' he can prove it by getting rid of this wall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2007/summer/berlin.html|first = Peter|last = Robinson|authorlink = Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|publisher = [[National Archives]]|date = Summer 2007|volume = 39|title = 'Tear Down This Wall': How Top Advisers Opposed Reagan's Challenge to Gorbachev&amp;nbsp;– But Lost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of ''Time'' who commented that there is little evidence that the speech had any impact on the decision to tear down the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[The Atlantic]]|date = September 20, 2012 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/lets-please-stop-crediting-ronald-reagan-for-the-fall-of-the-berlin-wall/262647/|title=Let's Please Stop Crediting Ronald Reagan for the Fall of the Berlin Wall|first = Liam | last = Hoare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[James Mann (writer)|James Mann]] disagreed with both critics like Hoare, who saw Reagan's speech as having no real effect, and those who praised the speech as key to shaking Soviet confidence. In a 2007 opinion article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', he put the speech in the context of previous Reagan overtures to the Soviet Union, such as the [[Reykjavík Summit|Reykjavik summit]] of the previous year, which had very nearly resulted in an agreement to eliminate American and Soviet nuclear weapons entirely. He characterized the speech as a way for Reagan to assuage his right-wing critics that he was still tough on communism, while also extending a renewed invitation to Gorbachev to work together to create "the vastly more relaxed climate in which the Soviets sat on their hands when the wall came down." Reagan, claimed Mann, "wasn't trying to land a knockout blow on the Soviet regime, nor was he engaging in mere political theater. He was instead doing something else on that damp day in Berlin 20 years [before Mann's article] – he was helping to set the terms for the end of the cold war."&lt;ref name="nyt-mann"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=James|title=Tear Down That Myth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/opinion/10mann.html|accessdate=May 1, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11200">[[File:TheaterAufDerWiedenFloorplans.png|350px|right|thumb|Floorplan of the ground level and first balcony level, from 1789.  "Klafter" denotes a unit of measure, about 1.9 meters. From the State Archives of Upper Austria in [[Linz]]]]
The '''Theater auf der Wieden''', also called the '''Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden''' or the '''Wiednertheater''', was a theater located in the then-suburban [[Wieden]] district of [[Vienna]] in the late 18th century.  It existed for only 14 years (1787–1801), but during this time it was the venue for the premiere of no fewer than 350 theatrical works,&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 69)&lt;/ref&gt; of which the most celebrated was [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.  During most of this period the director of the theater was [[Emanuel Schikaneder]], remembered today as librettist and impresario of ''The Magic Flute''.

==Origin==

The "Freihaus" was a large complex of businesses and residences belonging to the Starhemberg family.  It was located at the northern edge of the Wiedner suburb, separated from the inner city by the "Glacis", the ring of open land that surrounded inner Vienna for purposes of military defense.

The Freihaus attracted intensive development because by an earlier Imperial decree (1647) it was free from taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 43).  The exemption held good for the Starhembergs, not their tenants; presumably the heavy development of the complex occurred because the untaxed Starhembergs could offer lower rents.&lt;/ref&gt;  The complex was called the "Starhembergische Freihaus" ("free-house of the Starhembergs"), from which was derived the name "Freihaus-Theater".&lt;ref&gt;Buch (2007, ix)&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Rossbach, a theater director who had already been successfully mounting productions in Vienna for several years,&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; made an application to build a new theater in the Freihaus.  This was approved 16 March 1787,&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; and construction began, following a design by the architect Andreas Zach.  The building was completed within six months and was opened for its first performance on 14 October.&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 78)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The theater was a three-story structure having a divided parterre (ground level) and two galleries (balconies).  The external walls and roof were of brick and the interior was of wood.  According to Krzeszowiak the theater had "very good acoustics".&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 81).  Krzeszowiak does not give his source for this description.&lt;/ref&gt; No description of the theater's capacity survives. The dimensions of the theater were 30 by 15 meters;&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz (2008:4).  All page references to Lorenz are from the web-posted version.&lt;/ref&gt; Buch judges that the theater must have held over 500 spectators;&lt;ref&gt;Buch (2007, ix)&lt;/ref&gt; Honolka estimates 800, then 1000 following an expansion carried out by Emanuel Schikaneder.&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990, 76)&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage area was substantial, forming 12 meters of the 30 meter length of the building. Honolka judges that it was "planned from the beginning for opulent scenic design."&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990, 76), also Lorenz (2008:4)&lt;/ref&gt;  Examining the plays and librettos of Emanuel Schikaneder, Buch infers "a mechanical stage with three trap doors, movable flats and backdrops, and devices to accommodate flying machines, storms, sea battles, and similar effects."&lt;ref&gt;Buch (2007, ix)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==

The founding director was Christian Rossbach, who served from October 1787 to March 1788.  Rossbach's venture lasted only a few months and ended in financial failure, despite a dispensation from the Emperor to perform during Lent.  He first tried playing in cheaper venues in Vienna, then left Vienna with half of his troupe to play the provinces in Moravia.&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 83)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossbach was succeeded by Johann Friedel, who ran the productions from March 1788 to his death in March 1789.  Friedel worked in collaboration with his lover Eleonore Schikaneder, the estranged wife of Friedel's  former theatrical colleague Emanuel Schikaneder.  Like Rossbach Friedel was unable to make the theater a success, despite making improvements to the property and mounting as many as nine productions within a period of two weeks; Honolka comments that "they can scarcely have been properly rehearsed."&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990, 76)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Following Friedel's death, Eleonore reconciled with her husband and invited him to take on the directorship,&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990, 59)&lt;/ref&gt; which he held from July 1789 until the theater's closure in June 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 7-8).&lt;/ref&gt;  Schikaneder created a new troupe partly from the participants in Friedel's ensemble, and partly from personnel he brought with him from his former troupe, playing in [[Regensburg]].  The company offered "mostly German operas and plays with songs and incidental music (tragedies, comedies, and spectacles with elaborate stage machinery)".&lt;ref&gt;Buch 1997, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  The company staged [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Abduction from the Seraglio]]'' in April and May 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Buch 1997, 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1789, Schikaneder's company staged a series of fairy tale operas. These included ''[[Der Stein der Weisen]]'' (''The Philosopher's Stone''), a collaboratively written work to which Mozart contributed a small portion of the music (see [[Benedikt Schack]]). The fairy tale series culminated with the premiere in September 1791 of Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.  The latter was a success, and played for over 100 performances in its first year alone, 223 over the life of the theater.&lt;ref&gt;Yates (1995, 19)&lt;/ref&gt; It gave rise to a sequel by Schikaneder and [[Peter von Winter]] (1798) entitled ''[[The Magic Flute Second Part]]''.

The theater continued to be used for opera until 1801,&lt;ref&gt;Grove opera dictionary, "Wieden"&lt;/ref&gt; when Schikaneder moved the troupe to his newly built ''[[Theater an der Wien]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grove opera dictionary, "Vienna"&lt;/ref&gt;  Prince Starhemberg, an efficient businessman, promptly tore down the old theater and replaced it with apartment housing.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz (2008:9)&lt;/ref&gt; The roof tiles were reinstalled on the parish church of [[Perchtoldsdorf]], where they can be seen to this day ([http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:At_perchtoldsdorf02.jpg]).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz (2008:11)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly opinion==
Published opinion concerning the theater has evolved, raising the estimation of the quality of the building and the performances therein. This rise in its estimate has paralleled shifts in Mozart biography, as the field shifts away from the traditional assessment of Mozart's later life as wretched and despairing.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, it was presented as part of Mozart's decline that he was reduced to writing for a grossly inferior theater not affiliated with the court.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the building, testimony from the early Romantic era is preserved in the writings of [[Ignaz von Seyfried]] (1776–1841), who was the musical director of the theater from 1798 to 1801; he continued in this role at the Theater an der Wien until 1826.  In 1840, he wrote a contribution to the ''Neue Zeitschrift für Musik'' (12/46, 5 June 1840) in which he described the ''Theater an der Wieden'' in rather derogatory terms: "... for that limited venue, not much better than a wooden shack [German ''Holzbude''], Mozart composed his immortal Magic Flute".&lt;ref&gt;Buch 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As modern research has shown, this description is entirely false; see in particular Lorenz (2008). Of the legend, Kurt Honolka writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The loss of prestige which Schikaneder suffered at the end of the 19th century also extended to "his" theater. Of course, its simple structure could not measure up to the palatial court or civic "New Renaissance" buildings then being built. But it was of solid stone, with a tiled roof. The interior was made of wood, as was usual at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990:75)&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern notes written for concert programs and recordings often still perpetuate the "shack" legend.&lt;ref&gt;Examples can be viewed on line: [http://www.richmondsymphony.com/events_details.asp?id=205], [http://www.columbiasymphony.org/pdf/Mozart.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional views also asserted that the standard of musical execution in the theater was poor; this for instance is the view taken in [[Hermann Abert]]'s influential Mozart biography. The modern scholar [[David Buch]], who had access to more historical materials than Abert, offers a different assessment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another  myth  about  this  theater  has  also  persisted  in  modern  literature,  namely,  that  the  music  was  of  an  inferior  quality  and  that  the  performances  were  rather  crude. While there is one derisive review of a performance at the Theater auf der Wieden by a north German commentator in 1793, most contemporary reviews were positive, noting a high standard of musical performance. &lt;ref&gt;David J. Buch, "The House Composers of the Theater auf der Wieden in the. Time of Mozart (1789-91)", available on line at [http://www.biu.ac.il/HU/mu/min-ad/06-2/2_House_Comp14-18.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
In his profile of Mike Tyson, Kummer quotes the boxer talking about eating cockroaches with bread in prison in order to get more protein.&lt;ref name="Kniebe" /&gt; Sharon Stone confesses her sexual fantasies to Kummer, and she expresses a desire to "irritate men from wholly different classes of society". In Kummer's profile of Kim Basinger, she reveals that she gave [[Alec Baldwin]] see-through underwear.&lt;ref name="Boyes"/&gt;

Courtney Love describes herself as "depressed, empty, and stupid." She also says, "There are seagulls on the Riviera, slurping ice-cooled gin and tonics," and, "Minotauruses are eating the genitals of the moon."&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;"Too juicy to be true: Journalist with the celebrity scoops made them up", ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'' (Montreal), June 3, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Kummer has Brad Pitt saying, "sometimes, something will be hanging out of my nose for days."&lt;ref name="Koltnow"/&gt; Bruce Willis tells Kummer, "I understood pretty early on that we do not advance through morality, but immorality, vices, cynicism."&lt;ref name="Pidd"&gt;Pidd, Helen. [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/10/journalist-tom-kummer-fake-scoops-film "Journalist who faked celebrity scoops stars in film about his life and lies"], ''[[The Guardian]]''. May 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kummer was fond of injecting references to other writers in his profiles, often by having a celebrity quote an author. He discusses ''[[Neuromancer]]'' with Pamela Anderson. He has Sean Penn quote [[Kierkegaard]] and Mike Tyson quote [[Nietzsche]].&lt;ref name="De Waal"/&gt;

==Discovery==
''[[Marie Claire]]'' sought out Kummer for an interview at the height of his success. He told the magazine that his secret was to demand no less than 45 minutes with his subject.&lt;ref name="Boyes" /&gt; According to [[Katie Roiphe]], "What eventually betrayed [Kummer] was his inability to be banal, his desire to put ideas into people's mouths that they would never actually utter."&lt;ref name="Roiphe"&gt;Roiphe, Katie. "Profiles Encouraged," ''Brill's Content'', December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holger Hoetzel, a journalist with ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' magazine, uncovered Kummer's fraud. Hoetzel was suspicious of Kummer's access to such famous celebrities, and along with many of his foreign correspondent colleagues, he was being hounded by his editors to match Kummer's efforts. One reporter claimed, "Our editors were ringing up and saying, Why can't you go fishing with Bruce Willis, riding with Robert Redford and playing golf with Kevin Costner?"&lt;ref name="Floyd"&gt;Floyd, Chris. "Global Eye," ''[[The Moscow Times]]''. June 3, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kummer's profile of Courtney Love, in particular, struck Hoetzel as too outlandish to be true. "That did it for me. We all know Courtney Love is far out, but this was something else. This woman has been so controlling about all press and all interviews were conducted under extremely restrictive circumstances. And yet this guy seemed to have this incredible access." Hoetzel translated Kummer's profile of Love and sent it to her publicist, which began the cascade of denials from publicists who insisted their clients had never even met Kummer.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt;

One of the chief editors of ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', Christian Kaemmerling, said the paper began to suspect Kummer's work was false in 1999.&lt;ref name="Boyes" /&gt; They also discovered that Kummer had been fired for writing a fabricated story in another paper in 1990.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt; Kammerling and his colleague Ulf Poschardt were both fired for publishing Kummer's hoaxes.&lt;ref name="Meza"&gt;Meza, Ed. "Faker Fired," ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. June 5-11, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Claus Lutterbeck, one of the foreign correspondents who was also being pressured to match Kummer's success, explained how such an elaborate and sustained fraud could happen among the foreign press in Hollywood. "The problem is that no one, not even our bosses, knows how Hollywood really works. They don't know how hard it is to get any access at all. They think we spend our time at cocktail parties with movie stars. So someone like Kummer can come along and they have no control over him."&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Kummer has maintained a largely unapologetic stance about his fraud. He has referred to his work as "montage reporting" from "the school of borderline reporting",&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Martin. ''[[The Express]]''. June 2, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; where his goal was simply to entertain the reader, knowing full well that celebrities would never provide such interesting material.&lt;ref name="Rowbottom" /&gt; He told the ''[[Berner Zeitung]]'', "Interviews are an art form. Only people in Switzerland still believe that they have to be true word for word."&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;Hayes, Dade. "INSIDE MOVES: Facts fetter Swiss journo," ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. May 23, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; ''SZ-Magazin'', the Friday section of [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] where his profiles appeared would frequently feature satirical articles and graphics.&lt;ref name="Boyes" /&gt; Even some of his publishers came to his defense. The ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' went on record as dismissing the celebrity profile genre as "tedious", concluding: "No exclusive interviews blossom behind the hedges of Malibu, and the people who live there are paying a lot of money to make sure things stay that way." In the preface for a 1997 compilation of Kummer's interviews, Ulf Poschardt actually outlines Kummer's [[gonzo journalism]] as a "stylistic honing during the transcription of the tapes", where Kummer "decided to add his authorship into the framework of classical journalism, to inject it with fun and intelligence, taking no prisoners."&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;

Kummer is the subject of a 2011 documentary called ''Bad Boy Kummer'' by [[Miklós Gimes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10965">'''Ziggy''' (ca. 1917&amp;ndash;October 27, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephanttag.org/Professional/AsianElephantStudbook.pdf|title=Asian Elephant North American Regional Studbook|year=2005|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a male [[Indian elephant]] who lived at [[Brookfield Zoo]] outside [[Chicago]] from 1936 to 1975. He weighed about six tons and was over ten feet tall.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Friederici Ross. ''Let the Lions Roar''. Brookfield, Illinois: Chicago Zooological Society, 1997. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; After attacking and nearly killing his keeper in 1941, Ziggy was chained to the wall of an indoor enclosure, and remained there for nearly three decades. His confinement became a [[cause célèbre]] in the late 1960s, when school children and other animal enthusiasts began campaigning for his release. Ziggy was briefly allowed to go outside in 1970, and a year later, the zoo completed a new outdoor facility specifically designed for the elephant. However, Ziggy only enjoyed a few years of freedom before dying in 1975.

==Early years==
Born in [[Asia]], Ziggy was named after [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], who purchased the elephant from [[John Ringling]] in 1920.  Ziegfeld thought the elephant, then a 250-pound youngster, would be a good birthday present for his six-year-old daughter. However, the elephant was sold back to Ringling after the animal reportedly trampled through the Ziegfelds' greenhouse.&lt;ref name=Edward&gt;Edward Baumann. "Brookfield's rebel, Ziggy, dies quietly". ''Chicago Tribune''. October 29, 1975. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; Ringling, in turn, sold the elephant to [[Singer's Midgets|Singer's Midget Circus]]. While touring with Singer's troupe, Ziggy bonded with a dwarf named Charles Becker, who taught the elephant how to dance, play a [[harmonica]], and smoke cigarettes.&lt;ref name= page63&gt;Ross, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the San Diego Exposition Children's Circus in February 1936, Becker fell ill, and Ziggy was paired with a new handler, Johnny Winters. However, the elephant did not respond well to Winters, and fled from the grounds. Ziggy was later found in [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]], and Becker was called from his sickbed to coax the elephant out.&lt;ref&gt;"Midget's whistle brings back Ziggy, runaway elephant". ''Chicago Tribune''. February 22, 1936. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports claimed that Ziggy had killed a trombone player in the midst of his escape, but this was never verified.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sneed. "What ever happened to ???" ''Chicago Tribune''. January 10, 1983. A16.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the circus decided it could no longer keep the elephant, and sold him to Brookfield Zoo. Ziggy arrived at Brookfield in July 1936 and became a popular attraction for visitors.&lt;ref name =page63/&gt;

==Attack on Slim Lewis==
At Brookfield Zoo on April 26, 1941,&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Brown. "Mixed Up Elephant". ''Chicago Tribune''. May 12, 1957. C8.&lt;/ref&gt; Ziggy suddenly turned on his keeper, George "Slim" Lewis. The elephant first struck Lewis to the ground with his trunk and pulled him beneath his head. Ziggy then tried to gore Lewis, but the keeper dodged each attack by slipping between the elephant's tusks. Eventually, Ziggy lunged so hard that his tusks became lodged in the ground for several seconds. Sensing his chance to escape, Lewis pulled himself up by grabbing onto Ziggy's ear, then punched the elephant in the eye. With Ziggy momentarily stunned, Lewis jumped into the moat around the elephant's enclosure and climbed to the other side.&lt;ref name=attack&gt;Ross, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his ordeal, Lewis was an animal lover, and he begged zoo director Robert Bean to spare Ziggy's life. Bean decided that the animal would not be killed, but would be kept inside the Pachyderm House at all times as a safety precaution. Later that day, Lewis returned to Ziggy's yard and, with the help of another elephant, led the animal indoors.&lt;ref name=attack/&gt; For the next few decades, the animal would remain alone in a stall, attached to a wall with a chain of variable length.&lt;ref name=Rogue&gt;Michael Sneed. "Rogue elephant roams no more". ''Chicago Tribune''. March 2, 1969. S15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Lewis explained that Ziggy was in the midst of his [[musth]] period on the day of the attack. Musth is a time of high [[testosterone]] levels in male elephants, leading to aggressive behavior, and Ziggy may have been agitated because keepers had been urging him to mate with a female elephant.&lt;ref&gt;"Pachyderm still chained to wall after 28 years". ''Chicago Tribune''. May 31, 1970. SCL5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign to free Ziggy==
In March 1969, Michael Sneed of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called attention to Ziggy's confinement, writing, "Ziggy's six-foot tusks, which once grew so long they crossed each other, now are decayed and broken. The once frequent majestic blasts from his huge trunk wail very rarely.... Ziggy refuses to face his visitors and turns toward the back wall, swaying back and forth, occasionally picking up stray articles of food thrown at him."&lt;ref name=Rogue/&gt; The article caused a sensation, and Brookfield Zoo was inundated with letters about Ziggy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sneed. "Story brings response; appeals filed for 'Ziggy'". ''Chicago Sun-Times''. March 13, 1969. S3.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Crowcroft, who had recently become the zoo director, announced that he wanted to let Ziggy go outdoors again. However, he explained that the zoo would need to build a new $50,000 facility to accommodate the elephant, something they could not afford at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sneed. "Special zoo fund". ''Chicago Tribune''. March 20, 1969. W1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=money&gt;Michael Sneed. "$4,000 toward new home". ''Chicago Tribune''. June 26, 1969. NA1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, people throughout the Chicago area, particularly schoolchildren, began collecting money for the "Ziggy Fund". Many elementary schools and high schools organized fundraisers, and the [[Bellwood, Illinois|Bellwood]] Boys' Club made a five-foot-tall [[papier-mâché]] statue of Ziggy, which they paraded through the streets while collecting quarters.&lt;ref name=money/&gt; A number of donations also arrived from overseas, including several from American soldiers who had been stationed in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=fortyfour&gt;Ross, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1970, the zoo received a major boost when William Sitwell, president of the Chicagoland [[Buick]]-[[Opel]] Dealers Association, pledged to match the money raised from individual sources.&lt;ref&gt;"Zoo elephant may get new outside area". ''Chicago Tribune''. August 25, 1970. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Brookfield Zoo came closer to its $50,000 target, zoo officials decided they should see how Ziggy would react to being outdoors before building a new facility for the elephant. On September 23, 1970, Ziggy saw the sun for the first time in nearly thirty years when he was allowed to walk through a barricaded portion of his old yard.&lt;ref name=Goodyear&gt;Sara Jane Goodyear. "Ziggy ends 29-year sentence". ''Chicago Tribune''. September 2, 1970. A10.&lt;/ref&gt; Slim Lewis traveled from [[Seattle, Washington]], to escort the elephant outside.&lt;ref name=fortyfour/&gt; Ziggy stood at the doorway for about thirty minutes, then slowly came out and starting eating a bale of hay. After exploring the yard for an hour and a half, Ziggy went back inside.&lt;ref name=Goodyear/&gt;

Ziggy's new outdoor facility was completed during the summer of 1971. Most of the $50,000 was spent on a remote control door, which would allow the elephant to go inside and outside without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt; Ziggy finally entered his new home on August 28, 1971, in front of more than one thousand cheering people.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Jane Goodyear. "At last, sun shines for Ziggy". ''Chicago Tribune''. August 29, 1971. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few months, the zoo added a wading pool to Ziggy's yard and refurbished his indoor stall.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sneed. "Ziggy's winter love gets cold shoulder". ''Chicago Tribune''. December 20, 1972. B13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
The next few years were generally quiet for Ziggy. In March 1975, however, Ziggy fell into the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} moat around his enclosure while trying to poke a zookeeper with his trunk. The elephant survived the fall, but broke a tusk and scraped his head. Workers poured 84,000 pounds (42 tons) of gravel into the moat to give Ziggy a ramp to climb.  The elephant would not move for 31 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=20th Century Chicago|last=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2000|isbn=1-58261-239-0|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when a zookeeper (Leroy Woodruff) opened a nearby door to a female elephant's enclosure, Ziggy decided to pull himself out. Once free, however, he ignored the female elephant and simply went toward his food.&lt;ref&gt;Weldon  Whisler and Barbara Reynolds. "Ziggy free; forgets everything but food". ''Chicago Tribune''. March 25, 1975. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, Ziggy lay down to rest in his indoor stall, rolled onto his side, and died while being bathed by Lewis. Zoo spokespeople said Ziggy had mainly died of old age, explaining that the animal's health had been declining long before he fell into the moat.&lt;ref name=Edward/&gt;

==Legacy==
Ziggy's remains were given to the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Phillips. "Field Museum opens the door on the secrets of nature". ''Chicago Tribune''. September 24, 1982. D1.&lt;/ref&gt; where his bones remain in storage.&lt;ref name=Roadside&gt;{{cite web|title=Ziggy, Elephant with Issues (In Storage)|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/4496|publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Until his skeleton was displayed for the “Specimens” exhibit in early 2017. https://www.fieldmuseum.org/discover/on-exhibit/specimens/

A children's book about Ziggy's life, ''Ziggy: The World's Greatest Elephant'', was released in 1995. It was written by Tom Hollatz and illustrated by Ray Shlemon.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sneed. "Sneedlings". ''Chicago Sun-Times''. May 16, 1995. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Ziggy memorial made from [[obsidian]] with ivory made from Ziggy's tusks can be found at the Lizzadro Museum of Lapidary Art in [[Elmhurst, Illinois]],&lt;ref name=Roadside /&gt; in a [[diorama]] in their permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diorama|url=https://lizzadromuseum.org/diorama/|publisher=Lizzadro Museum of Lapidary Art|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
