'''96''' ('''ninety-six''') is the [[natural number]] following [[95 (number)|95]] and preceding [[97 (number)|97]]. It is a number that, when turned upside down, is still itself. Some other numbers that equal themselves include 69, 0, 88, and in some cases, 1 and 11

==In mathematics==
96 is:

* an [[octagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000567|title=Sloane's A000567 : Octagonal numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a [[semiperfect number]], since it is a multiple of 6.
* an [[abundant number]], since the sum of its divisors is &gt; 96.
* the fourth Granville number and the second non-perfect [[Granville number]]. The next [[Granville number]] is [[126 (number)|126]], the previous being [[24 (number)|24]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8542">{{for|the philosophy of Giovanni Gentile, often called actualism|Actual idealism}}
In contemporary [[analytic philosophy]], '''actualism''' is the view that everything there ''is'' (i.e., everything that has ''being'', in the broadest sense) is actual.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/actualism/ Actualism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plantinga, Alvin]] (1976). "Actualism and Possible Worlds". ''[[Theoria (philosophy journal)|Theoria]]'' 42 (1–3): pp. 139–160. {{doi|10.1111/j.1755-2567.1976.tb00681.x}}. (Reprinted in his compilation ''Essays on the Metaphysics of Modality'', Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Another phrasing of the thesis is that the [[domain of discourse|domain]] of [[Quantifier (logic)#Range of quantification|unrestricted quantification]] ranges over all and only actual existents.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Richard (2011). "The things that aren't actually there". ''[[Philosophical Studies]]'' 152 (2): pp. 155–166. {{doi|10.1007/s11098-009-9443-1}}. {{JSTOR|41487586}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The denial of actualism is '''possibilism'''&lt;!--'Possibilism (philosophy)' redirects here--&gt;&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, the thesis that there are some entities that are ''merely possible'': these entities have being but are not actual and, hence, enjoy a "less robust" sort of being than do actually existing things. An important, but significantly different notion of possibilism known as ''[[modal realism]]'' was developed by the philosopher [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]].&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt; On Lewis's account, the actual world is identified with the physical universe of which we are all a part. Other possible worlds exist in exactly the same sense as the actual world; they are simply spatio-temporally unrelated to our world, and to each other. Hence, for Lewis, "merely possible" entities—entities that exist in other possible worlds—exist in exactly the same sense as do we in the actual world; to be actual, from the perspective of any given individual ''x'' in any possible world, is simply to be part of the same world as ''x''.

==Example==
Consider the statement "[[Sherlock Holmes]] exists." This is a false statement about the world, but is usually accepted as representing a [[possible truth]]. This contingency is usually described by the statement "there is a possible world in which Sherlock Holmes exists". The possibilist argues that apparent existential claims such as this (that "there are" possible worlds of various sorts) ought to be taken more or less at face value: as stating the ''existence'' of two or more worlds, only one of which (at the most) can be the actual one. Hence, they argue, there are innumerably many possible worlds other than our own, which exist just as much as ours does.

Most actualists will be happy to grant the interpretation of "Sherlock Holmes' existence is possible" in terms of possible worlds. But they argue that the possibilist goes wrong in taking this as a sign that there exist other worlds that are just like ours, except for the fact that we are not actually in them. The actualist argues, instead, that when we claim "possible worlds" exist we are making claims that things exist ''in our own actual world'' which can serve as possible worlds for the interpretation of modal claims: that many ''ways the world could be'' (actually) exist, but not that any ''worlds which are those ways'' exist other than the actual world around us.

==Philosophical viewpoints==
From an actualist point of view, such as [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Adams']], [[possible worlds]] are nothing more than fictions created within the [[actual world]]. Possible worlds are mere descriptions of ways this world (the actual one) might have been, and nothing else. Thus, as modal constructions, they come in as a handy heuristic device to use with modal logic; as it helps our modal reasoning to imagine ways the world might have been. Thus, the actualist interpretation of "◊p" sees the modality (i.e., "the way" in which it is true) as being [[De dicto and de re|de dicto]] and not [[logical consequence|entailing]] any [[ontological commitment]].

So, from this point of view, what distinguishes the actual world from other possible worlds is what distinguishes reality from a description of a simulation of reality, this world from Sherlock Holmes': the former exists and is not a product of imagination and the latter does not exist and is a product of the imagination set in a modal construction.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, R.M. (1974). "Theories of Actuality". ''[[Noûs]]'', Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 211–231. {{doi|10.2307/2214751}}. {{JSTOR|2214751}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a modal realist’s point of view, such as [[David Kellogg Lewis|Lewis']], the proposition "◊p" means that p obtains in at least one other, distinct world that is as real as the one we are in. If a state of affairs is possible, then it really obtains, it physically occurs in at least one world. Therefore, as Lewis is happy to admit, there is a world where someone named Sherlock Holmes lived at 221b Baker Street in Victorian times, there is another world where pigs fly, and there is even another world where both Sherlock Holmes exists and pigs fly.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, D. (1986). ''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;

This leaves open the question, of course, of what an actually existing "way the world could be" ''is''; and on this question actualists are divided. One of the most popular solutions is to claim, as [[William Lycan]] and [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] do, that "possible worlds" talk can be reduced to logical relations amongst consistent and maximally complete ''sets of propositions''. "Consistent" here means that none of its propositions contradict one another (if they did, it would not be a ''possible'' description of the world); "maximally complete" means that the set covers ''every'' feature of the world. (More precisely: a set of propositions is "maximally complete" if, for ''any'' meaningful proposition P, P is either an element of the set, or the ''negation'' of an element of the set, or entailed by the conjunction of one or more elements of the set, or the ''negation'' of a proposition entailed by the conjunction of one or more elements of the set). Here the "possible world" which is said to be actual is actual in virtue of ''all'' its elements being ''true'' of the world around us.

Another common actualist account, advanced in different forms by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]] views "possible worlds" not as ''descriptions'' of how the world might be (through a very large set of statements) but rather as a maximally complete ''[[state of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]]'' that covers every ''state of affairs'' which might obtain or not obtain. Here, the "possible world" which is said to be actual is actual in virtue of that state of affairs obtaining in the world around us. (Since it is maximally complete, only ''one'' such state of affairs could actually obtain; all the others would differ from the actual world in various large or small ways.)

==The indexical analysis of actuality==
According to the [[indexical]] conception of actuality, favoured by Lewis (1986), actuality is an attribute which our world has relative to itself, but which all the other worlds have relative to themselves too. Actuality is an intrinsic property of each world, so world ''w'' is actual just at world ''w''. "Actual" is seen as an indexical term, and its reference depends on its context.&lt;ref&gt;Stalnaker, R.C. (1976). "Possible Worlds". ''Noûs'', 10 (1). Symposium Papers to be Read at the Meeting of the Western Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]] in New Orleans, Louisiana, April 29 – May 1, pp. 65–75. {{doi|10.2307/2214477}}. {{JSTOR|2214477}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is no feature of this world (nor of any other) to be distinguished in order to infer that the world is actual, "the actual world" is actual simply in virtue of the definition of "actual": a world is actual ''simpliciter''.

{{about|the Latin phrase|the musical group|Ad Infinitum (band)|the logic fallacy|Ad nauseam}}
'''''Ad infinitum''''' is a [[Latin]] [[List of Latin phrases|phrase]] meaning "to [[infinity]]" or "forevermore".

==Description==
In context, it usually means "continue forever, without limit" and this can be used to describe a non-terminating process, a non-terminating ''repeating'' process, or a set of instructions to be repeated "forever," among other uses. It may also be used in a manner similar to the Latin phrase ''[[et cetera]]'' to denote written words or a concept that continues for a lengthy period beyond what is shown. Examples include:

*"The [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] '''1, 2, 3, ...''' continues ''ad infinitum''."
*"The perimeter of a [[fractal]] may be iteratively drawn ''ad infinitum''."
*The 17th-century writer [[Jonathan Swift]] incorporated the idea of [[self-similarity]] in the following lines from his satirical poem ''On Poetry: a Rhapsody'' (1733):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The vermin only teaze and pinch
Their foes superior by an inch.
So, naturalists observe, a flea
Has smaller fleas that on him prey;
And these have smaller still to bite 'em,
And so proceed ''ad infinitum''.
Thus every poet, in his kind,
Is bit by him that comes behind&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14353/14353-8.txt |title=On Poetry: a Rhapsody |last=Swift |first=Jonathan |year=1733 |access-date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*The mathematician [[Augustus De Morgan]] included similar lines in his rhyme ''[[Siphonaptera (poem)|Siphonaptera]]''.&lt;ref name="Budget"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26408/26408-h/26408-h.htm |title=A Budget of Paradoxes |last=De Morgan |first=Augustus |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=David Eugene |edition=2nd |volume=II |publication-date=1915 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has [[diameter]] 2. Its [[Graph automorphism|automorphism group]] has 120 elements, and is in fact the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_5&lt;/math&gt;.]]

'''Algebraic [[graph theory]]''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] in which [[algebra]]ic methods are applied to problems about [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]]. This is in contrast to [[geometric graph theory|geometric]], [[combinatorics#Graph theory|combinatoric]], or [[algorithmic graph theory|algorithmic]] approaches.  There are three main branches of algebraic graph theory, involving the use of [[linear algebra]], the use of [[group theory]], and the study of [[graph property|graph invariants]].

==Branches of algebraic graph theory==
=== Using linear algebra ===
The first branch of algebraic graph theory involves the study of graphs in connection with [[linear algebra]]. Especially, it studies the [[Eigendecomposition of a matrix|spectrum]] of the [[adjacency matrix]], or the [[Laplacian matrix]] of a graph (this part of algebraic graph theory is also called [[spectral graph theory]]).  For the [[Petersen graph]], for example, the spectrum of the adjacency matrix is (−2,&amp;nbsp;−2,&amp;nbsp;−2,&amp;nbsp;−2,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;3). Several theorems relate properties of the spectrum to other [[graph property|graph properties]].  As a simple example, a [[connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] graph with [[Distance (graph theory)|diameter]] ''D'' will have at least ''D''+1 distinct values in its spectrum.&lt;ref name="biggs"&gt;{{Citation | author=Biggs, Norman | title=Algebraic Graph Theory | edition=2nd | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-521-45897-8 | postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algebraic connectivity|Aspects]] of graph spectra have been used in analysing the [[synchronizability]] of [[Network theory|networks]].

===Using group theory===
{{Graph families defined by their automorphisms}}
The second branch of algebraic graph theory involves the study of graphs in connection to [[group theory]], particularly [[Graph automorphism|automorphism groups]] and [[geometric group theory]]. The focus is placed on various families of graphs based on [[symmetry]] (such as [[symmetric graph]]s, [[vertex-transitive graph]]s, [[edge-transitive graph]]s, [[distance-transitive graph]]s, [[distance-regular graph]]s, and [[strongly regular graph]]s), and on the inclusion relationships between these families. Certain of such categories of graphs are sparse enough that [[Foster census|lists]] of graphs can be drawn up. By [[Frucht's theorem]], all [[group (mathematics)|groups]] can be represented as the automorphism group of a connected graph (indeed, of a [[cubic graph]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Frucht]]. Graphs of Degree 3 with given abstract group, Can. J. Math. 3 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Another connection with group theory is that, given any group, symmetrical graphs known as [[Cayley graph]]s can be generated, and these have properties related to the structure of the group.&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt;

[[Image:TruncatedTetrahedron.gif|thumb|left|220px|A [[Cayley graph]] for the [[alternating group]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, forming a [[truncated tetrahedron]] in three dimensions.  All Cayley graphs are [[vertex-transitive graph|vertex-transitive]], but some vertex-transitive graphs (like the [[Petersen graph]]) are not Cayley graphs.]]

[[Image:Petersen graph 3-coloring.svg|thumb|right|200px|A proper vertex coloring of the [[Petersen graph]] with 3 colors, the minimum number possible.  According to the [[chromatic polynomial]], there are 120 such colorings with 3 colors.]]

This second branch of algebraic graph theory is related to the first, since the symmetry properties of a graph are reflected in its spectrum. In particular, the spectrum of a highly symmetrical graph, such as the Petersen graph, has few distinct values&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt; (the Petersen graph has 3, which is the minimum possible, given its diameter). For Cayley graphs, the spectrum can be related directly to the structure of the group, in particular to its [[character theory|irreducible characters]].&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="babai"&gt;*{{Citation | first = L | last = Babai | editor-last = Graham | editor-first = R | editor2-last = Grötschel | editor2-first = M | editor2-link = Martin Grötschel | editor3-last = Lovász | editor3-first = L | title = Handbook of Combinatorics | contribution = Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction | contribution-url = http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-94-10.ps | year = 1996 | publisher = Elsevier | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studying graph invariants===
Finally, the third branch of algebraic graph theory concerns algebraic properties of [[graph property|invariants]] of graphs, and especially the [[chromatic polynomial]], the [[Tutte polynomial]] and [[knot invariant]]s. The chromatic polynomial of a graph, for example, counts the number of its proper [[vertex coloring]]s.  For the Petersen graph, this polynomial is &lt;math&gt;t(t-1)(t-2)(t^7-12t^6+67t^5-230t^4+529t^3-814t^2+775t-352)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt; In particular, this means that the Petersen graph cannot be properly colored with one or two colors, but can be colored in 120 different ways with 3 colors.  Much work in this area of algebraic graph theory was motivated by attempts to prove the [[four color theorem]]. However, there are still many [[Graph coloring#Open problems|open problems]], such as characterizing graphs which have the same chromatic polynomial, and determining which polynomials are chromatic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4137">The '''analytic element method''' ('''AEM''') is a [[numerical analysis|numerical]] method used for the solution of [[partial differential equation]]s. It was initially developed by O.D.L. Strack at the [[University of Minnesota]]. It is similar in nature to the [[boundary element method]] (BEM), as it does not rely upon discretization of volumes or areas in the modeled system; only internal and external boundaries are discretized. One of the primary distinctions between AEM and BEMs is that the boundary integrals are calculated analytically. 

The analytic element method has been applied to problems of [[Groundwater flow equation|groundwater flow]] governed by a variety of linear partial differential equations including the [[Laplace equation|Laplace]], the [[Poisson equation]], the modified Helmholtz equation, the [[heat equation]], and the [[Biharmonic equation|biharmonic]] equations. 

The basic premise of the analytic element method is that, for [[linear differential equation]]s, elementary solutions may be superimposed to obtain more complex solutions. A suite of 2D and 3D analytic solutions ("elements") are available for different governing equations. These elements typically correspond to a discontinuity in the dependent variable or its gradient along a geometric boundary (e.g., point, line, ellipse, circle, sphere, etc.). This discontinuity has a specific functional form (usually a polynomial in 2D) and may be manipulated to satisfy Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin (mixed) boundary conditions. Each analytic solution is infinite in space and/or time. In addition, each analytic solution contains degrees of freedom (coefficients) that may be calculated to meet prescribed boundary conditions along the element's border. To obtain a global solution (i.e., the correct element coefficients), a system of equations is solved such that the boundary conditions are satisfied along all of the elements (using [[collocation method|collocation]], [[least squares|least-squares minimization]], or a similar approach). Notably, the global solution provides a spatially continuous description of the dependent variable everywhere in the infinite domain, and the governing equation is satisfied everywhere exactly except along the border of the element, where the governing equation is not strictly applicable due to the discontinuity.

The ability to superpose numerous elements in a single solution means that analytical solutions can be realized for arbitrarily complex boundary conditions.  That is, models that have complex geometries, straight or curved boundaries, multiple boundaries, transient boundary conditions, multiple aquifer layers, piecewise varying properties and continuously varying properties can be solved.  Elements can be implemented using far-field expansions such that model containing many thousands of elements can be solved efficiently to high precision.

A contemporary student of Strack's who is a proponent of the Analytic Element Method (AEM) in groundwater modeling applications is Dr. David Steward of Kansas State University.

[[Information]] is that which reduces uncertainty, wholly or in part.
Similarly, anti-information is that which increases uncertainty.
It is negative information.

[[Noise_(signal_processing)|Noise]] on a [[Noisy-channel coding theorem|noisy communication channel]] is an example of anti-information.
According to [[Shannon–Hartley theorem|Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem]]
the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the noise must be subtracted to obtain the [[channel capacity]]
that remains available for reliable communication.

The [[gambling]] industry has made a business out of selling anti-information.
People are willing to pay for anti-information.
The increase in uncertainty enables them to savor the information that they subsequently receive
when the uncertainty is finally resolved.

The term anti-information was introduced by [[Jacobus Verhoeff|Koos Verhoeff]] in the 1970s
while teaching [[informatics]] at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]].

In [[complex analysis]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''antiderivative''', or '''primitive''', of a [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''g'' is a function whose [[complex derivative]] is ''g''. More precisely, given an [[open set]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane and a function &lt;math&gt;g:U\to \mathbb C,&lt;/math&gt; the antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a function &lt;math&gt;f:U\to \mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dz}=g&lt;/math&gt;.

As such, this concept is the complex-variable version of the [[antiderivative]] of a [[real number|real]]-valued function.

==Uniqueness==

The derivative of a constant function is the zero function. Therefore, any constant function is an antiderivative of the zero function. If &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a [[connected set]], then the constant functions are the only antiderivatives of the zero function. Otherwise, a function is an antiderivative of the zero function if and only if it is constant on each [[connected set|connected component]] of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (those constants need not be equal).

This observation implies that if a function &lt;math&gt;g:U\to \mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; has an antiderivative, then that antiderivative is unique [[up to]] addition of a function which is constant on each connected component of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

==Existence==
One can characterize the existence of antiderivatives via path integrals in the complex plane, much like the case of functions of a real variable. Perhaps not surprisingly, ''g'' has an antiderivative ''f'' if and only if, for every γ path from ''a'' to ''b'', the path integral 

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma} g(\zeta) \, d \zeta = f(b) - f(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, 

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\gamma} g(\zeta) \, d \zeta = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

for any closed path γ.   

However, this formal similarity notwithstanding, possessing a complex-antiderivative is a much more restrictive condition than its real counterpart. While it is possible for a discontinuous real function to have an anti-derivative, anti-derivatives can fail to exist even for [[holomorphic function|''holomorphic'' functions]] of a complex variable. For example, consider the reciprocal function, ''g''(''z'') = 1/''z'' which is holomorphic on the punctured plane '''C'''\{0}. A direct calculation shows that the integral of ''g'' along any circle enclosing the origin is non-zero. So ''g'' fails the condition cited above. This is similar to the existence of potential functions for [[conservative vector field]]s, in that [[Green's theorem]] is only able to guarantee path independence when the function in question is defined on a ''simply connected'' region, as in the case of the [[Cauchy integral theorem]].

In fact, holomorphy is characterized by having an antiderivative ''locally'', that is, ''g'' is holomorphic if for every ''z'' in its domain, there is some neighborhood ''U'' of ''z'' such that ''g'' has an antiderivative on ''U''. Furthermore, holomorphy is a necessary condition for a function to have an antiderivative, since the derivative of any holomorphic function is holomorphic.

Various versions of [[Cauchy integral theorem]], an underpinning result of Cauchy function theory, which makes heavy use of path integrals, gives sufficient conditions under which, for a holomorphic ''g'', 

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\gamma} g(\zeta) \, d \zeta&lt;/math&gt;

vanishes for any closed path γ (which may be, for instance, that the domain of ''g'' be simply connected or star-convex).

===Necessity===
First we show that if ''f'' is an antiderivative of ''g'' on ''U'', then ''g'' has the path integral property given above. Given any piecewise [[smooth function|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[path (topology)|path]] γ : [''a'', ''b''] → ''U'', one can express the [[line integral|path integral]] of ''g'' over γ as 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma g(z)\,dz=\int_a^b g(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t)\, dt=\int_a^b f'(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[chain rule]] and the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] one then has

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma g(z)\,dz=\int_a^b \frac{d}{dt}f\left(\gamma(t)\right)\,dt=f\left(\gamma(b)\right)-f\left(\gamma(a)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the integral of ''g'' over γ does ''not'' depend on the actual path γ, but only on its endpoints, which is what we wanted to show.

===Sufficiency===
Next we show that if  ''g'' is holomorphic, and the integral of ''g'' over any path depends only on the endpoints, then ''g'' has an antiderivative. We will do so by finding an anti-derivative explicitly.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that the domain ''U'' of ''g'' is connected, as otherwise one can prove the existence of an antiderivative on each connected component. With this assumption, fix a point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''U'' and for any ''z'' in ''U'' define the function

: &lt;math&gt;f(z)=\int_{\gamma}\! g(\zeta)\, d\zeta&lt;/math&gt;

where γ is any path joining ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''z''. Such a path exists since ''U'' is assumed to be an open connected set. The function ''f'' is well-defined because the integral depends only on the endpoints of γ. 

That this ''f'' is an antiderivative of ''g'' can be argued in the same way as the real case. We have, for a given ''z'' in ''U'',

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\left| \frac{f(w) - f(z)}{ w-z } - g(z) \right|&amp;= \left|  \int_z^w \frac{ g(\zeta) \,d\zeta}{w -z} - \int_z^w \frac{ g(z) \,d\zeta}{w -z} \right|\\
&amp;\leq \int_z^w \frac{ | g(\zeta) - g (z) |}{|w -z|} \,d\zeta \\
&amp;\leq \sup_{ \zeta \in [w, z]} | g(\zeta) - g(z) |,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where [''z'', ''w''] denotes the line segment between ''z'' and ''w''. By continuity of ''g'', the final expression goes to zero as ''w'' approaches ''z''. In other words, ''f′'' = ''g''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14107">In [[mathematics]], the '''Chern–Weil homomorphism''' is a basic construction in '''Chern–Weil theory''' that computes [[topology|topological]] invariants of [[vector bundle]]s and [[principal bundle]]s on a [[smooth manifold]] ''M'' in terms of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]] and [[curvature]] representing classes in the [[de Rham cohomology]] rings of ''M''. That is, the theory forms a bridge between the areas of [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential geometry]]. It was developed in the late 1940s by [[Shiing-Shen Chern]] and [[André Weil]], in the wake of proofs of the [[generalized Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]. This theory was an important step in the theory of [[characteristic class]]es.

Let ''G'' be a real or complex [[Lie group]] with [[Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak g]&lt;/math&gt; denote the algebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;-valued [[Polynomials on vector spaces|polynomial]]s on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; (exactly the same argument works if we used &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.) Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak g]^G&lt;/math&gt; be the [[fixed-point subring|subalgebra of fixed points]] in  &lt;math&gt; \mathbb C[\mathfrak g]&lt;/math&gt; under the [[adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint action]] of ''G''; that is, it consists of all polynomials ''f'' such that for any ''g'' in ''G'' and ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(\operatorname{Ad}_g x) = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Given [[principal bundle|principal G-bundle]] ''P'' on ''M'', there is an associated 
homomorphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;-algebras
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb C[\mathfrak g]^{G} \to H^*(M; \mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt;
called the '''Chern–Weil homomorphism''',
where on the right cohomology is [[de Rham cohomology]].   This homomorphism is obtained by taking invariant polynomials in the curvature of any connection on the given bundle.  If ''G'' is either compact  or semi-simple, 
then  the cohomology ring of the [[classifying space]] for ''G''-bundles ''BG'' is isomorphic to the algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C[\mathfrak g]^{G}&lt;/math&gt; of invariant polynomials:
:&lt;math&gt;H^*(BG; \mathbb{C}) \cong \mathbb C[\mathfrak g]^{G}.&lt;/math&gt;
(The cohomology ring of ''BG'' can still be given in the de Rham sense:
:&lt;math&gt;H^k(BG; \mathbb{C}) = \varinjlim \operatorname{ker} (d: \Omega^k(B_jG) \to \Omega^{k+1}(B_jG))/\operatorname{im} d.&lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;BG = \varinjlim B_jG&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_jG&lt;/math&gt; are manifolds.)

==Definition of the homomorphism==
Choose any [[connection form]] ω in ''P'', and let Ω be the associated [[curvature]] 2-form; i.e., Ω = ''D''ω, the [[exterior covariant derivative]] of ω. If &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathbb C[\mathfrak g]^G&lt;/math&gt; is a homogeneous polynomial function of degree&amp;nbsp;''k''; i.e., &lt;math&gt;f(a x) = a^k f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any complex number ''a'' and ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;, then, viewing ''f'' as a symmetric multilinear functional on &lt;math&gt;\prod_1^k \mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; (see the [[ring of polynomial functions]]), let
:&lt;math&gt;f(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;
be the (scalar-valued) 2''k''-form on ''P'' given by
:&lt;math&gt;f(\Omega)(v_1,\dots,v_{2k})=\frac{1}{(2k)!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak S_{2k}}\epsilon_\sigma f(\Omega(v_{\sigma(1)},v_{\sigma(2)}),\dots,\Omega(v_{\sigma(2k-1)}, v_{\sigma(2k)}))&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are tangent vectors to ''P'', &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the sign of the permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in the symmetric group on 2''k'' numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak S_{2k}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Lie algebra-valued forms#Operations]] as well as [[Pfaffian]]).

If, moreover, ''f'' is invariant; i.e., &lt;math&gt;f(\operatorname{Ad}_g x) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then one can show that &lt;math&gt;f(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed form]], it descends to a unique form on ''M'' and that the [[de Rham cohomology]] class of the form is independent of ''ω''. First, that &lt;math&gt;f(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a closed form follows from the next two lemmas:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi-Nomizu|1969|loc=Ch. XII.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Lemma 1: The form &lt;math&gt;f(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; on ''P'' descends to a (unique) form &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; on ''M''; i.e., there is a form on ''M'' that pulls-back to &lt;math&gt;f(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;.
:Lemma 2: If a form φ on ''P'' descends to a form on ''M'', then dφ = Dφ.

Indeed, [[Bianchi's second identity]] says &lt;math&gt;D \Omega = 0&lt;/math&gt; and, since ''D'' is a graded derivation, &lt;math&gt;D f(\Omega) = 0.&lt;/math&gt; Finally, Lemma 1 says &lt;math&gt;f(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 2.

To see Lemma 2, let &lt;math&gt;\pi: P \to M&lt;/math&gt; be the projection and ''h'' be the projection of &lt;math&gt;T_u P&lt;/math&gt; onto the horizontal subspace. Then Lemma 2 is a consequence of the fact that &lt;math&gt;d \pi(h v) = d \pi(v)&lt;/math&gt; (the kernel of &lt;math&gt;d \pi&lt;/math&gt; is precisely the vertical subspace.) As for Lemma 1, first note
:&lt;math&gt;f(\Omega)(d R_g(v_1), \dots, d R_g(v_{2k})) = f(\Omega)(v_1, \dots, v_{2k}), \, R_g(u) = ug;&lt;/math&gt;
which is because &lt;math&gt;R_g^* \Omega = \operatorname{Ad}_{g^{-1}} \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and ''f'' is invariant. Thus, one can define &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{f}(\Omega)(\overline{v_1}, \dots, \overline{v_{2k}}) = f(\Omega)(v_1, \dots, v_{2k})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; are any lifts of &lt;math&gt;\overline{v_i}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;d \pi(v_i) = \overline{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Next, we show that the de Rham cohomology class of &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; on ''M'' is independent of a choice of connection.&lt;ref&gt;The argument for the independent of a choice of connection here is taken from: Akhil Mathew, Notes on Kodaira vanishing {{cite web|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/~amathew/kodaira.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217025038/https://math.berkeley.edu/~amathew/kodaira.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}. Kobayashi-Nomizu, the main reference, gives a more concrete argument.&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\omega_0, \omega_1&lt;/math&gt; be arbitrary connection forms on ''P'' and let &lt;math&gt;p: P \times \mathbb{R} \to P&lt;/math&gt; be the projection. Put
:&lt;math&gt;\omega' = t \, p^* \omega_1 + (1 - t) \, p^* \omega_0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''t'' is a smooth function on &lt;math&gt;P \times \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;(x, s) \mapsto s&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega', \Omega_0, \Omega_1&lt;/math&gt; be the curvature forms of &lt;math&gt;\omega', \omega_0, \omega_1&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;i_s: M \to M \times \mathbb{R}, \, x \mapsto (x, s)&lt;/math&gt; be the inclusions. Then &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; is homotopic to &lt;math&gt;i_1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;i_0^* \overline{f}(\Omega')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i_1^* \overline{f}(\Omega')&lt;/math&gt; belong to the same de Rham cohomology class by the [[homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology]]. Finally, by naturality and by uniqueness of descending,
:&lt;math&gt;i_0^* \overline{f}(\Omega') = \overline{f}(\Omega_0)&lt;/math&gt;
and the same for &lt;math&gt;\Omega_1&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}(\Omega_0), \overline{f}(\Omega_1)&lt;/math&gt; belong to the same cohomology class.

The construction thus gives the linear map: (cf. Lemma 1)
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb C[\mathfrak g]^{G}_k \rightarrow H^{2k}(M; \mathbb C), \, f \mapsto \left[\overline{f}(\Omega)\right].&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, one can check that the map thus obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb C[\mathfrak g]^{G} \rightarrow H^*(M; \mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt;
is an [[algebra homomorphism]].

== Example: Chern classes and Chern character ==
Let &lt;math&gt;G = GL_n(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; its Lie algebra. For each ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, we can consider its [[characteristic polynomial]] in ''t'':
:&lt;math&gt;\det \left( I - t{x \over 2 \pi i} \right) = \sum_{k=0}^n f_k(x) t^k,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editorial note: This definition is consistent with the reference except we have ''t'', which is ''t'' &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; there. Our choice seems more standard and is consistent with our "[[Chern class]]" article.&lt;/ref&gt;
where ''i'' is the square root of -1. Then &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; are invariant polynomials on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, since the left-hand side of the equation is. The ''k''-th [[Chern class]] of a smooth complex-vector bundle ''E'' of rank ''n'' on a manifold ''M'':
:&lt;math&gt;c_k(E) \in H^{2k}(M, \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;
is given as the image of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; under the Chern–Weil homomorphism defined by ''E'' (or more precisely the frame bundle of ''E''). If ''t'' = 1, then &lt;math&gt;\det \left(I - {x \over 2 \pi i} \right) = 1 + f_1(x) + \cdots + f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; is an invariant polynomial. The [[total Chern class]] of ''E'' is the image of this polynomial; that is,
:&lt;math&gt;c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + \cdots + c_n(E).&lt;/math&gt;

Directly from the definition, one can show ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c'' given above satisfy the axioms of Chern classes. For example, for the Whitney sum formula, we consider
:&lt;math&gt;c_t(E) = [\det \left( I - t {\Omega / 2 \pi i} \right)]&lt;/math&gt;
where we wrote Ω for the [[curvature form|curvature 2-form]] on ''M'' of the vector bundle ''E'' (so it is the descendent of the curvature form on the frame bundle of ''E''). The Chern–Weil homomorphism is the same if one uses this Ω. Now, suppose ''E'' is a direct sum of vector bundles ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s and Ω&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the curvature form of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; so that, in the matrix term, Ω is the block diagonal matrix with Ω&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;'s on the diagonal. Then, since &lt;math&gt;\det(I - t\Omega/2\pi i) = \det(I - t\Omega_1/2\pi i) \wedge \dots \wedge \det(I - t\Omega_m/2\pi i)&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;c_t(E) = c_t(E_1) \cdots c_t(E_m)&lt;/math&gt;
where on the right the multiplication is that of a cohomology ring: [[cup product]]. For the normalization property, one computes the first Chern class of the [[complex projective line]]; see [[Chern class#Example: the complex tangent bundle of the Riemann sphere]].

Since &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{E \otimes E'} = \Omega_E \otimes I_{E'} + I_{E} \otimes \Omega_{E'}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Proof: By definition, &lt;math&gt;\nabla^{E \otimes E'}(s \otimes s') = \nabla^{E} s \otimes s' + s \otimes\nabla^{E'} s'&lt;/math&gt;. Now compute the square of &lt;math&gt;\nabla^{E \otimes E'}&lt;/math&gt; using Leibniz's rule.&lt;/ref&gt; we also have:
:&lt;math&gt;c_1(E \otimes E') = c_1(E) \operatorname{rk}(E') + \operatorname{rk}(E) c_1(E').&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the [[Chern character]] of ''E'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}(E) = [\operatorname{tr}(e^{-\Omega/2\pi i})] \in H^*(M, \mathbb{Q})&lt;/math&gt;
where Ω is the curvature form of some connection on ''E'' (since Ω is nilpotent, it is a polynomial in Ω.) Then ch is a [[ring homomorphism]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}(E \oplus F) = \operatorname{ch}(E) + \operatorname{ch}(F), \, \operatorname{ch}(E \otimes F) = \operatorname{ch}(E) \operatorname{ch}(F).&lt;/math&gt;
Now suppose, in some ring ''R'' containing the cohomology ring ''H''(''M'', '''C'''), there is the factorization of the polynomial in ''t'':
:&lt;math&gt;c_t(E) = \prod_{j=0}^n (1 + \lambda_j t)&lt;/math&gt;
where λ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are in ''R'' (they are sometimes called Chern roots.) Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}(E) = e^{\lambda_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example: Pontrjagin classes ==
If ''E'' is a smooth real vector bundle on a manifold ''M'', then the ''k''-th [[Pontrjagin class]] of ''E'' is given as:
:&lt;math&gt;p_k(E) = (-1)^k c_{2k}(E \otimes \mathbb{C}) \in H^{4k}(M; \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;
where we wrote &lt;math&gt;E \otimes \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; for the [[complex vector bundle|complexification]] of ''E''. Equivalently, it is the image under the Chern–Weil homomorphism of the invariant polynomial &lt;math&gt;g_{2k}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{det}\left(I - t {x \over 2 \pi}\right) = \sum_{k = 0}^n g_k(x) t^k.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- mention Euler class --&gt;

== The homomorphism for holomorphic vector bundles ==
Let ''E'' be a [[holomorphic vector bundle|holomorphic (complex-)vector bundle]] on a complex manifold ''M''. The curvature form Ω of ''E'', with respect to some hermitian metric, is not just a 2-form, but is in fact a (1, 1)-form (see [[holomorphic vector bundle#Hermitian metrics on a holomorphic vector bundle]]). Hence, the Chern–Weil homomorphism assumes the form: with &lt;math&gt;G = GL_n(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]_k \to H^{k, k}(M; \mathbb{C}), f \mapsto [f(\Omega)].&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1624">In [[quantum information science]], a '''classical information channel''' (often called simply '''classical channel''') is a [[communication channel]] that can be used to transmit [[classical information]] (as opposed to [[quantum channel]] which can transmit [[quantum information]]). An example would be a light travelling over fiber optics lines or electricity travelling over phone lines.

Although classical channels cannot transmit quantum information by themselves, they can be useful in combination with quantum channels. Examples of their use are:
* In [[quantum teleportation]], a classical channel together with a previously prepared [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] quantum state are used to transmit quantum information between two parties. Neither the classical channel nor the previously prepared quantum state alone can do this task. 
* In [[quantum cryptography]], a classical channel is used along with a quantum channel in protocols for quantum key exchange. 
* In [[quantum communication]], the information rate of a noisy quantum channel can be increased when used together with a noise-free classical channel. In particular, some very noisy quantum channels cannot transmit quantum information if used alone but can transmit it if used together with a classical channel (which is not capable of transmitting quantum information by itself).

A '''correlation swap''' is an [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] [[financial derivative]] that allows one to [[speculate]] on or [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] [[risks]] associated with the observed average [[correlation]], of a collection of [[underlying]] products, where each product has periodically observable prices, as with a [[commodity]],  [[exchange rate]], [[interest rate]], or [[stock index]].

== Payoff Definition ==
The fixed leg of a correlation swap pays the notional &lt;math&gt;N_{\text{corr}}&lt;/math&gt; times the agreed strike &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\text{strike}}&lt;/math&gt;, while the floating leg pays the realized correlation &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\text{realized }}&lt;/math&gt;.  The contract value at expiration from the pay-fixed perspective is therefore 
:&lt;math&gt;N_{\text{corr}} (\rho_{\text{realized}}-\rho_{\text{strike}})&lt;/math&gt;

Given a set of nonnegative weights &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; securities, the realized correlation is defined as the weighted average of all pairwise correlation coefficients &lt;math&gt;\rho_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{\text{realized }} := \frac{\sum_{i\neq j}{w_i w_j \rho_{i,j}}}{\sum_{i\neq j}{w_i w_j}}&lt;/math&gt;
Typically &lt;math&gt;\rho_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; would be calculated as the [[Pearson correlation coefficient]] between the daily log-returns of assets ''i'' and ''j'', possibly under zero-mean assumption.

Most correlation swaps trade using equal weights, in which case the realized correlation formula simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{\text{realized }} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i &gt; j}{\rho_{i,j}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Pricing and valuation==
No industry-standard models yet exist that have stochastic correlation and are [[arbitrage]]-free.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57043">A '''divisibility rule''' is a shorthand way of determining whether a given [[integer]] is divisible by a fixed [[divisor]] without performing the division, usually by examining its digits.  Although there are divisibility tests for numbers in any [[radix]], or base, and they are all different, this article presents rules and examples only for [[decimal]], or base 10, numbers.  [[Martin Gardner]] explained and popularized these rules in his September 1962 [[Mathematical Games column|"Mathematical Games" column]] in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Martin |title=Mathematical Games: Tests that show whether a large number can be divided by a number from 2 to 12 |journal=Scientific American |date=September 1962 |volume=207 |issue=3 |pages=232-246 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24936675|jstor=24936675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisibility rules for numbers 1–30==
The rules given below transform a given number into a generally smaller number, while preserving divisibility by the divisor of interest.  Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the resulting number should be evaluated for divisibility by the same divisor.  In some cases the process can be iterated until the divisibility is obvious; for others (such as examining the last ''n'' digits) the result must be examined by other means.

For divisors with multiple rules, the rules are generally ordered first for those appropriate for numbers with many digits, then those useful for numbers with fewer digits.

Note: To test divisibility by any number that can be expressed as 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or 5&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, in which ''n'' is a positive integer, just examine the last ''n'' digits.

Note: To test divisibility by any number expressed as the product of prime factors &lt;math&gt;p_1^n p_2^m p_3^q&lt;/math&gt;, we can separately test for divisibility by each prime to its appropriate power. For example, testing divisibility by 24 (24 = 8*3 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;*3) is equivalent to testing divisibility by 8 (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and 3 simultaneously, thus we need only show divisibility by 8 and by 3 to prove divisibility by 24.

==Step-by-step examples==

===Divisibility by 2===
First, take any number (for this example it will be 376) and note the last digit in the number, discarding the other digits. Then take that digit (6) while ignoring the rest of the number and determine if it is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then the original number is divisible by 2.

'''Example'''
# 376 (The original number)
# &lt;s&gt;37&lt;/s&gt; &lt;u&gt;6&lt;/u&gt; (Take the last digit)
# 6 ÷ 2 = 3 (Check to see if the last digit is divisible by 2)
# 376 ÷ 2 = 188 (If the last digit is divisible by 2, then the whole number is divisible by 2)

===Divisibility by 3 or 9===
First, take any number (for this example it will be 492) and add together each digit in the number (4 + 9 + 2 = 15). Then take that sum (15) and determine if it is divisible by 3. The original number is divisible by 3 (or 9) if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 (or 9).

If a number is a multiplication of 3 consecutive numbers then that number is always divisible by 3. This is useful for when the number takes the form of (''n'' × (''n'' − 1) × (''n'' + 1))

'''Ex.'''
# 492 (The original number)
# 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 (Add each individual digit together)
# 15 is divisible by 3 at which point we can stop. Alternatively we can continue using the same method if the number is still too large:
# 1 + 5 = 6 (Add each individual digit together)
# 6 ÷ 3 = 2 (Check to see if the number received is divisible by 3)
# 492 ÷ 3 = 164 (If the number obtained by using the rule is divisible by 3, then the whole number is divisible by 3)

'''Ex.'''
# 336 (The original number)
# 6 × 7 × 8 = 336
# 336 ÷ 3 = 112

===Divisibility by 4===
The basic rule for divisibility by 4 is that if the number formed by the last two digits in a number is divisible by 4, the original number is divisible by 4;&lt;ref name="Pascal's-criterion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="last-m-digits"/&gt; this is because 100 is divisible by 4 and so adding hundreds, thousands, etc. is simply adding another number that is divisible by 4.  If any number ends in a two digit number that you know is divisible by 4 (e.g. 24, 04, 08, etc.), then the whole number will be divisible by 4 regardless of what is before the last two digits.

Alternatively, one can simply divide the number by 2, and then check the result to find if it is divisible by 2.  If it is, the original number is divisible by 4.  In addition, the result of this test is the same as the original number divided by 4.

'''Ex.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''General rule'''
# 2092 (The original number)
# &lt;s&gt;20&lt;/s&gt; &lt;u&gt;92&lt;/u&gt; (Take the last two digits of the number, discarding any other digits)
# 92 ÷ 4 = 23 (Check to see if the number is divisible by 4)
# 2092 ÷ 4 = 523 (If the number that is obtained is divisible by 4, then the original number is divisible by 4)

'''Alternative example'''
# 1720 (The original number)
# 1720 ÷ 2 = 860 (Divide the original number by 2)
# 860 ÷ 2 = 430 (Check to see if the result is divisible by 2)
# 1720 ÷ 4 = 430 (If the result is divisible by 2, then the original number is divisible by 4)

===Divisibility by 5===
Divisibility by 5 is easily determined by checking the last digit in the number (47'''5'''), and seeing if it is either 0 or 5.  If the last number is either 0 or 5, the entire number is divisible by 5.&lt;ref name="Pascal's-criterion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="last-m-digits"/&gt;

If the last digit in the number is 0, then the result will be the remaining digits multiplied by 2.  For example, the number 40 ends in a zero (0), so take the remaining digits (4) and multiply that by two (4 × 2 = 8).  The result is the same as the result of 40 divided by 5(40/5 = 8).

If the last digit in the number is 5, then the result will be the remaining digits multiplied by two (2), plus one (1).  For example, the number 125 ends in a 5, so take the remaining digits (12), multiply them by two (12 × 2 = 24), then add one (24 + 1 = 25).  The result is the same as the result of 125 divided by 5 (125/5=25).

'''Ex.'''&lt;br&gt;
''' If the last digit is 0'''
# 110 (The original number)
# &lt;s&gt;11&lt;/s&gt; &lt;u&gt;0&lt;/u&gt; (Take the last digit of the number, and check if it is 0 or 5)
# &lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt; &lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt; (If it is 0, take the remaining digits, discarding the last)
# 11 × 2 = 22 (Multiply the result by 2)
# 110 ÷ 5 = 22 (The result is the same as the original number divided by 5)

'''If the last digit is 5'''
# 85 (The original number)
# &lt;s&gt;8&lt;/s&gt; &lt;u&gt;5&lt;/u&gt; (Take the last digit of the number, and check if it is 0 or 5)
# &lt;u&gt;8&lt;/u&gt; &lt;s&gt;5&lt;/s&gt; (If it is 5, take the remaining digits, discarding the last)
# 8 × 2 = 16 (Multiply the result by 2)
# 16 + 1 = 17 (Add 1 to the result)
# 85 ÷ 5 = 17 (The result is the same as the original number divided by 5)

===Divisibility by 6===
Divisibility by 6 is determined by checking the original number to see if it is both an even number ([[#Divisibility by 2|divisible by 2]]) and [[#Divisibility by 3|divisible by 3]].&lt;ref name="product-of-coprimes"/&gt; This is the best test to use.

If the number is divisible by six, take the original number (246) and divide it by two (246 ÷ 2 = 123).  Then, take that result and divide it by three (123 ÷ 3 = 41).  This result is the same as the original number divided by six (246 ÷ 6 = 41).

'''Ex.'''
;General rule
# 324 (The original number)
# 324 ÷ 3 = 108 (Check to see if the original number is divisible by 3)
# 324 ÷ 2 = 162 '''OR''' 108 ÷ 2 = 54 (Check to see if either the original number or the result of the previous equation is divisible by 2)
# 324 ÷ 6 = 54 (If either of the tests in the last step are true, then the original number is divisible by 6.  Also, the result of the second test returns the same result as the original number divided by 6)

;Finding a remainder of a number when divided by 6:

:Next, compute the sum of all the values and take the remainder on division by 6.

:Multiplication of the rightmost digit = 1 × 7 = 7
:Multiplication of the second rightmost digit = 3 × −2 = −6

:Eighth rightmost digit = −6
:Ninth rightmost digit = 0
:Tenth rightmost digit = −2
:Sum = −51
:−51 ≡ 3 (mod 6)
:Remainder = 3

===Divisibility by 7===
Divisibility by 7 can be tested by a recursive method. A number of the form 10''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'' is divisible by 7 if and only if ''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''y'' is divisible by 7.  In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits.  Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible by 7 is obtained.  The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7.  For example, the number 371: 37&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(2×1) =&amp;nbsp;37&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;35; 3&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;5) =&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;10 =&amp;nbsp;−7; thus, since −7 is divisible by 7, 371 is divisible by&amp;nbsp;7.

Another method is multiplication by 3. A number of the form 10''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'' has the same remainder when divided by 7 as 3''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''. One must multiply the leftmost digit of the original number by 3, add the next digit, take the remainder when divided by 7, and continue from the beginning: multiply by 3, add the next digit, etc. For example, the number 371: 3×3 + 7 = 16 remainder 2, and 2×3 + 1 = 7. This method can be used to find the remainder of division by 7.

A more complicated algorithm for testing divisibility by 7 uses the fact that 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1, 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;3, 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2, 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;6, 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;4, 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;5, 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1, ...&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;7). Take each digit of the number (371) in reverse order (173), multiplying them successively by the digits '''1''', '''3''', '''2''', '''6''', '''4''', '''5''', repeating with this sequence of multipliers as long as necessary (1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, ...), and adding the products (1×'''1'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7×'''3'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3×'''2''' =&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;21&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;28). The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7 (hence 371 is divisible by 7 since 28 is).&lt;ref name="7Divis1"&gt;{{cite web

This method can be simplified by removing the need to multiply. All it would take with this simplification is to memorize the sequence above (132645...), and to add and subtract, but always working with one-digit numbers.

The simplification goes as follows:
*Take for instance the number '''371'''
*Change all occurrences of '''7''', '''8''' or '''9''' into '''0''', '''1''' and '''2''', respectively. In this example, we get: '''301'''. This second step may be skipped, except for the left most digit, but following it may facilitate calculations later on.
*Now convert the first digit (3) into the following digit in the sequence '''13264513...''' In our example, 3 becomes '''2'''.
*Add the result in the previous step (2) to the second digit of the number, and substitute the result for both digits, leaving all remaining digits unmodified: 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. So ''30''1 becomes '''''2''1'''.
*Repeat the procedure until you have a recognizable multiple of 7, or to make sure, a number between 0 and 6. So, starting from 21 (which is a recognizable multiple of 7), take the first digit (2) and convert it into the following in the sequence above: 2 becomes 6. Then add this to the second digit: 6&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''7'''.
*If at any point the first digit is 8 or 9, these become 1 or 2, respectively. But if it is a 7 it should become 0, only if no other digits follow. Otherwise, it should simply be dropped. This is because that 7 would have become 0, and numbers with at least two digits before the decimal dot do not begin with 0, which is useless. According to this, our 7 becomes&amp;nbsp;'''0'''.

If through this procedure you obtain a '''0''' or any recognizable multiple of 7, then the original number is a multiple of 7. If you obtain any number from '''1''' to '''6''', that will indicate how much you should subtract from the original number to get a multiple of&amp;nbsp;7. In other words, you will find the [[remainder]] of dividing the number by 7. For example, take the number&amp;nbsp;'''186''':
*First, change the 8 into a 1: '''116'''.
*Now, change 1 into the following digit in the sequence (3), add it to the second digit, and write the result instead of both: 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''4''. So ''11''6 becomes now '''''4''6'''.
*Repeat the procedure, since the number is greater than 7. Now, 4 becomes 5, which must be added to 6. That is&amp;nbsp;'''11'''.
*Repeat the procedure one more time: 1 becomes 3, which is added to the second digit (1): 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''4'''.

Now we have a number lower than 7, and this number (4) is the remainder of dividing 186/7. So 186&amp;nbsp;minus&amp;nbsp;4, which is 182, must be a multiple of&amp;nbsp;7.

Note: The reason why this works is that if we have: '''a+b=c''' and '''b''' is a multiple of any given number '''n''', then '''a''' and '''c''' will necessarily produce the same remainder when divided by '''n'''. In other words, in 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9, 7 is divisible by&amp;nbsp;7. So 2 and 9 must have the same reminder when divided by 7. The remainder is&amp;nbsp;2.

Therefore, if a number ''n'' is a multiple of 7 (i.e.: the remainder of ''n''/7 is&amp;nbsp;0), then adding (or subtracting) multiples of 7 cannot change that property.

What this procedure does, as explained above for most divisibility rules,  is simply subtract little by little multiples of 7 from the original number until reaching a number that is small enough for us to remember whether it is a multiple of 7. If 1 becomes a 3 in the following decimal position, that is just the same as converting 10×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; into a 3×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. And that is actually the same as subtracting 7×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (clearly a multiple of 7) from 10×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Similarly, when you turn a 3 into a 2 in the following decimal position, you are turning 30×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; into 2×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the same as subtracting 30×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;−28×10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, and this is again subtracting a multiple of 7. The same reason applies for all the remaining conversions:
* 20×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;='''14'''×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
* 60×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;='''56'''×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
* 40×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;='''35'''×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
* 50×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;='''49'''×10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;

'''First method example'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Vedic method of divisibility by osculation'''&lt;br&gt;
Divisibility by seven can be tested by multiplication by the ''Ekhādika''. Convert the divisor seven to the nines family by multiplying by seven. 7×7=49. Add one, drop the units digit and, take the 5, the ''Ekhādika'', as the multiplier. Start on the right. Multiply by 5, add the product to the next digit to the left. Set down that result on a line below that digit. Repeat that method of multiplying the units digit by five and adding that product to the number of tens. Add the result to the next digit to the left. Write down that result below the digit. Continue to the end. If the end result is zero or a multiple of seven, then yes, the number is divisible by seven. Otherwise, it is not. This follows the Vedic ideal, one-line notation.&lt;ref&gt;Page 274, '''Vedic Mathematics: Sixteen Simple Mathematical Formulae''', by Swami Sankaracarya, published by Motilal Banarsidass, Varanasi, India, 1965, Delhi, 1978. 367 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=March 2016}}

'''Pohlman–Mass method of divisibility by 7'''&lt;br&gt;
The Pohlman–Mass method provides a quick solution that can determine if most integers are divisible by seven in three steps or less.  This method could be useful in a mathematics competition such as MATHCOUNTS, where time is a factor to determine the solution without a calculator in the Sprint Round.

Step A:
If the integer is 1,000 or less, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits.  If the result is a multiple of seven, then so is the original number (and vice versa).  For example:

 112 -&gt; 11 − (2×2) = 11 − 4  =  7  YES
 98  -&gt; 9  − (8×2) = 9  − 16 = −7  YES
 634 -&gt; 63 − (4×2) = 63 − 8  = 55  NO

Because 1,001 is divisible by seven, an interesting pattern develops for repeating sets of 1, 2, or 3 digits that form 6-digit numbers (leading zeros are allowed) in that all such numbers are divisible by seven.  For example:

 001 001 = 1,001 / 7 = 143
 010 010 = 10,010 / 7 = 1,430
 011 011 = 11,011 / 7 = 1,573
 100 100 = 100,100 / 7 = 14,300
 101 101 = 101,101 / 7 = 14,443
 110 110 = 110,110 / 7 = 15,730

 01 01 01 = 10,101 / 7 = 1,443
 10 10 10 = 101,010 / 7 = 14,430

 111,111 / 7 = 15,873
 222,222 / 7 = 31,746
 999,999 / 7 = 142,857

 576,576 / 7 = 82,368

For all of the above examples, subtracting the first three digits from the last three results in a multiple of seven.  Notice that leading zeros are permitted to form a 6-digit pattern.

This phenomenon forms the basis for Steps B and C.

Step B:
If the integer is between 1,001 and one million, find a repeating pattern of 1, 2, or 3 digits that forms a 6-digit number that is close to the integer (leading zeros are allowed and can help you visualize the pattern).  If the positive difference is less than 1,000, apply Step A.  This can be done by subtracting the first three digits from the last three digits.  For example:

 341,355 − 341,341 = 14 -&gt; 1 − (4×2) = 1 − 8 = −7     YES
  67,326 − 067,067 = 259 -&gt; 25 − (9×2) = 25 − 18 = 7  YES

The fact that 999,999 is a multiple of 7 can be used for determining divisibility of integers larger than one million by reducing the integer to a 6-digit number that can be determined using Step B.  This can be done easily by adding the digits left of the first six to the last six and follow with Step A.

Step C:
If the integer is larger than one million, subtract the nearest multiple of 999,999 and then apply Step B.  For even larger numbers, use larger sets such as 12-digits (999,999,999,999) and so on.  Then, break the integer into a smaller number that can be solved using Step B.  For example:

 22,862,420 − (999,999 × 22) = 22,862,420 − 21,999,978 -&gt; 862,420 + 22 = 862,442
    862,442 -&gt; 862 − 442 (Step B) = 420 -&gt; 42 − (0×2) (Step A) = 42  YES

This allows adding and subtracting alternating sets of three digits to determine divisibility by seven.  Understanding these patterns allows you to quickly calculate divisibility of seven as seen in the following examples:

'''Pohlman–Mass method of divisibility by 7, examples:'''

 355,341 − 341,341 = 14,000 (Step B) -&gt; 014 − 000 (Step B) -&gt; 14 = 1 − (4×2) (Step A) = 1 − 8 = −7  YES

 Is 42,341,530 divisible by seven?
 42,341,530 -&gt; 341,530 + 42 = 341,572 (Step C)
 341,572 − 341,341 = 231 (Step B)
 231 -&gt; 23 − (1×2) = 23 − 2 = 21  YES (Step A)

 Using quick alternating additions and subtractions:
  42,341,530 -&gt; 530 − 341 + 42 = 189 + 42 = 231 -&gt; 23 − (1×2) = 21  YES

'''Digit pair method of divisibility by 7'''

This method uses '''1''', '''−3''', '''2''' pattern on the ''digit pairs''. That is, the divisibility of any number by seven can be tested by first separating the number into digit pairs, and then applying the algorithm on three digit pairs (six digits). When the number is smaller than six digits, then fill zero’s to the right side until there are six digits. When the number is larger than six digits, then repeat the cycle on the next six digit group and then add the results. Repeat the algorithm until the result is a small number. The original number is divisible by seven if and only if the number obtained using this algorithm is divisible by seven. This method is especially suitable for large numbers.

''Example 1:''&lt;br&gt;
The number to be tested is 157514.
First we separate the number into three digit pairs: 15, 75 and 14.&lt;br&gt;
Then we apply the algorithm: '''1''' × 15 '''− 3''' × 75 + '''2''' × 14 = 182&lt;br&gt;
Because the resulting 182 is less than six digits, we add zero’s to the right side until it is six digits.&lt;br&gt;
Then we apply our algorithm again: '''1''' × 18 '''− 3''' × 20 + '''2''' × 0 = −42&lt;br&gt;
The result −42 is divisible by seven, thus the original number 157514 is divisible by seven.

''Example 2:''&lt;br&gt;
The number to be tested is 15751537186.&lt;br&gt;
('''1''' × 15 '''− 3''' × 75 + '''2''' × 15) + ('''1''' × 37 '''− 3''' × 18 + '''2''' × 60) = −180 + 103 = −77&lt;br&gt;
The result −77 is divisible by seven, thus the original number 15751537186 is divisible by seven.

===Divisibility by 13===
Remainder Test
13 (1, −3, −4, −1, 3, 4, cycle goes on.)
If you are not comfortable with negative numbers, then use this sequence. (1, 10, 9, 12, 3, 4)


Multiply the right most digit of the number with the left most number in the sequence shown above and the second right most digit to the second left most digit of the number in the sequence. The cycle goes on.

Example: What is the remainder when 321 is divided by 13?&lt;br/&gt;
Using the first sequence, &lt;br&gt;
Ans: '''1''' × 1 + '''2''' × −3 + '''3''' × −4 = −17&lt;br/&gt;
Remainder = −17 mod 13 = 9

Example: What is the remainder when 1234567 is divided by 13?&lt;br/&gt;
Using the second sequence, &lt;br&gt;
Answer: '''7''' × 1 + '''6''' × 10 + '''5''' × 9 + '''4''' × 12 + '''3''' × 3 + '''2''' × 4 + '''1''' × 1 = 178 mod 13 = 9&lt;br/&gt;
Remainder = 9

==Beyond 30==
Divisibility properties can be determined in two ways, depending on the type of the divisor.

===Composite divisors===
A number is divisible by a given divisor if it is divisible by the highest power of each of its [[prime number|prime]] factors.  For example, to determine divisibility by 36, check divisibility by 4 and by 9.&lt;ref name="product-of-coprimes"/&gt;  Note that checking 3 and 12, or 2 and 18, would not be sufficient.  A [[table of prime factors]] may be useful.

A [[Composite number|composite]] divisor may also have a rule formed using the same procedure as for a prime divisor, given below, with the caveat that the manipulations involved may not introduce any factor which is present in the divisor.  For instance, one cannot make a rule for 14 that involves multiplying the equation by 7.  This is not an issue for prime divisors because they have no smaller factors.

===Prime divisors===
The goal is to find an inverse to 10 [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] the prime under consideration (does not work for 2 or 5) and use that as a multiplier to make the divisibility of the original number by that prime depend on the divisibility of the new (usually smaller) number by the same prime.
Using 31 as an example, since 10 × (−3) = −30 = 1 mod 31, we get the rule for using ''y''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3''x'' in the table above. Likewise, since 10 × (28) = 280 = 1 mod 31 also, we obtain a complementary rule ''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;28''x'' of the same kind - our choice of addition or subtraction being dictated by arithmetic convenience of the smaller value. In fact, this rule for prime divisors besides 2 and 5 is ''really'' a rule for divisibility by any integer relatively prime to 10 (including 33 and 39; see the table below).  This is why the last divisibility condition in the tables above and below for any number relatively prime to 10 has the same kind of form (add or subtract some multiple of the last digit from the rest of the number).

==Generalized divisibility rule==

To test for divisibility by ''D'', where ''D'' ends in 1, 3, 7, or 9, the following method can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkels, Andrejs, "Comments on note 82.53—a generalized test for divisibility", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 84, March 2000, 79-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Find any multiple of ''D'' ending in 9. (If ''D'' ends respectively in 1, 3, 7, or 9, then multiply by 9, 3, 7, or 1.) Then add 1 and divide by 10, denoting the result as ''m''. Then a number ''N'' = 10''t'' + ''q'' is divisible by ''D'' if and only if ''mq + t'' is divisible by ''D''.

For example, to determine if 913 = 10×91 + 3 is divisible by 11, find that ''m'' = (11×9+1)÷10 = 10. Then ''mq+t'' = 10×3+91 = 121; this is divisible by 11 (with quotient 11), so 913 is also divisible by 11. As another example, to determine if 689 = 10×68 + 9 is divisible by 53, find that ''m'' = (53×3+1)÷10 = 16. Then ''mq+t'' = 16×9 + 68 = 212, which is divisible by 53 (with quotient 4); so 689 is also divisible by 53.

==Proofs==

===Proof using basic algebra===

Many of the simpler rules can be produced using only algebraic manipulation, creating [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]s and rearranging them.  By writing a number as the [[positional notation|sum of each digit times a power of 10]] each digit's power can be manipulated individually.

'''Case where all digits are summed'''

This method works for divisors that are factors of 10&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = 9.

Using 3 as an example, 3 divides 9&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. That means &lt;math&gt;10 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[modular arithmetic]]). The same for all the higher powers of 10: &lt;math&gt;10^n \equiv 1^n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}&lt;/math&gt;  They are all [[congruence relation|congruent]] to 1 modulo 3. Since two things that are congruent  modulo 3 are either both divisible by 3 or both not, we can interchange values that are congruent modulo 3. So, in a number such as the following, we can replace all the powers of 10 by 1:

:&lt;math&gt;100\cdot a + 10\cdot b + 1\cdot c \equiv (1)a + (1)b + (1)c \pmod{3}&lt;/math&gt;

which is exactly the sum of the digits.

'''Case where the alternating sum of digits is used'''

This method works for divisors that are factors of 10 + 1 = 11.

Using 11 as an example, 11 divides 11&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. That means &lt;math&gt;10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11}&lt;/math&gt;. For the higher powers of 10, they are congruent to 1 for even powers and congruent to −1 for odd powers:

:&lt;math&gt;10^n \equiv (-1)^n \equiv \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\ -1, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} \end{cases} \pmod{11}.&lt;/math&gt;

Like the previous case, we can substitute powers of 10 with congruent values:

:&lt;math&gt;1000\cdot a + 100\cdot b + 10\cdot c + 1\cdot d \equiv (-1)a + (1)b + (-1)c + (1)d \pmod{11}&lt;/math&gt;

which is also the difference between the sum of digits at odd positions and the sum of digits at even positions.

'''Case where only the last digit(s) matter'''

This applies to divisors that are a factor of a power of 10. This is because sufficiently high powers of the base are multiples of the divisor, and can be eliminated.

For example, in base 10, the factors of 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; include 2, 5, and 10. Therefore, divisibility by 2, 5, and 10 only depend on whether the last 1 digit is divisible by those divisors. The factors of 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; include 4 and 25, and divisibility by those only depend on the last 2 digits.

'''Case where only the last digit(s) are removed'''

Most numbers do not divide 9 or 10 evenly, but do divide a higher power of 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.  In this case the number is still written in powers of 10, but not fully expanded.

For example, 7 does not divide 9 or 10, but does divide 98, which is close to 100.  Thus, proceed from

:&lt;math&gt;100 \cdot a + b&lt;/math&gt;

where in this case a is any integer, and b can range from 0 to 99.  Next,

:&lt;math&gt;(98+2) \cdot a + b&lt;/math&gt;

and again expanding

:&lt;math&gt;98 \cdot a + 2 \cdot a + b,&lt;/math&gt;

and after eliminating the known multiple of 7, the result is

:&lt;math&gt;2 \cdot a + b,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the rule "double the number formed by all but the last two digits, then add the last two digits".

'''Case where the last digit(s) is multiplied by a factor'''

The representation of the number may also be multiplied by any number relatively prime to the divisor without changing its divisibility.  After observing that 7 divides 21, we can perform the following:

:&lt;math&gt;10 \cdot a + b,&lt;/math&gt;

after multiplying by 2, this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;20 \cdot a + 2 \cdot b,&lt;/math&gt;

and then

:&lt;math&gt;(21 - 1) \cdot a + 2 \cdot b.&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating the 21 gives

:&lt;math&gt; -1 \cdot a + 2 \cdot b,&lt;/math&gt;

and multiplying by −1 gives

:&lt;math&gt; a - 2 \cdot b.&lt;/math&gt;

Either of the last two rules may be used, depending on which is easier to perform.  They correspond to the rule "subtract twice the last digit from the rest".

===Proof using modular arithmetic===

This section will illustrate the basic method; all the rules can be derived following the same procedure. The following requires a basic grounding in [[modular arithmetic]]; for divisibility other than by 2's and 5's the proofs rest on the basic fact that 10 mod ''m'' is invertible if 10 and ''m'' are relatively prime.

'''For 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or 5&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:'''

Only the last ''n'' digits need to be checked.

:&lt;math&gt;10^n = 2^n \cdot 5^n \equiv 0 \pmod{2^n \mathrm{\ or\ } 5^n}&lt;/math&gt;

Representing ''x'' as &lt;math&gt;10^n \cdot y + z,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = 10^n \cdot y + z \equiv z \pmod{2^n \mathrm{\ or\ } 5^n}&lt;/math&gt;

and the divisibility of ''x'' is the same as that of ''z''.

'''For 7:'''

Since 10 × 5 &amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp; 10 × (−2) &amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;7) we can do the following:

Representing ''x'' as &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot y + z,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-2x \equiv y -2z \pmod{7},&lt;/math&gt;

so ''x'' is divisible by 7 if and only if ''y'' − 2''z'' is divisible by 7.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7307">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], a '''Dowling geometry''', named after Thomas A. Dowling, is a [[matroid]] associated with a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. There is a Dowling geometry of each rank for each group. If the rank is at least 3, the Dowling geometry uniquely determines the group. Dowling geometries have a role in matroid theory as [[universal object]]s (Kahn and Kung, 1982); in that respect they are analogous to [[projective geometry|projective geometries]], but based on groups instead of [[field (mathematics)|field]]s.

A '''Dowling lattice''' is the [[geometric lattice]] of [[matroid|flats]] associated with a Dowling geometry. The lattice and the geometry are mathematically equivalent: knowing either one determines the other. Dowling lattices, and by implication Dowling geometries, were introduced by Dowling (1973a,b).

A Dowling lattice or geometry of rank ''n'' of a group ''G'' is often denoted ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'').

==The original definitions==

In his first paper (1973a) Dowling defined the rank-''n'' Dowling lattice of the multiplicative group of a [[finite field]] ''F''. It is the set of all those subspaces of the [[vector space]] ''F'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; that are generated by subsets of the set ''E'' that consists of vectors with at most two nonzero coordinates. The corresponding Dowling geometry is the set of 1-dimensional vector subspaces generated by the elements of ''E''.

In his second paper (1973b) Dowling gave an intrinsic definition of the rank-''n'' Dowling lattice of any finite group ''G''. Let ''S'' be the set {1,...,''n''}. A ''G''-'''labelled set''' (''T'', α) is a set ''T'' together with a [[function (mathematics)|function]] α: ''T'' &amp;rarr; ''G''. Two ''G''-labelled sets, (''T'', α) and (''T'', β), are '''equivalent''' if there is a group element, ''g'', such that β = ''g''α. 
An equivalence class is denoted [''T'', α].
A '''partial ''G''-partition''' of ''S'' is a set γ = {[''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;], ..., [''B''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,α&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]} of equivalence classes of ''G''-labelled sets such that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are nonempty subsets of ''S'' that are pairwise disjoint. (''k'' may equal 0.) 
A partial ''G''-partition γ is said to be ≤ another one, γ*, if 
* every block of the second is a union of blocks of the first, and
* for each ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; contained in ''B''*&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to the restriction of α*&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; to domain ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; .

This gives a [[partially ordered set|partial ordering]] of the set of all partial ''G''-partitions of ''S''. The resulting partially ordered set is the Dowling lattice ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'').

The definitions are valid even if ''F'' or ''G'' is infinite, though Dowling mentioned only finite fields and groups.

==Graphical definitions==

A graphical definition was then given by Doubilet, Rota, and Stanley (1972). We give the slightly simpler (but essentially equivalent) graphical definition of Zaslavsky (1991), expressed in terms of [[gain graph]]s.

Take ''n'' vertices, and between each pair of vertices, ''v'' and ''w'', take a set of |''G''| [[Multiple edges|parallel edges]] labelled by each of the elements of the group ''G''. The edges are oriented, in that, if the label in the direction from ''v'' to ''w'' is the group element ''g'', then the label of the same edge in the opposite direction, from ''w'' to ''v'', is ''g''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The label of an edge therefore depends on the direction of the edge; such labels are called '''gains'''. Also add to each vertex a loop whose gain is any value other than 1. (1 is the group [[identity element]].) This gives a graph which is called ''GK&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; (note the raised circle).

A [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] in the graph then has a gain. The cycle is a sequence of edges, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;···''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Suppose the gains of these edges, in a fixed direction around the cycle, are ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then the gain of the cycle is the product, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;···''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The value of this gain is not completely well defined, since it depends on the direction chosen for the cycle and on which is called the "first" edge of the cycle. What is independent of these choices is the answer to the following question: is the gain equal to 1 or not? If it equals 1 under one set of choices, then it is also equal to 1 under all sets of choices.

To define the Dowling geometry, we specify the circuits (minimal dependent sets). The circuits of the matroid are 
* the cycles whose gain is 1,
* the pairs of cycles with both gains not equal to 1, and which intersect in a single vertex and nothing else, and
* the [[Glossary of graph theory#Walks|theta graph]]s in which none of the three cycles has gain equal to 1.

Thus, the Dowling geometry ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'') is the [[biased graph|frame matroid]] or (bias matroid) of the gain graph ''GK&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; (the raised circle denotes the presence of loops). 
Other, equivalent definitions are described in the article on [[gain graph]]s.

== Characteristic polynomial ==

One reason for interest in Dowling lattices is that the [[graded poset#characteristic polynomial|characteristic polynomial]] is very simple. If ''L'' is the Dowling lattice of rank ''n'' of a finite group ''G'' having ''m'' elements, then

:&lt;math&gt;p_L(y) = (y-1)(y-m-1)\cdots(y-[n-1]m-1) ,&lt;/math&gt;

an exceptionally simple formula for any geometric lattice.

==Generalizations==

There is also a Dowling geometry, of rank 3 only, associated with each [[quasigroup]]; see Dowling (1973b). This does not generalize in a straightforward way to higher ranks. There is a generalization due to Zaslavsky (2012) that involves ''n''-ary quasigroups.

'''Dynamic logic''' is an extension of [[modal logic]] originally intended for reasoning about computer programs and later applied to more general complex behaviors arising in [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], and other fields.

==Language==

[[Modal logic]] is characterized by the [[modal operator]]s &lt;math&gt;\Box p&lt;/math&gt; (box p) asserting that &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily the case, and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond p&lt;/math&gt; (diamond p) asserting that &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is possibly the case. Dynamic logic extends this by associating to every action &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the modal operators &lt;math&gt;[a]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, thereby making it a [[multimodal logic]].  The meaning of &lt;math&gt;[a]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is that after performing action &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; it is necessarily the case that &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; holds, that is, &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The meaning of &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is that after performing &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; it is possible that &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; holds, that is, &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; might bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  These operators are related by &lt;math&gt;[a]p \equiv \neg \langle a \rangle \neg p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle p \equiv \neg[a] \neg p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, analogously to the relationship between the universal (&lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) and existential (&lt;math&gt;\exists\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) quantifiers.

Dynamic logic permits compound actions built up from smaller actions. While the basic control operators of any programming language could be used for this purpose, Kleene's [[regular expression]] operators are a good match to modal logic. Given actions &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the compound action &lt;math&gt;a \cup b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, ''choice'', also written &lt;math&gt;a+b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a|b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is performed by performing one of &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The compound action &lt;math&gt;a\mathbin{;}b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, ''sequence'', is performed by performing first &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The compound action &lt;math&gt;a{*}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, ''iteration'', is performed by performing &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; zero or more times, sequentially. The constant action &lt;math&gt;0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or '''BLOCK''' does nothing and does not terminate, whereas the constant action &lt;math&gt;1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or '''SKIP''' or '''NOP''', definable as &lt;math&gt;0{*}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, does nothing but does terminate.

==Axioms==

These operators can be axiomatized in dynamic logic as follows, taking as already given a suitable axiomatization of [[modal logic]] including such axioms for modal operators as the above-mentioned axiom &lt;math&gt;[a]p \equiv \neg \langle a \rangle \neg p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and the two inference rules ''modus ponens'' (&lt;math&gt;\vdash p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vdash p \to q&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\vdash q\,&lt;/math&gt;) and ''necessitation'' (&lt;math&gt;\vdash p&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\vdash [a]p\,&lt;/math&gt;).

A1.  &lt;math&gt;[0]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A2.  &lt;math&gt;[1]p \equiv p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A3.  &lt;math&gt;[a \cup b]p \equiv [a]p \land [b]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A4.  &lt;math&gt;[a\mathbin{;}b]p \equiv [a][b]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A5.  &lt;math&gt;[a*]p \equiv p \land [a][a*]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A6.  &lt;math&gt;p \land [a*](p \to [a]p) \to [a*]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Axiom A1 makes the empty promise that when '''BLOCK''' terminates, &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; will hold, even if &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the proposition '''false'''.  (Thus '''BLOCK''' abstracts the essence of the action of hell freezing over.)&lt;br/&gt;
A2 says that '''NOP''' acts as the identity function on propositions, that is, it transforms &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into itself.&lt;br /&gt;
A3 says that if doing one of &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and likewise for &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and conversely.&lt;br /&gt;
A4 says that if doing &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must bring about a situation in which &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
A5 is the evident result of applying A2, A3 and A4 to the equation &lt;math&gt;a{*} = 1 \cup a\mathbin{;}a{*}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of [[Kleene algebra]].&lt;br /&gt;
A6 asserts that if &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; holds now, and no matter how often we perform &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; it remains the case that the truth of &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; after that performance entails its truth after one more performance of &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must remain true no matter how often we perform &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. A6 is recognizable as [[mathematical induction]] with the action '''n := n+1''' of incrementing '''n''' generalized to arbitrary actions &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

==Derivations==

The modal logic axiom &lt;math&gt;[a]p \equiv \neg\langle a \rangle \neg p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; permits the derivation of the following six theorems corresponding to the above:

T1.  &lt;math&gt;\neg \langle 0 \rangle p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

T2.  &lt;math&gt;\langle 1 \rangle p \equiv p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

T3.  &lt;math&gt;\langle a \cup b \rangle p \equiv \langle a \rangle p \lor \langle b \rangle p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

T4.  &lt;math&gt;\langle a;b \rangle p \equiv \langle a \rangle \langle b \rangle p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

T5.  &lt;math&gt;\langle a* \rangle p \equiv p \lor \langle a \rangle \langle a* \rangle p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

T6.  &lt;math&gt;\langle a* \rangle p \to p \lor \langle a* \rangle (\neg p \land \langle a \rangle p)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

T1 asserts the impossibility of bringing anything about by performing '''BLOCK'''.&lt;br/&gt;
T2 notes again that '''NOP''' changes nothing, bearing in mind that '''NOP''' is both deterministic and terminating whence &lt;math&gt;[1]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle 1 \rangle\,\!&lt;/math&gt; have the same force.&lt;br/&gt;
T3 says that if the choice of &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; could bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, then either &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; alone could bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
T4 is just like A4.&lt;br/&gt;
T5 is explained as for A5.&lt;br/&gt;
T6 asserts that if it is possible to bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; by performing &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently often, then either &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true now or it is possible to perform &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; repeatedly to bring about a situation where &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is (still) false but one more performance of &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; could bring about &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Box and diamond are entirely symmetric with regard to which one takes as primitive. An alternative axiomatization would have been to take the theorems T1-T6 as axioms, from which we could then have derived A1-A6 as theorems.

The difference between implication and inference is the same in dynamic logic as in any other logic: whereas the implication &lt;math&gt;p \to q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; asserts that if &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true then so is &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the inference &lt;math&gt;p \vdash q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; asserts that if &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is valid then so is &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. However the dynamic nature of dynamic logic moves this distinction out of the realm of abstract axiomatics into the common-sense experience of situations in flux. The inference rule &lt;math&gt;p \vdash [a]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, for example, is sound because its premise asserts that &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; holds at all times, whence no matter where &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; might take us, &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; will be true there. The implication &lt;math&gt;p \to [a]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not valid, however, because the truth of &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the present moment is no guarantee of its truth after performing &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;p \to [a]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; will be true in any situation where &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is false, or in any situation where &lt;math&gt;[a]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true, but the assertion &lt;math&gt;(x = 1) \to [x := x+1](x = 1)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is false in any situation where &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has value 1, and therefore is not valid.

==Derived rules of inference==

As for modal logic, the inference rules ''modus ponens'' and ''necessitation'' suffice also for dynamic logic as the only primitive rules it needs, as noted above. However, as usual in logic, many more rules can be derived from these with the help of the axioms. An example instance of such a derived rule in dynamic logic is that if kicking a broken TV once can't possibly fix it, then repeatedly kicking it can't possibly fix it either. Writing &lt;math&gt;k\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for the action of kicking the TV, and &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for the proposition that the TV is broken, dynamic logic expresses this inference as &lt;math&gt;b \to [k]b \vdash b \to [k*]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, having as premise &lt;math&gt;b \to [k]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and as conclusion &lt;math&gt;b \to [k*]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The meaning of &lt;math&gt;[k]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is that it is guaranteed that after kicking the TV, it is broken. Hence the premise &lt;math&gt;b \to [k]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; means that if the TV is broken, then after kicking it once it will still be broken. &lt;math&gt;k{*}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; denotes the action of kicking the TV zero or more times. Hence the conclusion &lt;math&gt;b \to [k*]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; means that if the TV is broken, then after kicking it zero or more times it will still be broken. For if not, then after the second-to-last kick the TV would be in a state where kicking it once more would fix it, which the premise claims can never happen under any circumstances.

The inference &lt;math&gt;b \to [k]b \vdash b \to [k*]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is sound. However the implication &lt;math&gt;(b \to [k]b) \to (b \to [k*]b)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not valid because we can easily find situations in which &lt;math&gt;b \to [k]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; holds but &lt;math&gt;b \to [k*]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; does not. In any such counterexample situation, &lt;math&gt;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must hold but &lt;math&gt;[k*]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must be false, while &lt;math&gt;[k]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; however must be true. But this could happen in any situation where the TV is broken but can be revived with two kicks. The implication fails (is not valid) because it only requires that &lt;math&gt;b \to [k]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; hold now, whereas the inference succeeds (is sound) because it requires that &lt;math&gt;b \to [k]b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; hold in all situations, not just the present one.

An example of a valid implication is the proposition &lt;math&gt;(x \ge 3) \to [x := x+1](x \ge 4)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This says that if &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is greater or equal to 3, then after incrementing &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must be greater or equal to 4. In the case of deterministic actions &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; that are guaranteed to terminate, such as &lt;math&gt;x := x+1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, ''must'' and ''might'' have the same force, that is, &lt;math&gt;[a]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle\,\!&lt;/math&gt; have the same meaning. Hence the above proposition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(x \ge 3) \to \langle x := x+1 \rangle (x \ge 4)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; asserting that if &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is greater or equal to 3 then after performing &lt;math&gt;x := x+1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; might be greater or equal to 4.

==Assignment==

The general form of an assignment statement is &lt;math&gt;x := e\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a variable and &lt;math&gt;e\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an expression built from constants and variables with whatever operations are provided by the language, such as addition and multiplication. The Hoare axiom for assignment is not given as a single axiom but rather as an axiom schema.

'''A7.'''  &lt;math&gt;[x:=e] \Phi(x) \equiv  \Phi(e)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This is a schema in the sense that &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can be instantiated with any formula &lt;math&gt;\Phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; containing zero or more instances of a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The meaning of &lt;math&gt;\Phi(e)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with those occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; that occur free in &lt;math&gt;\Phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. not bound by some quantifier as in &lt;math&gt;\forall x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, replaced by &lt;math&gt;e\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. For example, we may instantiate A7 with &lt;math&gt;[x:=e](x=y^2) \equiv e=y^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, or with &lt;math&gt;[x:=e](b=c+x) \equiv b=c+e\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Such an axiom schema allows infinitely many axioms having a common form to be written as a finite expression connoting that form.

The instance &lt;math&gt;[x:=x+1](x \ge 4) \equiv (x+1) \ge 4\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of A7 allows us to calculate mechanically that the example &lt;math&gt;[x:=x+1]x \ge 4\,\!&lt;/math&gt; encountered a few paragraphs ago is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(x+1) \ge 4\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;x \ge 3\,\!&lt;/math&gt; by [[elementary algebra]].

An example illustrating assignment in combination with &lt;math&gt;*\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the proposition &lt;math&gt;\langle (x:=x+1)*\rangle x=7\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This asserts that it is possible, by incrementing &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently often, to make &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; equal to 7. This of course is not always true, e.g. if &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is 8 to begin with, or 6.5, whence this proposition is not a theorem of dynamic logic. If &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is of type integer however, then this proposition is true if and only if &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is at most 7 to begin with, that is, it is just a roundabout way of saying &lt;math&gt;x \le 7\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Mathematical induction]] can be obtained as the instance of A6 in which the proposition &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is instantiated as &lt;math&gt;\Phi(n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the action &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n:=n+1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The first two of these three instantiations are straightforward, converting A6 to &lt;math&gt;(\Phi(n) \land [(n:=n+1)*](\Phi(n) \to [n:=n+1] \Phi(n))) \to [(n:=n+1)*] \Phi(n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. However, the ostensibly simple substitution of &lt;math&gt;0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not so simple as it brings out the so-called ''referential opacity'' of modal logic in the case when a modality can interfere with a substitution.

When we substituted &lt;math&gt;\Phi(n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, we were thinking of the proposition symbol &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as a [[rigid designator]] with respect to the modality &lt;math&gt;[n:=n+1]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that it is the same proposition after incrementing &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as before, even though incrementing &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; may impact its truth. Likewise, the action &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is still the same action after incrementing &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, even though incrementing &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; will result in its executing in a different environment. However, &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; itself is not a rigid designator with respect to the modality &lt;math&gt;[n:=n+1]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;; if it denotes 3 before incrementing &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, it denotes 4 after. So we can't just substitute &lt;math&gt;0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; everywhere in A6.

One way of dealing with the opacity of modalities is to eliminate them.  To this end, expand &lt;math&gt;[(n:=n+1)*] \Phi(n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as the infinite conjunction &lt;math&gt;[(n:=n+1)^0] \Phi(n) \land [(n:=n+1)^1] \Phi(n) \land [(n:=n+1)^2] \Phi(n) \land \ldots\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the conjunction over all &lt;math&gt;i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;[(n:=n+1)^i] \Phi(n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Now apply A4 to turn &lt;math&gt;[(n:=n+1)^i] \Phi(n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;[n:=n+1][n:=n+1]\ldots \Phi(n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, having &lt;math&gt;i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; modalities. Then apply Hoare's axiom &lt;math&gt;i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; times to this to produce &lt;math&gt;\Phi(n+i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, then simplify this infinite conjunction to &lt;math&gt;\forall i \Phi(n+i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This whole reduction should be applied to both instances of &lt;math&gt;[(n:=n+1)*]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in A6, yielding &lt;math&gt;(\Phi(n) \land \forall i (\Phi(n+i) \to [n:=n+1] \Phi(n+i))) \to \forall i \Phi(n+i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The remaining modality can now be eliminated with one more use of Hoare's axiom to give &lt;math&gt;(\Phi(n) \land \forall i (\Phi(n+i) \to \Phi(n+i+1))) \to \forall i \Phi (n+i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

With the opaque modalities now out of the way, we can safely substitute &lt;math&gt;0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the usual manner of [[first-order logic]] to obtain [[Peano]]'s celebrated axiom &lt;math&gt;(\Phi(0) \land \forall i (\Phi(i) \to  \Phi(i+1))) \to \forall i \Phi(i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, namely mathematical induction.

One subtlety we glossed over here is that &lt;math&gt;\forall i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; should be understood as ranging over the natural numbers, where &lt;math&gt;i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the superscript in the expansion of &lt;math&gt;a{*}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as the union of &lt;math&gt;a^i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; over all natural numbers &lt;math&gt;i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The importance of keeping this typing information straight becomes apparent if &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; had been of type ''integer'', or even ''real'', for any of which A6 is perfectly valid as an axiom. As a case in point, if &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a real variable and &lt;math&gt;\Phi(n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the predicate &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''is a natural number'', then axiom A6 after the first two substitutions, that is, &lt;math&gt;(\Phi(n) \land \forall i (\Phi(n+i) \to \Phi(n+i+1))) \to \forall i \Phi(n+i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is just as valid, that is, true in every state regardless of the value of &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in that state, as when &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is of type ''natural number''. If in a given state &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number, then the antecedent of the main implication of A6 holds, but then &lt;math&gt;n+i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is also a natural number so the consequent also holds. If &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not a natural number, then the antecedent is false and so A6 remains true regardless of the truth of the consequent. We could strengthen A6 to an equivalence &lt;math&gt;p \land [a*](p \to [a]p) \equiv [a*]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; without impacting any of this, the other direction being provable from A5, from which we see that if the antecedent of A6 does happen to be false somewhere, then the consequent ''must'' be false.

==Test==

Dynamic logic associates to every proposition &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; an action &lt;math&gt;p?\,\!&lt;/math&gt; called a test. When &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; holds, the test &lt;math&gt;p?\,\!&lt;/math&gt; acts as a '''NOP''', changing nothing while allowing the action to move on.  When &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is false, &lt;math&gt;p?\,\!&lt;/math&gt; acts as '''BLOCK'''. Tests can be axiomatized as follows.

'''A8.'''  &lt;math&gt;[p?]q \equiv p \to q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding theorem for &lt;math&gt;\langle p? \rangle\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is:

'''T8.'''  &lt;math&gt;\langle p? \rangle q \equiv p \land q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The construct '''if p then a else b''' is realized in dynamic logic as &lt;math&gt;(p?;a) \cup (\neg p?;b)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This action expresses a guarded choice: if &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; holds then &lt;math&gt;p?;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, whereas &lt;math&gt;\neg p?;b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to BLOCK, and &lt;math&gt;a \cup 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Hence when &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true the performer of the action can only take the left branch, and when &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is false the right.

The construct '''while p do a''' is realized as &lt;math&gt;(p?;a)*;\neg p?\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This performs &lt;math&gt;p?;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; zero or more times and then performs &lt;math&gt;\neg p?\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. As long as &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; remains true, the &lt;math&gt;\neg p?\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the end blocks the performer from terminating the iteration prematurely, but as soon as it becomes false, further iterations of the body &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are blocked and the performer then has no choice but to exit via the test &lt;math&gt;\neg p?\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quantification as random assignment==

The random-assignment statement &lt;math&gt;x:=?\,\!&lt;/math&gt; denotes the nondeterministic action of setting &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to an arbitrary value. &lt;math&gt;[x:=?]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; then says that &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; holds no matter what you set &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to, while &lt;math&gt;\langle x:=? \rangle p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; says that it is possible to set &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to a value that makes &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; true. &lt;math&gt;[x:=?]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; thus has the same meaning as the universal quantifier &lt;math&gt;\forall x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\langle x:=? \rangle\,\!&lt;/math&gt; similarly corresponds to the existential quantifier &lt;math&gt;\exists x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. That is, first-order logic can be understood as the dynamic logic of programs of the form &lt;math&gt;x:=?\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Dijkstra claimed to show the impossibility of a program that sets the value of variable x to an arbitrary positive integer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dijkstra|first=E.W.|title=A Discipline of Programming|year=1976|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs|isbn=013215871X|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in dynamic logic with assignment and the * operator, x can be set to an arbitrary positive integer with the dynamic logic program &lt;math&gt;x:=0\mathbin{;} (x:= x+ 1){*}&lt;/math&gt;: hence we must either reject Dijkstra's argument or hold that the * operator is not effective.

==Possible-world semantics==

Modal logic is most commonly interpreted in terms of [[possible world]] semantics or Kripke structures.  This semantics carries over naturally to dynamic logic by interpreting worlds as states of a computer in the application to program verification, or states of our environment in applications to linguistics, AI, etc.  One role for possible world semantics is to formalize the intuitive notions of truth and validity, which in turn permit the notions of soundness and completeness to be defined for axiom systems.  An inference rule is sound when validity of its premises implies validity of its conclusion.  An axiom system is sound when all its axioms are valid and its inference rules are sound.  An axiom system is complete when every valid formula is derivable as a theorem of that system.  These concepts apply to all [[systems of logic]] including dynamic logic.

==Propositional dynamic logic (PDL)==

Ordinary or [[first-order logic]] has two types of terms, respectively assertions and data. As can be seen from the examples above, dynamic logic adds a third type of term denoting actions. The dynamic logic assertion &lt;math&gt;[x:=x+1](x \ge 4)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; contains all three types: &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x+1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;4\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are data, &lt;math&gt;x:=x+1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an action, and &lt;math&gt;x \ge 4\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[x:=x+1](x \ge 4)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are assertions. [[Propositional logic]] is derived from first-order logic by omitting data terms and reasons only about abstract propositions, which may be simple [[propositional variable]]s or atoms or compound propositions built with such logical connectives as ''and'', ''or'', and ''not''.

Propositional dynamic logic, or PDL, was derived from dynamic logic in 1977 by [[Michael J. Fischer]] and Richard Ladner. PDL blends the ideas behind propositional logic and dynamic logic by adding actions while omitting data; hence the terms of PDL are actions and propositions. The TV example above is expressed in PDL whereas the next example involving &lt;math&gt;x:=x+1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is in first-order DL. PDL is to (first-order) dynamic logic as propositional logic is to first-order logic.

Fischer and Ladner showed in their 1977 paper that PDL satisfiability was of computational complexity at most nondeterministic exponential time, and at least deterministic exponential time in the worst case. This gap was closed in 1978 by [[Vaughan Pratt]] who showed that PDL was decidable in deterministic exponential time. In 1977, Krister Segerberg proposed a complete axiomatization of PDL, namely any complete axiomatization of modal logic K together with axioms A1-A6 as given above. Completeness proofs for Segerberg's axioms were found by [[dov Gabbay|Gabbay]] (unpublished note), Parikh (1978), Pratt (1979), and [[Dexter Kozen|Kozen]] and Parikh (1981).

==History==

Dynamic logic was developed by [[Vaughan Pratt]] in 1974 in notes for a class on program verification as an approach to assigning meaning to [[Hoare logic]] by expressing the Hoare formula &lt;math&gt;p \{ a \} q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;p \to [a]q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The approach was later published in 1976 as a [[logical system]] in its own right. The system parallels A. Salwicki's system of [[algorithmic logic]]&lt;ref name=AL&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirkowska|first=Grażyna|title=Algorithmic Logic|year=1987|publisher=PWN &amp; D. Reidel Publ.|location=Warszawa  &amp; Boston|isbn=8301068590|pages=372|author2=Salwicki A.|url=http://lem12.uksw.edu.pl/images/3/35/Algorithmic_Logic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s notion of weakest-precondition predicate transformer &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{wp}(a,p)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;[a]p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to Dijkstra's &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{wlp}(a,p)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, weakest liberal precondition. Those logics however made no connection with either modal logic, Kripke semantics, regular expressions, or the calculus of binary relations; dynamic logic therefore can be viewed as a refinement of algorithmic logic and [[Predicate transformer semantics|predicate transformers]] that connects them up to the axiomatics and Kripke semantics of modal logic as well as to the calculi of binary relations and regular expressions.

==The concurrency challenge==

Hoare logic, algorithmic logic, weakest preconditions, and dynamic logic are all well suited to discourse and reasoning about sequential behavior.  Extending these logics to concurrent behavior however has proved problematic.  There are various approaches but all of them lack the elegance of the sequential case.  In contrast [[Amir Pnueli]]'s 1977 system of [[temporal logic]], another variant of modal logic sharing many common features with dynamic logic, differs from all of the above-mentioned logics by being what Pnueli has characterized as an "endogenous" logic, the others being "exogenous" logics.  By this Pnueli meant that temporal logic assertions are interpreted within a universal behavioral framework in which a single global situation changes with the passage of time, whereas the assertions of the other logics are made externally  to the multiple actions about which they speak.  The advantage of the endogenous approach is that it makes no fundamental assumptions about what causes what as the environment changes with time.  Instead a temporal logic formula can talk about two unrelated parts of a system, which because they are unrelated tacitly evolve in parallel.  In effect ordinary logical conjunction of temporal assertions is the concurrent composition operator of temporal logic.  The simplicity of this approach to concurrency has resulted in temporal logic being the modal logic of choice for reasoning about concurrent systems with its aspects of synchronization, interference, independence, deadlock, livelock, fairness, etc.

These concerns of concurrency would appear to be less central to linguistics, philosophy, and artificial intelligence, the areas in which dynamic logic is most often encountered nowadays.

'''''"Everything is a file"''''' describes one of the defining features of [[Unix]], and its derivatives &amp;mdash; that a wide range of input/output [[System resource|resources]] such as documents, directories, hard-drives, modems, keyboards, printers and even some inter-process and network communications are simple streams of bytes exposed through the [[Unix directory structure|filesystem name space]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph7spot.com/musings/in-unix-everything-is-a-file]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320050159/http://ph7spot.com/musings/in-unix-everything-is-a-file |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of this approach is that the same set of tools, utilities and [[API]]s can be used on a wide range of resources. There are a number of [[Unix file types|file types]]. When a file is opened, a [[file descriptor]] is created. The [[Path (computing)|file path]] becoming the addressing system and the file descriptor being the byte stream I/O interface. But file descriptors are also created for things like [[anonymous pipe]]s and [[network socket]]s via different methods. So it is more accurate to say '''''"Everything is a file descriptor"'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linus Torvalds - "everything is a file descriptor or a process"|url=http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/everything_is_file.html|publisher=Yarchive.net|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghosts of Unix Past|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/411845/|publisher=Lwn.net|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a range of [[List of file systems#Pseudo- and virtual file systems|pseudo and virtual filesystems]] exists which exposes information about processes and other system information in a hierarchical file-like structure. These are [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] into the [[File system#Unix-like operating systems|single file hierarchy]].

An example of this purely virtual filesystem is under [[procfs|/proc]] that exposes many system properties as files.

All of these "files" have standard Unix file attributes such as [[chown|an owner]] and [[chmod|access permissions]], and can be queried by the same [[List of Unix commands|classic Unix tools]] and [[Filter (Unix)|filters]].  However, this is not universally considered a fast or portable approach. Some operating systems do not even mount /proc by default due to security or speed concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/linux-users/procfs.html |title=8. procfs: Gone But Not Forgotten |publisher=Freebsd.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, though, used heavily by both the widely installed [[BusyBox]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/libbb/procps.c |title=busybox - BusyBox: The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux |publisher=Git.busybox.net |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[embedded systems]] and by procps, which is used on most [[Linux]] systems. In both cases it is used in implementations of process-related [[POSIX]] shell commands. It is similarly used on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] systems in the operating system's Toolbox program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/master/toolbox/ps.c |title=platform_system_core/ps.c at master · android/platform_system_core · GitHub |publisher=Github.com |date=2015-03-09 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unix's successor [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] took this concept into [[Distributed operating system|distributed computing]] with the [[9P (protocol)|9P]] protocol.

{{Redirect|Gaussian Curve|the band|Gaussian Curve (band)}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''Gaussian function''', often simply referred to as a '''Gaussian''', is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a e^{- \frac{(x-b)^2 }{ 2 c^2} }&lt;/math&gt;

for arbitrary [[real number|real]] constants {{math|&lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;}}, {{math|&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;}} and non zero {{math|&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}}.  It is named after the mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. The [[graph of a function|graph]] of a Gaussian is a characteristic symmetric "[[Bell (instrument)|bell]] curve" shape. The parameter {{math|&lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;}} is the height of the curve's peak, {{math|&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;}} is the position of the center of the peak and {{math|&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}} (the [[standard deviation]], sometimes called the Gaussian [[Root mean square|RMS]] width) controls the width of the "bell".

Gaussian functions are often used to represent the [[probability density function]] of a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]] with [[expected value]] {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;}} and [[variance]] {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;σ&lt;/var&gt;{{sup|2}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;{{sup|2}}}}. In this case, the Gaussian is of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; g(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 }. &lt;/math&gt;

Gaussian functions are widely used in [[statistics]] to describe the [[normal distribution]]s, in [[signal processing]] to define [[Gaussian filter]]s, in [[image processing]] where two-dimensional Gaussians are used for [[Gaussian blur]]s, and in mathematics to solve [[heat equation]]s and [[diffusion equation]]s and to define the [[Weierstrass transform]].

==Properties==
Gaussian functions arise by composing the [[exponential function]] with a [[Concave function|concave]] [[quadratic function]]. The Gaussian functions are thus those functions whose [[logarithm]] is a concave quadratic function.

The parameter {{math|&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}} is related to the [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM) of the peak according to

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FWHM} = 2 \sqrt{2 \ln 2}\ c \approx 2.35482 c.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=rule&gt;Using the [[List of logarithmic identities|logarithmic identity]] &lt;math&gt;\log x = -\log \left( \frac 1 x \right)&lt;/math&gt;, this expression can be transformed to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FWHM} = 2 \sqrt{-2 \ln 0.5}\ c&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The function may then be expressed in terms of the FWHM, represented by {{math|&lt;var&gt;w&lt;/var&gt;}}:
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = a e^{- \frac{4 \ln (2) (x-b)^2 }{ w^2} }&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the parameter {{math|&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}} can be interpreted by saying that the two [[inflection point]]s of the function occur at {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}}.

The ''full width at tenth of maximum'' (FWTM) for a Gaussian could be of interest and is 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FWTM} = 2 \sqrt{2 \ln 10}\ c \approx 4.29193 c.&lt;/math&gt;

Gaussian functions are [[analytic function|analytic]], and their [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] as {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞}} is&amp;nbsp;0 (for the above case of {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}}).

Gaussian functions are among those functions that are [[Elementary function (differential algebra)|elementary]] but lack elementary [[antiderivative]]s; the [[integral]] of the Gaussian function is the [[error function]].  Nonetheless their improper integrals over the whole real line can be evaluated exactly, using the [[Gaussian integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx=\sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

and one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty a e^{- { (x-b)^2 \over 2 c^2 } }\,dx=ac\cdot\sqrt{2\pi}.&lt;/math&gt;

This integral is 1 if and only if &lt;math&gt;a = \tfrac{1}{c\sqrt{2\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;, and in this case the Gaussian is the [[probability density function]] of a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]] with [[expected value]] {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;}} and [[variance]] {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;σ&lt;/var&gt;{{sup|2}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;{{sup|2}}}}:

:&lt;math&gt; g(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 }. &lt;/math&gt;

These Gaussians are plotted in the accompanying figure.
[[Image:Normal Distribution PDF.svg|thumb|360px|right|[[Normalizing constant|Normalized]] Gaussian curves with [[expected value]] {{math|&lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt;}} and [[variance]] {{math|&lt;var&gt;σ&lt;/var&gt;{{sup|2}}}}. The corresponding parameters are &lt;math&gt;a = \tfrac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;,  {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;σ&lt;/var&gt;}}.]]

Gaussian functions centered at zero minimize the Fourier [[Fourier transform#Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]].

The product of two Gaussian functions is a Gaussian, and the [[convolution]] of two Gaussian functions is also a Gaussian, with variance being the sum of the original variances: &lt;math&gt;c^2 = c_1^2 + c_2^2&lt;/math&gt;.  The product of two Gaussian probability density functions, though, is not in general a Gaussian PDF.

Taking the [[Fourier transform#Other conventions|Fourier transform (unitary, angular frequency convention)]] of a Gaussian function with parameters {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1}}, {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}} yields another Gaussian function, with parameters &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}} and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric&amp;nbsp;W.|title=Fourier Transform&amp;nbsp;– Gaussian|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierTransformGaussian.html|publisher=[[MathWorld]]|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; So in particular the Gaussian functions with {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}} and &lt;math&gt;c = 1&lt;/math&gt; are kept fixed by the Fourier transform (they are [[eigenfunction]]s of the Fourier transform with eigenvalue&amp;nbsp;1).
&lt;!-- The way the Fourier transform is currently defined in its article (with pi in the exponent, also the way that I prefer), the Gaussian must also have a pi in its exponent. ~~~~ --&gt;
A physical realization is that of the [[Fraunhofer diffraction#Diffraction by an aperture with a Gaussian profile|diffraction pattern]]: for example, a [[photographic slide]] whose [[transmittance]] has a Gaussian variation is also a Gaussian function.

&lt;!--
Using [[periodic summation]] and [[discretization]] you can construct vectors from the Gaussian function,
that behave similarly under the [[Discrete Fourier transform]].
Comparing the zeroth coefficient of the Discrete Fourier transform of such a vector
with the periodic summation and discretization of the Continuous Fourier transform of the Gaussian yields the interesting identity:

The fact that the Gaussian function is an eigenfunction of the continuous Fourier transform
allows us to derive the following interesting{{clarify|date=August 2016}} identity from the [[Poisson summation formula]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}\exp\left(-\pi\cdot\left(\frac{k}{c}\right)^2\right) = c\cdot\sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}\exp(-\pi\cdot(kc)^2).&lt;/math&gt;

==Integral of a Gaussian function==
The integral of an arbitrary Gaussian function is

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty a\,e^{-\left( x-b \right)^2/2c^2}\,dx=\sqrt{2} a \, \left\vert c \right\vert \, \sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative form is

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty k\,e^{-f x^2 + g x + h}\,dx=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{k}{2f}\,e^{-f \left( x-g/(2f)\right)^2 +g^2/(4f) + h}\,dx=k\,\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{f}}\,\exp\left(\frac{g^2}{4f} + h\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' must be strictly positive for the integral to converge.

===Relation to standard Gaussian integral===

The integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty ae^{-(x-b)^2/2c^2}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

for some [[real number|real]] constants a, b, c &gt; 0 can be calculated by putting it into the form of a [[Gaussian integral]].  First, the constant ''a'' can simply be factored out of the integral. Next, the variable of integration is changed from ''x'' to ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''b''.

:&lt;math&gt;a\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-y^2/2c^2}\,dy&lt;/math&gt;

and then to &lt;math&gt;z=y/\sqrt{2 c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a\sqrt{2 c^2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-z^2}\,dz&lt;/math&gt;

Then, using the [[Gaussian integral|Gaussian integral identity]]

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-z^2}\,dz = \sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty ae^{-(x-b)^2/2c^2}\,dx=a\sqrt{2\pi c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Two-dimensional Gaussian function ==
[[Image:Gaussian 2d.svg|thumb|300px|Gaussian curve with a two-dimensional domain]]
In two dimensions, the power to which ''e'' is raised in the Gaussian function is any negative-definite quadratic form.  Consequently, the level sets of the Gaussian will always be ellipses.

A particular example of a two-dimensional Gaussian function is
&lt;!-- This makes the formula consistent with the 1d formula above --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = A \exp\left(- \left(\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y-y_o)^2}{2\sigma_y^2} \right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here the coefficient ''A'' is the amplitude, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the center and σ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, σ&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; are the ''x'' and ''y'' spreads of the blob.  The figure on the right was created using ''A'' = 1, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, σ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = σ&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.

The volume under the Gaussian function is given by
:&lt;math&gt;V = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x,y)\,dx \,dy=2 \pi A \sigma_x \sigma_y.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, a two-dimensional elliptical Gaussian function is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = A \exp\left(- \left(a(x - x_o)^2 + 2b(x-x_o)(y-y_o) + c(y-y_o)^2 \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{matrix} a &amp; b \\ b &amp; c \end{matrix}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

is [[positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]].

Using this formulation, the figure on the right can be created using ''A'' = 1, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) = (0, 0), ''a'' = ''c'' = 1/2, ''b'' = 0.

=== Meaning of parameters for the general equation ===
For the general form of the equation the coefficient ''A'' is the height of the peak and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) is the center of the blob.

If we set

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{\cos^2\theta}{2\sigma_x^2} + \frac{\sin^2\theta}{2\sigma_y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- extra blank line between two lines of displayed TeX, for legibility --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b = -\frac{\sin2\theta}{4\sigma_x^2} + \frac{\sin2\theta}{4\sigma_y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- extra blank line between two lines of displayed TeX, for legibility --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{\sin^2\theta}{2\sigma_x^2} + \frac{\cos^2\theta}{2\sigma_y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

then we rotate the blob by a clockwise angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (for counterclockwise rotation invert the signs in the b coefficient). This can be seen in the following examples:

{|
| [[Image:Gaussian 2d 1.svg|thumb|200px|&lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;]]
| [[Image:Gaussian 2d 2.svg|thumb|200px|&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi/6&lt;/math&gt;]]
| [[Image:Gaussian 2d 3.svg|thumb|200px|&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi/3&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

Using the following [[GNU Octave|Octave]] code, one can easily see the effect of changing the parameters

&lt;source lang="octave"&gt;
A = 1;
x0 = 0; y0 = 0;

sigma_x = 1;
sigma_y = 2;

[X, Y] = meshgrid(-5:.1:5, -5:.1:5);

for theta = 0:pi/100:pi
    a = cos(theta)^2/(2*sigma_x^2) + sin(theta)^2/(2*sigma_y^2);
    b = -sin(2*theta)/(4*sigma_x^2) + sin(2*theta)/(4*sigma_y^2);
    c = sin(theta)^2/(2*sigma_x^2) + cos(theta)^2/(2*sigma_y^2);

    Z = A*exp( - (a*(X-x0).^2 + 2*b*(X-x0).*(Y-y0) + c*(Y-y0).^2));

surf(X,Y,Z);shading interp;view(-36,36)
waitforbuttonpress
end

&lt;/source&gt;

Such functions are often used in [[image processing]] and in computational models of [[visual system]] function—see the articles on [[scale space]] and [[affine shn]].

Also see [[multivariate normal distribution]].

=== Higher-order Gaussian or super-Gaussian function ===
A more general formulation of a Gaussian function with a flat-top and Gaussian fall-off can be taken by raising the content of the exponent to a power, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = A \exp\left(-\left(\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\sigma_x^2}\right)^P\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This function is known as a super-Gaussian function and is often used for Gaussian beam formulation.&lt;ref&gt;Parent, A., M. Morin, and P. Lavigne. "Propagation of super-Gaussian field distributions." ''Optical and quantum electronics'' 24.9 (1992): S1071-S1079.&lt;/ref&gt; In a two-dimensional formulation, a Gaussian function along &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can be combined with potentially different &lt;math&gt;P_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_y&lt;/math&gt; to form an elliptical Gaussian distribution,&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = A \exp\left(- \left(\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y-y_o)^2}{2\sigma_y^2} \right)^P\right)&lt;/math&gt; or a rectangular Gaussian distribution, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = A \exp\left(- \left(\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\sigma_x^2}\right)^{P_x} - \left(\frac{(y-y_o)^2}{2\sigma_y^2} \right)^{P_y}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aor.com/anonymous/pub/commands.pdf|title=GLAD optical software commands manual, Entry on GAUSSIAN command|last=|first=|date=2016-12-15|website=Applied Optics Research|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multi-dimensional Gaussian function ==
{{main article|Multivariate normal distribution}}
In an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space a Gaussian function can be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \exp(-x^TAx) \;,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a column of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; coordinates, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]] &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix, and &lt;math&gt;{}^T&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[transpose|matrix transposition]].

The integral of this Gaussian function over the whole &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space is given as
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \exp(-x^TAx) \, dx = \sqrt{\frac{\pi^n}{\det A}} \;.
&lt;/math&gt;
It can be easily calculated by diagonalizing the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and changing the integration variables to the eigenvectors of  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally a shifted Gaussian function is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \exp(-x^TAx+s^Tx) \;,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;s=\{s_1,\dots,s_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is the shift vector and the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be assumed to be symmetric, &lt;math&gt;A^T=A&lt;/math&gt;, and positive-definite. The following integrals with this function can be calculated with the same technique,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-x^T A x+v^Tx} \, dx = \sqrt{\frac{\pi^n}{\det{A}}} \exp\left(\frac{1}{4}v^T A^{-1}v\right)\equiv \mathcal{M}\;. \\[6pt]
&amp; \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{- x^T A x + v^T x}  \left( a^T x \right) \, dx = (a^T u) \cdot \mathcal{M}\;,\text{ where } u = \frac{1}{2} A^{- 1} v \;. \\[6pt]
&amp; \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{- x^T A x + v^T x} (x^T D x) \, dx = \left( u^T D u +
\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{tr} (D A^{- 1}) \right) \cdot \mathcal{M}\;. \\[6pt]
&amp; \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{- x^T A' x + s'^T x} \left( -\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \Lambda \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) e^{-x^T A x + s^T x} \, dx \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \left( 2 \operatorname{tr} (A' \Lambda A B^{- 1}) + 4 u^T A' \Lambda A u - 2 u^T (A' \Lambda s + A \Lambda s') + s'^T \Lambda s \right) \cdot \mathcal{M}\;,\\[6pt]
&amp; \text{where } u = \frac{1}{2} B^{- 1} v, v = s + s', B = A + A' \;.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Gaussian profile estimation ==
A number of fields such as [[Photometry (astronomy)|stellar photometry]], [[Gaussian beam]] characterization, and [[emission spectrum#Emission spectroscopy|emission/absorption line spectroscopy]] work with sampled Gaussian functions and need to accurately estimate the height, position, and width parameters of the function. These are &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for a 1D Gaussian function, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_x,\sigma_y)&lt;/math&gt; for a 2D Gaussian function. The most common method for estimating the profile parameters is to take the logarithm of the data and fit a parabola to the resulting data set.&lt;ref name="Guo"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2011.941846 Hongwei Guo, "A simple algorithm for fitting a Gaussian function," IEEE Sign. Proc. Mag. 28(9): 134-137 (2011).]&lt;/ref&gt; While this provides a simple [[least squares]] fitting procedure, the resulting algorithm is biased by excessively weighting small data values, and this can produce large errors in the profile estimate. One can partially compensate for this through [[least squares#Weighted least squares|weighted least squares]] estimation, in which the small data values are given small weights, but this too can be biased by allowing the tail of the Gaussian to dominate the fit. In order to remove the bias, one can instead use an iterative procedure in which the weights are updated at each iteration (see [[Iteratively reweighted least squares]]).&lt;ref name="Guo" /&gt;

Once one has an algorithm for estimating the Gaussian function parameters, it is also important to know how accurate those estimates are. While an estimation algorithm can provide numerical estimates for the variance of each parameter (i.e. the variance of the estimated height, position, and width of the function), one can use [[Cramér–Rao bound]] theory to obtain an analytical expression for the lower bound on the parameter variances, given some assumptions about the data.&lt;ref name="Hagen1"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1364/AO.46.005374 N. Hagen, M. Kupinski, and E. L. Dereniak, "Gaussian profile estimation in one dimension," Appl. Opt. 46:5374–5383 (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagen2"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1364/AO.47.006842 N. Hagen and E. L. Dereniak, "Gaussian profile estimation in two dimensions," Appl. Opt. 47:6842–6851 (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The noise in the measured profile is either [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|i.i.d.]] Gaussian, or the noise is [[Poisson distribution|Poisson-distributed]].
# The spacing between each sampling (i.e. the distance between pixels measuring the data) is uniform.
# The peak is "well-sampled", so that less than 10% of the area or volume under the peak (area if a 1D Gaussian, volume if a 2D Gaussian) lies outside the measurement region.
# The width of the peak is much larger than the distance between sample locations (i.e. the detector pixels must be at least 5 times smaller than the Gaussian FWHM).
When these assumptions are satisfied, the following covariance matrix '''K''' applies for the 1D profile parameters &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; under i.i.d. Gaussian noise and under Poisson noise:&lt;ref name="Hagen1" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{K}_{\text{Gauss}} = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sqrt{\pi} \delta_x Q^2} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3}{2c} &amp;0 &amp;\frac{-1}{a} \\ 0 &amp;\frac{2c}{a^2} &amp;0 \\ \frac{-1}{a} &amp;0 &amp;\frac{2c}{a^2} \end{pmatrix} \ , \qquad \mathbf{K}_\text{Poiss} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3a}{2c} &amp;0 &amp;-\frac{1}{2} \\ 0 &amp;\frac{c}{a} &amp;0 \\ -\frac{1}{2} &amp;0 &amp;\frac{c}{2a} \end{pmatrix} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_x&lt;/math&gt; is the width of the pixels used to sample the function, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the quantum efficiency of the detector, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; indicates the standard deviation of the measurement noise. Thus, the individual variances for the parameters are, in the Gaussian noise case,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \operatorname{var} (a) &amp;= \frac{3 \sigma^2}{2 \sqrt{\pi} \, \delta_x Q^2 c} \\ \operatorname{var} (b) &amp;= \frac{2 \sigma^2 c}{\delta_x \sqrt{\pi} \, Q^2 a^2} \\ \operatorname{var} (c) &amp;= \frac{2 \sigma^2 c}{\delta_x \sqrt{\pi} \, Q^2 a^2} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and in the Poisson noise case,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \operatorname{var} (a) &amp;= \frac{3a}{2 \sqrt{2 \pi} \, c} \\ \operatorname{var} (b) &amp;= \frac{c}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \, a} \\ \operatorname{var} (c) &amp;= \frac{c}{2 \sqrt{2 \pi} \, a}. \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

For the 2D profile parameters giving the amplitude &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, position &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt;, and width &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_x,\sigma_y)&lt;/math&gt; of the profile, the following covariance matrices apply:&lt;ref name="Hagen2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{K}_\text{Gauss} = \frac{\sigma^2}{\pi \delta_x \delta_y Q^2} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{2}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;\frac{-1}{A \sigma_y} &amp;\frac{-1}{A \sigma_x} \\ 0
      &amp;\frac{2 \sigma_x}{A^2 \sigma_y} &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp;0 &amp;\frac{2 \sigma_y}{A^2 \sigma_x} &amp;0 &amp;0 \\ \frac{-1}{A \sigma_y} &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;\frac{2 \sigma_x}{A^2 \sigma_y} &amp;0 \\
      \frac{-1}{A \sigma_x} &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;\frac{2 \sigma_y}{A^2 \sigma_x} \end{pmatrix} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \mathbf{K}_{\operatorname{Poiss}} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3A}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;\frac{-1}{\sigma_y} &amp;\frac{-1}{\sigma_x} \\ 0
      &amp;\frac{\sigma_x}{A \sigma_y} &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp;0 &amp;\frac{\sigma_y}{A \sigma_x} &amp;0 &amp;0 \\ \frac{-1}{\sigma_y} &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;\frac{2 \sigma_x}{3A \sigma_y} &amp;\frac{1}{3A} \\
      \frac{-1}{\sigma_x} &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;\frac{1}{3A} &amp;\frac{2 \sigma_y}{3A \sigma_x} \end{pmatrix} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

where the individual parameter variances are given by the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.

== Discrete Gaussian ==
{{main article|Discrete Gaussian kernel}}
[[File:Discrete Gaussian kernel.svg|thumb|The [[discrete Gaussian kernel]] (solid), compared with the [[sampled Gaussian kernel]] (dashed) for scales &lt;math&gt;t=0.5,1,2,4.&lt;/math&gt;]]
One may ask for a discrete analog to the Gaussian;
this is necessary in discrete applications, particularly [[digital signal processing]]. A simple answer is to sample the continuous Gaussian, yielding the [[sampled Gaussian kernel]]. However, this discrete function does not have the discrete analogs of the properties of the continuous function, and can lead to undesired effects, as described in the article [[scale space implementation]].

An alternative approach is to use [[discrete Gaussian kernel]]:&lt;ref name="tpl90"&gt;[http://www.nada.kth.se/~tony/abstracts/Lin90-PAMI.html Lindeberg, T., "Scale-space for discrete signals," PAMI(12), No. 3, March 1990, pp. 234–254.]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T(n, t) = e^{-t} I_n(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[modified Bessel function]]s of integer order.

This is the discrete analog of the continuous Gaussian in that it is the solution to the discrete [[diffusion equation]] (discrete space, continuous time), just as the continuous Gaussian is the solution to the continuous diffusion equation.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J, 2007, ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2007.08.001 The SMM model as a boundary value problem using the discrete diffusion equation]'', Theor Popul Biol. 2007 Dec;72(4):539–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Gaussian functions appear in many contexts in the [[natural sciences]], the [[social sciences]], [[mathematics]], and [[engineering]].  Some examples include:
* In [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], Gaussian functions appear as the density function of the [[normal distribution]], which is a limiting [[probability distribution]] of complicated sums, according to the [[central limit theorem]].
* Gaussian functions are the [[Green's function]] for the (homogeneous and isotropic) [[diffusion equation]] (and to the [[heat equation]], which is the same thing), a [[partial differential equation]] that describes the time evolution of a mass-density under [[diffusion]]. Specifically, if the mass-density at time ''t''=0 is given by a [[Dirac delta]], which essentially means that the mass is initially concentrated in a single point, then the mass-distribution at time ''t'' will be given by a Gaussian function, with the parameter ''a'' being linearly related to 1/{{radic|''t''}} and ''c'' being linearly related to {{radic|''t''}}; this time-varying Gaussian is described by the [[heat kernel]]. More generally, if the initial mass-density is &amp;phi;(''x''), then the mass-density at later times is obtained by taking the [[convolution]] of &amp;phi; with a Gaussian function. The convolution of a function with a Gaussian is also known as a [[Weierstrass transform]].
* A Gaussian function is the [[wave function]] of the [[ground state]] of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]].
* The [[molecular orbital]]s used in [[computational chemistry]] can be [[linear combination]]s of Gaussian functions called [[Gaussian orbital]]s (see also [[basis set (chemistry)]]).
* Mathematically, the [[derivative]]s of the Gaussian function can be represented using [[Hermite functions]].  The ''n''-th derivative of the Gaussian is the Gaussian function itself multiplied by the ''n''-th [[Hermite polynomial]], up to scale.  
* Consequently, Gaussian functions are also associated with the [[vacuum state]] in [[quantum field theory]].
* [[Gaussian beam]]s are used in optical systems, microwave systems and lasers.
* In [[scale space]] representation, Gaussian functions are used as smoothing kernels for generating multi-scale representations in [[computer vision]] and [[image processing]]. Specifically, derivatives of Gaussians ([[Hermite functions]]) are used as a basis for defining a large number of types of visual operations.
* Gaussian functions are used to define some types of [[artificial neural network]]s.
* In [[fluorescence microscopy]] a 2D Gaussian function is used to approximate the [[Airy disk]], describing the intensity distribution produced by a [[point source]].
* In [[signal processing]] they serve to define [[Gaussian filter]]s, such as in [[image processing]] where 2D Gaussians are used for [[Gaussian blur]]s. In [[digital signal processing]], one uses a [[discrete Gaussian kernel]], which may be defined by sampling a Gaussian, or in a different way.
* In [[geostatistics]] they have been used for understanding the variability between the patterns of a complex [[training image]]. They are used with kernel methods to cluster the patterns in the feature space.&lt;ref&gt;Honarkhah, M and Caers, J, 2010, ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11004-010-9276-7 Stochastic Simulation of Patterns Using Distance-Based Pattern Modeling]'', Mathematical Geosciences, 42: 487–517&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 128-bit variant was submitted as an [[eSTREAM]] cipher candidate and has been selected as one of the four final contestants in the software profile.&lt;ref name="hc-128"&gt;{{cite journal

|title=The Stream Cipher HC-128

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=The eSTREAM Project
|url=http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/index.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm is designed by [[Hongjun Wu]], and was first published in 2004. It is not patented.

==Function==
HC-256 has a 256 bit key and an [[initialization vector]] (nonce) of 256 bits.&lt;ref name="hc-256"/&gt;

Internally, it consists of two secret tables (P and Q). Each table contains 1024 32-bit words. For each state update one 32-bit word in each table is updated using a non-linear update function. After 2048 steps all elements of the tables have been updated.

It generates one 32-bit [[Word (data type)|word]] for each update step using a 32-bit to 32-bit mapping function similar to the output function of the [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]] cipher. Finally a linear bit-masking function is applied to generate an output word. It uses the two message schedule functions in the [[hash function]] [[SHA-256]] internally, but with the tables P and Q as [[S-box]]es.

HC-128 is similar in function, and reduces each of key length, nonce, number of words in the tables P and Q, and number of table updating steps by half.&lt;ref name="hc-128"/&gt;

==Performance==
The performance of HC-256 is estimated by its author to be about 4 [[cycles per byte]] on a [[Pentium 4]] processor. However the initialization phase of the cipher includes expanding the 256-bit key into the tables P, Q and then running the cipher for 4096 steps. The author of HC-256 estimates this process to take around 74,000 cycles.

For HC-128 an encryption speed of about 3 cycles per byte on a [[Pentium M]] processor are cited.

The implementation of HC-128 on various computing structures is studied in detail, with significant performance gains compared to naive SW implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chattopadhyay|first=Anupam|author2=Ayesha Khalid |author3=Subhamoy Maitra |author4=Shashwat Raizada |title=Designing High-Throughput Hardware Accelerator for Stream Cipher HC-128|journal=IEEE ISCAS|date=May 2012|url=http://www.ice.rwth-aachen.de/publications/publications-detail/bib/chattopadhyay12/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khalid|first=Ayesha |author2=Deblin Bagchi |author3=Goutam Paul |author4=Anupam Chattopadhyay|title=Optimized GPU Implementation and Performance Analysis of HC Series of Stream Ciphers|journal=15th Annual International Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ICISC)|date=Nov 2012|url=http://www.ice.rwth-aachen.de/publications/publications-detail/bib/khalid12/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Cotterill''' {{post-nominals|DD|LLD|FRSE}} (1812 – 16 April 1886) was an [[Anglican]] bishop serving in [[South Africa]] in the second half of the 19th century. From 1872 until death he was a bishop of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] in [[Edinburgh]].

== Early life ==

Cotterill was born in [[Ampton]] in 1812 into an ecclesiastical family{{sfn|Nutter|1911}} of committed Church Evangelicals.  His father, Joseph Cotterill (1780 – 1858), was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Blakeney, Norfolk|Blakeney]], Norfolk, and a [[prebendary]] of [[Norwich Cathedral]]. His mother, Anne Boak,{{sfn| Waterston| Macmillan Shearer|2006|p=206}} was a close friend of [[Hannah More]].{{sfn|Jones|1995|p=}} Educated at his father's old college, [[St John's College, Cambridge]], he was both [[List of Wranglers of the University of Cambridge|Senior Wrangler]] and headed the list of Classicists in 1835,{{sfn|Craik|2008|pp=254–}} on the strength of which he was elected as a [[Fellow]] of his college.&lt;ref name="AutoI3-1"/&gt;{{sfn|Neale|1907|p=34}} Influenced by [[Charles Simeon]], he was [[ordained]] in 1836 and went to India as Chaplain to the [[Madras Presidency]] the following year.&lt;ref name="spud_Deta"/&gt;{{sfn|Jones|1995|pp=26, 41}} Forced by malaria to return to England in 1846, he became inaugural [[Vice Principal]] and then the second [[Principal (academia)|Principal]] of [[Brighton College]].{{sfn|Jones|1995|pp=26, 41}} In post less than six years, he reinvigorated the languishing infant school. In a whirlwind of energetic reform, he overhauled the curriculum by introducing the teaching of the sciences and oriental languages, restored discipline, launched a fund to build a chapel, built the first on-site boarding house and connected the school to the town's gas supply.{{sfn|Jones|1995|pp=41 – 46, 50, 53 – 54, 116 – 117}}

== Bishop of Grahamstown ==

At the suggestion of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]] and [[John Sumner (bishop)|John Sumner]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]],{{sfn|Jones|1995|p=46}} he was nominated and consecrated{{sfn|Cotton|1856}} in 1856 as the second colonial [[Bishop of Grahamstown]]&lt;ref name="brit_Cons"/&gt; in South Africa. As was then customary, he was simultaneously created a [[Doctor of Divinity]] (DD).{{sfn|Hefling|Shattuck|2008|p=}}

Cotterill was consecrated on 23 November 1856, and arrived in Grahamstown in May 1857. Bishop Cotterill's episcopate was occupied with the
development and consolidation of his diocese, and with the institution of diocesan and provincial synods. The opening service of the first synod of the diocese was held in the [[St Michael and St George Cathedral, Grahamstown|Grahamstown Cathedral]] on 20 June 1860. It may be of interest to record
that H. Blaine and F. Carlisle were the representatives of the Cathedral congregation at the synod.

As one of the bishops of South Africa, he sat in judgement in December 1863 on [[John Colenso]], [[Bishop of Natal]], his college friend from Cambridge days.

== Translation to Edinburgh ==

He was [[Translation (ecclesiastical)|translated]] to [[Edinburgh]] in 1871 as coadjutor bishop of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], and was created a full diocesan bishop in 1872.&lt;ref name="AutoI3-2"/&gt;

During his time in Edinburgh he resided at 10 North Manor Place (later renumbered as 56 Manor Place), just north of his place of worship [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Episcopal)|St Mary's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1880&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in post in [[Edinburgh]] in 1886 and was buried between the choir stalls in the cathedral.&lt;ref name="AutoI3-3"/&gt; His grave is covered by a large memorial brass made by [[Francis Skidmore]]{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} of Coventry.

== Family life ==

In 1836 he married Anna Isabella Parnther (1812-1899){{sfn| Waterston|Macmillan Shearer|2006|p=206}}       who had been born in [[Jamaica]].

They had at least two daughters and four sons.&lt;ref name="AutoI3-4"/&gt; The four boys all attended [[Brighton College]]. George Edward (1839 – 1913), a Cambridge cricket blue and Sussex cricketer, was briefly Headmaster of [[St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown]] (1863 – 65) before returning to teach at Brighton College (1865 – 81). Henry Bernard (1846 – 1924) was an African missionary explorer and writer. [[Joseph Montagu Cotterill]] (1851 – 1933) played cricket for [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and became President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] and was knighted. Arthur John (1849 – 1915) was Engineer-in-Chief, Egyptian Railways.

His brother George was on the teaching staff of [[Brighton College]] 1849 – 51 before emigrating to [[New Zealand]] while, intriguingly, his youngest brother, James Henry, was a pupil at the school while he was the Principal. James Henry became Professor of Applied Mathematics at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]] (1873 – 97) and was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1878.

'''Herbert Saul Wilf''' (June 13, 1931 – January 7, 2012) was a [[mathematician]], specializing in [[combinatorics]] and [[graph theory]].  He was the [[Thomas A. Scott Professorship of Mathematics|Thomas A. Scott Professor of Mathematics]] in Combinatorial Analysis and Computing at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  He wrote numerous books and research papers. Together with [[Neil Calkin]] he founded  ''[[The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics]]'' in 1994 and was its editor-in-chief until 2001.

== Biography ==
Wilf was the author of numerous papers and books, and was adviser and mentor to many students and colleagues. His collaborators include [[Doron Zeilberger]] and [[Donald Knuth]]. One of Wilf's former students is [[Richard Garfield]], the creator of the [[collectible card game]] ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''. He also served as a thesis advisor for [[E. Roy Weintraub]] in the late 1960s.

Wilf died of a progressive [[neuromuscular disease]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.upenn.edu/History/obits/Herb_Wilf.html |title=In Memoriam: Herbert S. Wilf |publisher=Math.upenn.edu |date=1931-06-13 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120152536/http://www.math.upenn.edu/History/obits/Herb_Wilf.html |archivedate=2012-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In 1998, Wilf and Zeilberger received the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] for Seminal Contribution to Research for their joint paper, "Rational functions certify combinatorial identities" (''[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]]'', 3 (1990) 147–158).  The prize citation reads: "New mathematical ideas can have an impact on experts in a field, on people outside the field, and on how the field develops after the idea has been introduced.  The remarkably simple idea of the work of Wilf and Zeilberger has already changed a part of mathematics for the experts, for the high-level users outside the area, and the area itself." Their work has been translated into computer packages that have simplified [[hypergeometric summation]].

In 2002, Wilf was awarded the [[Euler Medal]] by the [[Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications]].

In [[mathematical logic]], an '''implication graph''' is a [[skew-symmetric graph|skew-symmetric]] [[directed graph]] ''G''(''V'', ''E'') composed of vertex set ''V'' and directed edge set ''E''. Each vertex in ''V'' represents the truth status of a [[Boolean literal]], and each directed edge from vertex ''u'' to vertex ''v'' represents the [[material conditional|material implication]] "If the literal ''u'' is true then the literal ''v'' is also true". Implication graphs were originally used for analyzing complex [[Boolean expression]]s.

==Applications==
A [[2-satisfiability]] instance in [[conjunctive normal form]] can be transformed into an implication graph by replacing each of its [[disjunction]]s by a pair of implications. For example, the statement &lt;math&gt;(x_0\lor x_1)&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten as the pair &lt;math&gt;(\neg x_0 \rightarrow x_1), (\neg x_1 \rightarrow x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. An instance is satisfiable if and only if no literal and its negation belong to the same [[strongly connected component]] of its implication graph; this characterization can be used to solve 2-satisfiability instances in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Aspvall, Bengt; [[Michael Plass|Plass, Michael F.]]; [[Robert Tarjan|Tarjan, Robert E.]]|title = A linear-time algorithm for testing the truth of certain quantified boolean formulas|journal = Information Processing Letters | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 121–123|year = 1979|doi = 10.1016/0020-0190(79)90002-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[CDCL]] [[SAT]]-solvers, [[unit propagation]] can be naturally associated with an implication graph that captures all possible ways of deriving all implied literals from decision literals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Paul Beame |author2=Henry Kautz |author3=Ashish Sabharwal |title = Understanding the Power of Clause Learning| conference = IJCAI |  pages = 1194–1201|year = 2003|url=https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/papers/learnIjcai.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is then used for clause learning.

'''Inequity aversion''' ('''IA''') is the [[social preference|preference]] for fairness and resistance to incidental inequalities.&lt;ref name="Fehr"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fehr |first=E. |author2=Schmidt, K.M. |authorlink=Ernst Fehr |year= 1999 |title=A theory of fairness, competition, and cooperation |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=817–68 |doi=10.1162/003355399556151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social sciences that study inequity aversion include [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[ethology]].

==Human studies==
Inequity aversion research on humans mostly occurs in the discipline of [[economics]] though it is also studied in [[sociology]].

Research on inequity aversion began in 1978 when studies suggested that humans are sensitive to inequities in favor of as well as those against them, and that some people attempt overcompensation when they feel "guilty" or unhappy to have received an undeserved reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1978 |last=Walster |author2=Berscheid |authorlink2=Ellen S. Berscheid  |title=Equity: theory and research |isbn=0-205-05929-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent definition of inequity aversion (resistance to inequitable outcomes) was developed in 1999 by Fehr and Schmidt.&lt;ref name="Fehr"/&gt; They postulated that people make decisions so as to minimize inequity in outcomes. Specifically, consider a setting with individuals {1,2,...,''n''} who receive pecuniary outcomes ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the utility to person ''i'' would be given by 
:&lt;math&gt;U_i(\{x_i, x_j\}) = x_i - \frac{\alpha_i}{n-1} \times \sum{\max(x_j - x_i,0)} - \frac{\beta_i}{n-1} \times \sum{\max(x_i - x_j,0)},&lt;/math&gt;

where α parametrizes the distaste of person ''i'' for disadvantageous inequality in the first nonstandard term, and β parametrizes the distaste of person ''i'' for advantageous inequality in the final term.

===Punishing unjust success and game theory===
Fehr and Schmidt showed that disadvantageous inequity aversion manifests itself in humans as the "willingness to sacrifice potential gain to block another individual from receiving a superior reward". They argue that this apparently self-destructive response is essential in creating an environment in which bilateral bargaining can thrive. Without inequity aversion's rejection of injustice, stable cooperation would be harder to maintain (for instance, there would be more opportunities for successful [[free rider problem|free riders]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/726/1/Fehr-Schmidt_Handbook_2005-Munichecon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James H. Fowler]] and his colleagues also argue that inequity aversion is essential for cooperation in multilateral settings.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler JH, Johnson T, Smirnov O. "Egalitarian Motive and Altruistic Punishment," ''Nature'' 433: {{doi|10.1038/nature03256}} (6 January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they show that subjects in ''random income'' games (closely related to public goods games) are willing to spend their own money to reduce the income of wealthier group members and increase the income of poorer group members even when there is no cooperation at stake.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes CT, Fowler JH, Johnson T, McElreath R, Smirnov O. "Egalitarian Motives in Humans," ''Nature'' 446: 794–96, {{doi|10.1038/nature05651}} (12 April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, individuals who free ride on the contributions of fellow group members are likely to be punished because they earn more, creating a decentralized incentive for the maintenance of cooperation.

===Experimental economics===
Inequity aversion is broadly consistent with observations of behavior in three standard [[experimental economics|economics experiments]]:
# [[Dictator game]] – The subject chooses how a reward should be split between himself and another subject. If the dictator acted self-interestedly, the split would consist of 0 for the partner and the full amount for the dictator. While the most common choice is indeed to keep everything, many dictators choose to give, with the second most common choice being the 50:50 split. 
# [[Ultimatum game]] – The dictator game is played, but the recipient is allowed to veto the entire deal, so that both subjects receive nothing. The partner typically vetos the deal when low offers are made. People consistently prefer getting nothing to receiving a small share of the pie. Rejecting the offer is in effect paying to punish the dictator (called the ''proposer'').
# [[Trust game]] – The same result as found in the dictator game shows up when the dictator's initial endowment is provided by his partner, even though this requires the first player to trust that something will be returned (reciprocity). This experiment often yields a 50:50 split of the endowment, and has been used as evidence of the inequity aversion model.

In 2005, John List modified these experiments slightly to determine if something in the construction of the experiments was prompting specific behaviors. When given a choice to steal money from the other player, even a single dollar, the observed altruism all but disappeared. In another experiment, the two players were given a sum of money and the choice to give or take any amount from the other player. In this experiment, only 10% of the participants gave the other person any money at all, and fully 40% of the players opted to take all of the other player's money.

The last such experiment was identical to the former, where 40% were turned into a gang of robbers, with one catch: the two players were forced to earn the money by stuffing envelopes. In this last experiment, more than two thirds of the players neither took nor gave a cent, while just over 20% still took some of the other player's money.

In 2011, Ert Erev and Roth&lt;ref&gt;Ert E, Erev I, Roth AE "[http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/2/3/257 A Choice Prediction Competition for Social Preferences in Simple Extensive Form Games: An Introduction]." Games 2.3 (2011): 257–76.&lt;/ref&gt; ran a model prediction competition on two datasets, each of which included 120 two-player games. In each game player 1 decides whether to "opt out" and determine the payoffs for both players, or to "opt in" and let player 2 decide about the payoff allocation by choosing between actions "left" or "right". The payoffs were randomly selected, so the dataset included games like the Ultimatum, Dictator, and Trust, as well as other games. The results suggested that inequity aversion could be described as one of many strategies that people might use in such games.

Other research in experimental economics addresses risk aversion in decision making&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Joyce E., and Thomas A. Rietz's [[University of Iowa]] Discussion Paper, from 1997 ''Do Unto Others: A Theory and Experimental Test of Interpersonal Factors in Decision Making Under Uncertainty'' examines the increased risk aversion from [[lottery]]-choice games to multi-party dealing. It suggests that this could be explained by altruism and a concern for an equitable distribution among all parties (fairness). This paper also used the phrase 'inequity aversion'&lt;/ref&gt; and the comparison of inequality measures to subjective judgments on perceived inequalities.&lt;ref name="AmielCowell"&gt;Yoram Amiel (author), Frank A. Cowell: ''Thinking about Inequality: Personal Judgment and Income Distributions'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies of companies===
Surveys of employee opinions within firms have shown modern [[labor economist]]s that inequity aversion is very important to them. Employees compare not only relative [[salary|salaries]] but also relative performance against that of co-workers. Where these comparisons lead to guilt or envy, inequity aversion may lower employee morale. According to Bewley (1999), the main reason that [[management|managers]] create formal pay structures is so that the inter-employee comparison is seen to be "fair", which they considered "key" for morale and [[job performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, T. (1999) ''Why wages don't fall during a Recession''. Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|0-674-95241-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is natural to think of inequity aversion leading to greater [[solidarity]] within the labor pool, to the benefit of the average employee. However, a 2008 paper by Pedro Rey-Biel shows that this assumption can be subverted, and that an employer can use inequity aversion to get higher performance for less pay than would be possible otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9442.2008.00540.x/abstract |title=Inequity Aversion and Team Incentives |journal= [[The Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] |volume=10 |issue= 2 |pages= 297–320 |first= P. |last=Rey-Biel|date=June 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9442.2008.00540.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by moving away from formal pay structures and using off-[[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] [[Performance-related pay|bonus payments]] as incentives for extra performance. He shows that the optimal [[contract]] for inequity aversion employees is less generous at the optimal production level than contracts for "standard agents" (who don't have inequity aversion) in an otherwise identical two-employee model.

===Criticisms===
In 2005 Avner Shaked distributed a "pamphlet" entitled "The [[Rhetoric]] of Inequity Aversion" that attacked the inequity aversion papers of Fehr &amp; Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shaked|first1=Avner|title=The Rhetoric of Inequity Aversion|date=2005|SSRN=675227}} [[Bonn University]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Shaked has published an extended version of the criticism together with [[Kenneth Binmore|Ken Binmore]] in the ''Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization'' (the same issue also contains a reply by Fehr and Schmidt and a rejoinder by Binmore and Shaked).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental economics: Where next?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109002820|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2010|pages = 87–100|volume = 73|series = On the Methodology of Experimental Economics|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2008.10.019|first = Ken|last = Binmore|first2 = Avner|last2 = Shaked}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On inequity aversion: A reply to Binmore and Shaked|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109002844|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2010|pages = 101–08|volume = 73|series = On the Methodology of Experimental Economics|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2009.12.001|first = Ernst|last = Fehr|first2 = Klaus M.|last2 = Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental Economics: Where Next? Rejoinder|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109002832|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2010|pages = 120–21|volume = 73|series = On the Methodology of Experimental Economics|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2009.11.008|first = Ken|last = Binmore|first2 = Avner|last2 = Shaked}}&lt;/ref&gt; A problem of inequity aversion models is the fact that there are free parameters; standard theory is simply a special case of the inequity aversion model. Hence, by construction inequity aversion must always be at least as good as standard theory when the inequity aversion parameters can be chosen after seeing the data. Binmore and Shaked also point out that Fehr and Schmidt (1999) pick a distribution of alpha and beta without conducting a formal estimation. The perfect correlation between the alpha and beta parameters in Fehr and Schmidt (1999) is an assumption made in the appendix of their paper that is not justified by the data that they provide. 

More recently, several papers have estimated Fehr-Schmidt inequity aversion parameters using estimation techniques such as [[maximum likelihood]]. The results are mixed. Some authors have found beta larger than alpha, which contradicts a central assumption made by Fehr and Schmidt (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Inequity Aversion in a Heterogeneous Population Using Experimental Decisions and Subjective Probabilities|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2008.00860.x/abstract|journal = Econometrica|date = 2008|issn = 1468-0262|pages = 815–39|volume = 76|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0262.2008.00860.x|language = en|first = Charles|last = Bellemare|first2 = Sabine|last2 = Kröger|first3 = Arthur|last3 = Van Soest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have found that inequity aversion with Fehr and Schmidt's (1999) distribution of alphas and betas explains data of contract-theoretic experiments not better than standard theory; they also estimate average values of alpha that are much smaller than suggested by Fehr and Schmidt (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Contracting under Incomplete Information and Social Preferences: An Experimental Study|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/80/4/1516|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 2013|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 1516–44|volume = 80|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/restud/rdt010|language = en|first = Eva I.|last = Hoppe|first2 = Patrick W.|last2 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Levitt and List (2007) have pointed out that laboratory experiments tend to exaggerate the importance of pro-social behaviors because the subjects in the laboratory know that they are being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do Laboratory Experiments Measuring Social Preferences Reveal About the Real World?|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jep.21.2.153|journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives|date = 2007|issn = 0895-3309|pages = 153–74|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/jep.21.2.153|first = Steven D|last = Levitt|first2 = John A|last2 = List}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An alternative&lt;ref name="AmielCowell"/&gt; to the concept of a general inequity aversion is the assumption, that the ''degree'' and the structure of inequality could lead either to acceptance or to aversion of inequality.

==Non-human studies==
{{see also|Inequity aversion in animals}}
An experiment on [[capuchin monkey]]s ([[Sarah Brosnan|Brosnan, S]] and [[Frans de Waal|de Waal, F]]) showed that the subjects would prefer receiving nothing to receiving a reward awarded inequitably in favor of a second monkey, and appeared to target their anger at the researchers responsible for the inequitable distribution of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brosnan |first=S.F. |last2=de Waal|first2=F.B.M. |year=2003 |title=Monkeys reject unequal pay |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=425 |pmid=13679918 |pages=297–99 |doi=10.1038/nature01963 |issue=6955}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropologist]]s suggest that this research indicates a [[biological]] and [[evolution]]ary sense of social "fair play" in [[primates]], though others believe that this is learned behavior or explained by other mechanisms.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} There is also evidence for inequity aversion in [[chimpanzee]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brosnan|first1=S.

The latest study shows that chimpanzees play the Ultimatum Game in the same way as children, preferring equitable outcomes. The authors claim that we now are near the point of no difference between humans and apes with regard to a sense of fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Proctor |first=D.|year=2013 |title=Chimpanzees play the ultimatum game.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA |volume=110 |pages=2070–75 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1220806110|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that animals in the [[canidae]] family also recognize a basic level of fairness, stemming from living in cooperative societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dogs Understand Fairness, Get Jealous, Study Finds |date=9 December 2009 |last1=Greenfieldboyce |first1=Nell |website=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97944783}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animal cognition]] studies in other biological [[order (biology)|orders]] have not found similar importance on ''relative'' "equity" and "justice" as opposed to ''absolute'' [[utility]].

==Social inequity aversion==
Fehr and Schmidt's model may partially explain the widespread opposition to [[economic inequality]] in [[democracy|democracies]], but a distinction should be drawn between inequity aversion's "guilt" and [[egalitarianism]]'s "[[compassion]]", which does not necessarily imply ''injustice''.

Inequity aversion should not be confused with the arguments against the ''consequences'' of inequality. For example, the pro-[[publicly funded health care]] [[slogan]] "Hospitals for the poor become poor hospitals" directly objects to a predicted decline in medical care, not the health-care [[apartheid]] that is supposed to cause it. The argument that average medical outcomes improve with reduction in [[healthcare]] inequality (at the same total spending) is separate from the case for public healthcare on the grounds of inequity aversion.

[[File:Euler_Institutiones_calculi_diff.jpeg|thumb|''Institutiones calculi differentialis'']]
'''''Institutiones calculi differentialis''''' ('''''Foundations of differential calculus''''') is a mathematical work written in 1748 by [[Leonhard Euler]] and published in 1755 that lays the groundwork for the [[differential calculus]]. It consists of a single volume containing two internal books; there are 9 chapters in book I, and 18 in book II.

{{harvs|first=W. W. Rouse|last=Ball|year=1888|txt|authorlink=W. W. Rouse Ball}} writes that "this is the first textbook on the differential calculus which has any claim to be both complete and accurate, and it may be said that all modern treatises on the subject are based on it."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1759">'''Kellogg's theorem''' is a pair of related results in the [[mathematical]] study of the regularity of [[harmonic functions]] on sufficiently smooth domains by [[Oliver Dimon Kellogg]].

In the first version, it states that, for &lt;math&gt; k \geq 2 &lt;/math&gt;, if the domain's boundary is of class &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; and the ''k''-th derivatives of the boundary are [[Dini continuity|Dini continuous]], then the harmonic functions are uniformly &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; as well. The second, more common version of the theorem states that for domains which are &lt;math&gt;C^{k,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, if the boundary data is of class &lt;math&gt;C^{k,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, then so is the harmonic function itself.

Kellogg's method of proof analyzes the representation of harmonic functions provided by the [[Poisson kernel]], applied to an interior tangent sphere.

In modern presentations, Kellogg's theorem is usually covered as a specific case of the boundary [[Schauder estimates]] for [[Elliptic operator|elliptic]] [[partial differential equations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1288">In [[mathematics]], a [[partially ordered set]] ''P'' is said to have '''Knaster's condition upwards''' (sometimes '''property (K)''') if  any [[uncountable]] subset ''A'' of ''P'' has an [[linked set|upwards-linked]] uncountable subset. An analogous definition applies to '''Knaster's condition downwards'''.

The property is named after [[Poles|Polish]] [[mathematician]] [[Bronisław Knaster]].

Knaster's condition implies the [[countable chain condition]] (ccc), and it is sometimes used in conjunction with a weaker form of [[Martin's axiom]], where the ccc requirement is replaced with Knaster's condition. Not unlike ccc, Knaster's condition is also sometimes used as a property of a [[topological space]], in which case it means that the [[topology]] (as in, the family of all open sets) with [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]] satisfies the condition.

Furthermore, assuming [[Martin's axiom|MA]](&lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt;), ccc implies Knaster's condition, making the two equivalent.

In [[number theory]], '''Lagrange's theorem''' is a statement named after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] about how frequently a polynomial over the integers may evaluate to a multiple of a fixed prime. More precisely, it states that if ''p'' is a [[prime number]] and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then either:
* every coefficient of ''f(x)'' is divisible by ''p'', or
* &lt;math&gt;f(x) \equiv_p 0&lt;/math&gt; has at most deg ''f(x)'' incongruent solutions.

Solutions are "incongruent" if they do not differ by a multiple of ''p''. If the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus]] is not prime, then it is possible for there to be more than deg ''f(x)'' solutions.

==A proof of Lagrange's theorem==

The two key ideas are the following. Let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle g(x) \in (\mathbb{Z}/p)[x]&lt;/math&gt; be the polynomial obtained from &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by taking the coefficients &lt;math&gt;\mod p&lt;/math&gt;. Now (i) &lt;math&gt;f(k)&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;g(k) = 0&lt;/math&gt;; (ii) &lt;math&gt;g(k)&lt;/math&gt; has no more roots than its degree.

More rigorously, start by noting that &lt;math&gt;g(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if each coefficient of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Assume &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not 0; its degree is thus well-defined. It's easy to see &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \deg g(x) \leq \deg f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. To prove (i), first note that we can compute &lt;math&gt;g(k)&lt;/math&gt; either directly, i.e. by plugging in (the residue class of) &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and performing arithmetic in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{Z}/p&lt;/math&gt;, or by reducing &lt;math&gt;f(k) \mod p&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;g(k)=0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(k) \equiv_p 0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. if and only if &lt;math&gt; f(k)&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. To prove (ii), note that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{Z}/p&lt;/math&gt; is a field, which is a standard fact; a quick proof is to note that since &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is prime, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{Z}/p&lt;/math&gt; is a finite integral domain, hence is a field. Another standard fact is that a non-zero polynomial over a field has at most as many roots as its degree; this follows from the division algorithm.

Finally, note that two solutions &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(k_1), f(k_2) \equiv_p 0&lt;/math&gt; are incongruent if and only if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k_1 \not \equiv_p k_2&lt;/math&gt;. Putting it all together: the number of incongruent solutions by (i) is the same as the number of roots of &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which by (ii) is at most &lt;math&gt;\deg g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which is at most &lt;math&gt;\deg f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the mathematical discipline of [[set theory]], there are many ways of describing specific [[countable set|countable]] [[ordinal number|ordinals]]. The smallest ones can be usefully and non-circularly expressed in terms of their [[Cantor normal form]]s. Beyond that, many ordinals of relevance to [[proof theory]] still have [[computable function|computable]] [[ordinal notation]]s. However, it is not possible to decide effectively whether a given putative ordinal notation is a notation or not (for reasons somewhat analogous to the unsolvability of the [[halting problem]]); various more-concrete ways of defining ordinals that definitely have notations are available.

Since there are only countably many notations, all ordinals with notations are exhausted well below the [[first uncountable ordinal|first uncountable ordinal ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]; their [[supremum]] is called '''''Church–Kleene ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''''' or ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CK&lt;/sup&gt; (not to be confused with the first uncountable ordinal, ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), described [[#The Church–Kleene ordinal|below]]. Ordinal numbers below ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CK&lt;/sup&gt; are the '''recursive''' ordinals (see [[#Generalities on recursive ordinals|below]]). Countable ordinals larger than this may still be defined, but do not have notations.

Due to the focus on countable ordinals, [[ordinal arithmetic]] is used throughout, except where otherwise noted.  The ordinals described here are not as large as the ones described in [[large cardinals]], but they are large among those that have constructive notations (descriptions).  Larger and larger ordinals can be defined, but they become more and more difficult to describe.

== Generalities on recursive ordinals ==
{{Main|Recursive ordinal}}

=== Ordinal notations ===

{{Main|Ordinal notation}}

[[Recursive ordinal]]s (or computable ordinals) are certain countable ordinals: loosely speaking those represented by a [[computable function]].  There are several equivalent definitions of this: the simplest is to say that a computable ordinal is the order-type of some recursive (i.e., computable) well-ordering of the natural numbers; so, essentially, an ordinal is recursive when we can present the set of smaller ordinals in such a way that a computer ([[Turing machine]], say) can manipulate them (and, essentially, compare them).

&lt;!-- Consider the following as a sort of stub for a yet-to-be-written article on "ordinal notations"... --&gt;
A different definition uses [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]'s system of [[ordinal notation]]s. Briefly, an ordinal notation is either the name zero (describing the ordinal 0), or the successor of an ordinal notation (describing the successor of the ordinal described by that notation), or a Turing machine (computable function) that produces an increasing sequence of ordinal notations (that describe the ordinal that is the limit of the sequence), and ordinal notations are (partially) ordered so as to make the successor of ''o'' greater than ''o'' and to make the limit greater than any term of the sequence (this order is computable; however, the set '''O''' of ordinal notations itself is highly non-recursive, owing to the impossibility of deciding whether a given Turing machine does indeed produce a sequence of notations); a recursive ordinal is then an ordinal described by some ordinal notation.

Any ordinal smaller than a recursive ordinal is itself recursive, so the set of all recursive ordinals forms a certain (countable) ordinal, the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]] (see below).

It is tempting to forget about ordinal notations, and only speak of the recursive ordinals themselves: and some statements are made about recursive ordinals which, in fact, concern the notations for these ordinals.  This leads to difficulties, however, as even the smallest infinite ordinal, ω, has many notations, some of which cannot be proved to be equivalent to the obvious notation (the limit of the simplest program that enumerates all natural numbers).

=== Relationship to systems of arithmetic ===

There is a relation between computable ordinals and certain [[formal system]]s (containing [[arithmetic]], that is, at least a reasonable fragment of [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]]).

Certain computable ordinals are so large that while they can be given by a certain ordinal notation ''o'', a given formal system might not be sufficiently powerful to show that ''o'' is, indeed, an ordinal notation: the system does not show transfinite induction for such large ordinals.

For example, the usual [[First-order logic|first-order]] [[Peano axioms]] do not prove transfinite induction for (or beyond) ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: while the ordinal ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can easily be arithmetically described (it is countable), the Peano axioms are not strong enough to show that it is indeed an ordinal; in fact, transfinite induction on ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; proves the consistency of Peano's axioms (a theorem by [[Gerhard Gentzen|Gentzen]]), so by [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]], Peano's axioms cannot formalize that reasoning.  (This is at the basis of the [[Kirby–Paris theorem]] on [[Goodstein's theorem|Goodstein sequences]].)  We say that ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; measures the [[proof-theoretic strength]] of Peano's axioms.

But we can do this for systems far beyond Peano's axioms.  For example, the proof-theoretic strength of [[Kripke–Platek set theory]] is the [[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]], and, in fact, merely adding to Peano's axioms the axioms that state the well-ordering of all ordinals below the Bachmann–Howard ordinal is sufficient to obtain all arithmetical consequences of Kripke–Platek set theory.

== Specific recursive ordinals ==

=== Predicative definitions and the Veblen hierarchy ===
{{main|Veblen function}}
We have already mentioned (see  [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]]) the ordinal [[epsilon numbers (mathematics)|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]], which is the smallest satisfying the equation &lt;math&gt;\omega^\alpha = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, so it is the limit of the sequence 0, 1, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega^\omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega^{\omega^\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.  The next ordinal satisfying this equation is called ε&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: it is the limit of the sequence

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0+1, \qquad \omega^{\varepsilon_0+1}=\varepsilon_0\cdot\omega,\qquad\omega^{\omega^{\varepsilon_0+1}}=(\varepsilon_0)^\omega,\qquad\text{etc.}&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt;-th ordinal such that &lt;math&gt;\omega^\alpha = \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\iota&lt;/math&gt;.  We could define &lt;math&gt;\zeta_0&lt;/math&gt; as the smallest ordinal such that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\alpha=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, but since the Greek alphabet does not have transfinitely many letters it is better to use a more robust notation: define ordinals &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\gamma(\beta)&lt;/math&gt; by transfinite induction as follows: let &lt;math&gt;\varphi_0(\beta) = \omega^\beta&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\gamma+1}(\beta)&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-th fixed point of &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-th ordinal such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\gamma(\alpha)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; so for example, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1(\beta) = \varepsilon_\beta&lt;/math&gt;), and when &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is a limit ordinal, define &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\delta(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; as the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-th common fixed point of the &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  This family of functions is known as the '''[[Veblen hierarchy]]'''  (there are inessential variations in the definition, such as letting, for &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; a limit ordinal, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\delta(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; be the limit of the &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\gamma(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;: this essentially just shifts the indices by 1, which is harmless). &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;math&gt;\gamma^{th}&lt;/math&gt; '''[[Veblen function]]''' (to the base &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;).

Ordering: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\alpha(\beta) &lt; \varphi_\gamma(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if either (&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;) or (&lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; \varphi_\gamma(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;) or (&lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; \gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\alpha(\beta) &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;).

=== The Feferman–Schütte ordinal and beyond ===

The smallest ordinal such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\alpha(0) = \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]] and generally written &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be described as the set of all ordinals that can be written as finite expressions, starting from zero, using only the Veblen hierarchy and addition.  The Feferman–Schütte ordinal is important because, in a sense that is complicated to make precise, it is the smallest (infinite) ordinal that cannot be (“[[impredicative|predicatively]]”) described using smaller ordinals.  It measures the strength of such systems as “[[Reverse mathematics#Arithmetical transfinite recursion ATR0|arithmetical transfinite recursion]]”.

More generally, Γ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; enumerates the ordinals that cannot be obtained from smaller ordinals using addition and the Veblen functions.

It is, of course, possible to describe ordinals beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal.  One could continue to seek fixed points in more and more complicated manner: enumerate the fixed points of &lt;math&gt;\alpha\mapsto\Gamma_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then enumerate the fixed points of ''that'', and so on, and then look for the first ordinal α such that α is obtained in α steps of this process, and continue diagonalizing in this ''ad hoc'' manner.  This leads to the definition of the “[[small Veblen ordinal|small]]” and “[[large Veblen ordinal|large]]” Veblen ordinals.

=== Impredicative ordinals ===
{{main|Ordinal collapsing function}}

To go far beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal, one needs to introduce new methods.  Unfortunately there is not yet any standard way to do this: every author in the subject seems to have invented their own system of notation, and it is quite hard to translate between the different systems. The first such system was introduced by Bachmann in 1950 (in an ''ad hoc'' manner), and different extensions and variations of it were described by Buchholz, Takeuti (ordinal diagrams), Feferman (θ systems), Aczel, Bridge, Schütte, and Pohlers. However most systems use the same basic idea, of constructing new countable ordinals by using the existence of certain uncountable ordinals.  Here is an example of such a definition, described in much greater detail in the article on [[ordinal collapsing function]]:
*ψ(α) is defined to be the smallest ordinal that cannot be constructed by starting with 0, 1, ω and Ω, and repeatedly applying addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and ψ to previously constructed ordinals (except that ψ can only be applied to arguments  less than α, to ensure that it is well defined).
Here Ω = ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the first uncountable ordinal. It is put in because otherwise the function ψ gets "stuck" at the smallest ordinal σ such that ε&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;=σ: in particular ψ(α)=σ for any ordinal α satisfying σ≤α≤Ω. However the fact that we included Ω allows us to get past this point: ψ(Ω+1) is greater than σ. The key property of Ω that we used is that it is greater than any ordinal produced by ψ.

To construct still larger ordinals, we can extend the definition of ψ by throwing in  more ways of constructing uncountable ordinals. There are several ways to do this, described to some extent in the article on [[ordinal collapsing function]].

The '''[[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]]''' (sometimes just called the '''Howard ordinal''', ψ(ε&lt;sub&gt;Ω+1&lt;/sub&gt;) with the notation above) is an important one, because it describes the proof-theoretic strength of [[Kripke–Platek set theory]].  Indeed, the main importance of these large ordinals, and the reason to describe them, is their relation to certain formal systems as explained above.  However, such powerful formal systems as full [[second-order arithmetic]], let alone [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], seem beyond reach for the moment.

=== &amp;ldquo;Unrecursable&amp;rdquo; recursive ordinals ===

By dropping the requirement of having a useful description, even larger recursive countable ordinals can be obtained as the ordinals measuring the strengths of various strong theories; roughly speaking, these ordinals are the smallest ordinals that the theories cannot prove are well ordered. By taking stronger and stronger theories such as [[second-order arithmetic]], [[Zermelo set theory]], [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with various [[large cardinal]] axioms, one gets some extremely large recursive ordinals.  (Strictly speaking it is not known that all of these really are ordinals: by construction, the ordinal strength of a theory can only be proved to be an ordinal from an even stronger theory.  So for the large cardinal axioms this becomes quite unclear.)

== Beyond recursive ordinals ==

&lt;!-- This section should be much expanded, perhaps made into a separate article, because the present view is unbalanced: most of the article deals with recursive ordinals, and other large countable ordinals seem to be a kind of afterthought. --&gt;

=== The Church–Kleene ordinal ===

The set of [[recursive ordinal]]s is an ordinal that is the smallest ordinal that ''cannot'' be described in a recursive way. (It is not the order type of any recursive well-ordering of the integers.) That ordinal is a countable ordinal called the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]], &lt;math&gt;\omega_1^{\mathrm{CK}}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1^{\mathrm{CK}}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest non-recursive ordinal, and there is no hope of precisely “describing” any ordinals from this point on&amp;mdash;we can only ''define'' them. But it is still far less than the first uncountable ordinal, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt;. However, as its symbol suggests, it behaves in many ways rather like &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt;. {{such as?}}

=== Admissible ordinals ===
{{main|Admissible ordinal}}

The Church–Kleene ordinal is again related to [[Kripke–Platek set theory]], but now in a different way: whereas the Bachmann–Howard ordinal (described [[#Impredicative ordinals|above]]) was the smallest ordinal for which KP does not prove transfinite induction, the Church–Kleene ordinal is the smallest α such that the construction of the [[Constructible universe|Gödel universe]], ''L'', up to stage α, yields a model &lt;math&gt;L_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of KP. Such ordinals are called '''admissible''', thus &lt;math&gt;\omega_1^{\mathrm{CK}}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest admissible ordinal (beyond ω in case the axiom of infinity is not included in KP).

By a theorem of [[Gerald Sacks|Sacks]], the countable admissible ordinals are exactly those constructed in a manner similar to the Church–Kleene ordinal but for Turing machines with [[Oracle machine|oracles]].  One sometimes writes &lt;math&gt;\omega_\alpha^{\mathrm{CK}}&lt;/math&gt; for the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-th ordinal that is either admissible or a limit of admissible.

=== Beyond admissible ordinals ===

An ordinal that is both admissible and a limit of admissibles, or equivalently such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-th admissible ordinal, is called ''recursively inaccessible''.  There exists a theory of large ordinals in this manner that is highly parallel to that of (small) [[large cardinal property|large cardinals]].  For example, we can define recursively ''Mahlo ordinals'': these are the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that every &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-recursive closed unbounded subset of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; contains an admissible ordinal (a recursive analog of the definition of a [[Mahlo cardinal]]).  But note that we are still talking about possibly countable ordinals here. (While the existence of inaccessible or Mahlo cardinals cannot be proved in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], that of recursively inaccessible or recursively Mahlo ordinals is a theorem of ZFC: in fact, any [[regular cardinal]] is recursively Mahlo and more, but even if we limit ourselves to countable ordinals, ZFC proves the existence of recursively Mahlo ordinals.  They are, however, beyond the reach of Kripke–Platek set theory.)

An admissible ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is called ''nonprojectible'' if there is no total &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-recursive injective function mapping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; into a smaller ordinal.  (This is trivially true for regular cardinals; however, we are mainly interested in countable ordinals.)  Being nonprojectible is a much stronger condition than being admissible, recursively inaccessible, or even recursively Mahlo.  It is equivalent to the statement that the [[Constructible universe|Gödel universe]], ''L'', up to stage α, yields a model &lt;math&gt;L_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of KP + &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;-separation.

=== &amp;ldquo;Unprovable&amp;rdquo; ordinals ===

We can imagine even larger ordinals that are still countable. For example, if [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] has a [[transitive model]] (a hypothesis stronger than the mere hypothesis of consistency, and implied by the existence of an inaccessible cardinal), then there exists a countable &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;L_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a model of ZFC.  Such ordinals are beyond the strength of ZFC in the sense that it cannot (by construction) prove their existence.

Even larger countable ordinals, called the ''[[stable ordinal]]s'', can be defined by indescribability conditions or as those &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;L_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a [[elementary equivalence|1-elementary submodel]] of ''L''; the existence of these ordinals can be proved in ZFC,&lt;ref&gt;Barwise (1976), theorem 7.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and they are closely related to the [[nonprojectible ordinal]]s.

== A pseudo-well-ordering ==

Within the [[Kleene's O|scheme of notations of Kleene]] some represent ordinals and some do not. One can define a recursive total ordering that is a subset of the Kleene notations and has an initial segment which is well-ordered with order-type &lt;math&gt;\omega_1^{\mathrm{CK}}&lt;/math&gt;. Every recursively enumerable (or even hyperarithmetic) nonempty subset of this total ordering has a least element.  So it resembles a well-ordering in some respects.  For example, one can define the arithmetic operations on it.  Yet it is not possible to effectively determine exactly where the initial well-ordered part ends and the part lacking a least element begins.

For an example of a recursive pseudowellordering, let S be [[Reverse_mathematics#Arithmetical_transfinite_recursion_ATR0|ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] or another recursively axiomatizable theory that has an ω-model but no hyperarithmetical ω-models, and (if needed) conservatively extend S with [[Skolem function]]s.  Let T be the tree of (essentially) finite partial ω-models of S: A sequence of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; is in T iff S plus ∃m φ(m) ⇒ φ(x&lt;sub&gt;⌈φ⌉&lt;/sub&gt;) (for the first n formulas φ with one numeric free variable; ⌈φ⌉ is the Gödel number) has no inconsistency proof shorter than n.  Then the [[Kleene–Brouwer order]] of T is a recursive pseudowellordering.

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] mathematics, a '''large set''' of [[positive integer]]s

:&lt;math&gt;S = \{s_0,s_1,s_2,s_3,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt;

is one such that the [[infinite sum]] of the reciprocals

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{s_0}+\frac{1}{s_1}+\frac{1}{s_2}+\frac{1}{s_3}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

[[divergent series|diverges]].  A '''small set''' is any subset of the positive integers that is not large; that is, one whose sum of reciprocals converges.

Large sets appear in the [[Müntz–Szász theorem]] and in the [[Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions]].

==Examples==
* Every finite subset of the positive integers is small.
* The set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4,5,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt; of all positive integers is known to be a large set; this statement is equivalent to the divergence of the [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]].  More generally, any [[arithmetic progression]] (i.e., a set of all integers of the form ''an''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' with ''a''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, ''b''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...) is a large set.
* The set of [[square number]]s is small (see [[Basel problem#The Riemann zeta function|Basel problem]]). So is the set of [[cube number]]s, the set of 4th powers, and so on. More generally, the set of positive integer values of any [[polynomial]] of degree 2 or larger forms a small set.
* The set {1, 2, 4, 8, ...} of powers of [[2 (number)|2]] is known to be a small set, and so is any [[geometric progression]] (i.e., a set of numbers of the form of the form ''ab''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with ''a''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, ''b''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...).
* The set of [[prime number]]s [[Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges|has been proven]] to be large. The set of [[twin prime]]s has been proven to be small (see [[Brun's constant]]).
* The set of [[prime power]]s which are not prime (i.e., all numbers of the form ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 and ''p'' prime) is a small set although the primes are a large set. This property is frequently used in [[analytic number theory]]. More generally, the set of [[perfect power]]s is small.
* The set of numbers whose expansions in a given [[Numeral system#Positional systems in detail|base]]&lt;!--Is there a better link for this?--&gt; exclude a given digit is small.  For example, the set

:&lt;math&gt;\{1, \dots, 6, 8, \dots, 16, 18, \dots, 66, 68, 69, 80, \dots \}&lt;/math&gt;

:of integers whose [[decimal]] expansion does not include the digit 7 is small.  Such series are called [[Kempner series]].
* Any set whose upper [[asymptotic density]] is nonzero, is large.

==Properties==
* Every [[subset]] of a small set is small.
* The [[union (set theory)|union]] of finitely many small sets is small, because the sum of two [[convergent series]] is a convergent series.  (In set theoretic terminology, the small sets form an [[ideal (set theory)|ideal]].)
* The complement of every small set is large.
* The [[Müntz–Szász theorem]] states that a set &lt;math&gt;S=\{s_1,s_2,s_3,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt; is large if and only if the set of polynomials spanned by

::&lt;math&gt;\{1,x^{s_1},x^{s_2},x^{s_3},\dots\} &lt;/math&gt;

:is [[dense set|dense]] in the [[uniform norm]] topology of [[continuous function]]s on a closed interval. This is a generalization of the [[Stone–Weierstrass theorem]].

==Open problems involving large sets==
[[Paul Erdős]] famously [[Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions|asked the question]] of whether any set that does not contain arbitrarily long [[arithmetic progression]]s must necessarily be small.  He offered a prize of $3000 for the solution to this problem, more than for any of his [[Erdős conjectures|other conjectures]],  and joked that this prize offer violated the minimum wage law.&lt;ref name="pomerance"&gt;[[Carl Pomerance]], [http://www.ams.org/notices/199801/vertesi.pdf Paul Erdős, Number Theorist Extraordinaire]. (Part of the article ''The Mathematics of Paul Erdős''), in ''[[Notices of the AMS]]'',  [http://www.ams.org/notices/199801/index.html January, 1998].&lt;/ref&gt; This question is still open.

It is not known how to identify whether a given set is large or small in general. As a result, there are many sets which are not known to be either large or small.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4426">In the field of [[ordinary differential equation]]s, the '''Mingarelli identity'''&lt;ref name="Hartman"&gt;The locution was coined by [[Philip Hartman]], according to {{harvtxt|Clark D.N., G. Pecelli, and R. Sacksteder|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a theorem that provides criteria for the [[oscillation theory|oscillation]] and [[oscillation theory|non-oscillation]] of solutions of some [[linear differential equation]]s in the real domain. It extends the [[Picone identity]] from two to three or more differential equations of the second order.

== The identity ==
Consider the {{mvar|n}} solutions of the following (uncoupled) system of second order linear differential equations over the {{mvar|t}}–interval {{math|[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']}}:
:&lt;math&gt;(p_i(t) x_i^\prime)^\prime + q_i(t) x_i = 0, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, x_i(a)=1,\,\, x_i^\prime(a)=R_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i=1,2, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;. 
Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; denote the forward difference operator, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_i = x_{i+1}-x_i.&lt;/math&gt; 
The second order difference operator is found by iterating the first order operator as in 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2 (x_i) = \Delta(\Delta x_i) = x_{i+2}-2x_{i+1}+x_{i},&lt;/math&gt;, 
with a similar definition for the higher iterates. Leaving out the independent variable {{mvar|t}} for convenience, and assuming the {{math|''x{{sub|i}}''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0}} on {{math|(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']}}, there holds the identity,&lt;ref name="Mingarelli.223"&gt;{{harv|Mingarelli|1979|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x_{n-1}^2\Delta^{n-1}(p_1r_1)]_a^b &amp; = \int_a^b (x^\prime_{n-1})^2 \Delta^{n-1}(p_1) - \int_a^b x_{n-1}^2 \Delta^{n-1}(q_1) 
- \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(n-1,k)(-1)^{n-k-1}\int_a^b p_{k+1} W^2(x_{k+1},x_{n-1})/x_{k+1}^2,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*&lt;math&gt;r_i = x^\prime_i/x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[logarithmic derivative]], 
*&lt;math&gt;W(x_i, x_j) = x^\prime_ix_j - x_ix^\prime_j&lt;/math&gt;, is the [[Wronskian determinant]], 
*&lt;math&gt;C(n-1,k)&lt;/math&gt; are [[binomial coefficients]]. 
When {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;2}} this equality reduces to the [[Picone identity]].

==An application==
The above identity leads quickly to the following comparison theorem for three linear differential equations,&lt;ref name="Mingarelli.th2"&gt;{{harv|Mingarelli|1979|loc=Theorem 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which extends the classical [[Sturm–Picone comparison theorem]].

Let {{mvar|p{{sub|i}}}}, {{mvar|q{{sub|i}}}} {{math|''i''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3}}, be real-valued continuous functions on the interval {{math|[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']}} and let
#&lt;math&gt;(p_1(t) x_1^\prime)^\prime + q_1(t) x_1 = 0, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, x_1(a)=1,\,\, x_1^\prime(a)=R_1&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;(p_2(t) x_2^\prime)^\prime + q_2(t) x_2 = 0, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, x_2(a)=1,\,\,  x_2^\prime(a)=R_2&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(p_3(t) x_3^\prime)^\prime + q_3(t) x_3 = 0, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, x_3(a)=1,\,\,  x_3^\prime(a)=R_3&lt;/math&gt;
be three homogeneous linear second order differential equations in [[self-adjoint form]], where 
*{{math|''p{{sub|i}}''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0}}  for each {{mvar|i}} and for all {{mvar|t}} in {{math|[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']}} , and 
*the {{mvar|R{{sub|i}}}} are arbitrary real numbers.

Assume that for all {{math|''t''}} in {{math|[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']}} we have,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(q_1) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(p_1) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(p_1(a)R_1) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
Then, if {{math|''x''{{sub|1}}(''t'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0}} on {{math|[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']}} and {{math|''x''{{sub|2}}(''b'')&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;0}}, then any solution {{math|''x''{{sub|3}}(''t'')}} has at least one zero in {{math|[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']}}.

In [[Recreational mathematics|recreational]] [[number theory]], a '''minimal prime''' is a [[prime number]] for which there is no shorter [[subsequence]] of its digits in a given base that form a prime. In base 10 there are exactly 26 minimal primes:
:[[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[19 (number)|19]], [[41 (number)|41]], [[61 (number)|61]], [[89 (number)|89]], 409, 449, 499, 881, 991, 6469, 6949, 9001, 9049, 9649, 9949, 60649, 666649, 946669, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049 {{OEIS|id=A071062}}.

For example, 409 is a minimal prime because there is no prime among the shorter subsequences of the digits: 4, 0, 9, 40, 49, 09. The subsequence does not have to consist of consecutive digits, so 109 is not a minimal prime (because 19 is prime). But it does have to be in the same order; so, for example, 991 is still a minimal prime even though a subset of the digits can form the shorter prime 19 by changing the order.

Similarly, there are exactly 32 [[composite number]]s which have no shorter composite subsequence:
:4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 21, 22, 25, 27, 30, 32, 33, 35, 50, 51, 52, 55, 57, 70, 72, 75, 77, 111, 117, 171, 371, 711, 713, 731 {{OEIS|id=A071070}}.

There are 146 primes congruent to 1 mod 4 which have no shorter prime congruent to 1 mod 4 subsequence:
:5, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 61, 73, 89, 97, 101, 109, 149, 181, 233, 277, 281, 349, 409, 433, 449, 677, 701, 709, 769, 821, 877, 881, 1669, 2221, 3001, 3121, 3169, 3221, 3301, 3833, 4969, 4993, 6469, 6833, 6949, 7121, 7477, 7949, 9001, 9049, 9221, 9649, 9833, 9901, 9949, ... {{OEIS|id=A111055}}

There are 113 primes congruent to 3 mod 4 which have no shorter prime congruent to 3 mod 4 subsequence:

:3, 7, 11, 19, 59, 251, 491, 499, 691, 991, 2099, 2699, 2999, 4051, 4451, 4651, 5051, 5651, 5851, 6299, 6451, 6551, 6899, 8291, 8699, 8951, 8999, 9551, 9851, ... {{OEIS|id=A111056}}

==Other bases==

Minimal primes can be generalized to other bases. It can be shown that there are only a finite number of minimal primes in every base. Equivalently, every [[sufficiently large]] prime contains a shorter subsequence that forms a prime.

The '''Möbius strip''' or '''Möbius band''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|m|ɜː|b|i|ə|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|m|oʊ|-|,_|ˈ|m|eɪ|-|}}; {{IPA-de|ˈmøːbi̯ʊs|lang}}), also spelled '''Mobius''' or '''Moebius''', is a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] with only one side (when embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space) and only one [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]. The Möbius strip has the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] property of being [[orientability|unorientable]]. It can be realized as a [[ruled surface]]. Its discovery is attributed to the German [[mathematician]]s [[August Ferdinand Möbius]] and [[Johann Benedict Listing]] in 1858,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An example of a Möbius strip can be created by taking a paper strip and giving it a half-twist, and then joining the ends of the strip to form a loop. However, the Möbius strip is not a surface of only one exact size and shape, such as the half-twisted paper strip depicted in the illustration.  Rather, mathematicians refer to the closed Möbius band as any surface that is [[homeomorphic]] to this strip.  Its boundary is a simple closed curve, i.e., homeomorphic to a circle. This allows for a very wide variety of geometric versions of the Möbius band as surfaces each having a definite size and shape.   For example, any rectangle can be glued to itself (by identifying one edge with the opposite edge after a reversal of orientation) to make a Möbius band.  Some of these can be smoothly modeled in  [[Euclidean space]], and others cannot.

A half-twist [[clockwise]] gives an embedding of the Möbius strip different from that of a half-twist counterclockwise – that is, as an embedded object in Euclidean space, the Möbius strip is a [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] object with right- or left-handedness. However, the underlying [[topological space]]s within the Möbius strip are homeomorphic in each case. An infinite number of topologically different embeddings of the same topological space into three-dimensional space exist, as the Möbius strip can also be formed by twisting the strip an odd number of times greater than one, or by knotting and twisting the strip, before joining its ends.  The complete open Möbius band is an example of a topological surface that is closely related to the standard Möbius strip, but that is not homeomorphic to it.

Finding [[algebraic variety|algebraic equations]], the solutions of which have the topology of a Möbius strip, is straightforward, but, in general, these equations do not describe the same geometric shape that one gets from the twisted paper model described above.  In particular, the twisted paper model is a [[developable surface]], having zero [[Gaussian curvature]].  A system of [[differential-algebraic equation]]s that describes models of this type was published in 2007 together with its numerical solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Starostin E.L. |author2=van der Heijden G.H.M. | title=The shape of a Möbius strip | journal=[[Nature Materials]] | url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v6/n8/abs/nmat1929.html | year=2007 | doi=10.1038/nmat1929 | volume = 6 | pages = 563–7 | pmid=17632519 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Euler characteristic]] of the Möbius strip is [[zero]].

==Properties==
[[File:Moebiusband-1s.svg|thumb|once cut Möbius strip: one non Möbius strip]]
[[File:Moebiusband-2s.svg|thumb|twice cut Möbius strip: one Möbius strip (purple), one non Möbius strip]]
The Möbius strip has several curious properties. A line drawn starting from the seam down the middle meets back at the seam, but at the other side. If continued, the line meets the starting point, and is double the length of the original strip. This single continuous curve demonstrates that the Möbius strip has only one [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]].

Cutting a Möbius strip along the center line with a pair of scissors yields one long strip with two full twists in it, rather than two separate strips; the result is not a Möbius strip. This happens because the original strip only has one edge that is twice as long as the original strip.  Cutting creates a second independent edge, half of which was on each side of the scissors. Cutting this new, longer, strip down the middle creates two strips wound around each other, each with two full twists.

If the strip is cut along about a third of the way in from the edge, it creates two strips: One is a thinner Möbius strip – it is the center third of the original strip, comprising one-third of the width and the same length as the original strip. The other is a longer but thin strip with two full twists in it – this is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the edge of the original strip, and it comprises one-third of the width and twice the length of the original strip.

Other analogous strips can be obtained by similarly joining strips with two or more half-twists in them instead of one. For example, a strip with three half-twists, when divided lengthwise, becomes a twisted strip tied in a [[trefoil knot]]. (If this knot is unravelled, the strip has eight half-twists.)  A strip with ''N'' half-twists, when bisected, becomes a strip with ''N'' + 1 full twists.  Giving it extra twists and reconnecting the ends produces figures called [[paradromic ring]]s.

[[File:MöbiusStripAsSquare.svg|thumb|To turn a [[rectangle]] into a Möbius strip, join the edges labelled ''A'' so that the directions of the arrows match.]]

One way to represent the Möbius strip as a subset of three-dimensional Euclidean space is using the parametrization:

:&lt;math&gt;x(u,v)= \left(1+\frac{v}{2} \cos \frac{u}{2}\right)\cos u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y(u,v)= \left(1+\frac{v}{2} \cos\frac{u}{2}\right)\sin u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z(u,v)= \frac{v}{2}\sin \frac{u}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;0 \le u&lt; 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1 \le v\le 1&lt;/math&gt;. This creates a Möbius strip of width 1 whose center circle has radius 1, lies in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;-plane and is centered at &lt;math&gt;(0, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; runs around the strip while &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; moves from one edge to the other.

In [[cylindrical coordinates|cylindrical polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(r, \theta, z)&lt;/math&gt;, an unbounded version of the Möbius strip can be represented by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\log(r)\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta\right)=z\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Widest isometric embedding in 3-space ===
If a smooth Möbius strip in three-space is a rectangular one – that is, created from identifying two opposite sides of a geometrical rectangle with bending but not stretching the surface – then such an embedding is known to be possible if the aspect ratio of the rectangle is greater than the square root of three. (Note the shorter sides of the rectangle are identified to obtain the Möbius strip.) For an aspect ratio less than or equal to the square root of three, however, a smooth embedding of a rectangular Möbius strip into three-space may be impossible.

As the aspect ratio approaches the limiting ratio of {{sqrt|3}} from above, any such rectangular Möbius strip in three-space seems to approach a shape that in the limit can be thought of as a strip of three equilateral triangles, folded on top of one another so that they occupy just one equilateral triangle in three-space.

If the Möbius strip in three-space is only once continuously differentiable (in symbols: C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), however, then the theorem of Nash-Kuiper shows that no lower bound exists.

A method of making a Möbius strip from a rectangular strip too wide to simply twist and join (e.g., a rectangle only one unit long and one unit wide) is to first fold the wide direction back and forth using an even number of folds—an "accordion fold"—so that the folded strip becomes narrow enough that it can be twisted and joined, much as a single long-enough strip can be joined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Barr  |first = Stephen  |title = Experiments in Topology  |year = 1964 |publisher = Thomas Y. Crowell Company |location = New York |pages = 48,200–201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two folds, for example, a {{nowrap|1 × 1}} strip would become a {{nowrap|1 × ⅓}} folded strip whose [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is in the shape of an 'N' and would remain an 'N' after a half-twist. This folded strip, three times as long as it is wide, would be long enough to then join at the ends. This method works in principle, but becomes impractical after sufficiently many folds, if paper is used. Using normal paper, this construction can be [[Mathematics of paper folding#Flat folding|folded flat]], with all the layers of the paper in a single plane, but mathematically, whether this is possible without stretching the surface of the rectangle is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Fuchs and [[Serge Tabachnikov]], ''Mathematical Omnibus: Thirty Lectures on Classic Mathematics'', 2007, page 199, at http://www.math.psu.edu/tabachni/Books/taba.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Topology ===
[[Topology|Topologically]], the Möbius strip can be defined as the [[square (geometry)|square]] &lt;math&gt;[0, 1] \times [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; with its top and bottom sides [[Quotient space (topology)|identified]] by the relation &lt;math&gt;(x, 0) \sim (1 - x, 1)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le 1&lt;/math&gt;, as in the diagram on the right.

A less used presentation of the Möbius strip is as the topological quotient of a torus.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Phillips, ''[http://www.ams.org/mathmedia/archive/10-2006-media.html Tony Phillips' Take on Math in the Media],'' [[American Mathematical Society]], October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A torus can be constructed as the square &lt;math&gt;[0, 1] \times [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; with the edges identified as &lt;math&gt;(0, y) \sim (1, y)&lt;/math&gt; (glue left to right) and &lt;math&gt;(x, 0) \sim (x, 1)&lt;/math&gt; (glue bottom to top). If one then also identified {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'') ~ (''y'', ''x'')}}, then one obtains the Möbius strip. The diagonal of the square (the points {{nowrap|(''x'', ''x'')}} where both coordinates agree) becomes the boundary of the Möbius strip, and carries an orbifold structure, which geometrically corresponds to "reflection" – [[geodesic]]s (straight lines) in the Möbius strip reflect off the edge back into the strip. Notationally, this is written as T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – the 2-torus quotiented by the [[group action]] of the [[symmetric group]] on two letters (switching coordinates), and it can be thought of as the [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of two unordered points on the circle, possibly the same (the edge corresponds to the points being the same), with the torus corresponding to two ordered points on the circle.

The Möbius strip is a two-dimensional [[compact manifold]] (i.e. a [[Surface (topology)|surface]]) with boundary. It is a standard example of a surface that is not [[orientable manifold|orientable]]. In fact, the Möbius strip is the epitome of the topological phenomenon of [[Orientability|nonorientability]].  This is because two-dimensional shapes (surfaces) are the lowest-dimensional shapes for which nonorientability is possible and the Möbius strip is the '''only''' surface that is topologically a subspace of '''every''' nonorientable surface. As a result, any surface is nonorientable if and only if it contains a Möbius band as a subspace.

The Möbius strip is also a standard example used to illustrate the mathematical concept of a [[fiber bundle]]. Specifically, it is a nontrivial bundle over the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a fiber the [[unit interval]], {{nowrap|1=''I'' = [0, 1]}}. Looking only at the edge of the Möbius strip gives a nontrivial two point (or '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;!-- What is Z2??--&gt;) bundle over ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Computer graphics ===
A simple construction of the Möbius strip that can be used to portray it in computer graphics or modeling packages is:
* Take a rectangular strip. Rotate it around a fixed point not in its plane. At every step, also rotate the strip along a line in its plane (the line that divides the strip in two) and perpendicular to the main orbital radius. The surface generated on one complete revolution is the Möbius strip.
* Take a Möbius strip and cut it along the middle of the strip.  This forms a new strip, which is a rectangle joined by rotating one end a whole turn.  By cutting it down the middle again, this forms two interlocking whole-turn strips.

=== Open Möbius band ===
The '''open Möbius band''' is formed by deleting the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the standard Möbius band. It is constructed from the set {{nowrap|1=''S'' = { (''x'', ''y'') ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; : 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1 and 0 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 1 } }} by identifying (glueing) the points {{nowrap|(0, ''y'')}} and {{nowrap|(1, 1 − ''y'')}} for all {{nowrap|1=0 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 1}}.

It may be constructed as a surface of constant positive, negative, or zero (Gaussian) [[Gaussian curvature|curvature]]. In the cases of negative and zero curvature, the Möbius band can be constructed as a (geodesically) complete surface, which means that all geodesics ("straight lines" on the surface) may be extended indefinitely in either direction.

'''Constant negative curvature:'''
Like the plane and the open cylinder, the open Möbius band admits not only a complete metric of constant curvature 0, but also a complete metric of constant negative curvature, say −1.  One way to see this is to begin with the [[Poincaré half-plane model|upper half plane (Poincaré) model]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] ℍ, namely {{nowrap|1=ℍ = { (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{pipe}} ''y'' &gt; 0} }} with the [[Riemannian metric]] given by {{nowrap|(''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +  ''dy''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The orientation-preserving isometries of this metric are all the maps {{nowrap|''f'' : ℍ → ℍ}} of the form {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') := (''az'' + ''b'') / (''cz'' + ''d'')}}, where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are real numbers satisfying {{nowrap|1=''ad'' − ''bc'' = 1}}. Here ''z'' is a complex number with {{nowrap|Im(''z'') &gt; 0}}, and we have identified ℍ with {{nowrap|{''z'' ∈ ℂ {{pipe}} Im(''z'') &gt; 0} }} endowed with the Riemannian metric that was mentioned.  Then one orientation-reversing isometry ''g'' of ℍ given by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''z'') := -conj(''z'')}}, where conj(''z'') denotes the complex conjugate of ''z''.  These facts imply that the mapping {{nowrap|''h'' : ℍ → ℍ}} given by {{nowrap|1=''h''(''z'') := −2⋅conj(''z'')}} is an orientation-reversing isometry of ℍ that generates an infinite cyclic group ''G'' of isometries. (Its square is the isometry  {{nowrap|1=''h''(''z'') := 4⋅z}}, which can be expressed as {{nowrap|1=(''2z'' + ''0'') / (''0z'' + ''1/2'')}}.) The quotient {{nowrap|ℍ / ''G''}} of the action of this group can easily be seen to be topologically a Möbius band. But it is also easy to verify that it is complete and non-compact, with constant negative curvature −1.

The group of isometries of this Möbius band is 1-dimensional and is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group SO(2).

'''(Constant) zero curvature:'''
This may also be constructed as a complete surface, by starting with portion of the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; defined by {{nowrap|0 ≤ y ≤ 1}} and identifying {{nowrap|(''x'', 0)}} with {{nowrap|(−''x'', 1)}} for all ''x'' in '''R''' (the reals). The resulting metric makes the open Möbius band into a (geodesically) complete flat surface (i.e., having Gaussian curvature equal to 0 everywhere). This is the only metric on the Möbius band, up to uniform scaling, that is both flat and complete.

The group of isometries of this Möbius band is 1-dimensional and is isomorphic to the orthogonal group SO(2).

'''Constant positive curvature:'''
A Möbius band of constant positive curvature cannot be complete, since it is known that the only complete surfaces of constant positive curvature are the sphere and the [[Real projective plane|projective plane]].  The projective plane '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of constant curvature +1 may be constructed as the quotient of the unit sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by the antipodal map ''A'': ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, defined by {{nowrap|1=''A''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = (−''x'', −''y'', −''z'')}}.  The open Möbius band is homeomorphic to the once-punctured projective plane, that is, '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with any one point removed.  This may be thought of as the closest that a Möbius band of constant positive curvature can get to being a complete surface: just one point away.

The group of isometries of this Möbius band is also 1-dimensional and isomorphic to the orthogonal group O(2).

The space of unoriented lines in the plane is [[diffeomorphic]] to the open Möbius band.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Phillip|year=1993|title=Spaces of Geodesics|journal=Aportaciones Matemáticas|series=Notas de Investigación|pages=67–79|publisher=UASLP|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/~pparker/research/sog.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see why, let ''L''(''θ'') denote the line through the origin at an angle ''θ'' to the positive x-axis.  For each ''L''(''θ'') there is the family ''P''(''θ'') of all lines in the plane that are perpendicular to ''L''(''θ'').  Topologically, the family ''P''(''θ'') is just a line (because each line in ''P''(''θ'') intersects the line ''L''(''θ'') in just one point).  In this way, as ''θ'' increases in the range {{nowrap|0° ≤ ''θ'' &lt; 180°}}, the line ''L''(''θ'') represents a line's worth of distinct lines in the plane. But when ''θ'' reaches 180°, ''L''(180°) is identical to ''L''(0), and so the families ''P''(0°) and ''P''(180°) of perpendicular lines are also identical families.  The line ''L''(0°), however, has returned to itself as ''L''(180°) ''pointed in the opposite direction''. Every line in the plane corresponds to exactly one line in some family ''P''(''θ''), for exactly one ''θ'', for {{nowrap|0° ≤ ''θ'' &lt; 180°}}, and ''P''(180°) is identical to ''P''(0°) but returns pointed in the opposite direction.  This ensures that the space of all lines in the plane – the union of all the ''L''(''θ'') for {{nowrap|0° ≤ ''θ'' ≤ 180°}} – is an open Möbius band.

The group of bijective linear transformations {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}} of the plane to itself (real {{nowrap|2 × 2}} matrices with non-zero determinant) naturally induces bijections of '''the space of lines in the plane''' to itself, which form a group of self-homeomorphisms of the space of lines.  Hence the same group forms a group of self-homeomorphisms of the Möbius band described in the previous paragraph.  But there is no metric on the space of lines in the plane that is invariant under the action of this group of homeomorphisms. In this sense, the space of lines in the plane has no natural metric on it.

This means that the Möbius band possesses a natural 4-dimensional [[Lie group]] of self-homeomorphisms, given by {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}}, but this high degree of symmetry cannot be exhibited as the group of isometries of any metric.

===Möbius band with round boundary===
The edge, or [[boundary (topology)|boundary]], of a Möbius strip is [[homeomorphic]] (topologically equivalent) to a [[circle]].  Under the usual embeddings of the strip in Euclidean space, as above, the boundary is not a true circle.  However, it is possible to [[embedding|embed]] a Möbius strip in three dimensions so that the boundary is a perfect circle lying in some plane.  For example, see Figures 307, 308, and 309 of "Geometry and the imagination".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A much more geometric embedding begins with a minimal [[Klein bottle]] immersed in the 3-sphere, as discovered by Blaine Lawson.  We then take half of this Klein bottle to get a Möbius band embedded in the 3-sphere (the unit sphere in 4-space). The result is sometimes called the "Sudanese Möbius Band"
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |author1=Dan Asimov |author2=Doug Lerner | title = Issue 17 SIGGRAPH '84 Electronic Theater
 | year = 1984
 | url = http://www.siggraph.org/publications/video-review/1_36.php}}
&lt;/ref&gt; where "sudanese" refers not to the country [[Sudan]] but to the names of two topologists, Sue Goodman and Daniel Asimov.  Applying stereographic projection to the Sudanese band places it in 3-dimensional space, as can be seen below – a version due to George Francis can be found [http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/graphics/pix/Special_Topics/Differential_Geometry/illiview.html here].

From Lawson's minimal Klein bottle we derive an embedding of the band into the [[3-sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, regarded as a subset of '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is geometrically the same as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.  We map angles ''η'', ''φ'' to complex numbers ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = \sin\eta\,e^{i\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_2 = \cos\eta\,e^{i\varphi/2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here the parameter ''η'' runs from 0 to ''π'' and ''φ'' runs from 0 to 2''π''. Since {{nowrap|1={{abs|&amp;thinsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + {{abs|&amp;thinsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, the embedded surface lies entirely in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The boundary of the strip is given by {{nowrap|1={{abs|&amp;thinsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;}} = 1}} (corresponding to {{nowrap|1=''η'' = 0, ''π''}}), which is clearly a circle on the 3-sphere.

To obtain an embedding of the Möbius strip in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; one maps ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; via a [[stereographic projection]]. The projection point can be any point on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that does not lie on the embedded Möbius strip (this rules out all the usual projection points). One possible choice is &lt;math&gt;\left\{1/\sqrt{2},i/\sqrt{2}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Stereographic projections map circles to circles and preserves the circular boundary of the strip. The result is a smooth embedding of the Möbius strip into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with a circular edge and no self-intersections.

[[File:MobiusSnail2B.png|center|580px]]

The Sudanese Möbius band in the three-sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is geometrically a fibre bundle over a great circle, whose fibres are great semicircles.  The most symmetrical image of a stereographic projection of this band into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained by using a projection point that lies on that great circle that runs through the midpoint of each of the semicircles. Each choice of such a projection point results in an image that is congruent to any other. But because such a projection point lies on the Möbius band itself, two aspects of the image are significantly different from the case (illustrated above) where the point is not on the band: 1) the image in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is not the full Möbius band, but rather the band with one point removed (from its centerline); and 2) the image is unbounded – and as it gets increasingly far from the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, it increasingly approximates a plane.  Yet this version of the stereographic image has a group of 4 symmetries in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (it is isomorphic to the [[Klein 4-group]]), as compared with the bounded version illustrated above having its group of symmetries the unique group of order 2. (If all symmetries and not just orientation-preserving isometries of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are allowed, the numbers of symmetries in each case doubles.)

But the most geometrically symmetrical version of all is the original Sudanese Möbius band in the three-sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where its full group of symmetries is isomorphic to the Lie group O(2). Having an infinite cardinality (that of the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]]), this is far larger than the symmetry group of any possible embedding of the Möbius band in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Related objects==
A closely related 'strange' geometrical object is the [[Klein bottle]]. A Klein bottle can be produced by gluing two Möbius strips together along their edges; this cannot be done in ordinary three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] without creating self-intersections.&lt;ref&gt;

Another closely related manifold is the [[real projective plane]]. If a circular disk is cut out of the real projective plane, what is left is a Möbius strip.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Going in the other direction, if one glues a disk to a Möbius strip by identifying their boundaries, the result is the projective plane. To visualize this, it is helpful to deform the Möbius strip so that its boundary is an ordinary circle (see above). The real projective plane, like the Klein bottle, cannot be embedded in three-dimensions without self-intersections.

In [[graph theory]], the [[Möbius ladder]] is a [[cubic graph]] closely related to the Möbius strip.

In 1968, Gonzalo Vélez Jahn (UCV, Caracas, Venezuela) discovered three dimensional bodies with Möbian characteristics;&lt;ref&gt;[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/VelezJahnsMoebiusToroidalPolyhedron/ Wolfram Demonstration Project:  Vélez-Jahn's Möbius Toroidal Polyhedron]&lt;/ref&gt; these were later described by [[Martin Gardner]] as prismatic rings that became toroidal polyhedrons in his August 1978 [[Mathematical Games column]] in Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;This was the third time Gardner had featured the Möbius strip in his column.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Moebiusstripscarf.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Mathematics and art|Mathematical art]]: a [[scarf]] designed as a Möbius strip]]
There have been several technical applications for the Möbius strip.  Giant Möbius strips have been used as [[conveyor belt]]s that last longer because the entire surface area of the belt gets the same amount of wear, and as continuous-loop recording tapes (to double the playing time).  Möbius strips are common in the manufacture of fabric computer printer and [[typewriter ribbon]]s, as they let the ribbon be twice as wide as the print head while using both halves evenly.&lt;ref&gt;Hogarth, Ian W. and Kiewning, Friedhelm. (1991) "Typewriter or printer ribbon and method for its manufacture" {{US Patent|5062725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Möbius resistor]] is an electronic circuit element that cancels its own inductive reactance. [[Nikola Tesla]] patented similar technology in 1894:&lt;ref&gt;Tesla, Nikola (1894) "Coil for Electro-Magnets" {{US Patent|512340}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Coil for Electro Magnets" was intended for use with his system of global transmission of electricity without wires.

The Möbius strip is the [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of two unordered points on a circle.  Consequently, in [[music theory]], the space of all two-note chords, known as [[Dyad (music)|dyads]], takes the shape of a Möbius strip; this and generalizations to more points is a significant [[Orbifold#Music theory|application of orbifolds to music theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080507-math-music.html Clara Moskowitz, Music Reduced to Beautiful Math, LiveScience]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dmitri Tymoczko |title= The Geometry of Musical Chords |date= 7 July 2006 |volume= 313 |issue= 5783 |pages= 72–4 |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |doi= 10.1126/science.1126287 |pmid= 16825563|bibcode= 2006Sci...313...72T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In stage magic ===
The Möbius strip principle has been used as a method of creating [[Magic (illusion)|the illusion of magic]]. The trick, known as the Afghan bands, was very popular in the first half of the twentieth century. Many versions of this trick exist and have been performed by famous illusionists such as [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]] and [[Thomas Nelson Downs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://magicperspectives.net/afghan-bands/|title=The Möbius Strip in Magic: A Treatise on the Afghan Bands|last=Prevos|first=Peter|publisher=Third Hemisphere|year=2018|isbn=|location=Kangaroo Flat|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mathematics, Magic and Mystery|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=Dover Books|year=1956|isbn=|location=New York|pages=70-73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part III of the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]]''' (officially '''Master of Mathematics/Master of Advanced Study''') is a one-year [[Master's degree|Master]]s-level taught course in [[mathematics]] offered at the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge]]. It is regarded as one of the hardest and most intensive mathematics courses in the world and is taken by approximately 200 students each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2014.maths.cam.ac.uk/facultyboard/partiiicommittee/exreport2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~twk/PartIII.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly one third of the students take the course as a [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|fourth year]] of mathematical study at Cambridge (after Parts IA, IB, and II), whilst the remaining two thirds take the course as a one-year course.&lt;ref name="discussion" /&gt;

==History==
The [[Smith's Prize]] Examination was founded by bequest of [[Robert Smith (mathematician)|Robert Smith]] upon his death in 1768 to encourage the study of more advanced mathematics than that found in the undergraduate course. [[Thomas William Körner|T. W. Körner]] notes

{{quote|Only a small handful of students took the Smith's prize examination in the nineteenth century. When [[Karl Pearson]] took the examination in 1879, the examiners were [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|Stokes]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]], and [[Isaac Todhunter|Todhunter]] and the examinees went on each occasion to the examiner's house, did a morning paper, had lunch there, and continued their work on the paper in the afternoon.|[[Thomas William Körner]]&lt;ref name="discussion" /&gt;}}

In 1883 this was replaced by an exam called ''Part III'' and the Smith's Prize awarded for an essay rather than examination. In 1886 this exam was renamed ''Part II'', and later in 1909 ''Part II, Schedule B''. In 1934 it was again renamed ''Part III''.&lt;ref name="discussion" /&gt; 

In the 1980s the ''Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics'' was introduced; for those students successfully completing Part III of the Mathematical Tripos in Easter Term 2011 CASM was replaced by two new degrees, the ''[[Master of Mathematics]]'' (M.Math.) and ''[[Master of Advanced Study]]'' (M.A.St.). All who have passed the course since 1962 are entitled to these new degrees.&lt;ref name="discussion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2008-09/weekly/6138/16.html|title=Discussion on the establishment of a degree of Master of Mathematics and a degree of Master of Advanced Study|publisher=Cambridge University Reporter|date=2009-01-28|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first retrospective M.Math and M.A.St. degrees were conferred as part of a celebration of the University's 800th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mathiii/arrangements.html|title=Award of the Master of Mathematics and the Master of Advanced Study in Mathematics|author=T.

==Master of Mathematics vs Master of Advanced Study==
Students who have completed their undergraduate degree at Cambridge will be awarded both a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) and the [[Master of Mathematics]] (M.Math.) degree for four years of study, provided they have not previously graduated with a B.A.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mathiii/partiimeeting/&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Cambridge graduates to remain eligible for government funding for the course. Progression from Part II of the Mathematical Tripos to Part III normally requires either a first in Part II or very good performances in Parts IB and Part II.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; 
Students who complete Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, but did not complete undergraduate studies at Cambridge (or have previously graduated with a B.A.) will be awarded the [[Master of Advanced Study]] (M.A.St.) in Mathematics degree for the one-year course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2008-09/weekly/6133/13.html|title=Joint Report of the Council and the General Board on the establishment of a degree of Master of Mathematics and a degree of Master of Advanced Study|publisher=Cambridge University Reporter|date=2008-12-10|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2008-09/weekly/6144/21.html|title=Graces submitted to the Regent House on 11 March 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Reporter|date=2009-03-11|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program previously resulted in a Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics instead of a Master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/certificate-advanced-study-mathematics-part-iii-announcement-1|title=Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics (Part III) : Announcement|publisher=Cambridge University Reporter|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current course structure==
The course lasts one year, divided into three eight-week terms. There are a wide variety of lectures on both pure and applied maths, mostly concentrated in the first two terms. The third term is primarily for examinations (and revision for said examinations) which, together with the option of writing a part III essay (introduced in the 1970s, a miniature [[thesis]] of sorts, often in the form of a [[literature review]]), determine one's final grade entirely.

==Grading==

The grades available are Fail, Pass (Honours), Merit, and Distinction (the Merit grade was introduced in 2000).  Cambridge recognises that in Part III of the mathematical tripos a merit is equivalent to a [[British undergraduate degree classification|First Class]] in the other parts of the Tripos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mathiii/creditdetails.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/planning/sso/studentnumbers/2014exams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The level of achievement required for a distinction is yet higher.
Traditionally, results are announced in the University's [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]]. Standing on the [[balcony]], the examiner reads out the [[British undergraduate degree classification|class results]] for each student, and printed copies of the results are then thrown to the audience below. The students' exact rankings are no longer announced, but highest-ranked student is still identified, nowadays by the [[Hat tip|tipping]] of the examiner's [[Square academic cap|academic hat]] when the relevant name is read out.

==Prizes==

In addition to the grades, there are five associated prizes. Four of these may be awarded at the discretion of the examiners: the [[Mayhew Prize]] for [[Applied Mathematics]], the [[Tyson Medal]] for [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]], the Bartlett Prize for [[applied probability]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/2013/chapter12-section2.html#heading2-28&lt;/ref&gt; and the Wishart Prize for [[statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/2013/chapter12-section2.html#heading2-601&lt;/ref&gt; Several notable astronomers and astrophysicists have been awarded the [[Tyson Medal]] in the history of Part III maths, including [[Jayant Narlikar]], Ray Lyttleton and [[Edmund Whittaker]]. In addition, the [[Thomas Bond Sprague Prize]]
is awarded by the [[Rollo Davidson Prize|Rollo Davidson Trust]] for distinguished performance in [[actuarial science]], 
[[finance]], [[insurance]], [[operations research|mathematics of operational research]], [[probability theory|probability]], [[risk]]
and [[statistics]].

==Biography==
Fischer was born December 3, 1935, in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; His father, Carl H. Fischer, became a professor of actuarial mathematics at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://um2017.org/faculty-history/faculty/carl-h-fischer|contribution=Carl H. Fischer|title=University of Michigan Faculty History Project|accessdate=3 September 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the family moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] where he grew up.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Fischer himself went to the University of Michigan, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1957&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; and an MBA in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=Dividend, the Magazine of the Graduate School of Business Administration|publisher=University of Michigan|date=Fall 1981|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/50729/2/1981-fall-dividend-text.pdf|page=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to graduate studies at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], earning a Ph.D. in 1962 under the supervision of [[Hartley Rogers, Jr.]], with a thesis on the subject of [[recursion theory]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Patrick Carl Fischer|id=13297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving his Ph.D. in 1962, Fischer joined the faculty of [[Harvard University]] as an assistant professor of [[applied mathematics]]; his students at Harvard included [[Albert R. Meyer]], through whom Fischer has over 250 [[academic genealogy|academic descendants]]. as well as noted computer scientists [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Arnold L. Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="mg"/&gt; In 1965, he moved to a tenured position as associate professor of computer science at [[Cornell University]]. After teaching at the [[University of British Columbia]] from 1967 to 1968 (where he met his second wife Charlotte Froese) he moved to the [[University of Waterloo]] where he became a professor of applied analysis and computer science. At Waterloo, he was department chair from 1972 to 1974. He then moved to [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1974, where he headed the computer science department, and moved again to [[Vanderbilt University]] as department chair in 1980.&lt;ref name="fortnow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; He taught at Vanderbilt for 18 years, and was chair for 15 years.&lt;ref name="vandy"/&gt; He retired in 1998,&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; and died of [[stomach cancer]] on August 26, 2011 in [[Rockville, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="fortnow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;

Like his father, Fischer became a [[fellow]] of the [[Society of Actuaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.actuary.org/archives/pdf/yearbook/yearbook_1969.pdf|title=1969 Year Book|author=American Academy of Actuaries|year=1969|publisher=University of Chicago|page=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fischer's second wife, [[Charlotte Froese Fischer]], was also a computer science professor at Vanderbilt University and the University of British Columbia, and his brother, [[Michael J. Fischer]], is a computer science professor at Yale University.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fortnow"/&gt;

==Research==
Fischer's thesis research concerned the effects of different models of computation on the efficiency of solving problems. For instance, he showed how to generate the sequence of [[prime number]]s using a one-dimensional [[cellular automaton]], based on earlier solutions to the [[firing squad synchronization problem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Fischer was an early leader in the field of [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], and helped establish [[theoretical computer science]] as a discipline separate from [[mathematics]] and [[electrical engineering]].&lt;ref name="psu"/&gt; He was the first chair of [[SIGACT]], the Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], which he founded in 1968.&lt;ref name="fortnow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; He also founded the annual [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]], which together with the [[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] is one of the two flagship conferences in [[theoretical computer science]], and he served five times as chair of the conference.&lt;ref name="fortnow"/&gt;

In the 1980s, Fischer's research interests shifted to [[database theory]]. His research in that area included the study of the [[semantics]] of databases, [[metadata]], and incomplete information.&lt;ref name="fortnow"/&gt; Fischer did important work defining the [[nested relational model]] of databases, in which the values in the cells of a [[relational database]] may themselves be relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his work on the mathematical foundations of database [[query language]]s became central to the databases now used by major web servers worldwide.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Fischer was also an expert in [[information system]]s and their use by educational institutions.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vandy"/&gt;

==Unabomber==
[[Ted Kaczynski]], known as the Unabomber, was a graduate student of mathematics at the University of Michigan, where Fischer's father was a professor.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; In 1982, Kaczynski sent the fifth of his [[mail bomb]]s to Fischer, at his Penn State address; it was forwarded to Vanderbilt, where it was opened on May 5 by Fischer's secretary, Janet Smith, who was hospitalized for three weeks after the attack.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Fischer claimed not to have ever met Kaczynski,&lt;ref name="fortnow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; and speculated that he was targeted because he "went from pure math to theoretical computer science."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Kaczynski was not apprehended until 1996, by which time the [[statute of limitations]] on the 1982 bombing had expired, so he was never prosecuted for it.&lt;ref name="fortnow"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5697">In [[mathematics]], the notions of '''prevalence and shyness''' are notions of "[[almost everywhere]]" and "[[measure zero]]" that are well-suited to the study of [[Infinity|infinite]]-[[dimension]]al spaces and make use of the translation-invariant [[Lebesgue measure]] on finite-dimensional real spaces. The term "shy" was suggested by the [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] [[John Milnor]].

==Definitions==

===Prevalence and shyness===

Let ''V'' be a [[real number|real]] [[topological vector space]] and let ''S'' be a [[Borel sigma algebra|Borel-measurable]] [[subset]] of ''V''. ''S'' is said to be '''prevalent''' if there exists a finite-dimensional subspace ''P'' of ''V'', called the '''probe set''', such that for all ''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''V'' we have ''v''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''S'' for ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;-[[almost all]] ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''P'', where ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the dim(''P'')-dimensional Lebesgue measure on ''P''. Put another way, for every ''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''V'', Lebesgue-almost every point of the [[hyperplane]] ''v''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''P'' lies in ''S''.

A non-Borel subset of ''V'' is said to be prevalent if it contains a prevalent Borel subset.

A Borel subset of ''V'' is said to be '''shy''' if its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] is prevalent; a non-Borel subset of ''V'' is said to be shy if it is contained within a shy Borel subset.

An alternative, and slightly more general, definition is to define a set ''S'' to be shy if there exists a [[transverse measure]] for ''S'' (other than the [[trivial measure]]).

===Local prevalence and shyness===

A subset ''S'' of ''V'' is said to be '''locally shy''' if every point ''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''V'' has a [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; whose [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] with ''S'' is a shy set. ''S'' is said to be '''locally prevalent''' if its complement is locally shy.

==Theorems involving prevalence and shyness==

* If ''S'' is shy, then so is every subset of ''S'' and every translate of ''S''.
* Every shy Borel set ''S'' admits a transverse measure that is finite and has [[compact space|compact]] [[support (measure theory)|support]]. Furthermore, this measure can be chosen so that its support has arbitrarily small [[diameter]].
* Any finite or [[countable]] [[union (set theory)|union]] of shy sets is also shy.
* Any shy set is also locally shy. If ''V'' is a [[separable space]], then every locally shy subset of ''V'' is also shy.
* A subset ''S'' of ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is shy [[if and only if]] it has Lebesgue measure zero.
* Any prevalent subset ''S'' of ''V'' is [[dense (topology)|dense]] in ''V''.
* If ''V'' is infinite-dimensional, then every compact subset of ''V'' is shy.

In the following, "almost every" is taken to mean that the stated property holds of a prevalent subset of the space in question.

* Almost every [[continuous function]] from the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,&amp;nbsp;1] into the [[real line]] '''R''' is [[nowhere differentiable]]; here the space ''V'' is ''C''([0,&amp;nbsp;1];&amp;nbsp;'''R''') with the topology induced by the [[supremum norm]].
* Almost every function ''f'' in the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;([0,&amp;nbsp;1];&amp;nbsp;'''R''') has the property that
::&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \, \mathrm{d} x \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt;
:Clearly, the same property holds for the spaces of ''k''-times [[differentiable function]]s ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;([0,&amp;nbsp;1];&amp;nbsp;'''R''').

* For 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;infin;, almost every sequence ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;isin;'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; has the property that the series
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} a_{n}&lt;/math&gt;
:diverges.

* Prevalence version of the [[Whitney embedding theorem]]: Let ''M'' be a compact [[manifold]] of class ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and dimension ''d'' contained in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  For 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;infin;, almost every ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2''d''+1&lt;/sup&gt; is an [[embedding]] of ''M''.
* If ''A'' is a compact subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[Hausdorff dimension]] ''d'', ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''d'', and 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;infin;, then, for almost every ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''f''(''A'') also has Hausdorff dimension ''d''.
* For 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;infin;, almost every ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; has the property that all of its [[periodic point]]s are hyperbolic. In particular, the same is true for all the period ''p'' points, for any integer ''p''.

[[File:Firenze, porfirio, isagoge, e miscellanea di aristotele, 1290 ca. 01, pluteo 11 sin 1. f. 138r.jpg|thumb|300px|Aristotle ''Prior Analytics'' in Latin, 1290 circa, [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], Florence]]
[[File:Aristotle Opera Logica.jpg|thumb|236px&lt;!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)--&gt;|Page from a 13th/14th-century Latin transcript of Aristotle's ''Opera Logica''.]]

The '''''Prior Analytics''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀναλυτικὰ Πρότερα}}; {{lang-la|Analytica Priora}}) is [[Aristotle]]'s work on [[deductive reasoning]], which is known as his [[syllogistic]]. Being one of the six extant Aristotelian writings on logic and scientific method, it is part of what later [[Peripatetics]] called the ''[[Organon]]''. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by [[Jan Lukasiewicz]] of a revolutionary paradigm. The [[Jan Lukasiewicz]] approach was replaced in the early 1970s in a series of papers by [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]  and [[Timothy Smiley]]&lt;ref&gt;"We should not let modern standard systems force us to distort our interpretations of the ancient doctrines. A good example is the Corcoran-Smiley interpretation of Aristotelian categorical syllogistic which permits us to translate the actual details of the Aristotelian exposition almost sentencewise into modern notation (Corcoran 1974a; Smiley 1973). Lukasiewicz (1957) once thought that most of Aristotle's more specific methods were inadequate because they could not be formulated in the modern systems then known. He arrived at such a formulation only by distorting Aristotle's thought to a certain degree. In this respect Corcoran's interpretation is far superior in that it is very near to the texts while being fully correct from the point of view of modern logic." Urs Egli, "Stoic Syntax and Semantics." In Jacques Brunschwig (ed.), ''Les Stoiciens et leur logique'', Paris, Vrin, 1986, pp. 135-147 (2nd edition 2006, pp. 131-148).

&lt;/ref&gt; —which inform modern translations of ''Prior Analytics'' by Robin Smith in 1989 and [[Gisela Striker]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;*Review of "Aristotle, Prior Analytics: Book I, Gisela Striker (translation and commentary), Oxford UP, 2009, 268pp., $39.95 (pbk), {{ISBN|978-0-19-925041-7}}." in the ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', [http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=18787 2010.02.02].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "analytics" comes from the Greek words ἀναλυτός (''analytos'' "solvable") and ἀναλύω (''analyo'' "to solve", literally "to loose"). However, in Aristotle's corpus, there are distinguishable differences in the meaning of ἀναλύω and its cognates. There is also the possibility that Aristotle may have borrowed his use of the word "analysis" from his teacher [[Plato]]. On the other hand, the meaning that best fits the ''Analytics'' is one derived from the study of Geometry and this meaning is very close to what Aristotle calls έπιστήμη ''episteme'', knowing the reasoned facts. Therefore, Analysis is the process of finding the reasoned facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Patrick Hugh Byrne |title=Analysis and Science in Aristotle |page=3 |quote=... while "decompose" - the most prevalent connotation of "analyze" in the modern period&amp;nbsp;— is among Aristotle's meanings, it is neither the sole meaning nor the principal meaning nor the meaning which best characterizes the work, Analytics. |year=1997 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0-7914-3321-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' represents the first time in history when Logic is scientifically investigated. On those grounds alone, Aristotle could be considered the Father of Logic for as he himself says in ''Sophistical Refutations'', "... When it comes to this subject, it is not the case that part had been worked out before in advance and part had not; instead, nothing existed at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jonathan Barnes |title=The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle |page=27 |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-42294-9 |quote=History's first logic has also been the most influential...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem in meaning arises in the study of ''Prior Analytics'' for the word "syllogism" as used by Aristotle in general does not carry the same narrow connotation as it does at present; Aristotle defines this term in a way that would apply to a wide range of [[valid argument]]s. Some scholars prefer to use the word "deduction" instead as the meaning given by Aristotle to the Greek word συλλογισμός ''syllogismos''. At present, "syllogism" is used exclusively as the method used to reach a conclusion which is really the narrow sense in which it is used in the Prior Analytics dealing as it does with a much narrower class of arguments closely resembling the "syllogisms" of traditional logic texts: two premises followed by a conclusion each of which is a categorial sentence containing all together three terms, two extremes which appear in the conclusion and one middle term which appears in both premises but not in the conclusion. In the ''Analytics'' then, ''Prior Analytics'' is the first theoretical part dealing with the science of deduction and the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' is the second demonstratively practical part. ''Prior Analytics'' gives an account of deductions in general narrowed down to three basic syllogisms while ''Posterior Analytics'' deals with demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Robin |title=Aristotle: Prior Analytics |pages=XIII-XVI |year=1989 |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co. |isbn=0-87220-064-7 |quote=... This leads him to what I would regard as the most original and brilliant insight in the entire work.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Prior Analytics'', Aristotle defines syllogism as "... A deduction in a discourse in which, certain things being supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so." In modern times, this definition has led to a debate as to how the word "syllogism" should be interpreted. Scholars [[Jan Lukasiewicz]], [[Józef Maria Bocheński]] and Günther Patzig have sided with the [[Antecedent (logic)|Protasis]]-[[Consequent|Apodosis]] [[dichotomy]] while [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] prefers to consider a syllogism as simply a deduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lagerlund |first=Henrik |title=Modal Syllogistics in the Middle Ages |pages=3–4 |quote=In the ''Prior Analytics'' Aristotle presents the first logical system, i.e., the theory of the syllogisms. |year=2000 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-11626-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third century AD, [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]'s commentary on the ''Prior Analytics'' is the oldest extant and one of the best of the ancient tradition and is available in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Striker |first=Gisela |title=Aristotle: ''Prior Analytics'', Book 1 |page=xx |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-925041-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth century, [[Boethius]] composed the first known Latin translation of the ''Prior Analytics''.

== The syllogism &lt;!--Linked from 'Bryson of Heraclea'--&gt; ==
The ''Prior Analytics'' represents the first formal study of logic, where logic is understood as the study of arguments. An argument is a series of true or false statements which lead to a true or false conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nolt |first1=John |last2=Rohatyn |first2=Dennis |title=Logic: Schaum's outline of theory and problems |page=1 |year=1988 |publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=0-07-053628-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Prior Analytics'', Aristotle identifies valid and invalid forms of arguments called syllogisms. A syllogism is an argument that consists of at least three sentences: at least two premises and a conclusion. Although Aristotles does not call them "categorical sentences," tradition does; he deals with them briefly in the ''Analytics'' and more extensively in ''On Interpretation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robin Smith |title=Aristotle: Prior Analytics |page=XVII }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each proposition (statement that is a thought of the kind expressible by a declarative sentence)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Nolt/Dennis Rohatyn |title=Logic: Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems |pages=274–275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a syllogism is a categorical sentence which has a subject and a predicate connected by a verb. The usual way of connecting the subject and predicate of a categorical sentence as Aristotle does in ''On Interpretation'' is by using a linking verb e.g. P is S. However, in the Prior Analytics Aristotle rejects the usual form in favor of three of his inventions: 1) P belongs to S, 2) P is predicated of S and 3) P is said of S. Aristotle does not explain why he introduces these innovative expressions but scholars conjecture that the reason may have been that it facilitates the use of letters instead of terms avoiding the ambiguity that results in Greek when letters are used with the linking verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anagnostopoulos |first=Georgios |title=A Companion to Aristotle |page=33 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-2223-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his formulation of syllogistic propositions, instead of the copula ("All/some... are/are not..."), Aristotle uses the expression, "... belongs to/does not belong to all/some..." or "... is said/is not said of all/some..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patzig |first=Günther |title=Aristotle's theory of the syllogism |page=49 |year=1969 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-277-0030-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four different types of categorical sentences: universal affirmative (A), particular affirmative (I), universal negative (E) and particular negative (O).

*A	-	A belongs to every B
*E      -       A belongs to no B
*I	-	A belongs to some B
*O	-	A does not belong to some B

A method of symbolization that originated and was used in the Middle Ages greatly simplifies the study of the Prior Analytics.
Following this tradition then, let:

a = belongs to every

e = belongs to no

i = belongs to some

o = does not belong to some

Categorical sentences may then be abbreviated as follows:

AaB = A belongs to every B (Every B is A)

AeB = A belongs to no B (No B is A)

AiB = A belongs to some B (Some B is A)

AoB = A does not belong to some B (Some B is not A)

From the viewpoint of modern logic, only a few types of sentences can be represented in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle |pages=34–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The three figures ===

Depending on the position of the middle term, Aristotle divides the syllogism into three kinds: Syllogism in the first, second and third figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle |page=35 |quote=At the foundation of Aristotle's syllogistic is a theory of a specific class of arguments: arguments having as premises exactly two categorical sentences with one term in common.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the Middle Term is subject of one premise and predicate of the other, the premises are in the First Figure. If the Middle Term is predicate of both premises, the premises are in the Second Figure. If the Middle Term is subject of both premises, the premises are in the Third Figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robin Smith |title=Aristotle: Prior Analytics |page=XVIII }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolically, the Three Figures may be represented as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! First figure
! Second figure
! Third figure
|-
|
| Predicate&amp;nbsp;— Subject
| Predicate&amp;nbsp;— Subject
| Predicate&amp;nbsp;— Subject
|-
| Major premise
| A ------------ B
| B ------------ A
| A ------------ B
|-
| Minor premise
| B ------------ C
| B ------------ C
| C ------------ B
|-
| Conclusion
| A ********** C
| A ********** C
| A ********** C
|}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henrik Legerlund |title=Modal Syllogistics in the Middle Ages |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syllogism in the first figure ==

In the ''Prior Analytics'' translated by A. J. Jenkins as it appears in volume 8 of the Great Books of the Western World, Aristotle says of the First Figure: "... If A is predicated of all B, and B of all C, A must be predicated of all C."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Great Books of the Western World |volume=8 |page=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Prior Analytics'' translated by Robin Smith, Aristotle says of the first figure: "... For if A is predicated of every B and B of every C, it is necessary for A to be predicated of every C."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robin Smith |title=Aristotle: ''Prior Analytics'' |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking a = is predicated of all = is predicated of every, and using the symbolical method used in the Middle Ages, then the first figure is simplified to:

If AaB

and BaC

then AaC.

Or what amounts to the same thing:

AaB, BaC; therefore AaC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle |page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the four syllogistic propositions, a, e, i, o are placed in the first figure, Aristotle comes up with the following valid forms of deduction for the first figure:

AaB, BaC; therefore, AaC

AeB, BaC; therefore, AeC

AaB, BiC; therefore, AiC

AeB, BiC; therefore, AoC

In the Middle Ages, for [[mnemonic]] reasons they were called respectively "Barbara", "Celarent", "Darii" and "Ferio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle |page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between the first figure and the other two figures is that the syllogism of the first figure is complete while that of the second and fourth is not. [?? and the third?? something wrong here.] This is important in Aristotle's theory of the syllogism for the first figure is axiomatic while the second and third require proof. The proof of the second and third figure always leads back to the first figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henrik Legerlund |title=Modal Syllogistics in the Middle Ages |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syllogism in the second figure ==

This is what Robin Smith says in English that Aristotle said in Ancient Greek: "... If M belongs to every N but to no X, then neither will N belong to any X. For if M belongs to no X, neither does X belong to any M; but M belonged to every N; therefore, X will belong to no N (for the first figure has again come about)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robin Smith |title=Aristotle: Prior Analytics |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above statement can be simplified by using the symbolical method used in the Middle Ages:

If MaN

but MeX

then NeX.

For if MeX

then XeM

but MaN

therefore XeN.

When the four syllogistic propositions, a, e, i, o are placed in the second figure, Aristotle comes up with the following valid forms of deduction for the second figure:

MaN, MeX; therefore NeX

MeN, MaX; therefore NeX

MeN, MiX; therefore NoX

MaN, MoX; therefore NoX

In the Middle Ages, for mnemonic resons they were called respectively "Camestres", "Cesare", "Festino" and "Baroco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syllogism in the third figure ==

Aristotle says in the Prior Analytics, "... If one term belongs to all and another to none of the same thing, or if they both belong to all or none of it, I call such figure the third." Referring to universal terms, "... then when both P and R belongs to every S, it results of necessity that P will belong to some R."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robin Smith |title=Aristotle: Prior Analytics |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simplifying:

If PaS

and RaS

then PiR.

When the four syllogistic propositions, a, e, i, o are placed in the third figure, Aristotle develops six more valid forms of deduction:

PaS, RaS; therefore PiR

PeS, RaS; therefore PoR

PiS, RaS; therefore PiR

PaS, RiS; therefore PiR

PoS, RaS; therefore PoR

PeS, RiS; therefore PoR

In the Middle Ages, for mnemonic reasons, these six forms were called respectively: "Darapti", "Felapton", "Disamis", "Datisi", "Bocardo" and "Ferison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle |page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The fourth figure ==

"In Aristotelian syllogistic (''Prior Analytics'', Bk I Caps 4-7), syllogisms are divided into three figures according to the position of the middle term in the two premises. The fourth figure, in which the middle term is the predicate in the major premise and the subject in the minor, was added by Aristotle's pupil [[Theophrastus]] and does not occur in Aristotle's work, although there is evidence that Aristotle knew of fourth-figure syllogisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Bertrand |last2=Blackwell |first2=Kenneth |title=Cambridge essays, 1888-99 |year=1983 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-04-920067-8 |page=411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boole’s acceptance of Aristotle==
[[File:Alexander - Commentaria in Analytica priora Aristotelis, 1549 - 4725692.tif |thumb|''Commentaria in Analytica priora Aristotelis'', 1549]]
[[George Boole]]'s unwavering acceptance of Aristotle’s logic is emphasized by the historian of logic [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] in an accessible introduction to ''Laws of Thought''&lt;ref&gt;[[George Boole]]. 1854/2003. The Laws of Thought, facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in Philosophy in Review.24 (2004) 167–169.&lt;/ref&gt; Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of ''Prior Analytics'' and ''Laws of Thought''.&lt;ref&gt;JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol. 24 (2003), pp. 261–288.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle’s logic. Boole’s goals were “to go under, over, and beyond” Aristotle’s logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations, 2) extending the class of problems it could treat—from assessing validity to solving equations--, and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle—e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.

More specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole’s ‘disagreements’, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. 
First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of [[Aristotle's logic]] to formulas in the form of equations—-by itself a revolutionary idea. 
Second, in the realm of logic’s problems, Boole’s addition of equation solving to logic—-another revolutionary idea—-involved Boole’s doctrine that Aristotle’s rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. 
Third, in the realm of applications, Boole’s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle’s system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9849">'''Ramanujan's lost notebook''' is the manuscript in which the Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] recorded the mathematical discoveries of the last year (1919–1920) of his life. Its whereabouts were unknown to all but a few mathematicians until it was rediscovered by [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]] in 1976, in a box of effects of [[G. N. Watson]] stored at the [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. The "notebook" is not a book, but consists of loose and unordered sheets of paper — "more than one hundred pages written on 138 sides in Ramanujan's distinctive handwriting. The sheets contained over six hundred mathematical formulas listed consecutively without proofs."&lt;ref name=RLNref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrews, George E.|authorlink=George E.

have published several  books in which they give proofs for Ramanujan's formulas included in the notebook. Berndt says of the notebooks' discovery: "The discovery of this 'Lost Notebook' caused roughly as much stir in the mathematical world as the discovery of [[Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)|Beethoven’s tenth symphony]] would cause in the musical world." {{harv|Peterson|2006}}

==History==
After Ramanujan died on April 26, 1920, at the age of 32, his wife gave his notebooks to the [[University of Madras]]. On August 30, 1923, the registrar Francis Drewsbury sent much of this material to [[G. H. Hardy]], probably including the lost notebook.

{{blockquote|... Almost surely, this manuscript, or at least most of it, was written during the last year of Ramanujan's life, after his return to India from England. ... The manuscript contains no introduction or covering letter. In fact, there are hardly any words in the manuscript. There are a few marks evidently made by a cataloguer, and there are a few remarks in the handwriting of [[G. H. Hardy]]. Undoubtedly, the most famous objects examined in the lost notebook are the ''[[mock theta function]]s'' ...&lt;ref name=RLNref/&gt;}}

Some time between 1934 and 1947 Hardy probably passed the notebook on to [[G. N. Watson]], who with [[Bertram Martin Wilson|B. M. Wilson]] started on the project of editing Ramanujan's notebooks. However, Wilson died in 1935 and Watson seems to have lost interest in the project in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name=BerndtRef&gt;{{cite web|author=Berndt, Bruce C.|title=An overview of Ramanujan's notebooks|page=3|postscript=; paper delivered at Proc. Conf. Karl der Grosse|website=math.uiuc.edu/~berndt/articles/aachen.pdf|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~berndt/articles/aachen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Watson's death in 1965, [[J. M. Whittaker]] examined Watson's  papers (which were a complete mess, due to be incinerated in a few days) and found Ramanujan's notebook, which he and [[R. A. Rankin]] sent to [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Trinity College Wren library]] on December 26, 1968.  {{harvs|txt|authorlink=George Andrews (mathematician)|first=George|last= Andrews|year=1986|loc=section 1.5}}, following a suggestion by [[Lucy Joan Slater|Lucy Slater]], found the lost notebook in the spring of 1976 while on a visit to Trinity College. It was published on December 22, 1987, by Narosa publishing house.

=== Andrews' account of the discovery===
George Andrews, an American mathematician, wrote an account of the discovery for the 125th celebration of Ramanujan's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrews|first=George E.|date=December 2012|title=The Discovery of Ramanujan's Lost Notebook|url=http://www.math.illinois.edu/~berndt/andrews.pdf|journal=The Legacy of Srinivasa Ramanujan: Proceedings of an International Conference in Celebration of the 125th Anniversary of Ramanujan’s Birth: University of Delhi|volume=|pages=17&amp;ndash;22|access-date=29 June 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his account, Andrews states that he was already an advanced researcher in fields, such as mock theta functions and [[hypergeometric series]], related closely to works of Ramanujan. In 1970, anticipating a [[sabbatical]], he wrote to [[British people|British]] mathematician [[Lucy Joan Slater|Lucy Slater]]. Slater "intriguingly" stated in her reply that she had inherited a "great collection" of papers from mathematicians such as Watson, Bailey, Jackson and Rogers, which were unsorted, including one of the last by Ramanujan. She also mentioned other papers were held by the Trinity College library. 

Although unable to travel to Europe in 1970, Andrews became able to do so in 1976, when he was due to attend a European conference in [[Strasbourg]], near the [[France]]-[[Germany]] border. He obtained permission and support from Slater, from the Trinity College library, and from his professor, Ben Noble, to visit Cambridge after the conference, in order to investigate the "invaluable" unpublished writings of Watson ''et al''. Noble agreed, adding that if he could attempt to find a lost paper by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] at the same time, it would be appreciated. The library's documents included a list of matters held from Watson's estate. The list included the item: ''"A 139 page manuscript by S. Ramanujan on q-series"'', containing the work from Ramanujan's final year. 

Although not labelled as such, the identity of the papers was settled because Ramanujan's final letters to Hardy had referred to the discovery of what Ramanujan called mock theta functions, although without great detail, and the manuscript included what appeared to be his full notes on these.

==Contents==
{{harvtxt|Rankin|1989}}  described the lost notebook in detail. The majority of the formulas are about ''q''-series and [[mock theta functions]], about a third are about [[modular equation]]s and singular moduli, and the remaining formulas are mainly about integrals, [[Dirichlet series]], congruences, and asymptotics. The mock theta functions in the notebook have been found to be useful for calculating the [[Entropy|entropy]] of [[Black hole|black holes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://thatsmaths.com/2012/12/06/ramanujans-lost-notebook "Ramanujan’s Lost Notebook"], ''ThatsMaths''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3921">In mathematics, a '''recurrent word''' or '''sequence''' is an infinite word over a finite alphabet in which every factor occurs infinitely often.&lt;ref name=LotII30&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS325&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PF2&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.2&lt;/ref&gt;  An infinite word is recurrent if and only if it is a [[sesquipower]].&lt;ref name=LotII141&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLRS133&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''uniformly recurrent word''' is a recurrent word in which for any given factor ''X'' in the sequence, there is some length ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; (often much longer than the length of ''X'') such that ''X'' appears in ''every'' block of length ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=LotII30/&gt;&lt;ref name=BR7&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS328&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.328&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''minimal sequence'''&lt;ref name=PF6&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; or '''almost periodic sequence'''(Muchnik, Semenov, Ushakov 2003) is also used.

==Examples==
* The easiest way to make a recurrent sequence is to form a [[periodic sequence]], one where the sequence repeats entirely after a given number ''m'' of steps.  Such a sequence is in then uniformly recurrent and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; can be set to any multiple of ''m'' that is larger than twice the length of ''X''.  A recurrent sequence that is ultimately periodic is purely periodic.&lt;ref name=AS325/&gt;
* The [[Thue–Morse sequence]] is uniformly recurrent ''without'' being periodic, nor even eventually periodic (meaning periodic after some nonperiodic initial segment).&lt;ref name=LotII31&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.31&lt;/ref&gt;  
* More generally, all [[Sturmian word]]s are recurrent.&lt;ref name=BR177&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9024">In [[Boolean logic]], a '''Reed–Muller expansion''' (or '''Davio expansion''') is a [[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]] of a [[Boolean function]].

For a Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) : \mathbb{B}^n \to \mathbb{B}&lt;/math&gt; we call

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_{{x_i}}(x) &amp; = f(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},1,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n) \\
f_{\overline{x}_i}(x)&amp; = f(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},0,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

the positive and negative [[Shannon expansion|cofactor]]s of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} &amp; = f_{x_i}(x) \oplus f_{\overline{x}_i}(x)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
the boolean derivation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{\oplus}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operator.

Then we have for the Reed–Muller or positive Davio expansion:

:&lt;math&gt;
f = f_{\overline{x}_i} \oplus x_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is written in a way that it resembles a [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;x_i=0&lt;/math&gt;. There is a similar decomposition corresponding to an expansion about &lt;math&gt;x_i=1&lt;/math&gt; (negative Davio):

:&lt;math&gt;
f = f_{x_i} \oplus \overline{x}_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Repeated application of the Reed–Muller expansion results in an XOR polynomial in &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
f = a_1 \oplus a_2 x_1 \oplus a_3 x_2 \oplus a_4 x_1 x_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{2^n} x_1\cdots x_n
&lt;/math&gt;

This representation is unique and sometimes also called Reed–Muller expansion.&lt;ref name="Kebschull_1992"/&gt;

E.g. for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; the result would be

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x_1, x_2) = f_{\overline{x}_1 \overline{x}_2} \oplus \frac{\partial f_{\overline{x}_2}}{\partial x_1} x_1 \oplus \frac{\partial f_{\overline{x}_1}}{\partial x_2} x_2 \oplus \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} x_1 x_2
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial^2 f \over \partial x_1 \partial x_2} = f_{\bar x_1 \bar x_2} \oplus f_{\bar x_1 x_2} \oplus f_{x_1 \bar x_2} \oplus f_{x_1 x_2} &lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;n = 3&lt;/math&gt; the result would be

:&lt;math&gt; f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = f_{\bar x_1 \bar x_2 \bar x_3} \oplus {\partial f_{\bar x_2 \bar x_3} \over \partial x_1} x_1 \oplus {\partial f_{\bar x_1 \bar x_3} \over \partial x_2} x_2 \oplus {\partial f_{\bar x_1 \bar x_2} \over \partial x_3} x_3 \oplus {\partial^2 f_{\bar x_3} \over \partial x_1 \partial x_2} x_1 x_2 \oplus {\partial^2 f_{\bar x_2} \over \partial x_1 \partial x_3} x_1 x_3 \oplus {\partial^2 f_{\bar x_1} \over \partial x_2 \partial x_3} x_2 x_3 \oplus {\partial^3 f \over \partial x_1 \partial x_2 \partial x_3} x_1 x_2 x_3 &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial^3 f \over \partial x_1 \partial x_2 \partial x_3} = f_{\bar x_1 \bar x_2 \bar x_3} \oplus f_{\bar x_1 \bar x_2 x_3} \oplus f_{\bar x_1 x_2 \bar x_3} \oplus f_{\bar x_1  x_2  x_3} \oplus f_{x_1 \bar x_2 \bar x_3} \oplus f_{x_1 \bar x_2 x_3} \oplus f_{x_1 x_2 \bar x_3} \oplus f_{x_1 x_2 x_3} &lt;/math&gt;.

This &lt;math&gt;n = 3&lt;/math&gt; case can be given a cubical geometric interpretation (or a graph-theoretic interpretation) as follows: when moving along the edge from &lt;math&gt;\bar x_1 \bar x_2 \bar x_3&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_1 \bar x_2 \bar x_3&lt;/math&gt;, XOR up the functions of the two end-vertices of the edge in order to obtain the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;. To move from &lt;math&gt;\bar x_1 \bar x_2 \bar x_3&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_1 x_2 \bar x_3&lt;/math&gt; there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge path passing through &lt;math&gt;x_1 \bar x_2 \bar x_3&lt;/math&gt; and the other one a two-edge path passing through &lt;math&gt;\bar x_1 x_2 \bar x_3&lt;/math&gt;. These two paths encompass four vertices of a square, and XORing up the functions of these four vertices yields the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x_1 x_2&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, to move from &lt;math&gt;\bar x_1 \bar x_2 \bar x_3&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_1 x_2 x_3&lt;/math&gt; there are six shortest paths which are three-edge paths, and these six paths encompass all the vertices of the cube, therefore the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x_1 x_2 x_3&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by XORing up the functions of all eight of the vertices. (The other, unmentioned coefficients can be obtained by symmetry.)

The shortest paths all involve monotonic changes to the values of the variables, whereas non-shortest paths all involve non-monotonic changes of such variables; or, to put it another way, the shortest paths all have lengths equal to the Hamming distance between the starting and destination vertices. This means that it should be easy to generalize an algorithm for obtaining coefficients from a truth table by XORing up values of the function from appropriate rows of a truth table, even for hyperdimensional cases (&lt;math&gt;n = 4&lt;/math&gt; and above). Between the starting and destination rows of a truth table, some variables have their values remaining fixed: find all the rows of the truth table such that those variables likewise remain fixed at those given values, then XOR up their functions and the result should be the coefficient for the monomial corresponding to the destination row. (In such monomial, include any variable whose value is 1 (at that row) and exclude any variable whose value is 0 (at that row), instead of including the negation of the variable whose value is 0, as in the minterm style.)

Similar to [[binary decision diagram]]s (BDDs), where nodes represent [[Shannon expansion]] with respect to the according variable, we can define a 
[[decision diagram]] based on the Reed–Muller expansion. These decision diagrams are called functional BDDs (FBDDs).

== Derivations ==
The Reed–Muller expansion can be derived from the XOR-form of the Shannon decomposition, using the identity &lt;math&gt;\overline{x} = 1 \oplus x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f &amp; = x_i f_{x_i} \oplus \overline{x}_i f_{\overline{x}_i} \\
  &amp; = x_i f_{x_i} \oplus (1 \oplus x_i) f_{\overline{x}_i} \\
  &amp; = x_i f_{x_i} \oplus f_{\overline{x}_i} \oplus x_i f_{\overline{x}_i} \\
  &amp; = f_{\overline{x}_i} \oplus x_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Derivation of the expansion for &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f &amp; = f_{\bar x_1} \oplus x_1 {\partial f \over \partial x_1} \\
    &amp; = \Big( f_{\bar x_2} \oplus x_2 {\partial f \over \partial x_2} \Big)_{\bar x_1} \oplus x_1 {\partial \Big(f_{\bar x_2} \oplus x_2 {\partial f \over \partial x_2} \Big) \over \partial x_1} \\
     &amp; = f_{\bar x_1 \bar x_2} \oplus x_2 {\partial f_{\bar x_1} \over \partial x_2} \oplus x_1 \Big({\partial f_{\bar x_2} \over \partial x_1} \oplus x_2 {\partial^2 f \over \partial x_1 \partial x_2}\Big) \\
      &amp; = f_{\bar x_1 \bar x_2} \oplus x_2 {\partial f_{\bar x_1} \over \partial x_2} \oplus x_1 {\partial f_{\bar x_2} \over \partial x_1} \oplus x_1 x_2 {\partial^2 f \over \partial x_1 \partial x_2}. 
 \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;


Derivation of the second-order boolean derivative:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
{\partial^2 f \over \partial x_1 \partial x_2} &amp; = {\partial \over \partial x_1} \Big( {\partial f \over \partial x_2} \Big) = {\partial \over \partial x_1} (f_{\bar x_2} \oplus f_{x_2}) \\
  &amp; = (f_{\bar x_2} \oplus f_{x_2})_{\bar x_1} \oplus (f_{\bar x_2} \oplus f_{x_2})_{x_1} \\
  &amp; = f_{\bar x_1 \bar x_2} \oplus f_{\bar x_1 x_2} \oplus f_{x_1 \bar x_2} \oplus f_{x_1 x_2}.
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem is named after [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]].

The existence of at least one triangle with angle sum of 180 degrees in absolute geometry implies Euclid's parallel postulate. Similarly, the existence of at least one triangle with angle sum of less than 180 degrees implies the characteristic postulate of [[hyperbolic geometry]].

[[Max Dehn]] gave an example of a [[non-Legendrian geometry]] where the angle sum of a triangle is greater than 180 degrees, and a [[semi-Euclidean geometry]] where there is a triangle with an angle sum of 180 degrees but Euclid's parallel postulate fails. In Dehn's geometries the [[Archimedean axiom]] does not hold.

[[File:KsiegaSzkocka1.JPG|thumb|Part of the Scottish Book with notes of [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]].]]

The '''Scottish Book''' ({{lang-pl|Księga Szkocka}}) was a thick notebook used by mathematicians of the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] in Poland for jotting down problems meant to be solved. The notebook was named after the "[[Scottish Café]]" where it was kept.

Originally, the mathematicians who gathered at the cafe would write down the problems and equations directly on the cafe's marble table tops, but these would be erased at the end of each day, and so the record of the preceding discussions would be lost. The idea for the book was most likely originally suggested by [[Stefan Banach]], or his wife, Łucja, who purchased a large notebook and left it with the proprietor of the cafe.&lt;ref name="Raikhel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Visser" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Lwow - Kawiarnia Szkocka.jpg|thumb|The building of the Scottish cafe where the book was recorded and stored]]
[[File:MazurGes.jpg|thumb |1972: [[Stanislaw Mazur|Mazur]] (left) acknowledges [[Per Enflo]] with the promised "live goose", the prize for having solved the [[approximation problem|problem 153]].]]

The Scottish Café ({{lang-pl|Kawiarnia Szkocka}}) was the café in [[Lviv|Lwów]] (now ''Lviv'') where, in the 1930s and 1940s, mathematicians from the [[Lwów School of Mathematics|Lwów School]] collaboratively discussed [[mathematical problem|research problem]]s, particularly in [[functional analysis]] and [[general topology|topology]].

[[Stanislaw Ulam]] recounts that the tables of the café had [[marble]] tops, so they could write in pencil, directly on the table, during their discussions. To keep the results from being lost, and after becoming annoyed with their writing directly on the table tops, [[Stefan Banach]]'s wife provided the mathematicians with a large notebook, which was used for writing the problems and answers and eventually became known as the ''Scottish Book''. The book—a collection of solved, unsolved, and even probably unsolvable problems—could be borrowed by any of the guests of the café. Solving any of the problems was rewarded with prizes, with the most difficult and challenging problems having expensive prizes (during the [[Great Depression]] and on the eve of [[World War II]]), such as a bottle of fine brandy.&lt;ref&gt;Mauldin, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

For problem 153, which was later recognized as being closely related to Stefan Banach's "[[approximation problem|basis problem]]", [[Stanisław Mazur]] offered the prize of a live goose. This problem was solved only in 1972 by [[Per Enflo]], who was presented with the live goose in a ceremony that was broadcast throughout Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Mauldin, ed.; Kaluza.&lt;/ref&gt;

The café building used to house the {{Interlanguage link multi|Universal Bank (Ukraine)|uk|3=Універсал Банк|lt=Universal Bank}} at the street address of 27 [[Taras Shevchenko]] Prospekt. The original cafe was renovated in May 2014 and contains a copy of the Scottish Book.

==Problems contributed by individual authors==

A total of 193 problems were written down in the book.&lt;ref name="Raikhel" /&gt; [[Stanisław Mazur]] contributed a total of 43 problems, 24 of them as a single author and 19 together with Stefan Banach.&lt;ref name="mazur" /&gt; Banach himself wrote 14, plus another 11 with [[Stanislaw Ulam]] and Mazur. Ulam wrote 40 problems and additional 15 ones with others.&lt;ref name="Raikhel" /&gt;

During the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet occupation of Lwów]], several Russian mathematicians visited the city and also added problems to the book.&lt;ref name="Visser" /&gt;

[[Hugo Steinhaus]] contributed the last one in May 1941 (other sources give March 1941), which involved a question about the [[probability distribution|likely distribution]] of matches within a matchbox—a problem motivated by Banach's habit of chain smoking cigarettes—shortly before the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Raikhel" /&gt;

The stick is notched and inscribed to record a debt owed to the [[rural dean]] of [[Preston Candover]], Hampshire, of a [[tithe]] of 20[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] each on 32 sheep, amounting to a total sum of £2 13s. 4d.]]
A '''tally stick''' (or simply '''tally'''&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|tally}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an ancient memory aid device used to record and document numbers, quantities, or even messages. Tally sticks first appear as animal bones carved with notches during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]; a notable example is the [[Ishango Bone]]. Historical reference is made by [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD 23–79) about the best wood to use for tallies, and by [[Marco Polo]] (1254–1324) who mentions the use of the tally in China. Tallies have been used for numerous purposes such as messaging and scheduling, and especially in financial and legal transactions, {{citation needed span|text=to the point of being [[currency]].|date=January 2018}}

==Kinds of tallies==
[[File:SAM PC 1 - Tally sticks 1 - Overview.jpg|thumb|Single and split tallies from the [[Swiss Alps]], 18th to early 20th century ([[Swiss Alpine Museum]])]]
Principally, there are two different kinds of tally sticks: the single tally and the split tally. A common form of the same kind of primitive counting device is seen in various kinds of [[prayer beads]].

===Paleolithic tally sticks===
A number of anthropological artefacts have been conjectured to be tally sticks:

*the [[Ishango bone]] is a [[bone tool]], dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, around 18,000 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;BC. It is a dark brown length of bone, the [[fibula]] of a baboon. It has a series of [[tally mark]]s carved in three columns running the length of the tool. It was found in 1960 in Belgian Congo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html A very brief history of pure mathematics: The Ishango Bone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721075947/http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/%7Eschultz/3M3/history.html |date=21 July 2008 }} University of Western Australia School of Mathematics – accessed January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Lebombo Bone]]'' is a [[baboon]]'s [[fibula]] with 29 distinct notches, discovered within the [[Border Cave]] in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] of [[Swaziland]]. 
*The so-called ''Wolf bone'' &lt;small&gt;([[:cs:Vlčí radius|cs]])&lt;/small&gt; is a prehistoric artefact discovered in 1937 in [[Czechoslovakia]] during excavations at [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Vestonice]], [[Moravia]], led by [[Karel Absolon|Karl Absolon]]. Dated to the [[Aurignacian]], approximately 30,000 years ago, the bone is marked with 55 marks which some believe to be [[tally mark]]s. The head of an ivory [[Venus figurine]] was excavated close to the bone.&lt;ref&gt;*Graham Flegg, ''Numbers: their history and meaning'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-486-42165-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beckmann|first1=Petr|title=A History of {{pi}} (PI)|date=1971|publisher=The Golem Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-0-911762-12-9|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single tally===
The single tally stick was an elongated piece of bone, ivory, wood, or stone which is marked with a system of notches (see: [[Tally marks]]). The single tally stick serves predominantly [[mnemonic]] purposes. Related to the single tally concept are messenger sticks (e.g., Inuit tribes), the knotted cords, ''[[khipu]]s'' or ''quipus'', as used by the [[Inca]]. [[Herodotus]] (c. 485–425 BC) reported  the use of a knotted cord by [[Darius I of Persia]] (c. 521–486 BC).

===Split tally===
The split tally was a technique which became common in medieval Europe, which was constantly short of money (coins) and predominantly illiterate, in order to record bilateral exchange and debts. A stick (squared hazelwood sticks were most common) was marked with a system of notches and then split lengthwise. This way the two halves both record the same notches and each party to the transaction received one half of the marked stick as proof. Later this technique was refined in various ways and became virtually tamper proof. One of the refinements was to make the two halves of the stick of different lengths. The longer part was called ''stock'' and was given to the party which had advanced money (or other items) to the receiver. The shorter portion of the stick was called ''foil'' and was given to the party which had received the funds or goods. Using this technique each of the parties had an identifiable record of the transaction. The natural irregularities in the surfaces of the tallies where they were split would mean that only the original two halves would fit back together perfectly, and so would verify that they were matching halves of the same transaction. If one party tried to unilaterally change the value of his half of the tally stick by adding more notches, the absence of those notches would be apparent on the other party's tally stick. The split tally was accepted as legal proof in medieval courts and the [[Napoleonic Code]] (1804) still makes reference to the tally stick in Article 1333.&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 13 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the [[Danube]] and in [[Switzerland]] the tally was still used in the 20th century in rural economies.

====Split tally in England====

The most prominent and best recorded use of the split tally stick or "nick-stick"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|year=2003|edition=3|chapter=nick-stick|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shenton|first=Caroline|title=The Day Parliament Burned Down|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199646708|chapter=Chapter 1: Thursday 16 October 1834, 6am: Mr Hume's Motion for a New House}}&lt;/ref&gt; being used as a form of currency&lt;ref name="BBC_Radio_50_Things"&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Things That Made the Modern Economy|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p053g7qj|website=BBC Radio|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was when [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] introduced the tally stick system in medieval England in around 1100. He would accept the tally stick only for taxes, and it was a tool of the [[Exchequer]] for the collection of taxes by local sheriffs (tax farmers "farming the shire"){{citation needed|date=March 2018}} for seven centuries. The split tally of the Exchequer was in continuous use until 1826. In 1834 tally sticks representing six centuries worth of financial records were ordered to be burned in a stove in the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The resulting fire set the chimney ablaze and then spread until [[Burning of Parliament|most of the building was destroyed]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Radio_50_Things" /&gt; This event was described by [[Charles Dickens]] in an 1855 article on administrative reform.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens, "Administrative Reform" (June 27, 1855) Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bT5WAAAAcAAJ Speeches literary and social by Charles Dickens]'' (1870) pp.133–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of tally marks of the Exchequer is described in ''[[Dialogue concerning the exchequer|The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer]]'' (see external links below) as follows:
{{quote|The manner of cutting is as follows. At the top of the tally a cut is made, the thickness of the palm of the hand, to represent a thousand pounds; then a hundred pounds by a cut the breadth of a thumb; twenty pounds, the breadth of the little finger; a single pound, the width of a swollen barleycorn; a shilling rather narrower; then a penny is marked by a single cut without removing any wood.|}}
The cuts were made the full width of the stick so that, after splitting, the portion kept by the issuer (the ''stock'') exactly matched the piece (the ''foil'') given as a receipt. Each stick had to have the details of the transaction written on it, in ink, to make it a valid record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clanchy|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Clanchy|title=From Memory to Written Record|year=1979|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford, England|isbn=9780631168577|page=125|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal tallies (debt of the Crown) also played a role in the formation of the [[Bank of England]] at the end of the 17th century. In 1697, the bank issued £1 million worth of stock in exchange for £800,000 worth of tallies at par and £200,000 in bank notes. This new stock was said to be "engrafted". The government promised not only to pay the Bank interest on the tallies subscribed but to redeem them over a period of years. The "engrafted" stock was then cancelled simultaneously with the redemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carswell|first1=John|title=The South Sea Bubble|date=1993|publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd|location=England|isbn=978-0-86299-918-6|page=24|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tally sticks feature in the design of the entrance gates to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] at [[Kew]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7694">{{About|the notion used in [[computer programming]] and [[type theory]]|types of measurement units|Units of measurement|other uses|Unit (disambiguation)}}

In the area of [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] known as [[type theory]], a '''unit type''' is a [[data type|type]] that allows only one value (and thus can hold no information).&lt;!-- see general reference at the end and WP:CITE --&gt; The carrier (underlying set) associated with a unit type can be any [[singleton set]]. There is an [[isomorphism]] between any two such sets, so it is customary to talk about ''the'' unit type and ignore the details of its value. One may also regard the unit type as the type of 0-[[tuple]]s, i.e. the [[product (category theory)|product]] of no types.

The unit type is the [[terminal object]] in the [[category theory|category]] of types and typed functions. It should not be confused with the ''zero'' or [[bottom type]], which allows ''no'' values and is the [[initial object]] in this category. Similarly, the [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] is the type with ''two'' values.

The unit type is implemented in most [[functional programming language]]s. The [[void type]] that is used in some imperative programming languages serves some of its functions, but because its carrier set is empty, it has some limitations (as detailed below).

==In programming languages==
Several computer [[programming language]]s provide a unit type to specify the result type of a [[function (computer science)|function]] with the sole purpose of causing a [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]], and the argument type of a function that does not require arguments. 
*In [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], the unit type is called &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; and its only value is also &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, reflecting the 0-tuple interpretation.  
*In [[ML programming language|ML]] descendants (including [[OCaml]], [[Standard ML]], and [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]]), the type is called &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; but the value is written as &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;.  
*In [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], the unit type is called &lt;code&gt;Unit&lt;/code&gt; and its only value is written as &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;.
*In [[Common Lisp]] the type named &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt; is a unit type which has one value, namely the symbol &lt;tt&gt;NIL&lt;/tt&gt;.  This should not be confused with the &lt;tt&gt;NIL&lt;/tt&gt; ''type'', which is the [[bottom type]].
* In [[Python (programming language)|Python]], there is a type called &lt;code&gt;NoneType&lt;/code&gt; which allows the single value of &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;.
* In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], the unit type is called &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; and its only value is also &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, reflecting the 0-tuple interpretation.

* In [[PHP]], the unit type is called null, which only value is NULL itself.
* In [[Javascript]], both null and undefined are built-in unit types.
* in [[Kotlin_(programming_language)|Kotlin]], &lt;code&gt;Unit&lt;/code&gt; is a singleton with only one value: the &lt;code&gt;Unit&lt;/code&gt; object.
* In [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; is the only instance of the &lt;code&gt;NilClass&lt;/code&gt; class.

=== Void type as unit type ===

In [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D_(programming_language)|D]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], &lt;code&gt;[[void return type|void]]&lt;/code&gt; is used to designate a function that does not return anything useful, or a function that accepts no arguments. The unit type in C is conceptually similar to an empty &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;, but a struct without members is not allowed in the C language specification. Instead, '&lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;' is used in a manner that simulates some, but not all, of the properties of the unit type, as detailed below. Like most imperative languages, C allows functions that do not return a value; these are specified as having the void return type. Such functions are called procedures in other imperative languages like [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], where a syntactic distinction, instead of type-system distinction, is made between functions and procedures.

==== Difference in calling convention ====

The first notable difference between a true unit type and the void type is that the unit type may always be the type of the argument to a function, but the void type cannot be the type of an argument in C, despite the fact that it may appear as the sole argument in the list. This problem is best illustrated by the following program, which is a compile-time error in C:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
void f(void) {}
void g(void) {}

int main(void)
{
  f(g()); // compile-time error here
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This issue does not arise in most programming practice in C, because since the &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; type carries no information, it is useless to pass it anyway; but it may arise in [[generic programming]], such as C++ [[template (programming)|templates]], where &lt;code&gt;[[void return type|void]]&lt;/code&gt; must be treated differently from other types. In C++ however, empty classes are allowed, so it is possible to implement a real unit type; the above example becomes compilable as:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class unit_type {};
const unit_type the_unit;

unit_type f(unit_type) { return the_unit; }
unit_type g(unit_type) { return the_unit; }

int main()
{
  f(g(the_unit));
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

(For brevity, we're not worried in the above example whether &lt;code&gt;the_unit&lt;/code&gt; is really a [[singleton pattern|singleton]]; see [[singleton pattern]] for details on that issue.)

==== Difference in storage ====

The second notable difference is that the void type is special and can never be stored in a [[Record (computer science)|record type]], i.e. in a struct or a class in C/C++. In contrast, the unit type can be stored in records in functional programming languages, i.e. it can appear as the type of a field; the above implementation of the unit type in C++ can also be stored. While this may seem a useless feature, it does allow one for instance to elegantly implement a [[Set (computer science)|set]] as a [[Associative array|map]] to the unit type; in the absence of a unit type, one can still implement a set this way by storing some dummy value of another type for each key.

==== In Generics ====

In Java Generics, type parameters must be reference types. The wrapper type &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; is often used when a unit type parameter is needed. Although the &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; type can never have any instances, it does have one value, &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; (like all other reference types), so it acts as a unit type. In practice, any other non-instantiable type, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt;, can also be used for this purpose, since they also have exactly one value, &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
public static Void f(Void x) { return null; }
public static Void g(Void x) { return null; }

public static void main(String[] args)
{
  f(g(null));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12167">'''Universal Systems Language''' ('''USL''') is a [[modeling language]] and [[formal method]] for the specification and design of software and other complex systems. It was designed by [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]] based on her experiences writing flight software for the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref name="USL"&gt;[[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|M. Hamilton]] and W.&amp;nbsp;R. Hackler, "[http://www.htius.com/Articles/r12ham.pdf Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo]", IEEE Computer, Dec. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The language is implemented through the 001 Tool Suite software by Hamilton Technologies, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.htius.com 001 Tool Suite (1986-2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; USL evolved from 001AXES which in turn evolved from AXES all of which are based on Hamilton's axioms of control. The 001 Tool Suite uses the preventative concept of Development Before the Fact (DBTF) for its life-cycle development process. DBTF eliminates errors as early as possible during the development process removing the need to look for errors after-the-fact.

==Philosophy==
USL was inspired by Hamilton's recognition of patterns or categories of errors occurring during Apollo software development. Errors at the interfaces between subsystem boundaries accounted for the majority of errors and were often the most subtle and most difficult to find. Each interface error was placed into a category identifying the means to prevent it by way of system definition. This process led to a set of six axioms, forming the basis for a mathematical constructive logical theory of control for designing systems that would eliminate entire classes of errors just by the way a system is defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Universal Systems Language and its Automation, the 001 Tool Suite, for Designing and Building Systems and Software" Lockheed Martin/IEEE Computer Society Webinar Series|author= Margaret H. Hamilton, Hamilton Technologies|date=September 27, 2012|url=https://media.computer.org/sponsored/podcast/lmco/lmco-089-p.mp4?_kip_ipx=966916323-1480349712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain correctness guarantees are embedded in the USL grammar. In contrast to reactive approaches to program verification, testing for errors late into the life cycle, USL's development-before-the-fact philosophy is preventive, not allowing errors in the first place. A USL definition models both its application (for example, an avionics or banking system) and properties of control into its own life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Dolha, Steve, Chiste, Dave, "A Remote Query System for the Web: Managing the Development of Distributed Systems.", Chapter 32, Internet Management, Editor Jessica Keyes, Auerbach, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Providing a mathematical framework within which objects, their interactions, and their relationships can be captured, USL – a metalanguage – has "metamechanisms" for defining systems. USL's philosophy is that all objects are recursively reusable and reliable; reliable systems are defined in terms of reliable systems; only reliable systems are used as building blocks; and only reliable systems are used as mechanisms to integrate these building blocks to form a new system. Designers can then use the new system, along with more primitive ones, to define (and build) more comprehensive reliable systems. If a system is reliable, all the objects in all its levels and layers are reliable.

USL is regarded by some users as more [[usability|user-friendly]] than other formal systems.&lt;ref&gt;Krut, Jr., B., "[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA293427 Integrating 001 Tool Support in the Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis Methodology]" (CMU/SEI-93-TR-11, ESC-TR-93-188), Pittsburgh, SEI, Carnegie Mellon University, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not only a formalism for software, but also defines [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]] for common elements of problem domains, such as physical space and event timing.

==Formalism for a theory of control==
{{close paraphrasing|section|source=http://www.htius.com/Articles/r12ham.pdf|free=no|date=July 2016}}
A [[systems philosophy]] formalism for representing the logic of the control of systems, USL is based on a set of axioms of a general systems control theory with formal rules for its application. At the base of every USL system is a set of six axioms and the assumption of a universal set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Hamilton, M.]], "[http://www.htius.com/Articles/ELECTRONIC_DESIGN/INSIDE_DBTF.pdf Inside Development Before the Fact"], cover story, Special Editorial Supplement, 8ES-24ES. Electronic Design, Apr. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Hamilton, M.]], "[http://www.htius.com/Articles/ELECTRONIC_DESIGN/001_A_FULL_LIFE_CYCLE.pdf 001: A FULL LIFE CYCLE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT Development Before The Fact In Action"], cover story, Special Editorial Supplement, 8ES-24ES. Electronic Design, Apr. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The axioms provide the formal foundation for a USL "hierarchy" – referred to as a map, which is a tree of control that spans networks of relations between objects. Explicit rules for defining a map have been derived from the axioms, where – among other things – structure, behavior, and their integration are captured. Each axiom defines a relation of immediate domination of a parent over its children. The union of these relations is control. Among other things, the axioms establish the relationships of an object for invocation in time and space, input and output (domain and codomain), input access rights and output access rights (domain access rights and codomain access rights), error detection and recovery, and ordering during its developmental and operational states. Every system can ultimately be defined in terms of three primitive control structures, each of which is derived from the six axioms – resulting in a universal semantics for defining systems.

All representations of a system are defined in terms of a function map (FMap) and a type map (TMap). With USL, all functions in a system and their relationships are defined with a set of FMaps. Similarly, all types in a system and their relationships are defined with a set of TMaps. FMaps represent the dynamic (doing) world of action by capturing functional and temporal (including priority) characteristics. TMaps represent the static (being) world of objects by capturing spatial characteristics – for example, containment of one object by another or relationships between locations of objects in space. FMaps are inherently integrated with TMaps. Three universal primitive structures derived from the set of axioms and non-primitive structures derived ultimately in terms of the primitive structures specify each map. Primitive structures are universal in that they are able to be used to derive new abstract universal structures, functions or types. The process of deriving new objects (i.e., structures, types and functions) is equivalent to the process of deriving new types in a constructive type theory. Primitive functions, corresponding to primitive operations on types defined in a TMap, reside at the bottom nodes of an FMap. Primitive types, each defined by its own set of axioms, reside at the bottom nodes of a TMap. Each primitive function (or type) can be realized as a top node of a map on a lower (more concrete) layer of the system. Resident at every node on a map is the same kind of object (for example, a function on every node of an FMap and a type on a TMap). The object at each node plays multiple roles; for example, the object can serve as a parent (in control of its children) or a child (being controlled by its parent). Whereas each function on an FMap has a ''mapping'' from its input to output (domain to codomain), each type on a TMap has a ''relation'' between its domain and codomain. A structure relates each parent and its children according to the set of rules derived from the axioms of control. A primitive structure provides a relationship of the most primitive form (finest grain) of control. All maps are defined ultimately in terms of the primitive structures and therefore abide by the rules associated with each structure: A parent controls its children to have a dependent (Join), independent (Include), or decision-making relationship (Or).

[[Image:ucs rules.png|center|frame|Caption|Figure. 1 The three primitive control structures and their rules form a universal foundation for constructing maps in the domains of time and space as FMaps and TMaps]]

Any system can be defined completely using only primitive structures, but less primitive structures defined by and derived from the primitive structures – and therefore governed by the control axioms – accelerate the definition and understanding of a system. The defined structure, a form of template-like reuse, provides a mechanism to define a map without explicitly defining some of its elements. An FMap structure has placeholders for variable functions; a TMap structure has placeholders for variable types; a universal structure has placeholders for functions or types. Async is an example of a real-time, distributed, communicating FMap structure with both asynchronous and synchronous behavior. An example of a TMap structure is TreeOf, a collection of the same type of objects ordered using a tree indexing system. Each TMap structure assumes its own set of possible relations for its parent and children types. Abstract types decomposed with the same TMap structure inherit the same primitive operations and therefore the same behavior (each of which is available to FMaps that have access to members of each of its TMap's types).

==Implementation==
The process of developing a software system with USL together with its automation, the 001 Tool Suite (001), is as follows: define the system with USL, automatically analyze the definition with 001's analyzer to ensure that USL was used correctly, automatically generate much of the design and all of the implementation code with 001's generator.&lt;ref&gt;Ouyang, M., Golay, M.W. 1995, ''[http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/67642 An Integrated Formal Approach for Developing High Quality Software of Safety-Critical Systems]'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Report No. MIT-ANP-TR-035.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Uta Caecilia Merzbach''' (February 9, 1933 – June 27, 2017) was a German-American [[history of mathematics|historian of mathematics]] who became the first curator of [[mathematical instrument]]s at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].{{r|si}}

==Early life==
Merzbach was born in [[Berlin]], where her mother was a [[philologist]] and her father was an economist who worked for the [[Reich Association of Jews in Germany]] during World War II. The Nazi government closed the association in June 1943; they arrested the family, along with other leading members of the association, and sent them to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] on August 4, 1943.{{r|si|ebk}} The Merzbachs survived the war and the camp, and after living for a year in a refugee camp in [[Deggendorf]] they moved to [[Georgetown, Texas]] in 1946, where her father found a faculty position at [[Southwestern University]].

==Education==
After high school in [[Brownwood, Texas]], Merzbach entered Southwestern, but transferred after two years to the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where she graduated in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. In 1954, she earned a master's degree there, also in mathematics.{{r|si}}
Merzbach became a school teacher, but soon returned to graduate study at [[Harvard University]].{{r|si}} She completed her Ph.D. at Harvard in 1965. Her dissertation, ''Quantity of Structure: Development of Modern Algebraic Concepts from Leibniz to Dedekind'', combined mathematics and the history of mathematics; it was jointly supervised by mathematician [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and historian of science [[I. Bernard Cohen]].{{r|si|mgp}}

==Career==
Merzbach joined the Smithsonian as an associate curator in 1964, and served there until 1988 in the [[National Museum of American History]]. As well as collecting mathematical objects at the Smithsonian, she also collected interviews with many of the pioneers of computing.{{r|si}} In 1991, she became the co-author of the second edition of ''A History of Mathematics'', originally published in 1968 by [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]].{{r|si|acker}} After her retirement she returned to Georgetown, Texas, where she died in 2017.{{r|si}}

The symbol ''&amp;rho;'' ([[rho]]) is often used instead of ''r''.]]

NOTE: This page uses common physics notation for spherical coordinates, in which &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the ''z'' axis and the radius vector connecting the origin to the point in question, while &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the projection of the radius vector onto the ''x-y'' plane and the ''x'' axis. Several other definitions are in use, and so care must be taken in comparing different sources.&lt;ref name="wolfram"&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricalCoordinates.html Wolfram Mathworld, spherical coordinates]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cylindrical coordinate system ==

=== Vector fields ===

Vectors are defined in [[cylindrical coordinates]] by (''ρ'', φ, ''z''), where
* ''ρ'' is the length of the vector projected onto the ''xy''-plane,
* φ is the angle between the projection of the vector onto the ''xy''-plane (i.e. ''r'') and the positive ''x''-axis (0 ≤ φ &lt; 2π),
* ''z'' is the regular ''z''-coordinate.

(''ρ'', φ, ''z'') is given in [[cartesian coordinates]] by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \rho \\ \phi \\ z \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\ \operatorname{arctan}(y / x) \\ z
\end{bmatrix},\ \ \ 0 \le \phi &lt; 2\pi,
&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Physics Coordinates.png|thumb]]

or inversely by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} r\cos\theta \\ r\sin\theta \\ z \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Any [[vector field]] can be written in terms of the unit vectors as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A = A_x \mathbf{\hat x} + A_y \mathbf{\hat y} + A_z \mathbf{\hat z} 
                 = A_r \mathbf{\hat r} + A_\theta \boldsymbol{\hat \theta} + A_z \mathbf{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt;
The cylindrical unit vectors are related to the cartesian unit vectors by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{\hat r} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} \\ \mathbf{\hat z}\end{bmatrix}
  = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta &amp; \sin\theta &amp; 0 \\
                   -\sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{\hat x} \\ \mathbf{\hat y} \\ \mathbf{\hat z} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
* Note: the matrix is an [[orthogonal matrix]], that is, its [[Invertible matrix|inverse]] is simply its [[transpose]].

=== Time derivative of a vector field ===

To find out how the vector field A changes in time we calculate the time derivatives.
For this purpose we use [[Newton's notation]] for the time derivative (&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{A}}&lt;/math&gt;).
In cartesian coordinates this is simply:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{A}} = \dot{A}_x \hat{\mathbf{x}} + \dot{A}_y \hat{\mathbf{y}} + \dot{A}_z \hat{\mathbf{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

However, in cylindrical coordinates this becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{A}} = \dot{A}_r \hat{\boldsymbol{r}} + A_r \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}} 
  + \dot{A}_\theta \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} + A_\theta \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}
  + \dot{A}_z \hat{\boldsymbol{z}} + A_z \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{z}}}&lt;/math&gt;

We need the time derivatives of the unit vectors. 
They are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \dot{\hat{\mathbf{r}}} &amp; = \dot{\theta} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \\
  \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}} &amp; = - \dot\theta \hat{\mathbf{r}} \\
  \dot{\hat{\mathbf{z}}} &amp; = 0
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So the time derivative simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{A}} = \hat{\boldsymbol{r}} (\dot{A}_r - A_\theta \dot{\theta})
  + \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} (\dot{A}_\theta + A_r \dot{\theta})
  + \hat{\mathbf{z}} \dot{A}_z&lt;/math&gt;

=== Second time derivative of a vector field ===

The second time derivative is of interest in [[physics]], as it is found in [[equations of motion]] for [[classical mechanics|classical mechanical]] systems.
The second time derivative of a vector field in cylindrical coordinates is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot A} = \mathbf{\hat r} (\ddot A_r - A_\theta \ddot\theta - 2 \dot A_\theta \dot\theta - A_r \dot\theta^2)
  + \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} (\ddot A_\theta + A_r \ddot\theta + 2 \dot A_r \dot\theta - A_\theta \dot\theta^2)
  + \mathbf{\hat z} \ddot A_z&lt;/math&gt;

To understand this expression, we substitute A = P, where p is the vector (r, θ, z).

This means that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{P} = r \mathbf{\hat r} + z \mathbf{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt;.

After substituting we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{\hat r} (\ddot r - r \dot\theta^2)
  + \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} (r \ddot\theta + 2 \dot r \dot\theta)
  + \mathbf{\hat z} \ddot z&lt;/math&gt;

In mechanics, the terms of this expression are called:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \ddot r \mathbf{\hat r}          &amp;= \mbox{central outward acceleration} \\
  -r \dot\theta^2 \mathbf{\hat r}    &amp;= \mbox{centripetal acceleration} \\
  r \ddot\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta}      &amp;= \mbox{angular acceleration} \\
  2  \dot r \dot\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} &amp;= \mbox{Coriolis effect} \\
  \ddot z \mathbf{\hat z}               &amp;= \mbox{z-acceleration}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Spherical coordinate system ==

=== Vector fields ===

Vectors are defined in [[spherical coordinates]] by (ρ,θ,φ), where
* ρ is the length of the vector,
* θ is the angle between the positive Z-axis and the vector in question (0 ≤ θ ≤ π), and
* φ is the angle between the projection of the vector onto the X-Y-plane and the positive X-axis (0 ≤ φ &lt; 2π).

(ρ,θ,φ) is given in [[Cartesian coordinates]] by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\rho \\ \theta \\ \phi \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\  \arccos(z / \rho) \\ \arctan(y / x)
\end{bmatrix},\ \ \ 0 \le \theta \le \pi,\ \ \ 0 \le \phi &lt; 2\pi,
&lt;/math&gt;

or inversely by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} \rho\sin\theta\cos\phi \\ \rho\sin\theta\sin\phi \\ \rho\cos\theta\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Any vector field can be written in terms of the unit vectors as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A = A_x\mathbf{\hat x} + A_y\mathbf{\hat y} + A_z\mathbf{\hat z} 
                 = A_\rho\boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + A_\theta\boldsymbol{\hat \theta} + A_\phi\boldsymbol{\hat \phi}&lt;/math&gt;
The spherical unit vectors are related to the cartesian unit vectors by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\hat\rho} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\theta}  \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \end{bmatrix}
  = \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta\cos\phi &amp; \sin\theta\sin\phi &amp; \cos\theta \\
                    \cos\theta\cos\phi &amp; \cos\theta\sin\phi &amp; -\sin\theta \\
                    -\sin\phi          &amp; \cos\phi           &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{\hat x} \\ \mathbf{\hat y} \\ \mathbf{\hat z} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
* Note: the matrix is an [[orthogonal matrix]], that is, its inverse is simply its [[transpose]].

So the cartesian unit vectors are related to the spherical unit vectors by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{\hat x} \\ \mathbf{\hat y}  \\ \mathbf{\hat z} \end{bmatrix}
  = \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta\cos\phi &amp; \cos\theta\cos\phi &amp; -\sin\phi \\
                    \sin\theta\sin\phi &amp; \cos\theta\sin\phi &amp;  \cos\phi \\
                    \cos\theta         &amp; -\sin\theta        &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\hat\rho} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Time derivative of a vector field ===

To find out how the vector field A changes in time we calculate the time derivatives.
In cartesian coordinates this is simply:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot A} = \dot A_x \mathbf{\hat x} + \dot A_y \mathbf{\hat y} + \dot A_z \mathbf{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt;

However, in spherical coordinates this becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot A} = \dot A_\rho \boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + A_\rho \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat \rho}}
  + \dot A_\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} + A_\theta \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat\theta}}
  + \dot A_\phi \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} + A_\phi \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat\phi}}&lt;/math&gt;

We need the time derivatives of the unit vectors. 
They are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat \rho}} &amp;= \dot\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} + \dot\phi\sin\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \\
  \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat\theta}} &amp;= - \dot\theta \boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + \dot\phi\cos\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \\
  \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat\phi}} &amp;= - \dot\phi\sin\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\rho} - \dot\phi\cos\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So the time derivative becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot A} = \boldsymbol{\hat \rho} (\dot A_\rho - A_\theta \dot\theta - A_\phi \dot\phi \sin\theta)
  + \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} (\dot A_\theta + A_\rho \dot\theta - A_\phi \dot\phi \cos\theta)
  + \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} (\dot A_\phi + A_\rho \dot\phi \sin\theta + A_\theta \dot\phi \cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

'''λProlog''', also written '''lambda Prolog''', is a [[logic programming language]] featuring [[polymorphic typing]], [[modular programming]], and [[higher-order programming]].  These extensions to [[Prolog]] are derived from the higher-order hereditary [[Harrop formula]]s used to justify the foundations of λProlog.  [[Higher-order logic|Higher-order quantification]], [[Typed lambda calculus|simply typed λ-term]]s, and [[Unification (computing)#Higher-order unification|higher-order unification]] gives λProlog the basic supports needed to capture the λ-tree syntax approach to ''[[higher-order abstract syntax]]'', an approach to representing syntax that maps object-level bindings to programming language bindings.  Programmers in λProlog need not deal with bound variable names: instead various declarative devices are available to deal with binder scopes and their instantiations.  Since 1986, λProlog has received numerous implementations.  As of 2013, the language and its implementations are still actively being developed.

The Abella theorem prover has been designed to provide an interactive environment for proving theorems about the declarative core of λProlog.
