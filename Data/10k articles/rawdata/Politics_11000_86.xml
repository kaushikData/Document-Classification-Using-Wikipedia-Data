==Background==
On 18 September, a [[2016 Uri attack|a ''fedayeen'' attack]] was made by four armed militants on an army base near the town of [[Uri, Jammu and Kashmir|Uri]]. Nineteen Indian Army soldiers were killed.  India accused [[Jaish-e-Muhammad]], a Pakistan-based terrorist organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sameer Yasir |title=Uri attack carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammad militants, confirms Indian Army |newspaper=Firstpost |date=21 September 2016 |url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/uri-attack-carried-out-by-jaish-e-mohammad-militants-confirms-indian-army-3013332.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Having come after similar ''fidayeen'' attacks in [[2015 Gurdaspur attack|Gurdaspur]] and [[2016 Pathankot attack|Pathankot]], the Uri attack gave rise to high degree of concern in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Ankit Panda |url=https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/gurdaspur-pathankot-and-now-uri-what-are-indias-options/ |title=Gurdaspur, Pathankot, and Now Uri: What Are India's Options? |newspaper=The Diplomat |date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the Indian army said that it had displayed considerable restraint in the wake of the attacks, but it reserved the right to respond "at the time and place of our own choosing.”.&lt;ref name="respond_place"&gt;{{cite news|title=We will respond at time, place of our choosing: Army on Uri attack|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uri-attacks-we-will-respond-at-time-place-of-our-choosing-says-army/article9124795.ece|accessdate=30 September 2016|work=|agency=The Hindu|date=19 September 2016|location=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919145019/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uri-attacks-we-will-respond-at-time-place-of-our-choosing-says-army/article9124795.ece|archivedate=19 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' said that Indian patience had run out due to Pakistan's inaction in curbing the activities of terrorist organisations such as [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] and [[Jaish-e-Mohammad]].&lt;ref name="Boone"&gt;
{{citation |author1=Jon Boone |author2=Michael Safi |title=Pakistan humiliated by south Asian countries' boycott of summit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/pakistan-humiliated-by-south-asian-countries-boycott-of-summit |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001163733/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/pakistan-humiliated-by-south-asian-countries-boycott-of-summit |archivedate=1 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 September, India summoned the Pakistan High Commission Abdul Bassit and gave a protest letter detailing the involvement of a terrorist group based in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Shishir_Gupta&gt;{{cite news|title=Mission LoC: How India punished Pakistan with surgical strikes|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mission-loc-how-india-punished-pakistan-with-surgical-strikes/story-hup3eHFQc2za87BDWY6MzM.html|accessdate=8 October 2016|work=The Hindustan Times|agency=|date=3 October 2016|location=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007173633/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mission-loc-how-india-punished-pakistan-with-surgical-strikes/story-hup3eHFQc2za87BDWY6MzM.html|archivedate=7 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan later said that India had provided no evidence that the Uri attack was launched from Pakistan. Pakistan's defence minister suggested that India had carried out the Uri attack to deflect attention from the popular protests in [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt; The ''Hindustan Times'' reported that the minister's comments made up an "inflection point", after which India decided to respond militarily.&lt;ref name=Shishir_Gupta/&gt;

Indian officials said that the cross-border infiltration across the [[Line of Control]] had surged since the unrest began in Kashmir. The persons crossing the border showed evidence of military training.&lt;ref name=Guardian2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to a government source close to Home Minister [[Rajnath Singh]], a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security was held on 24 September, at which "broad details of targeting terrorists" were discussed.&lt;ref name="sealed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Surgical Strike was sealed, delivered, kept under wraps until CCS meet|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/surgical-strike-was-sealed-delivered-kept-under-wraps-until-ccs-meet-3059052/|work=The Indian Express|date=1 October 2016|accessdate=1 October 2016|first=|last=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001010808/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/surgical-strike-was-sealed-delivered-kept-under-wraps-until-ccs-meet-3059052/|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surgical strikes==
On 29 September, eleven days after the Uri attack, the [[Indian army]] reported that it conducted surgical strikes against suspected militants in [[Azad Kashmir|Pakistani-administered Kashmir]]. Lt Gen [[Ranbir Singh (general)|Ranbir Singh]], Indian Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), said that it had received "very credible and specific information" about "terrorist teams" who were preparing to "carry out infiltration and conduct terrorist strikes inside Jammu and Kashmir and in various metros in other states".

Analyst Sandeep Singh, writing in ''The Diplomat,'' said that the operation is better characterised as a cross-border raid because "surgical strikes" involve striking deep into the enemy territory and typically using air power.&lt;ref&gt;

===Indian version===
Indian officials said the strike targeted areas close to the Line of Control (LoC), where it believes militants congregate for their final briefings before sneaking across the LoC. An Indian security source said the operation began with Indian forces firing artillery across the frontier to provide cover for three to four teams of 70–80 commandos from the 4th and 9th battalions of the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] (part of [[Para (Special Forces)]]) to cross the LoC at several separate points shortly after midnight IST on 29 September (18:30 hours UTC, 28 Sep).

On 23 October, a [[BBC News]] article by M.

The article said the Indian Army had conducted a ground assault in the Pooch sector, destroying a Pakistani post and killing a soldier; setup their guns on a ridge in Leepa valley, hitting three posts and killing four Pakistani soldiers; and advanced in the Dudhnial sector injuring a Pakistani soldier, but were beaten back after their movements were detected. The report also took statements from villagers at Madarpur ([[Poonch District, Pakistan|Poonch District]]) and [[Leepa Valley]] ([[Bagh District]]) and Dudhnial ([[Neelam District]]) who confided that Indian troops directed heavy fire at several Pakistani border posts. The BBC News could not verify if any militants were hit. Villagers in Dudhnial said that they saw one or two damaged structures close to a Pakistani border post. The villagers in Leepa Valley said that, following the attack, there was an increased influx of militants to the valley.&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{citation |author=M.

A senior Indian Home Ministry official subsequently claimed that in the wake of the raid, at least 12 training camps belonging to [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]], [[Hizbul Mujahideen]] and [[Jaish-e-Mohammad]] had been swiftly moved from their locations at Pir Chanasi, Aksha Maskar and Tabuk near Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Based on satellite images, inputs from foreign intelligence agencies and unnamed "sources in Pakistan," according to the official, the training camps had been relocated "near crowded towns deep inside Pakistan," in the provinces of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and Punjab, to "minimise casualties to their assets."  According to the Indian official, the camps had housed around 500 militants, 300 of whom belonged to Lashkar-e-Taiba alone.&lt;ref name="camps_shifted"&gt;{{cite news|title=Training camps now shifted to crowded Pakistani towns’|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/training-camps-now-shifted-to-crowded-pakistani-towns/article9170047.ece|work=The Hindu|date=1 October 2016|accessdate=1 October 2016|first=|last=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930223228/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/training-camps-now-shifted-to-crowded-pakistani-towns/article9170047.ece|archivedate=30 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eyewitness living across the LoC was one of five contacted through intermediaries for covert interviews with the ''Indian Express''. He reported that on 30 September, a day after the surgical strikes, several members of Lashkar-e-Taiba had met for Friday prayers at a Lashkar-affiliated mosque in Chalhana. "The Lashkar men gathered there were blaming the Pak Army for failing to defend the border”, he said, “and [were] saying they would soon give India an answer it would never forget."&lt;ref name="bodies_explosions"/&gt; Several days after the raids, a leading Indian security official who had been closely involved in their planning said that Pakistan's continued denial that any surgical strikes took place was a "stance that suits us." He further stated – "The surprise element in such an operation is key to its success and there will be no predictable repetition. If provoked yet again, we will amend our operational tactics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surgical strikes: Pakistan denial suits us for now, we will change tactics if provoked again, says top official|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/surgical-strikes-uri-attack-india-pakistan-terrorists-3062311/|accessdate=3 October 2016|work=The Indian Express|agency=|date=3 October 2016|location=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003014633/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/surgical-strikes-uri-attack-india-pakistan-terrorists-3062311/|archivedate=3 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Indian Defence Minister Parrikar and National Security Advisor Doval were shown original, unedited footage from the military raids were seen on 1 October. After viewing it, Parrikar informed Prime Minister Modi that he was satisfied with what he had seen, and that there was no need to publicly release any footage. In response to calls from members of opposition parties to release the footage, a senior government official stated, "The Opposition should understand the difference between a covert and overt strike.

==Analysis==
Defence analysts in Pakistan said it was not possible for Indian forces to breach the heavily armed and fenced LoC border undetected, perform operations at multiple sites over several hours, and return without casualties and military resistance. According to one source, the Indian narrative matched a "fantastic movie script" created for public consumption.&lt;ref name="Yousaf"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1191128/cross-border-raid-strategic-analysts-laugh-off-indian-claim/|title=Cross-border raid: Strategic analysts laugh off Indian claim|work=The Express Tribune|date=1 October 2016|accessdate=1 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930230825/http://tribune.com.pk/story/1191128/cross-border-raid-strategic-analysts-laugh-off-indian-claim/|archivedate=30 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ejaz Awan dismissed Indian claims of paratrooper involvement, stating: "For pulling out these troops, you need helicopters on the ground."&lt;ref name="Yousaf"/&gt;

[[Bruce Riedel]], a United States security expert, said that while India's "surgical military response" was "limited and calibrated," it would send a sharp signal to the Pakistani establishment. He added that India could legitimately cite a right to self-defence in taking such strong action, following the example of United States operations in Pakistan against [[Osama bin Laden]] and Mullah [[Akhtar Mansour]]. Riedel observed, however, that regardless of outside support for India's position, its situation in Kashmir would only worsen unless Prime Minister Modi addressed "the legitimate demands of Kashmiris." This, according to Riedel, would require Modi to adopt a policy on Kashmir "independent of how he deals with Pakistan," though his "strong popularity gives him much room to act."&lt;ref name="ups_stakes"&gt;{{cite news|title=India ups the stakes after sharp signal of surgical strike: Ex-CIA official|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/india-ups-the-stakes-after-sharp-signal-of-surgical-strike-ex-cia-official/articleshow/54631264.cms|work=The Economic Times|date=2 October 2016|accessdate=2 October 2016|first=Charmy|last=Harikrishnan|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006023455/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/india-ups-the-stakes-after-sharp-signal-of-surgical-strike-ex-cia-official/articleshow/54631264.cms|archivedate=6 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==De-escalation==

[[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs]] was confirmed to be attending the 7th [[Istanbul Process|Heart of Asia Conference]], the first visit by a high-level Pakistani official since December 2015.

But the conference ended without any peace talks and the delegates returned to their countries. Media said that there was a short conversation between Aziz and Indian leaders as soon as he landed. But it was denied this was not billed a de-escalation of border tensions.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Achnacarry''' ({{lang-gd|Achadh na Cairidh}}; 'field of the fish-trap/weir') is a small hamlet, private [[estate (land)|estate]], and a castle in the [[Lochaber]] region of [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], [[Scotland]]. It occupies a strategic position on an isthmus between [[Loch Lochy]] to the east, and [[Loch Arkaig]] to the west.

The settlement has a long association with [[Clan Cameron]]: Sir [[Ewen Cameron of Lochiel]] built the original [[Achnacarry Castle]] in about 1655. This was destroyed by government troops after the [[Battle of Culloden]], but "New Achnacarry" was built near the same site in [[Scottish Baronial]] style in 1802. It was used as a [[Commando]] Training Depot during the Second World War and the village retains close ties to [[British Commandos]], the [[United States Army Rangers]] and similar units from other allied nations. In 1928, the '''Achnacarry Agreement''' was signed, an early attempt to set petroleum [[production quota]]s.

==Geography==
Achnacarry is not far from the village of [[Spean Bridge]] and about 15 miles north of the town of [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]]. It has been described by [[Queen Victoria]] as follows:

"As you approach Achnacarry, which lies rather low, but is surrounded by very fine trees, the luxuriance of the tangled woods, surmounted by rugged hills, becomes finer and finer till you come to Loch Arkaig, a little over half a mile from the house. This is a very lovely loch, reminding one of Loch Katrine, especially where there is a little pier, from which we embarked on board a very small but nice screw steamer which belongs to Cameron of Lochiel."—Royal Visit to Achnacarry, from the Journal of Queen Victoria, Friday, 12 September 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/info/about.do|title=Queen Victoria's Journals|publisher=Royal Archives|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Achnacarry Castle and [[Loch Arkaig]] is a path of interwoven trees known as The Dark Mile, or Mile Dorcha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfortwilliam.co.uk/attractions-and-museums/information-about-the-clan-cameron-of-achnacarry-in-lochaber|title=Clan Cameron Museum at Achnacarry and Ka-aig Falls|work=visitfortwilliam.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Original castle===
Ewen "Eoghainn MacAilein" Cameron, XIII Chief of [[Clan Cameron]], built the highly disputed [[Tor Castle]] (said to have been on [[Clan Mackintosh]] lands) in the early 16th century. Tor Castle would remain the seat of the Camerons of Lochiel until demolished by his great-great-great grandson, Sir Ewen "Dubh" Cameron, XVII Chief.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clan-cameron.org/achna.html|title=The history of Achnacarry - Past and Present|publisher=Clan Cameron|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ewen Cameron of Lochiel|Sir Ewen Cameron]] wanted a "more convenient" house, which was further removed from the [[Clan Mackintosh]], [[Clan Campbell]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s garrison at [[Inverlochy Castle]]. He built Achnacarry Castle in around 1655 in a strategic position on the isthmus between [[Loch Lochy]] and [[Loch Arkaig]]. One of the few remaining descriptions relate that Lochiel's seat was "a large house, all built of fir-planks, the handsomest of that kind in Britain." Sir Ewen's bard described the home somewhere around 1663 in song as "The generous house of feasting...Pillared hall of princes...Where wine goes round freely in gleaming glasses...Music resounding under its rafters." Others portrayed "old" Achnacarry as a "man's home," with the feel and look of a grand hunting lodge amidst the West Highlands.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

In 1665 the [[Stand-off at the Fords of Arkaig]] took place near Achnacarry, which saw the Camerons finally end their 360-year feud with the [[Chattan Confederation]] led by the [[Clan Mackintosh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaZSTnaE86sC&amp;pg=PA156 | title=The History of the Camerons | journal=The Celtic Magazine | first=Alexander | last=MacKenzie | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2008 | isbn= 978-0-559-79382-0 | volume=IX | issue=XCVII | page=156}} Modern reprint of November 1883 article with a detailed account of Cameron history from 1654 to 1665.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Appears to be part of a series of articles that would provide references for a lot of Cameron history, and the probable source of a lot of what appears on the Cameron websites --&gt;

With Sir Ewen's death in the early 18th century his son [[John Cameron of Lochiel|John Cameron]] became Clan Chief, soon after which his son, [[Donald Cameron of Lochiel|Donald]] would assume Achnacarry when Lord Lochiel (as his father was known) fled into exile in [[Flanders]] after the first Jacobite Uprising.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

From [[Donald Cameron of Lochiel|Donald Cameron]] ("The Gentle Lochiel") XIX Chief we find the best description of the grounds of Achnacarry. In his marriage contract a requirement was placed in which Lochiel had to build his wife "a house...to the value of 100 pounds sterling at least, with gardens, office houses [privies], lands, other conveniencys." Donald was planting a long line of beech trees near the banks of the River Arkaig when word of "[[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie's]]" landing arrived in 1745...it would be the last landscaping done at Achnacarry Castle for years to come.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

With the Jacobite army's defeat at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in April 1746 the clans retreated into the [[Scottish Highlands]], with Donald taking the lead in re-grouping them. After this last attempt at resistance failed, he and his men took to the mountains. On May 28, 1746, Donald watched as men from [[Thomas Bligh|Bligh's Regiment]] under the command of [[Edward Cornwallis|Lt-Col Edward Cornwallis]] and an Independent Company of Munros, commanded by [[George Munro, 1st of Culcairn]], burned Achnacarry to the ground. Many valued relics and personal possessions were relocated beforehand, but the great fir-planked "Old" Achnacarry was left in ashes.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

===Current Achnacarry Castle===
In 1802 Achnacarry, which had spent the last fifty or so years in ruin, was rebuilt under Donald Cameron, XXII Chief of Clan Cameron as a [[Scottish baronial style]] home, although this "New Achnacarry" is still referred to as a castle.

In 1928 Achnacarry served as the meeting place for global petroleum producers in an effort to set production quotas. A document known as the Achnacarry Agreement or "As-Is" Agreement was signed on 17 September 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=J.H. |last=Bamberg |title=The History of the British Petroleum Company, Volume 2: The Anglo-Iranian Years, 1928–1954 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |pages=528–34 |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/energy/achnacarry.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611165112/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/energy/achnacarry.htm |archivedate=11 June 2009 |df=dmy }} 18 August 1928 draft of the Achnacarry Agreement.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current building and the surrounding estate gained fame as the Commando Training Depot for the Allied Forces from March 1942 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commandoveterans.org/CommandoBasicTrainingCentre|title=The Commando Basic Training Centre at Achnacarry|date=2015|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[British Commandos]], [[United States Army Rangers]] and commandos from [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], Czechoslovakia, [[Poland]] and [[Belgium]] trained there. Each training course culminated in an "opposed landing" exercise around the area of nearby [[Bunarkaig]] on [[Loch Lochy]]. As live ammunition was used, there were some casualties whilst training at Achnacarry. Some 25,000 commandos completed training at the centre during the four years it was in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/11810760/Major-James-Dunning-obituary.html|title=Major James Dunning - obituary|date=18 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The castle also suffered some damage due to fire. Several military associations still sponsor a Commando march either annually or from time to time.  Generally it is a timed seven mile march, in full battle gear, backpack and combat boots, from [[Spean Bridge]] (site of the striking Commando Memorial) to Achnacarry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090809075848/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/royalmarines/units%2Dand%2Ddeployments/3%2Dcommando%2Dbrigade/45%2Dcommando%2Droyal%2Dmarines/news/achnacarry%2Dspeed%2Dmarch%2D2008 Achnacarry Speed March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.combinedops.com/Commando%20March.htm Commando Speed March] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423032214/http://www.combinedops.com/Commando%20March.htm |date=23 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post Second World War====
In August 2001, Achnacarry served as the site of the International Gathering of Clan Cameron, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Colonel Sir Donald Hamish Cameron of Lochiel, [[Knight of the Thistle|K.T.]], XXVI Chief of Clan Cameron. It also hosted the International Gathering of Clan Cameron in the summer of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clan-cameron.org/gathering|title=2009 International Gathering of Clan Cameron|work=clan-cameron.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the castle itself is in private hands and is not open to the public, the commando memorial can be visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/d-dayonyourdoorstep/details/commando-training-depot-achnacarry|title=Commando Training Depot, Achnacarry|publisher=D Day Museum|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors are welcome at the Clan Cameron Museum about a quarter-mile from the castle. The current Chief of [[Clan Cameron]], traditionally known simply as "Lochiel", Donald Cameron of Lochiel, continues to live in Achnacarry. Displays in the museum include the clan's legends, chiefs, slogans, history, clan lands in [[Lochaber]], and notable clansmen. Other exhibits include artifacts associated with the castle and estate's history, with the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]], and with "[[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]".&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clancameronmuseum.co.uk/index.html|title=Clan Cameron Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">The '''Agence nationale de sécurité''' ('''ANS''') is the [[intelligence agency]] of the [[Chad|Republic of Chad]]. It is the successor of the Documentation and Security Directorate (DDS) which was created by the former President [[Hissène Habré]]. The current Director is Kogri Ahmed, who was appointed May 2013 by current President [[Idriss Déby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makaila.fr/2016/12/tchad-urgent-directeur-de-l-ans-limoge.html|title=TCHAD URGENT : DIRECTEUR DE L'ANS LIMOGE - Makaila, plume combattante et indépendante|last=Mak|work=Makaila, plume combattante et indépendante|access-date=2018-10-07|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ANS was not created as a law enforcement agency (those duties instead being done by the National Gendarmerie) they were given powers of arrest in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/fr/countries/africa/chad/report-chad/|title=Tchad 2017/2018|website=www.amnesty.org|language=fr|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The ANS has been active in fighting against [[Boko Haram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/264003/politique/securite-au-tchad-le-reveil-de-lans/|title=Sécurité au Tchad : le réveil de l’ANS – JeuneAfrique.com|date=2015-09-21|work=JeuneAfrique.com|access-date=2018-10-07|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voaafrique.com/a/boko-haram-concseil-de-sucurite-discute-avec-les-autorites-tchadiennes-a-n-djamena/3749814.html|title=Boko Haram : Le Conseil de sécurité discute avec les autorités tchadiennes à N’Djamena|last=Kodmadjingar|first=André|work=VOA|access-date=2018-10-07|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The ANS has been accused of human rights violations, continuing the legacy left by the former DDS that it replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20170311-tchad-ans-agence-nationale-securite-bachir-fonac|title=Tchad: pour Ahmet Mahamat Bachir, l'ANS agit en toute légalité - RFI|work=RFI Afrique|access-date=2018-10-07|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those detained by the ANS are unable to contact their family members or their lawyers, and frequently nobody is aware of their detention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critics maintain that the ANS is used as an armed wing of Déby's [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tchadinfos.com/politique/politique-lopposition-en-appelle-a-la-solidarite-des-tchadiens-contre-lans/|title=Politique : l’opposition en appelle à la solidarité des Tchadiens contre l’ANS|date=2016-05-12|work=Tchadinfos.com|access-date=2018-10-07|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than an independent organization focused on [[counter-terrorism]].

{{Anarchism sidebar|Culture}}

'''Autonomous social centers''' are self-managed [[community centers]] in which non-authoritarians, often as volunteers, enact principles of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]]. These community spaces, often in multi-purpose venues affiliated with [[anarchism]], can include propaganda library '''infoshops''' and non-hierarchical '''free skools'''.&lt;!-- Social centers are either [[squatted|occupied]], leased, or owned, and provide a space for individuals opposed to authoritarianism and capitalism to relax, learn about political issues, and practice solidarity...--&gt;

== Social centers ==

Western anarchists have long created enclaves in which they could live their societal principles of non-authoritarianism, mutual aid, gifting, and conviviality in microcosm.{{sfn|Shantz|2012|p=124}} Some of these community sites include Wobbly union halls (1910s, 1920s), Barcelonan community centers during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], and [[squatted]] community centers since the 1960s. They share a lineage with the radical [[intentional communities]] that have periodically surfaced throughout history{{sfn|Shantz|2012|p=125}} and are sometimes termed [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s{{sfn|Shantz|2012|p=124}} or "free spaces", in which a counter-hegemonic resistance can form arguments and tactics.{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=57}}&lt;!-- heterotopias Shantz 2012--&gt; Anarchists outside the class-struggle and workplace activism tradition instead organize through autonomous spaces including social centers, squats, camps, and mobilizations.{{sfn|Franks|Kinna|2014}} While these alternative, autonomous institutions tend to exist in transience, their proponents argue that their ideas are consistent between incarnations and that temporary institutions prevents government forces from easily clamping down on their activities.{{sfn|Atton|2010|p=49}}

A free, or [[autonomous]], space is defined as a place independent from dominant institutions and ideologies, formed [[Economic determinism|outside standard economic relations]], and fostering self-directing freedom through self-reliance. These nonhierarchical rules encourage experimental approaches to organization, power-sharing, social interaction, personal development, and finance.{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=59}} Social centers can be squatted, rented, or owned cooperatively. They are largely self-maintained by volunteers and often close for reasons of burnout and reduced participation, especially if participant free time wanes as their economic circumstances change.{{sfn|Noterman|Pusey|2012|p=194}}

Since the 1980s,{{sfn|Atton|2010|p=53}} young Italians maintained independent, self-managed social centers (''centri sociali'') where they gathered to work on cultural projects, listen to music, discuss politics, and share basic living information.{{sfn|Downing|2000|pp=293–294}} By 2001, there were about 150 social centers, set up in abandoned, squatted buildings, such as former schools and factories.{{sfn|Klein|2001}} These centers operate outside state and free market control,{{sfn|Klein|2001}} and have an oppositional relationship with the police, often portrayed by conservative media as magnets for crime and illicit behavior. The Italian cultural centers were sometimes funded by city cultural programming.{{sfn|Downing|2000|pp=293–294}}

In the United States, autonomous social spaces primarily take the form of infoshops and radical bookstores, such as [[Bluestockings (bookstore)|Bluestockings]] in New York City and [[Red Emma's]] in Baltimore.{{sfn|Noterman|Pusey|2012|p=194}} Since the 1990s, North American anarchists have created community centers, infoshops, and free spaces to foster alternative cultures, economies, media, and schools as a counterculture with a [[DIY ethic|do-it-yourself ethic]]. These social spaces, as distinguished from regional intentional communities of the midcentury, often seek to integrate their community with the existing urban neighborhood instead of wholly "dropping out" of society to rural communes.{{sfn|Shantz|2012|p=125}}

In Great Britain, the rise of social centers as cultural activity and political organizing hubs has been a major feature of the region's radical and anarchist politics.{{sfn|Franks|Kinna|2014}}

== Infoshops ==

[[File:Infoshop.jpg|thumb|Street view of an infoshop in Barcelona]]

Infoshops are multi-functional spaces that disseminate [[alternative media]] and provide a forum for alternative cultural, economic, political, and social activities.{{sfn|Atton|2010|pp=47–48}} Individual infoshops vary in features but can include a small library or reading room and serve as a distribution center for both free and priced/retail alternative media,{{sfn|Atton|2010|p=47}} particularly media with revolutionary anarchist politics.{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=58, 63}} While infoshops can serve as a kind of community library, they are designed to meet the information &lt;!--and often political--&gt; needs of its users rather than to compete with the public library or per-existing information centers.{{sfn|Atton|1999|p=24}} For alternative publishers and activist groups, infoshops can offer low-cost [[reprographic]] services for [[do-it-yourself]] publications, and provide a postal mail delivery address for those who cannot afford a [[post office box]] or receive mail at a squatted address. In the 1990s, available tools ranged from no-frills [[photocopiers]] to [[desktop publishing]] software. Besides these print publication functions, infoshops can also host meetings, discussions, concerts, or exhibitions.{{sfn|Atton|2010|p=47}}&lt;!-- more example functions on p48 but not sure whether they're just aspirational; also in 2003 p63--&gt;  For instance, as activist video grew in the 1990s, infoshops screened films and hosted discussion groups that, in turn, encouraged debate and [[collective action]].{{sfn|Atton|2010|pp=47–48}} The infoshop attempts to offer a space where individuals can publish without the restrictions of the mainstream press{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=57}} and discuss alternative ideas unimpeded by&lt;!--without the social and cultural limitations of--&gt; homophobia, racism, and sexism.{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=63}}&lt;!--this is aspirational... p65 says Edinburgh didn't quite get there--&gt;

Organized by political activists, infoshops are often independent, precariously self-funded, and unaffiliated with any organization or council. They too are often staffed by their own self-selected users as volunteers{{sfn|Atton|1999|p=24}} and like the anarchist media they distribute, operate on inexpensive, borrowed, or donated resources, such as secondhand computers and furniture.{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=62}} As a result, infoshops and other marginal institutions are often short-lived, with minimal income to pay their short-term leases on rented storefronts.{{sfn|Atton|2010|pp=48–49}}&lt;!-- or resigned to "beneficent harmlessness" in hidden, low-rent locations on the outskirts of town Atton 2003--&gt; Infoshops sometimes combine the function of other alternative venues: vegetarian cafés, independent [[record stores]], [[head shops]], and alternative bookstores.{{sfn|Atton|2010|p=47}} But foremost, infoshops disseminate information, serving as library, archive, distributor, retailer,{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=58, 63}} and hub of an informal and ephemeral network of alternative organizations and activists.{{sfn|Atton|2010|p=48}}

Infoshops sprouted across North America and Europe{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=57}} in the 1990s from the squatted anarchist centers of the prior decade, such as [[121 Centre]] in London.{{sfn|Atton|2010|p=47}}&lt;!-- and earlier, the 1970s [[free festival movement]] and cooperative, alternative reading rooms.{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=57}} or {{sfn|Atton|1999|p=24}}--&gt; In the early 1990s, a network of infoshops in the United States shared resources and a zine, and thus were more developed as a network than the infoshops of the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Atton|2010|p=53}} Separate from the anarchist tradition, radical presses have long been associated with meeting space functions, such as [[Giles Calvert]]'s press (1600s) and [[John Doherty (trade unionist)#Doherty the bookseller|John Doherty's bookstore]] (1830s).{{sfn|Atton|2010|p=53}}

Some infoshops reflect the protest subcultures to which its volunteers belong. An Edinburgh infoshop, for example, sold [[punk rock|punk]] records (a genre and [[punk subculture|subculture]] that shares the infoshop's anarchist philosophy) and prioritized [[vegan]] food, which tempered the group's accessibility. The infoshop was only open and staffed for two afternoons each week and ad hoc events, which limited drop-in socializing. The group made [[decisions by consensus]] at open business meetings with regular attendees, a handful of people who ran most of the infoshop.{{sfn|Atton|2003|pp=63–65}} Infoshops in the United States, especially those run by large, unfocused groups, have been known to close for reasons of schisms and in-fighting. Their goals can also appear opaque to outsiders and inarticulate at explaining the purpose of its strategy, vision, and stances.{{sfn|Atton|2003|p=66}}

== Free skools ==

Anarchists, in pursuit of freedom from dogma, believe that individuals must not be socialized into acceptance of authority or dogma as part of their education.{{sfn|Shantz|2012|p=126}} In contrast to traditional schools, anarchist free skools are autonomous, nonhierarchical spaces intended for educational exchange and skillsharing.{{sfn|Noterman|Pusey|2012|p=182}} They do not have admittance criteria or subordinate relations between teacher and student. Free skools follow a loosely structured program that seeks to defy dominant institutions and ideologies under a [[Horizontalidad|nonhierarchical]] division of power and prefigure a more equitable world. Classes are run by volunteers and held in autonomous social centers, community centers, parks, and other public places.{{sfn|Noterman|Pusey|2012|pp=182–183}}

Free skools follow in the [[anarchism and education|anarchist education]] lineage from Spanish anarchist [[Francisco Ferrer]]'s [[Escuela Moderna]] and resulting modern school movement in the early 1900s, through the predominantly American [[free school movement]] of the 1960s.{{sfn|Shantz|2012|p=127}}&lt;!-- could use some explanation of what these were; not in chapter--&gt; The American anarchist [[Paul Goodman]], who was prominent in this latter movement, advocated for small schools for children to be held in storefronts and to use the city as its classroom.{{sfn|Shantz|2012|pp=127–128}}

In one example, a free skool in Toronto grew from the closure of a [[countercultural]] community café with the opening of an anarchist free space. It sought to share ideas about how to create anti-authoritarian social relations through a series of classes. All were invited to propose and attend classes, whose topics included: 1920s [[love songs]], alternative [[economics]], [[street art]], and [[violence against women]], though the longest running classes introduced anarchism and related politics of syndicalism and libertarian socialism. The course instructors served as facilitators, providing texts and encouraging participation, rather than as top-down lecturers. The free space also hosted art events, parties, and conversational forums. Other initiatives were short-lived or nonstarters, such as an anemic lending library and free used goods table.{{sfn|Shantz|2012|pp=128–130}} Another free skool in Nottingham found skillshare-oriented classes with more traditional pedagogy more popular than sessions on radical education.{{sfn|Noterman|Pusey|2012|p=184}}

Similar to free skools, free university projects are run from college campuses most prominently in Europe. Organized by volunteer student collectives, participants in these initiatives experiment with the process of learning and are not designed to replace the traditional university.{{sfn|Noterman|Pusey|2012|pp=184–185}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2259">The '''Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities''' ('''Buró para Represión de las Actividades Comunistas''', or '''BRAC''') was the [[Cuba]]n [[secret police]] agency that President [[Fulgencio Batista]] maintained in the 1950s, which gained a reputation for brutality in its fight against the [[26th of July Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathanpollard.org/2000/021900b.htm |title=Miami Herald: Faget's father was a brutal Batista official |website=Jonathanpollard.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/theangryearth/batista.html |title=Bush and Batista: Brothers in Arms |author=Jean-Guy Allard |website=Webcitation.org |accessdate=2016-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knpwo2zm?url=http://www.geocities.com/theangryearth/batista.html |archivedate=October 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cuban-rebels/kirkpatrick.htm |title=Cuba's Batista |website=Latinamericanstudies.org |date=1959-01-01 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themilitant.com/1996/6016/6016_13.html |title=4/22/96 - Camilo Cienfuegos As An Immigrant In U.S |publisher=The Militant |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubaverdad.net/revolution.htm |title=The Cuban revolution the truth behind the lies |website=Cubaverdad.net |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bureau was headed by Mariano Faget, who had first gained fame as a Nazi hunter during Batista's first turn at power, from 1940 to 1944, when he was chief of the Office of Investigation of Enemy Activities (''Oficina de Investigación de Actividades Enemigas''),{{efn|Also called the ''Servicio'', ''Buró'' or ''Sección de Investigación de Actividades Enemigas''.}} a [[Counterintelligence|counter-espionage]] unit that targeted Nazi and Fascist agents. 

Development of BRAC was aided and encouraged by the CIA starting in 1956.

The '''Citizens' List''' ({{lang-lb|Biergerlëscht}}, {{lang-fr|Liste des citoyens}}) is a [[Luxembourg]]ian [[political party]].  It was founded in the run-up to the [[Luxembourgish legislative election, 2009|2009 Chamber of Deputies election]] and [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Luxembourg)|European election]].  It ran in two [[Legislative circonscriptions (Luxembourg)|circonscriptions]]; in [[Circonscription Sud (Luxembourg)|Sud]], the list was to be headed by [[Aly Jaerling]], then an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], whilst, in [[Circonscription Nord (Luxembourg)|Nord]], it was led by [[Jean Ersfeld]], formerly leader of the [[Free Party of Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name="Gegen Rentenklau"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Gegen Rentenklau |url=http://www.wort.lu/wort/web/letzebuerg/artikel/14276/gegen-rentenklau.php |publisher=[[d'Wort]] |date=4 April 2009 |accessdate=10 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party stands for increased pension rights,&lt;ref name="Gegen Rentenklau" /&gt; following on from Jaerling's former membership of the (formerly [[Single-issue politics|single-issue]]) [[Alternative Democratic Reform Party]]; [[social justice]]; and an [[anti-establishment]] opposition to the major political parties.&lt;ref name="Gegen Rentenklau" /&gt;

'''Pigeons''' and '''doves''' constitute the animal family '''Columbidae''' and the order '''Columbiformes''', which includes about 42 [[Genus|genera]] and 310 [[species]]. They are stout-bodied birds with short necks, and short slender bills that in some species feature fleshy [[cere]]s. They primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and plants. Pigeons and doves are likely the most common birds in the world; the family occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indomalaya]] and [[Australasian ecozone|Australasia]] [[ecozone]]s. 

The distinction between "doves" and "pigeons" is not consistent. In everyday speech, "dove" frequently indicates a pigeon that is white or nearly white; some people use the terms "dove" and "pigeon" interchangeably. In contrast, in scientific and ornithological practice, "dove" tends to be used for smaller species and "pigeon" for larger ones, but this is in no way consistently applied. Historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms. The species most commonly referred to as "pigeon" is the species known by scientists as the [[rock dove]], one subspecies of which, the [[domestic pigeon]], is common in many cities as the [[feral pigeon]].

''Pigeon'' is a French word that derives from the Latin ''pipio'', for a "peeping" chick,&lt;ref name="oetymd-pigeon"&gt;{{OEtymD|pigeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''dove'' is a [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]] word that refers to the bird's diving flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|dove}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English dialectal word "[[wikt:culver|culver]]" appears to derive from Latin ''columba''.&lt;ref name="oetymd-pigeon" /&gt;

Doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests, often using sticks and other debris, which may be placed on trees, ledges, or the ground, depending on species. They lay one or two eggs at a time, and both parents care for the young, which leave the nest after 7–28 days.&lt;ref name="EoB"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Crome, Francis H.J.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|place=London|pages= 115–116|isbn= 978-1-85391-186-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most birds, both sexes of doves and pigeons produce "[[crop milk]]" to feed to their young, secreted by a sloughing of fluid-filled cells from the lining of the [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]]. Young doves and pigeons are called "squabs".

The Columbidae are usually divided into five subfamilies, probably inaccurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fLvMdtxHMC4C&amp;pg=PA200|title=Pigeon|last=Allen|first=Barbara|date=2009|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-711-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the American ground and [[Quail-dove|quail doves]] (''Geotrygon''), which are usually placed in the [[Columbinae]], seem to be two distinct subfamilies.&lt;ref&gt;Basically, the conventional treatment had two large subfamilies, one for the fruit doves, imperial pigeons, and fruit pigeons, and another for nearly all of the remaining species. Additionally, three [[monotypic]] subfamilies were noted, one each for the genera ''Goura'', ''Otidiphaps'', and ''Didunculus''. The old subfamily Columbinae consists of five distinct lineages, whereas the other four groups are more or less accurate representations of the evolutionary relationships.&lt;/ref&gt; The order presented here follows Baptista et{{nbsp}}al.

The arrangement of genera and naming of subfamilies is in some cases provisional because analyses of different [[DNA sequence]]s yield results that differ, often radically, in the placement of certain (mainly Indo-Australian) genera.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This ambiguity, probably caused by [[long branch attraction]], seems to confirm the first pigeons evolved in the [[Australasia|Australasian region]], and that the "[[Treroninae|Treronidae]]" and allied forms (crowned and [[pheasant pigeon]]s, for example) represent the earliest [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] of the group.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Description ==
[[File:Columbina passerina.jpg|thumb|The [[Common ground dove]] is among the smallest species in the family.]]
[[File:Dove.jpg|thumb|A flock of pigeons, commonly seen in urban areas around the world]]
Pigeons and doves exhibit considerable variation in size, ranging in length from {{convert|15|to|75|cm}}, and in weight from {{convert|30|g|lb|abbr=on}} to above {{convert|2000|g|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The largest species is the [[crowned pigeon]] of [[New Guinea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/victoria-crowned-pigeon/goura-victoria/|title=Victoria crowned-pigeon videos, photos and facts – Goura victoria|website=Arkive}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is nearly [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]-sized, at a weight of {{convert|2|–|4|kg|abbr=on|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/southern-crowned-pigeon/goura-scheepmakeri/|title=Southern crowned-pigeon videos, photos and facts – Goura scheepmakeri|website=Arkive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest is the New World ground dove of the genus ''Columbina'', which is the same size as a [[house sparrow]], weighing as little as {{convert|22|g|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="HBW" /&gt; With a total length of more than {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} and weight of almost {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, the largest [[arboreal]] species is the [[Marquesan imperial pigeon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.big-animals.com/marquesan-imperial-pigeon/|title=Marquesan Imperial Pigeon « Big Animals|website=www.big-animals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[dwarf fruit dove]], which may measure as little as {{convert|13|cm|abbr=on}}, has a marginally smaller total length than any other species from this family.&lt;ref name="HBW" /&gt;

Overall, the Columbidae tend to have short legs, short bills with a fleshy [[Beak|cere]], and small heads on large, compact bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faunaparaguay.com/columbidae.html|title=COLUMBIDAE Pigeons and Doves FAUNA PARAGUAY|last=Smith|first=Paul|website=www.faunaparaguay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of experiments in 1975 by Dr.{{nbsp}}Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their characteristic head bobbing was shown to be due to their natural desire to keep their vision constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/pigeon.html|title=Why do pigeons bob their heads when they walk?

Like some other birds, the Columbidae have no [[gall bladder]]s.&lt;ref name= Hagey&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biliary bile acids of fruit pigeons and doves (Columbiformes)|pmid=7868982|journal=Journal of Lipid Research|url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/reprint/35/11/2041.pdf|year=1994|last1=Hagey|first1=LR|last2=Schteingart|first2=CD|last3=Ton-Nu|first3=HT|last4=Hofmann|first4=AF|volume=35|issue=11|pages=2041–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medieval naturalists concluded they have no [[bile]] (gall), which in the medieval theory of the [[four humours]] explained the allegedly sweet disposition of doves.&lt;ref name="Isidore"&gt;{{cite web| work= The Medieval Bestiary| url= http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast253.htm| title= Doves| access-date= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, however, they do have gall (as [[Aristotle]] had earlier realised), which is secreted directly into the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]].&lt;ref name= Browne&gt;{{cite book| authorlink= Thomas Browne| first= Thomas |last= Browne| year= 1646| title= Pseudodoxia Epidemica| volume= III.iii| edition= 1672 | url= http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo33.html |publisher= available online at [[University of Chicago]]| accessdate= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
{{See also|List of Columbiformes by population}}
[[File:Geopelia striata NBII.jpg|thumb|The [[zebra dove]] has been widely introduced around the world.]]

Pigeons and doves are distributed everywhere on Earth, except for the driest areas of the [[Sahara Desert]], [[Antarctica]] and its surrounding islands, and the high [[Arctic]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Columbidae/|title=Columbidae (doves and pigeons)|website=Animal Diversity Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have colonised most of the world's oceanic islands, reaching eastern [[Polynesia]] and the [[Chatham Islands]] in the [[Pacific]], Mauritius, the Seychelles and [[Réunion]] in the Indian Ocean, and the [[Azores]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

The family has adapted to most of the habitats available on the planet. These species may be arboreal, [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], or semi-terrestrial. Various species also inhabit [[savanna]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[desert]]s, [[Woodland|temperate woodlands]] and forests, [[Mangrove|mangrove forests]], and even the barren sands and gravels of atolls.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/pigeons-and-doves-columbidae|title=Pigeons and Doves (Columbidae) – Dictionary definition of Pigeons and Doves (Columbidae)|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species have large natural ranges. The [[eared dove]] ranges across the entirety of [[South America]] from Colombia to [[Tierra del Fuego]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Zenaida_auriculata/|title=''Zenaida auriculata'' (eared dove)|website=Animal Diversity Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eurasian collared dove]] has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from [[Great Britain|Britain]] across [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], India, Pakistan and China,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://natureconservation.in/eurasian-collared-dove-streptopelia-decaocto-complete-detail/|title=Eurasian collared dove (''Streptopelia decaocto'') detail|website=natureconservation.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[laughing dove]] across most of sub-Saharan [[Africa]], as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.in/detail/photo/laughing-dove-this-bird-is-native-to-sub-high-res-stock-photography/140591245|title=Laughing Dove This Bird Is Native To Subsaharan Africa The Middle East And India Where It Is Known As The Little Brown Dove It Inhabits Scrubland And Feeds On Grass Seeds And Grain Stock Photo |website=www.gettyimages.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island [[endemism|endemics]]. The [[whistling dove]] is endemic to the tiny [[Kadavu Island]] in Fiji,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beautyofbirds.com/whistlingdoves.html|title=Whistling Fruit Doves|website=www.beautyofbirds.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Caroline ground-dove|Caroline ground dove]] is restricted to two islands, [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and [[Pohnpei]] in the [[Caroline Islands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JMGkAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA406|title=Pigeons and Doves: A Guide to the Pigeons and Doves of the World|last=Gibbs|first=David|date=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4081-3555-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Grenada dove]] is restricted to Grenada in the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/grenada-dove-leptotila-wellsi/details|title=Grenada Dove (Leptotila wellsi) - BirdLife species factsheet|website=datazone.birdlife.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the [[black-banded fruit dove]] is restricted to a small area of the [[Arnhem Land]] of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lK_tb2TICq8C&amp;pg=PA60|title=Aves (Columbidae to Coraciidae)|last=Schodde|first=Richard|last2=Mason|first2=I. J.|date=1997|publisher=Csiro Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-06037-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Somali pigeon]] is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbw.com/species/somali-pigeon-columba-oliviae|title=Somali Pigeon (Columba oliviae)|website=www.hbw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Moreno's ground dove]] is restricted to the area around [[Salta]] and [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucuman]] in northern Argentina.&lt;ref name="HBW" /&gt;

The largest range of any species is that of the rock dove.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beautyofbirds.com/rockpigeons.html|title=Rock Pigeons (''Columba livia'') aka Feral or Domestic Pigeons|website=www.beautyofbirds.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species had a large natural distribution from Britain and Ireland to northern Africa, across Europe, [[Arabia]], [[Central Asia]], India, the [[Himalayas]] and up into China and Mongolia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication, as the species went [[Introduced species|feral]] in cities around the world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The species is currently resident across most of [[North America]], and has established itself in cities and urban areas in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, [[Southeast Asia]], Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The species is not the only pigeon to have increased its range due to the actions of man; several other species have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity, and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity.&lt;ref name="HBW" /&gt;

==Behaviour==

===Feeding===
[[File:Treron Sieboldii.jpg|thumb|[[White-bellied green pigeon]] feeding on fruit]]
Seeds and fruit form the major component of the diets of pigeons and doves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdfeedersspot.com/wild-birds-basics-tips/what-do-doves-eat.html|title=What Do Doves Eat – Best Food For Doves|website=www.birdfeedersspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the family can be divided into the seed-eating or granivorous species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or [[Frugivore|frugivorous]] species (the other four subfamilies).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.birdsofeden.co.za/pigeons-and-doves---whats-differance_article_op_view_id_1672|title=Pigeons And Doves – What's The Differance?|publisher=birdsofeden.co.za|date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are morphological adaptations that can be used to distinguish between the two groups: granivores tend to have thick walls in their gizzards, [[Gastrointestinal tract|intestines]], and [[Esophagus|esophagi]] whereas the frugivores tend to have thin walls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k_7UBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA462|title=A Dictionary of Birds|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|last2=Lack|first2=Elizabeth|date=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4081-3838-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.&lt;ref name="HBW" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In addition to fruit and seeds, a number of other food items are taken by many species. Some, particularly the ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One species, the [[atoll fruit dove]], is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Snails, moths, and other insects are taken by [[white-crowned pigeon]]s, [[orange fruit dove]]s, and [[ruddy ground dove]]s.&lt;ref name="HBW" /&gt;

Male pigeons are more opportunistic to mate with another female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shehzad Zareen|author2=Hameed Ur Rehman|author3=Raqeebullah|author4=Abid Ur Rehman|title=Fidelity Analysis among Mates of Different Breeds of Columba livia, District Kohat, KPK, Pakistan|journal=[[Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies]]|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=195–197|url=http://www.entomoljournal.com/archives/2016/vol4issue4/PartC/4-3-154-225.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status and conservation ==
[[File:Zenaida graysoni 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Socorro dove]] is [[extinct in the wild]].]]

While many species of pigeons and doves have benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become [[threatened]] or even succumbed to [[extinction]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) are two of the most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/deextinction/selected-species-extinctions-since-1600/|title=Species Extinction Time Line {{!}} Animals Lost SInce 1600|last=Society|first=National Geographic|work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[passenger pigeon]] was exceptional for a number of reasons. In modern times, it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on Earth.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Its former numbers are difficult to estimate, but one [[Ornithology|ornithologist]], [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]], estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/06/the-birds-4|title=The Birds|website=The New Yorker|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of the species was abrupt; in 1871, a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds, yet the last individual in the species was dead by 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nebraskabirdlibrary.org/columbiformes/columbidae/passenger-pigeon/|title=Passenger Pigeon |publisher=Nebraska Bird Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although habitat loss was a contributing factor, the species is thought to have been massively over-hunted, being used as food for slaves and, later, the poor, in the United States throughout the 19th{{nbsp}}century.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The dodo, and its extinction, was more typical of the extinctions of pigeons in the past. Like many species that colonise remote islands with few predators, it lost much of its [[island tameness|predator avoidance behaviour]], along with its ability to fly.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r__Tx8QKQfMC&amp;pg=PA14|title=Pigeons and Doves: A Guide to the Pigeons and Doves of the World|last=Gibbs|first=David|date=2010|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-3556-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of people, along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats, pigs, and cats, quickly spelled the end for this species and all the other island forms that have become extinct.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Various [[conservation biology|conservation]] techniques are employed to prevent these extinctions, including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure, the establishment of protected areas to prevent further habitat loss, the establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into the wild (''[[ex situ]]'' conservation), and the translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7qoeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|title=Ethno-ornithology: "Birds, Indigenous Peoples, Culture and Society"|last=Tidemann|first=Sonia C.|last2=Gosler|first2=Andrew|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-54384-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces''' ({{korean|hangul=이북5도위원회|hanja=以北五道委員會}}, literally "The North's Five Provinces Committee") is a [[South Korea]]n government body under the [[Ministry of Security and Public Administration]].

==History==
Established in 1949, the committee is officially responsible for the administration of the five Korean provinces located entirely north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]], as the South Korean government formally claims to be the sole legitimate government of whole of [[Korea]]. The [[President of South Korea]] appoints governors for each of the five provinces.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579321810508073546|title=South Korea's Governors of Northern Provinces Don't—And Never Will—Govern|date=March 17, 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215224117/http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579321810508073546|archive-date=2014-12-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their role is largely symbolic, as the territory is under the effective jurisdiction of [[North Korea]]. The committee's main practical function is to provide support to [[North Korean defectors]] living in South Korea, including helping with the resettlement of North Koreans and organizing social events for North Koreans.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ibuk5do"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibuk5do.go.kr/5do/eng/purpose.jsp?menu_depth=02|title=Purpose/Function|work=The Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces|accessdate=2 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407055630/http://www.ibuk5do.go.kr/5do/eng/purpose.jsp?menu_depth=02|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite its name, the committee plays no part in [[North Korea–South Korea relations]]; North Korean affairs are handled by the [[Ministry of Unification]].&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; In the event of a North Korean collapse, contingency plans call for a new government body to be set up to administer the North under the leadership of the Unification Minister.

==Southern provinces with territory in North Korea==
Two South Korean provinces, [[Gyeonggi Province|Gyeonggi]] and [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon]], officially have parts of their territory in North Korea. The South Korean government considers the governors of these two provinces the head of their entire province, including the parts in the North.&lt;ref name="WSJ2" /&gt;

'''The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine''' is an international instrument aiming to prohibit the misuse of innovations in [[biomedicine]] and to protect human [[dignity]]. The Convention was opened for signature on 4 April 1997 in [[Oviedo, Spain]] and is thus otherwise known as the '''Oviedo Convention'''. The International [[treaty]] is a manifestation of the effort on the part of the [[Council of Europe]] to keep pace with developments in the field of biomedicine; it is notably the first multilateral binding instrument entirely devoted to biolaw.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention entered into force on 1 December 1999.

==Characteristics==
The Convention provides a framework structure to preserve human dignity comprehensively across the field of [[bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubios.info/EJ123/ej123d.htm Ismini Kriari-Cataris, ''The Convention for the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine: Convention on human rights and biomedicine,'' Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences Athens, Greece, Journal of Asian and International Bioethics, 12 (2002) 90-93]&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is shaped around the premise that there is a fundamental connection between human rights and biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum common standard is created by the Convention and allows states to legislate for a greater degree of protection upon ratification (''Article 27''). In addition, judicial protection is conferred on the national courts. Therefore, there is no basis on which an individual can bring an action in relation to the Oviedo Convention alone. The Convention may only be referenced in conjunction with proceedings brought in respect of a violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Absence of any provisions for a judicial procedure from the convention is considered to be a major weakness of the Oviedo Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gr2tq4rz9x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=The+Convention+on+Human+Rights+and+Biomedicine%3A+An+appraisal+of+the+Council+of+Europe+Convention&amp;rft.jtitle=European+Journal+of+Health+Law&amp;rft.au=Roscam+Abbing%2C+H.D.C&amp;rft.date=1998&amp;rft.issn=0929-0273&amp;rft.eissn=1571-8093&amp;rft.volume=5&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=377&amp;rft.epage=387&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1163%2F15718099820522588&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=29051894&amp;paramdict=en-NZ Henriette Roscam Abbing, ''The Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine. An Appraisal of the Council of Europe Convention'', European Journal of Health Law, 1998, no.5, p.379]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==
The rate of advancement in biomedicine caused concern to the Council of Europe that as much as development in this field instilled hope for mankind, it also posed a threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; It became the objective of the Council of Europe to set out common general standards for the protection of the dignity of the human person in relation to biomedical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  A draft convention was requested by the Steering Committee on Bioethics (CDBI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/healthbioethic/cdbi/default_en.asp Committee on Bioethics]&lt;/ref&gt; and drafted by its Working Group in July 1992. The draft convention underwent public consultation in July 1994, adopted by the Committee of Ministers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/cm/home_en.asp Committee of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1996, and finally opened for signature on 4 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parties to the Convention==
35 states have signed the ‘’’Oviedo Convention’'' since it was opened for signature in 1997, however only 29 of these states have signed and ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/164/signatures|title=Parties to the Oviedo Convention|last=|first=|date=|website=Treaty Office|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that only 29 states have implemented the principles of the instrument into their national law. Furthermore, 6 of those ratifying states have reservations limiting the extent to which they are bound to certain provisions. Notably, the UK and Germany have neither signed nor ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=164&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Parties to the Oviedo Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; The UK considered the convention too restrictive, whereas Germany thought it too permissive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues addressed by the Convention==
The preamble to the Oviedo Convention makes clear that its intention is for developments in biomedicine to benefit future generations and all of humanity.  The convention sets out the legal framework, which will ensure the protection of the dignity and identity of the human being. Intended as a supplementary instrument, the convention will be read in conjunction with other human rights protections namely: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/Introduction.aspx UDHR]&lt;/ref&gt; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx ICCPR]&lt;/ref&gt; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx ICESCR]&lt;/ref&gt; the Convention on the Rights of the Child ([[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx CRC]&lt;/ref&gt; the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ([[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms|ECHR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf ECHR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703000000/http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf |date=July 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/T/DGHL/Monitoring/SocialCharter/ European Social Charter]&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Principles===
The general provisions of the Oviedo Convention outline the object and purpose of the instrument. The aim is to secure the dignity of human beings within the field of biomedicine. Several principles are adopted in order to achieve this goal. Embodied in the first chapter to the convention, the principles relate to the primacy of the human being, equitable access to healthcare ([[health equity|equitable access to healthcare]]), and professional standards.

===Consent===
The issue of consent is pivotal to the Convention because of the relationship it has to individual [[autonomy]]. Medical intervention carried out without consent is a general prohibition within ''Article 5''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, consent must be free and fully informed. Free and [[informed consent]] is based on objective information. Protection is afforded to those not able to consent and provision is made for emergency situations. Specific rules must be observed where any medical intervention is carried out in any situation where a person is not able to give free and informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private life and right to information===
This issue is closely related to the right to privacy in [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. The scope of the right encompasses an individual’s entitlement not to know as well as the right to know information regarding their health. Interests of the patient, a third party, or society may lead to a restriction of either facet of the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter III]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human genome===
The Oviedo Convention incorporates provisions to address concerns relating to research into the [[human genome]]. Focus is honed on [[genetic testing]], the storage of genetic data and modification of the human genome.  Genetic testing as a tool for discrimination is prohibited under ''Article 11'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 11]&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Article 12'' allows genetic testing only for health or for scientific research linked to health purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 12]&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching theme is that genetic testing is reserved for health-related purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, modification of the human genome, for reasons other than health-related is generally prohibited under ''Article 13'' of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===
The freedom of scientific research&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=freedom%20of%20scientific%20research  World Congress for Freedom of Research]&lt;/ref&gt; is embodied in ''Chapter V''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter V]&lt;/ref&gt; However, precedence is afforded to the protection of human dignity and other fundamental freedoms. Therefore, the freedom of research is qualified (''Article 15'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Research carried out on human beings is under strict controls set forth by the convention (''Article 16'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 16]&lt;/ref&gt; The general rules on consent stipulated in ''Chapter II''&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt; must be observed in the context of research. In addition, the creation of embryos [[in vitro]] for the purposes of scientific research is expressly prohibited (''Article 18'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 18]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Organs and Transplantation===
The Convention provides the general rule that living donors for organ transplants are only to be utilised if there is no availability of organs from a deceased person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter VI]&lt;/ref&gt; Any removed parts of the body must be disposed of respectfully in accordance with the wishes of the individual. In addition, there is to be no financial gain arising from the human body or its parts, however adequate compensation for expenses incurred for a medical procedure is not prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 132]&lt;/ref&gt; The rules relating to consent laid out in ''Chapter II'' of the Convention also apply in the context of organ transplantation.

==Infringements of the Provisions of the Convention==
In accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, any individual who has suffered damage should have access to fair compensation (''Article 24'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 24]&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate judicial protection is required to be put in place to ensure there is no infringement of the principles contained in the Convention. Proportionate sanctions will be imposed for non-compliance in accordance with ''Article 25''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider Protection==
The Oviedo Convention reflects a [[minimum harmonisation]] instrument. Therefore, parties to the convention have jurisdiction to provide a greater degree of protection than that offered by the convention. However, they cannot offer lesser protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 161-162]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of the Convention==
Questions of interpretation may be referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for an advisory opinion to be issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 164]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are unable to bring an action on the basis of violation of the Oviedo Convention alone, but may reference the provisions in proceedings relating to the European Convention on Human Rights.

==Reservations==
A [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] may be made with respect to a particular provision of the convention (''Article 36''). Six states have reservations regarding particular provisions:
* [[Croatia]]
* [[Denmark]]
* [[France]]
* [[Norway]]
* [[Switzerland]]
* [[Turkey]]

==Denunciation==
Any [[signatory]] can denounce the convention by means of notification to the [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe]].

==Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings==
Deliberate [[cloning]], to create genetically identical human beings, is contrary to human dignity and constitutes a misuse of biology and medicine. It is therefore prohibited under this protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/168.htm Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Transplantation==
The protocol stipulates that, insofar as is possible, equitable access to transplantation services should be ensured. In addition, any transplantation should be carried out with respect for rights and freedoms of donors, potential donors, and recipients of organs and tissues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/186.htm Protocol on Transplantation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Biomedical Research==
In the context of biomedical research, the protocol aims to ensure protection for dignity and identity of all human beings without discrimination. The Protocol recognises that research can contribute to saving and improving human life but it can also run contrary to the fundamental principles of dignity and other rights. Where this may be the case the research should not be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/195.htm Protocol on Biomedical Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes==
The protocol responds to the concerns regarding possible improper use of genetic testing and aims to protect the dignity and identity of all human beings within this sphere. Through restricting use of genetic testing to health purposes only the convention aims to achieve its object and purpose. Genetic Testing is also permitted for scientific research, but its regulation is not included in this Protocol. It also establishes the need of free and informed consent and genetic counselling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/203.htm Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corruption in China''' post-1949 refers to the abuse of political power for private ends typically by members of the Chinese Communist Party, who hold the majority of power in the People's Republic of China. In the reform era corruption has been attributed to "organizational involution"&lt;ref&gt;Lü 2000, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; caused by the [[market liberalization]] reforms initiated by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Like other socialist economies that have undertaken economic reforms, such as [[Eastern Bloc|post-Soviet Eastern Europe]] and Central Asia, [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976–89)|reform-era China]] has experienced increasing levels of corruption.&lt;ref name=yan2&gt;Yan 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadre corruption in China has been subject to significant media attention since Communist Party General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]] announced his [[Anti-corruption campaign in China|Anti-corruption campaign]] following the [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th National Congress]] which was held in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/11/chinas-corruption-crackdown-progress-or-politics |title=China's Corruption Crackdown: Progress or Politics?|author=Teresa Welsh |date=June 11, 2015 |website= |publisher=U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report |access-date=2015-06-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public surveys on the mainland since the late 1980s have shown that it is among the top concerns of the general public. According to Yan Sun, Associate Professor of Political Science at the [[City University of New York]], it was cadre corruption, rather than a demand for democracy as such, that lay at the root of the social dissatisfaction that led to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].&lt;ref name=yan2 /&gt; Corruption undermines the legitimacy of the CPC, adds to economic inequality, undermines the environment, and fuels social unrest.&lt;ref name=pei2007 /&gt;

Since the June 4 incident, corruption has not slowed down as a result of greater economic freedom, but instead has grown more entrenched and severe in its character and scope. Business deals often involve corruption.&lt;ref name=NYTMX&gt;{{cite news|title=No Roads Are Straight Here|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/opinion/no-roads-are-straight-here.html|accessdate=May 9, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 8, 2012|author=Murong Xuecun|format=Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular perception, there are more dishonest CPC officials than honest ones, a reversal of the views held in the first decade of reform of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=yan2 /&gt; China specialist [[Minxin Pei]] argues that failure to contain widespread corruption is among the most serious threats to China's future economic and political stability.&lt;ref name=pei2007&gt;Minxin Pei, [http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=19628 ''Corruption Threatens China's Future''], Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Policy Brief No. 55, October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Bribery, kickbacks, theft, and waste of public funds costs at least three percent of GDP, he estimates.

Many high ranking government and military officials have been found guilty of corruption since Xi came to power in 2012. 

==Historical overview==

=== Imperial China ===
The spread of corruption in traditional China is often connected to the Confucian concept of ''renzhi'' ({{zh|p=rénzhì|c=人治|l=Rule of the people|labels=no}}) as opposed to the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalist]] "rule of law" ({{zh|c=法治|p=Fǎzhì|labels=no}}). Profit was despised as preoccupation of the base people, while the true Confucians were supposed to be guided in their actions by the moral principle of justice ({{zh|p=yì|t=義|s=义|labels=no}}). Thus, all relations were based solely on mutual trust and propriety. As a matter of course, this kind of moral uprightness could be developed only among a minority. The famous attempt of [[Wang Anshi]] to institutionalize the monetary relations of the state, thus reducing corruption, were met with sharp criticism by the Confucian elite. As a result, corruption continued to be widespread both in the court ([[Wei Zhongxian]], [[Heshen]]) and among the local elites, and became one of the targets for criticism in the novel ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]''. Another kind of corruption came about in [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, developed in connection with the imperial [[Imperial examination|examination system]].

In the late Ming dynasty, robust international trade brought an influx of silver into China, enriching merchants and becoming a target of government officials. In the early 1600s, literary works like "[https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-book-of-swindles/9780231178631 The Book of Swindles]" created typologies of fraud, including categories such as "Government Underlings" and "Corruption in Education."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-book-of-swindles/9780231178631 | title=The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection| publisher=Columbia University Press| isbn=9780231545648| date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republican era ===
{{see also|History of the Republic of China|Black gold (politics)}}
The widespread corruption of the [[Kuomintang]], the Chinese Nationalist Party, is often credited as being an important component in the defeat of the KMT by the Communist [[People's Liberation Army]]. Though the Nationalist Army was initially better equipped and had superior numbers, the KMT's rampant corruption damaged its popularity, limited its support base, and helped the communists in their propaganda war.

==People's Republic of China==
Getting high quality, reliable, and standardised survey data on the severity of corruption in the PRC is enormously difficult. However, a variety of sources can still be tapped, which "present a sobering picture," according to [[Minxin Pei]], an academic with expertise on Chinese affairs.&lt;ref name=pei2007nov&gt;Minxin Pei, Daniel Kaufmann, [http://www.carnegieendowment.org/events/?fa=eventDetail&amp;id=1079 ''Corruption in China: How Bad is It?''], November 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official deviance and corruption have taken place at both the individual and unit level since the founding of the PRC. Initially the practices had much to do with the ''[[danwei]]'' ({{zh|t=單位|s=[[wikt:单位|单位]]|p=dān wèi|links=no}}) system, an outgrowth of communist wartime organs.&lt;ref name="Lü 2000, p. 236"&gt;Lü 2000, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; In the PRC the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reforms of Deng Xiaoping]] were much criticized for making corruption the price of economic development. Corruption during [[Mao Zedong|Mao's]] reign also existed, however.&lt;ref&gt;Lü 2000, p. 235: ''"It is true that corruption by cadres existed in the Maoist era."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Emergence of the private sector inside the state economy in post-Mao China has tempted CPC members to misuse their power in government posts; the powerful economic levers in the hands of the elite has propelled the sons of some party officials to the most profitable positions. For this, the CPC has been called the "[[princelings]]' party" ({{zh|p=taizidang|s=太子党|links=no}}), a reference to nepotistic corruption in some periods of [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial China]]. The relatives of several prominent political leaders are reported to have generated large personal wealth in business, including relatives of former Premier [[Wen Jiabao]],&lt;ref&gt;David Barboza, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html?_r=1&amp; "Billions in Hidden Riches for Family of Chinese Leader"], ''The New York Times'', 25 October 2012. Retrieved 27 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Current CPC general secretary [[Xi Jinping]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-29/xi-jinping-millionaire-relations-reveal-fortunes-of-elite.html|title=Xi Jinping Millionaire Relations Reveal Fortunes of Elite| publisher=Bloomberg|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former Chongqing party secretary [[Bo Xilai]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Forsythe.

The politically unchallenged regime in China creates opportunities for cadres to exploit and control the rapid growth of economic opportunities; and while incentives to corruption grow, effective countervailing forces are absent.&lt;ref name=johnston /&gt;

Both structural and non-structural corruption has been prevalent in China. Non-structural corruption exists around the world, and refers to all activities that can be clearly defined as "illegal" or "criminal," mainly including different forms of graft: embezzlement, extortion, bribery etc. Structural corruption arises from particular economic and political structures; this form is difficult to root out without a change of the broader system.&lt;ref name="Lü 2000, p. 236"/&gt;

Weak state institutions are blamed for worsening corruption in reform-era China. [[New Left]] scholars on China criticise the government for apparent "blind faith" in the market, and especially for its erosion of authority and loss of control of local agencies and agents since 1992. Others also see strong links between institutional decline and rising corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Yan 2004, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption in China results from the Party-State's inability to maintain a disciplined and effective administrative corps, according to Lü Xiaobo, Assistant Professor of Political Science at [[Barnard College]]. The Chinese reform-era state has also been an enabling factor, since state agencies have been granted regulatory power without institutional constraints, allowing them to tap into new opportunities to seek profits from the rapid growth in businesses and the economy. This takes place at both the departmental and individual level.&lt;ref&gt;Lü 2000, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption here is part of the dilemma faced by any reforming socialist state, where the state needs to play an active role in creating and regulating markets, while at the same time its own intervention places extra burdens on administrative budgets. Instead of being able to reduce the size of its bureaucratic machinery (and therefore opportunities for corruption), it is instead pressed to expand further. Officials then cash in on the regulatory power by "seeking rents."&lt;ref&gt;Lü 2000, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hillman |first=Ben |title= Factions and Spoils: Examining Local State Behaviour in China |journal=The China Journal |volume=62 |year=2010 |pages=1–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, in a rare move due to its perceived impact on stability, [[Li Jinhua]], vice-chairman of the [[National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference]] (NCCPPCC) and former long-serving auditor general of the [[National Audit Office of the People's Republic of China|National Audit Office]], fired a warning shot in the ''People's Daily'', calling for better legal structures and greater supervision over the business dealings of officials and their children. He said the rapidly growing wealth of Communist officials’ children and family members "is what the public is most dissatisfied about".&lt;ref name=anderlini/&gt;

According to a January, 2014 investigation by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] more than a dozen family members of China's top political and military leaders are linked to offshore companies based in the [[British Virgin Islands]]. The report shows that the brother-in-law of China's current Paramount leader, [[Xi Jinping]] and the son-in-law of former premier Wen Jiabao are amongst those making use of offshore financial havens to avoid tax and transfer money overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Public perceptions==
Opinion surveys of Party officials and Chinese citizens over recent years set identify corruption as one of the public's top concerns. Every year researchers at the [[Central Party School]], the CPC organ that trains senior and midlevel officials, survey over 100 officials at the school. Between 1999 and 2004 respondents ranked corruption as either the most serious or second most serious social problem.&lt;ref name=pei2007 /&gt; Similarly, in late 2006 the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]’s Development Research Center asked 4,586 business executives (87 percent in nonstate firms) to rate their local officials in terms of integrity. Almost one-quarter said that their local officials were “bad”; 12 percent said they were “very bad.”&lt;ref name=pei2007 /&gt;

In a commercial environment, corruption may be prevalent because many employees are not loyal to their employers, seeing themselves as "free-agent entrepreneurs" first and foremost.&lt;ref name=rein2009&gt;Shaun Rein, ''"How to Deal with Corruption in China"'', ''Forbes'', July 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They use their employers as a way to make money, both for themselves and for their "[[guanxi]] social-circle network." The imperative of maintaining this social circle of benefits is seen as a primary goal for many involved in corruption.&lt;ref name=rein2009 /&gt;

Official corruptions are among the populace's greatest gripes against the regime. One folk saying vividly illustrates how the public sees the issue, according to Yan Sun: "If the Party executes every official for corruption, it will overdo a little; but if the Party executes every other official for corruption, it cannot go wrong."&lt;ref name=yan2 /&gt; In contemporary China, bribe taking has become so entrenched that one party secretary in a poor county received repeated death threats for rejecting over 600,000 [[Renminbi]] in bribes during his tenure. In 1994, in another area officially designated "impoverished," a delegation of the [[UN Food and Agriculture Organization]] arrived for a conference on development, but upon seeing rows of imported luxury cars outside the conference site asked the local officials "Are you really poor?"&lt;ref name=yan2 /&gt; A rare online opinion poll in 2010 by the ''People’s Daily'' found that 91% of respondents believe all rich families in China have political backgrounds.&lt;ref name=anderlini/&gt;

The high corruption rates in China has been blamed by many as a result of the political system in which public service officials are not elected by the general public.

==Means==
Broadly defined, three types of corruption are common in China: graft, [[rent-seeking]], and [[prebendalism]].&lt;ref name=lv14&gt;Lü 2000, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Graft is the most common and refers to bribery, illicit kickbacks, embezzlement, and theft of public funds. Graft involves something of value given to, and accepted by, public officials for dishonest or illegal purposes. It includes officials spending fraudulently or using public funds for their own benefit.&lt;ref name=lv14 /&gt;

Rent-seeking refers to all forms of corrupt behaviour by people with monopolistic power. Public officials, through granting a license or monopoly to their clients, get "rents"—additional earnings as a result of a restricted market. Rent-seeking happens when officials grant rents to those in their favor.&lt;ref name=lv14 /&gt; This is akin to [[cronyism]]. In the Chinese case, public officials are both rent-generators and rent-seekers, both making rent opportunities for others and seeking such opportunities to benefit themselves. This may include profiteering by officials or official firms, extortion in the form of illicit impositions, fees, and other charges.&lt;ref name=lv14 /&gt;

Prebendalism refers to when incumbents of public office get privileges and perquisites through that office.&lt;ref name=lv14 /&gt; Controlling an office entitles the holder to rents or payments for real or fake activities, and organizations are turned from places of work into "resource banks" where individuals and groups pursue their own interests. Prebendal corruption doesn't necessarily need to be about monetary gain, but may include usurpation of official privilege, backdoor deals, clientelism, cronyism, nepotism.&lt;ref name=lv14 /&gt;

Corruption in the PRC has developed in two major ways. In the first mode, corruption is in the form of ostensibly legal official expenditure, but is actually wasteful and directed toward private benefits. For example, the increasing number of local governments building massive administrative office buildings that resemble luxurious mansions.&lt;ref name=pei2007nov /&gt; At the same time, many corrupt local officials have turned their jurisdictions into virtual “mafia states,” where they collude with criminal elements and unsavory businessmen in illegal activities.&lt;ref name=pei2007nov /&gt;

While the state and its bureaucrats are major players in the reform-era economy, new interests and concentrations of economic have been created, without legitimate channels between administrators and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=johnston /&gt; A lack of regulation and supervision has meant these roles are not clearly demarcated (Lü Xiaobo in his text titles one section "From Apparatchiks to Entrepreneurchiks").&lt;ref&gt;Lv 2000, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Illicit ''guandao'' enterprises formed by networks of bureaucrats and entrepreneurs are allowed to grow, operating behind a facade of a government agency or state-owned enterprise, in a realm neither fully public nor private.&lt;ref name=johnston /&gt; More recently, Ben Hillman has shown how official corruption is facilitated by intrastate patronage networks. According to Hillman, patronage networks 'grease the wheels' of a dysfunctional bureaucracy while simultaneously extracting spoils for the private benefit of their members. Patronage networks also protect transgressors from intrusion by the Party-state's disciplinary agencies. Hillman's study of patronage networks helps to explain how corruption and economic development have been able to coexist in China.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Ben. [http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=18534 ''Patronage and Power: Local State Networks and Party-state Resilience in Rural China''] Stanford University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PLA has also become a major economic player, and participant in large- and small-scale corruption at the same time. Inconsistent tax policy, and a politicised and poorly organised banking system, create ample opportunities for favouritism, kickbacks, and "outright theft," according to Michael Johnston, Professor of Political Science at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York.&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;Michael Johnston, "Corruption in China: Old Ways, New Realities
and a Troubled Future", United Nations Public Administration Network. Retrieved January 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption has also taken the form of collusion between CPC officials and criminal gangs. Often hidden inside legitimate businesses, gangs had infiltrated public offices and worked closely with the police.&lt;ref name=moore09 /&gt; ''The Telegraph'' quoted an employee of a state company saying: "In fact, the police stations in [[Chongqing]] were actually the centre of the prostitution, gambling and drugs rackets. They would detain gangsters from time to time, and sometimes send them to prison, but the gangsters described it as going away for a holiday. The police and the mafia were buddies." In some cases, innocents were hacked to death and dismembered by roaming gangs whose presence was allowed by regime officials, according to the Telegraph.&lt;ref name=moore09&gt;Malcolm Moore, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6357024/China-corruption-trial-exposes-capital-of-graft.html ''"China corruption trial exposes capital of graft"''], ''The Daily Telegraph'', October 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Housing ===

{{See also|Forced evictions in China}}

China's housing boom, and the shift of central government policy towards social housing, are providing officials more ways to siphon off properties for personal gain. The ''Financial Times'' cites a number of public scandals involving local officials in 2010: for example, in province, eastern China, a complex of 3,500 apartments designated as social housing in Rizhao, Shandong, was sold to local officials at prices 30-50 per cent below market values. It said in Meixian, Sha’anxi, around 80 per cent of the city’s first social housing development, called Urban Beautiful Scenery, went to local officials. In Xinzhou, Shanxi, a new complex of 1,578 apartments on the local government’s list of designated social housing was almost entirely reserved for local officials, many were 'flipped' for tidy profits even before construction was completed. Jones Lang LaSalle said that transparency about the plans for affordable housing was severely lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Geoff (18 June 2010). [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8642412e-7aee-11df-8935-00144feabdc0.html "Housing boom fuels corruption in China"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Whether the effects of corruption in China are solely positive or negative is a subject of hot debate. Corruption favors the most connected and unscrupulous, rather than the efficient, and also creates entry barriers in the market for those without such connections. Favors are sought for inefficient subsidies, monopoly benefits, or regulatory oversight, rather than productive activity.&lt;ref name="Yan 2004, p. 12"&gt;Yan 2004, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Bribes also lead to a misdirection of resources into wasteful or poor-quality projects. Further, since corrupt payments are usually done in secrecy, they are more likely to be used in the same way, driving the proceeds of illegal transactions into foreign bank accounts. Such capital flight costs national growth.&lt;ref name="Yan 2004, p. 12"/&gt; Centralised corruption also carries with it the same defects, according to Yan. Rent seeking, for example, is costly to growth because it prevents innovation. Rent seeking activities are also self-sustaining, since such activity makes it seem more attractive compared to productive activity. Corruption is never a better option to honest public policy, Yan Sun argues, and it distorts and retards development.&lt;ref&gt;Yan 2004, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, including local officials, play down the negative impacts of corruption, and local cadres frown on anticorruption efforts for three reasons: a preoccupation with rooting out corruption may lead to cautiousness about new practices; corruption may act as a "lubricant" to "loosen up" the bureaucracy and facilitate commercial exchanges; and thirdly, corruption is a necessary trade-off and inevitable part of the process of reform and opening up.&lt;ref&gt;Yan 2004, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the destructiveness of corruption in the Chinese context helps transfer or reallocate power from officials, perhaps even enabling the rise of a "new system" and acting as a driving force for reform.&lt;ref&gt;Yan 2004, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the deleterious effects of corruption were documented in detail in Minxin Pei's report. The amount of money stolen through corruption scandals has risen exponentially since the 1980s, and corruption in China is now more concentrated in the sectors the state is heavily involved with.&lt;ref name=pei2007 /&gt; These include infrastructure projects, real estate, government procurement, and financial services. The lack of a competitive political process means these are high-risk areas for fraud, theft, and bribery; Pei estimates the cost of corruption could be up to $86 billion per year.&lt;ref name=pei2007 /&gt;

Corruption in China also harms Western business interests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/www/english/metro-beijing/update/top-news/2010-05/530235.html |title= |author= |date= |website=globaltimes.cn |publisher=[[Global Times]] |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514112633/http://www.globaltimes.cn/www/english/metro-beijing/update/top-news/2010-05/530235.html |archivedate=2010-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular foreign investors. They risk human rights, environmental, and financial liabilities, at the same time squaring off against rivals who engage in illegal practices to win business.&lt;ref name=pei2007 /&gt;

Long term, corruption has potentially "explosive consequences," including widening income inequalities within cities and between city and countryside, and creating a new, highly visible class of "socialist millionaires," which further fuels resentment from the citizenry.&lt;ref name=johnston /&gt;

Ordinary Chinese are many times, the victims in official corruption, as in the case of [[Hewan]] village in [[Jiangsu]] province, where 200 thugs were hired to attack local farmers and force them off their land so Party bosses could build a petrochemical plant. Sun Xiaojun, the party chief of Hewan village, was later arrested. One farmer died.&lt;ref&gt;AsiaNews/Agencies, [http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Corruption-in-China:-Communist-official-and-Supreme-Court-justice-imprisoned-17388.html "Corruption in China: Communist official and Supreme Court justice imprisoned,"] AsiaNews.it, January 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Officials themselves are increasingly victims of official corruption when they target each other out of jealousy, hunger for promotion: there have been high-profile cases of mainland bureaucrats employing hit men or launching acid attacks on rivals. In August 2009, a former director of the Communications Bureau in [[Hegang]], [[Heilongjiang]], who hired hitmen to kill his successor, supposedly because of the latter's ingratitude, was given the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Xiangwei (28 Jun 2010). CHINA BRIEFING: "More officials trying to get away with murder", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures==
The CPC has tried a variety of anti-corruption measures, constructing a variety of laws and agencies in an attempt to stamp out corruption, but almost none have been proven to be even mildly effective.

In 2004, the CPC devised strict regulations on officials assuming posts in business and enterprise. The [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China|Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] and the [[Central Organization Department]] issued a joint circular instructing Party committees, governments and related departments at all levels not to give approval for Party and government officials to take up concurrent posts in enterprises.&lt;ref name=ti2006&gt;Transparency International, [http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases_nc/2006/2006_12_08_chinese_nis ''"Chinese National Integrity System Study 2006"''], December 7, 2006 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202232159/http://www.transparency.org./news_room/latest_news/press_releases_nc/2006/2006_12_08_chinese_nis |date=December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law 395 related to the illicit enrichment of public officials was also enacted.

In 2007 Chinese authorities established a National Corruption Prevention Bureau, focused primarily on gathering information and intra-agency coordination. Unlike the Ministry of Supervision, Procuratorate, or CCDI, the NCPB was focused on "implementing preventive measures, monitoring the transfer of assets across organizations, facilitating and promoting information sharing between agencies, and policing corrupt practices within the nongovernmental sphere, including private enterprises, social organizations and NGOs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Jeffrey|date=2008-10-01|title=Tackling Corruption at its Source: The National Corruption Prevention Bureau|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11366-008-9028-4|journal=Journal of Chinese Political Science|volume=13|issue=3|pages=287–303|doi=10.1007/s11366-008-9028-4|issn=1080-6954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of independence of the NCPB however meant that its impact on actual corruption was limited.

The Anti-Unfair Competition Law prohibits commercial bribery punishable by economic and administrative sanctions. It is prohibited to give or receive bribes in the course of selling or purchasing goods. In case of misconduct, companies are fined in between 10.000 RMB and 200.000 RMB The Criminal Law of China prohibits giving and receiving property to obtain an undue benefit, with penalties including fines, confiscation of property, imprisonment or death.
Such measures are largely ineffective, however, due to the insufficient enforcement of the relevant laws.&lt;ref name=pei2007nov /&gt; Further, because the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection largely operates in secrecy, it is unclear to researchers how allegedly corrupt officials are disciplined and punished. The odds for a corrupt official to end up in prison are less than three percent, making corruption a high-return, low risk activity. This leniency of punishment has been one of the main reasons corruption is such a serious problem in China.&lt;ref name=pei2007nov /&gt;

While corruption has grown in scope and complexity, anti-corruption policies, on the other hand, have not changed much.&lt;ref name=johnston /&gt; Communist-style mass campaigns with anti-corruption slogans, moral exhortations, and prominently displayed miscreants, are still a key part of official policy, much as they were in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=johnston /&gt;

In 2009, according to internal Party reports, there were 106,000 officials found guilty of corruption, an increase of 2.5 percent on the previous year. The number of officials caught embezzling more than one million RMB (US$146,000) went up by 19 percent over the year. With no independent oversight like NGOs or free media, corruption has flourished.&lt;ref name=bbc09jan&gt;Quentin Sommerville, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8448059.stm "''Corruption up among China government officials"''], BBC, January 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

These efforts are punctuated by an occasional harsh prison term for major offenders, or even executions. But rules and values for business and bureaucratic conduct are in flux, sometimes contradictory, and “deeply politicized.”&lt;ref name=johnston /&gt; In many countries systematic anti-corruption measures include independent trade and professional associations, which help limit corruption by promulgating codes of ethics and imposing quick penalties, watchdog groups like NGOs, and a free media. In China, these measures do not exist as a result of the CPC’s means of rule.&lt;ref name=johnston /&gt;

Thus, while CPC disciplinary organs and prosecutorial agencies produce impressive statistics on corruption complaints received from the public, few citizens or observers believe corruption is being systematically addressed.&lt;ref name=johnston /&gt;

There are also limits to how far anti-corruption measures will go. For example, when [[Hu Jintao]]'s son was implicated in a [[Nuctech|corruption investigation in Namibia]], Chinese Internet portals and Party-controlled media were ordered not to report on it.&lt;ref name=nyt2009sept /&gt;

At the same time, local leaders engage in "corruption protectionism," as coined by the head of the [[Hunan]] provincial [[Party Discipline Inspection Commission]]; apparatchiks thwart corruption investigations against the staff of their own agencies, allowing them to escape punishment. In some cases this has impelled high-ranking officials to form special investigative groups with approval from the central government to avoid local resistance and enforce cooperation.&lt;ref name="Lü 2000, p. 227"&gt;Lü 2000, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; However, since in China vertical and horizontal leadership structures often run at odds with one another, CPC anti-corruption agencies find it hard to investigate graft at the lower levels. The goal of effectively controlling corruption thus remains elusive to the ruling Party, and only a propaganda tool to mislead the Chinese public on its false promises.&lt;ref name="Lü 2000, p. 227"/&gt;

===Political incentives for cracking down===
Prominent anti-corruption cases in China are often an outgrowth of factional struggles for power in the CPC, as opponents use the "war of corruption" as a weapon against rivals in the Party or corporate world.&lt;ref name=nyt2009sept&gt;David Barboza, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/business/global/04corrupt.html ''"Politics Permeates Anti-Corruption Drive in China"''], ''The New York Times'', September 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Peng|title=The rise of the Red Mafia in China: a case study of organised crime and corruption in Chongqing|journal=Trends in Organized Crime|year=2013|volume=16|issue=1|pages=49–73|doi=10.1007/s12117-012-9179-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, too, the central leadership's goal in cracking down on corruption is to send a message to those who step over some "unknown acceptable level of graft" or too obviously flaunt its benefits. Another reason is to show an angry public that the Party is doing something about the problem.&lt;ref name=nyt2009sept /&gt;

In many such cases, the origins of anti-corruption measures are a mystery. When [[Chen Liangyu]] was ousted, analysts said it was because he lost a power struggle with leaders in [[Beijing]]. Chen was [[Shanghai]]'s party secretary and member of the powerful [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]].&lt;ref name=nyt2009sept /&gt; In 2010, a re-release of the [[Communist Party of China 52 code of ethics]] was published.

A '''crown''' is a traditional [[symbol]]ic form of [[headwear]], or [[hat]], worn by a [[monarch]] or by a [[deity]], for whom the crown traditionally represents [[Political power|power]], [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], [[victory]], [[Roman triumph|triumph]], [[honor]], and [[glory (religion)|glory]], as well as [[Crown of Immortality|immortality]], [[righteousness]], and [[resurrection]]. In [[art]], the crown may be shown being offered to those on Earth by [[angels]]. Apart from the traditional form,{{what|reason="traditional form" is not defined in the previous two sentences -- are our readers supposed to interpret "traditional" as meaning "in popular culture"? Because that's INCREDIBLY problematic.|date=September 2017}} crowns also may be in the form of a [[Wreath (attire)|wreath]] and be made of flowers, [[Civic Crown|oak leaves]], or [[Crown of Thorns|thorns]] and be worn by others, representing what the [[coronation]] part aims to symbolize with the specific crown. In religious art, a crown of [[Crown of Immortality|stars]] is used similarly to a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. Crowns worn by rulers often contain [[Crown jewels|jewels]].

==As an emblem==
A crown is often an [[emblem]] of the monarchy, a monarch's government, or items endorsed by it. The word itself is used, particularly in Commonwealth countries, as an abstract name for the monarchy itself, as distinct from the individual who inhabits it (see [[The Crown]]). A specific type of crown (or [[coronet]] for lower ranks of peerage) is employed in [[heraldry]] under strict rules. Indeed, some monarchies never had a physical crown, just a heraldic representation, as in the constitutional kingdom of Belgium, where no coronation ever took place; the royal installation is done by a solemn oath in parliament, wearing a military uniform: the King is not acknowledged as by divine right, but assumes the only hereditary public office in the service of the law; so he in turn will swear in all members of "his" federal government.

*[[Costume]] headgear imitating a monarch's crown is also called a crown. Such costume crowns may be worn by [[actor]]s portraying a monarch, people at costume parties, or ritual "monarchs" such as the king of a [[Carnival]] [[krewe]], or the person who found the trinket in a [[king cake]].
*The '''nuptial crown''', sometimes called a '''coronal''', worn by a bride, and sometimes the bridegroom, at her wedding is found in many European cultures since ancient times. In the present day, it is most common in [[Eastern Orthodox]] cultures. The Eastern Orthodox marriage service has a section called the crowning, wherein the bride and groom are crowned as "king" and "queen" of their future household.  In Greek weddings, the crowns are [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]]s usually made of white flowers, synthetic or real, often adorned with [[silver]] or [[mother of pearl]].  They are placed on the heads of the newlyweds and are held together by a ribbon of white [[silk]].  They are then kept by the couple as a reminder of their special day. In Slavic weddings, the crowns are usually made of ornate metal, designed to resemble an imperial crown, and are held above the newlyweds' heads by their best men.  A parish usually owns one set to use for all the couples that are married there since these are much more expensive than Greek-style crowns. This was common in Catholic countries in the past.
* Crowns are also often used as symbols of religious status or veneration, by divinities (or their representation such as a statue) or by their representatives, e.g. the [[Black Crown]] of the Karmapa Lama, sometimes used a model for wider use by devotees. 
*A [[Crown of thorns]] according to [[the New Testament]], was placed on the head of [[Jesus]] before his [[crucifixion]] and has become a common symbol of martyrdom. 
*According to [[Roman Catholic]] [[Sacred tradition|tradition]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] was crowned as [[Queen of Heaven]] after her [[Assumption of Mary|assumption]] into [[Heaven#In Roman Catholicism|heaven]]. She is often depicted wearing a crown, and statues of her in churches and [[Shrines to the Virgin Mary|shrines]] are [[May crowning|ceremonially crowned]] during May.
*The [[Crown of Immortality]] is also common in historical symbolism.
*The heraldic symbol of [[Three Crowns]], referring to the three evangelical [[Biblical Magi|Magi (wise men)]], traditionally called kings, is believed thus to have become the symbol of the Swedish kingdom, but it also fits the historical (personal, dynastic) [[Kalmar Union]] (1397–1520) between the three kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.
*Dancers of certain traditional [[Thai dance]]s often wear crowns (''[[Chada and mongkut|mongkut]]'') on their head. These are inspired in the crowns worn by deities and [[Great Crown of Victory|by kings]].
*In [[India]], crowns are known as ''mukuta'' (Sanskrit for "crest"), and have been used in India since ancient times and are described adorning Hindu gods or kings.
*In pre-Hispanic [[Philippines]], a crown-like [[diadem]]s or ''Putong'' is wore by [[Maharlika|elite individuals]] and also [[Philippine Mythology|deities]], include array of golden ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayalamuseum.org/2014/02/04/gold-of-ancestors/|title=Gold of Ancestors - Ayala Museum|first=Alex|last=Itsios|website=www.ayalamuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/facts-about-pre-colonial-philippines/|title=12 Surprising Facts You Didn't Know About Ancient Philippines|date=4 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Three distinct categories of crowns exist in those [[monarchy|monarchies]] that use crowns or state regalia.

*'''[[Coronation crown|Coronation]]''':  worn by monarchs when being [[coronation|crowned]].
*'''[[State crown|State]]''':  worn by monarchs on other state occasions.
*'''[[Consort crown]]s''':  worn by [[Queen consort|queens consort]], signifying rank granted as a [[constitution]]al courtesy [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]].

Crowns or similar headgear, as worn by [[nobility]] and other high-ranking people below the ruler, is in English often called a [[coronet]]; However, in many languages, this distinction is not made and the same word is used for both types of headgear (e.g., French ''couronne'', German ''Krone'', Dutch ''kroon''). In some of these languages the term "rank crown" (rangkroon, etc.) refers to the way these crowns may be ranked according to hierarchical status.
[[File:Kroon van Nederland.jpg|thumb|Crown of the Kingdom of the Netherlands]]
In [[Classical antiquity]], the crown (''corona'') that was sometimes awarded to people other than rulers, such as triumphal [[military]] [[general]]s or [[sportsperson|athlete]]s, was actually a [[Wreath (attire)|wreath]] or chaplet, or ribbon-like [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]].

==History==
[[Image:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb| The [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], probably the most ancient royal insignia of Europe, used by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]], kept in the Cathedral of [[Monza]].]]
[[File:Crown of George XII of Georgia.jpeg|thumb|[[Georgian Crown|Crown]] of King [[George XII of Georgia]] made of gold and decorated with 145 diamonds, 58 rubies, 24 emeralds and 16 amethysts. It took the form of a circlet surmounted by ornaments and eight arches. A [[Globus cruciger|globe surmounted by a cross]] rested on the top of the crown.]]

The precursor to the crown was the browband called the [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], which had been worn by the [[Achaemenid|Achaemenid Persian emperors]]. It was adopted by [[Constantine I]] and was worn by all subsequent rulers of the later Roman Empire.

Numerous crowns of various forms were used in antiquity, such as the [[Hedjet]], [[Deshret]], [[Pschent]] (double crown) and [[Khepresh]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]]. The Pharaohs of Egypt also wore the diadem, which was associated with solar cults, an association which was not completely lost, as it was later revived under the Roman Emperor Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muslim Kingship: Power and the Sacred in Muslim, christian and Pagan Politics|last=Al-Azmeh|first=Aziz|publisher=I.B. Tauris Publications|year=2001|isbn=1-86064-609-3|location=London|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the  time of the Pharaoh Amenophis III (r.1390-1352c)  wearing a diadem clearly became a symbol  of royalty.

The ''corona radiata'', the "[[radiant crown]]" known best on the [[Statue of Liberty]], and perhaps worn by the [[Helios]] that was the [[Colossus of Rhodes]], was worn by Roman emperors as part of the cult of [[Sol Invictus]] prior to the [[Roman Empire]]'s conversion to Christianity. It was referred to as "the chaplet studded with sunbeams” by [[Lucian]], about 180 AD.&lt;ref&gt;in [http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm ''Alexander the false prophet''])&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the oldest extant Christian crown in Europe is the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], of Roman and [[Longobard]] antiquity, later again used to crown modern Kings of Napoleonic and Austrian Italy, and to represent united Italy after 1860.

In the Christian tradition of European cultures, where ecclesiastical sanction authenticates monarchic power, when a new monarch ascends the throne, the crown is placed on the new monarch's head by a religious official in a coronation ceremony. Some, though not all, early [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s travelled to Rome at some point in their careers to be crowned by the pope. [[Napoleon]], according to legend, surprised [[Pius VII]] when he reached out and crowned himself, although in reality this order of ceremony had been pre-arranged (see [[coronation]]).

Today, only the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarchy]] and [[Monarchy of Tonga|Tongan Monarchy]], with their anointed and crowned monarchs, continue this tradition, although many monarchies retain a crown as a national symbol. The [[French Crown Jewels]] were sold in 1885 on the orders of the [[Third French Republic]], with only a token number, their precious stones replaced by glass, retained for historic reasons and displayed in the [[Louvre]]. The [[Spanish Crown Jewels]] were destroyed in a major fire in the 18th century while the so-called "[[Irish Crown Jewels]]" (actually merely the British Sovereign's insignia of the [[Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick]]) were stolen from [[Dublin Castle]] in 1907, just before the investiture of [[Bernard Edward Barnaby FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown]].

Special headgear to designate rulers dates back to pre-history, and is found in many separate civilizations around the globe. Commonly, rare and precious materials are incorporated into the crown, but that is only essential for the notion of crown jewels. [[Gold]] and precious [[gemstone|jewel]]s are common in western and oriental crowns. In the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] civilizations of the [[Pre-Columbian]] [[New World]], rare [[feather]]s, such as that of the [[quetzal]], often decorated crowns; so too in Polynesia (e.g. Hawaii).

[[Coronation|Coronation ceremonies]] are often combined with other rituals, such as enthronement (the throne is as much a symbol of monarchy as the crown) and anointing (again, a religious sanction, the only defining act in the Biblical tradition of Israel).

In other cultures, no crown is used in the equivalent of coronation, but the head may still be otherwise symbolically adorned; for example, with a royal ''[[tikka (forehead mark)|tikka]]'' in the Hindu tradition of India.

==Numismatics==
Because one or more crowns, alone or as part of a more elaborate design, often appear on coins, several monetary denominations came to be known as 'a crown' (see [[Crown (British coin)]]) or the equivalent word in the local language, such as ''krone''. This persists in the case of the national currencies of the Scandinavian countries and the Czech Republic.  The generic term "crown sized" is frequently used for any coin roughly the size of an American [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]].

The '''Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation''' ({{lang-ga|An Roinn Gnó, Fiontar agus Nuálaíochta}}) is a [[Department of State (Ireland)|department]] of the [[Government of Ireland]]. It is led by the [[Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation]] who is assisted by two [[Minister of State (Ireland)|Ministers of State]].

==Overview==
[[File:Dept of Industry and Commerce.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Department Headquarters, Kildare Street, Dublin 2.]]
The official headquarters and ministerial offices of the department are at 23 [[Kildare Street]], [[Dublin 2]]. It is one of the most important economic departments in the Irish Government, responsible for the implementation of policy in five key areas:
* Enterprise, Innovation, Growth
* Quality Work and Learning
* Making Markets and Regulation work better
* Quality, Value and Continuous Improvement
* the European Union.

A large element of the work of the Department arises from Ireland's membership of a number of international organisations, in particular the [[European Union]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. The Department plays an active role in the development of EU and WTO policies, particularly to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected. The Department is organised into five divisions. They are:
*Innovation and Investment Division
*Enterprise and Trade Division
*Commerce, Consumer and Competition Division
*Employment Rights and Industrial Relations Division
*Corporate Services

==Bodies and offices associated with the Department==
The department oversees a large number of bodies and agencies. In July 2009 the [[McCarthy Report|Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes]] proposed merging the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  However, this process remains at an early stage. Until 2010, the Department was responsible for FÁS, which had its responsibilities divided up between two bodies in 2013. Bodies and agencies associated with the Department include:

*[[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|Companies Registration Office]]
*[[Competition and Consumer Protection Commission]]
*Local Enterprise Offices
*[[Director of Corporate Enforcement]]
*Employment Appeals Tribunal
*[[Enterprise Ireland]]
*[[Health and Safety Authority]]
*[[IDA Ireland]]
*[[InterTradeIreland]] (under North-South co-operation structures)
*Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority
*Labour Court
*Workplace Relations Commission
*[[National Standards Authority of Ireland]]
*Office of the Register of Friendly Societies
*Patents Office
*Personal Injuries Assessment Board
*[[Science Foundation Ireland]]

The '''Duesberg hypothesis''' is the claim, associated with [[University of California, Berkeley]] professor [[Peter Duesberg]], that various noninfectious factors such as but not limited to, [[recreational drug|recreational]] and pharmaceutical drug use are the cause of [[AIDS]], and that [[HIV]] (human immunodeficiency virus) is merely a harmless [[passenger virus]].&lt;ref name="DuesbergJBiosci"/&gt; The [[scientific consensus]] is that the Duesberg hypothesis is incorrect and that HIV is the cause of AIDS.&lt;ref name="niaid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/How+HIV+Causes+AIDS/HIVcausesAIDS.htm |title=National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease Fact Sheet: The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS |accessdate=9 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924081245/http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/How+HIV+Causes+AIDS/HIVcausesAIDS.htm |archivedate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/hiv/en/ World Health Organization HIV and AIDS Programme], from the [[World Health Organization]] website. Retrieved 9 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent supporters of this hypothesis are Duesberg himself, [[biochemist]] vitamin proponent [[David Rasnick]], and journalist [[Celia Farber]]. The [[scientific community]] contends that Duesberg's arguments are the result of [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picking]] predominantly outdated scientific data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galea P, Chermann JC | title = HIV as the cause of AIDS and associated diseases | journal = Genetica | volume = 104 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–142 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10220906 | doi = 10.1023/A:1003432603348}}&lt;/ref&gt; and selectively ignoring evidence in favor of HIV's role in AIDS.&lt;ref name="phenom"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7992043 | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. | year = 1994 | title = The Duesberg phenomenon | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/cohen/266-5191-1642a.pdf | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5191| pages = 1642–1644 | pmid = 7992043 | bibcode=1994Sci...266.1642C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of legal and illegal drug use==
Duesberg argues that there is a statistical [[correlation]] between trends in recreational drug use and trends in AIDS cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duesberg P, Rasnick D |title=The AIDS dilemma: drug diseases blamed on a passenger virus |journal=Genetica |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=85–132 |year=1998 |pmid=10220905 |doi=10.1023/A:1003405220186}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the [[AIDS epidemic|epidemic]] of AIDS cases in the 1980s corresponds to a supposed epidemic of recreational drug use in the United States and Europe during the same time frame.

These claims are not supported by [[epidemiology|epidemiologic data]]. The average yearly increase in opioid-related deaths from 1990 to 2002 was nearly three times the yearly increase from 1979–90, with the greatest increase in 2000–02, yet AIDS cases and deaths fell dramatically during the mid-to-late-1990s.&lt;ref name="drugusepharmaco"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paulozzi LJ, Budnitz DS, Yongli X |title=Increasing deaths from opioid analgesics in the United States |journal=Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety |volume=15 |issue=9 |pages=618–27 |year=2006 |pmid=16862602 |doi=10.1002/pds.1276|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1229306/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duesberg's claim that recreational drug use, rather than HIV, was the cause of AIDS has been specifically examined and found to be false. Cohort studies have found that only HIV-positive drug users develop [[opportunistic infection]]s; HIV-negative drug users do not develop such infections, indicating that HIV rather than drug use is the cause of AIDS.&lt;ref name="niaid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="drugusenature"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ascher MS, Sheppard HW, Winkelstein W, Vittinghoff E |title=Does drug use cause AIDS? |journal=Nature |volume=362 |issue=6416 |pages=103–4 |year=1993 |pmid=8095697 |doi=10.1038/362103a0 |bibcode=1993Natur.362..103A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duesberg has also argued that [[nitrite inhalant]]s were the cause of the epidemic of [[Kaposi sarcoma]] (KS) in gay men. However, this argument has been described as an example of the [[fallacy]] of a statistical [[confounding]] effect;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morabia A |title=Poppers, Kaposi's sarcoma, and HIV infection: empirical example of a strong confounding effect? |journal=Prev Med |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=90–5 |year=1995 |pmid=7661947 |doi=10.1006/pmed.1995.1014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is now known that [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|a herpesvirus]], potentiated by HIV, is responsible for AIDS-associated KS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kedes D, Operskalski E, Busch M, Kohn R, Flood J, Ganem D |title=The seroepidemiology of human herpesvirus 8 (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus): distribution of infection in KS risk groups and evidence for sexual transmission |journal=Nat Med |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=918–24 |year=1996 |pmid=8705863 |doi=10.1038/nm0896-918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin J, Ganem D, Osmond D, Page-Shafer K, Macrae D, Kedes D |title=Sexual transmission and the natural history of human herpesvirus 8 infection |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=338 |issue=14 |pages=948–54 |year=1998 |pmid=9521982 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199804023381403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in addition to recreational drugs, Duesberg argues that anti-HIV drugs such as [[zidovudine]] (AZT) can cause AIDS. Duesberg's claim that antiviral medication causes AIDS is regarded as disproven by the scientific community. Placebo-controlled studies have found that AZT as a single agent produces modest and short-lived improvements in survival and delays the development of opportunistic infections; it certainly did not cause AIDS, which develops in both treated and untreated study patients. With the subsequent development of [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s and [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]], numerous studies have documented the fact that anti-HIV drugs prevent the development of AIDS and substantially prolong survival, further disproving the claim that these drugs "cause" AIDS.&lt;ref name="niaid"/&gt;

===Scientific study and rejection of Duesberg's risk-AIDS hypothesis===
Several studies have specifically addressed Duesberg's claim that recreational drug abuse or [[sexual promiscuity]] were responsible for the manifestations of AIDS. An early study of his claims, published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1993, found Duesberg's drug abuse-AIDS hypothesis to have "no basis in fact."&lt;ref name="drugusenature"/&gt;

A large [[prospective study]] followed a group of 715 [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] men in the Vancouver, Canada, area; approximately half were HIV-[[seropositive]] or became so during the follow-up period, and the remainder were HIV-seronegative. After more than 8 years of follow-up, despite similar rates of drug use, sexual contact, and other supposed risk factors in both groups, only the HIV-positive group suffered from [[opportunistic infection]]s. Similarly, [[CD4]] counts dropped in the patients who were HIV-infected, but remained stable in the HIV-negative patients, despite similar rates of risk behavior.&lt;ref name="lancet1993"/&gt; The authors concluded that "the risk-AIDS hypothesis ... is clearly rejected by our data," and that "the evidence supports the hypothesis that HIV-1 has an integral role in the CD4 depletion and progressive immune dysfunction that characterise AIDS."&lt;ref name="lancet1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter M, Craib K, Gelmon K, Montaner J, Le T, O'Shaughnessy M | title = HIV-1 and the aetiology of AIDS. | journal = Lancet | volume = 341 | issue = 8846 | pages = 658–9 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8095571 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(93)90421-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study]] (MACS) and the [[Women's Interagency HIV Study]] (WIHS)—which between them observed more than 8,000 Americans—demonstrated that "the presence of HIV infection is the only factor that is strongly and consistently associated with the conditions that define AIDS."&lt;ref name="macs"&gt;[http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/focuson/hiv/resources/macs_and_wihs.htm MACS and WIHS Studies Provide Overwhelming Evidence That HIV Causes AIDS]. From the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]]. Retrieved 9 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that recreational drug use (including [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[poppers]], and [[amphetamines]]) had no effect on [[CD4]] or [[CD8]] T-cell counts, providing further evidence against a role of recreational drugs as a cause of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chao C |title=Recreational drug use and T lymphocyte subpopulations in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected men |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume= 94|issue= 1–3|pages= 165–171|year=2008 |pmid=18180115 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2007.11.010 |pmc=2691391 |author2=Jacobson LP |author3=Tashkin D |last4=Martínez-Maza |first4=Otoniel |last5=Roth |first5=Michael D. |last6=Margolick |first6=Joseph B. |last7=Chmiel |first7=Joan S. |last8=Rinaldo |first8=Charles |last9=Zhang |first9=Zuo-Feng|display-authors=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current AIDS definitions==
Duesberg argued in 1989 that a significant number of AIDS victims had died without proof of HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Duesberg P |title=Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: correlation but not causation |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=755–64 |year=1989 |pmid=2644642 |doi=10.1073/pnas.86.3.755 |pmc=286556|bibcode = 1989PNAS...86..755D }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the use of modern culture techniques and [[polymerase chain reaction]] testing, HIV can be demonstrated in virtually all patients with AIDS.&lt;ref name="niaid"/&gt; Since AIDS is now defined partially by the presence of HIV, Duesberg claims it is impossible by definition to offer evidence that AIDS doesn't require HIV. However, the first definitions of AIDS mentioned no cause and the first AIDS diagnoses were made before HIV was discovered. The addition of HIV positivity to surveillance criteria as an absolutely necessary condition for case reporting occurred only in 1993, after a scientific consensus was established that HIV caused AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' 31(37), 24 Sep 1982] ''Update on Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), United States.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' 34(25), 28 June 1985] ''Revision of the CDC Surveillance Case Definition of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome for National Reporting, United States.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' 36(S1), 14 August 1987] ''Revision of the CDC Surveillance Case Definition for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' 41(RR-17), 18 December 1992] ''1993 Revised Classification System for HIV Infection and Expanded Surveillance Definition for AIDS Among Adolescents and Adults.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==AIDS in Africa==
According to the Duesberg hypothesis, AIDS is not found [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|in Africa]]. What Duesberg calls "the myth of an African AIDS epidemic,"&lt;ref name = "uirhmj"&gt;[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. {{ISBN|0-89526-399-8}}] Page 291.&lt;/ref&gt; among people"&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jun/15-aids-dissident-seeks-redemption-and-a-cure-for-cancer Discover Magazine feature on Duesberg.] Jeanne Linzer, Discover, 15 May 2008, ''AIDS "Dissident" Seeks Redemption...and a Cure for Cancer.'' Accessed 16 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; exists for several reasons, including:
*The need, according to Duesberg, of the CDC, the WHO, and other health organizations to justify their existences, resulting in their "manufacturing contagious plagues out of noninfectious medical conditions."&lt;ref&gt;[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. {{ISBN|0-89526-399-8}}] Page 137.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Media sensationalism, with stories that "helped shape the Western impression of an AIDS problem out of control," resulting in high levels of funding.&lt;ref name = "uirhmj"/&gt;
*Willing participation in deception by local doctors who wish to take advantage of this aid money: "African doctors themselves participate in building the myth of the AIDS pandemic."&lt;ref&gt;[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. {{ISBN|0-89526-399-8}}] Pages 290-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Confusion or incompetence on the part of African doctors: "Many common Third World diseases are confused with AIDS even if they are not part of its official definition."&lt;ref&gt;[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. {{ISBN|0-89526-399-8}}] Page 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Duesberg, common diseases are easily misdiagnosed as AIDS in Africa because "the diagnosis of African AIDS is arbitrary" and does not include HIV testing.&lt;ref name="DuesbergJBiosci"/&gt; A definition of AIDS agreed upon in 1985 by the [[World Health Organization]] in [[Bangui]] did not require a positive HIV test, but since 1985, many African countries have added positive HIV tests to the Bangui criteria for AIDS or changed their definitions to match those of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/hiv/strategic/en/use_aids_def.xls] From the [[World Health Organization]] Accessed 1 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons for using more HIV tests despite their expense is that, rather than overestimating AIDS as Duesberg suggests, the Bangui definition alone excluded nearly half of African AIDS patients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diaz T |title=New strategies for HIV surveillance in resource-constrained settings: an overview |journal=AIDS |volume=19 |issue=Suppl2 |pages=S1–S8 |year=2005 |pmid=15930836 |doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000172871.80723.3e |author2=De Cock K |last3=Brown |first3=Tim |last4=Ghys |first4=Peter D |last5=Boerma |first5=J Ties|display-authors=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duesberg notes that diseases associated with AIDS differ between African and Western populations, concluding that the causes of immunodeficiency must be different. [[Tuberculosis]] is much more commonly diagnosed among AIDS patients in Africa than in Western countries, while [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|PCP]] conforms to the opposite pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J | title = Is AIDS in Africa a distinct disease? | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5474 | pages = 2153–5 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10896593 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5474.2153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuberculosis, though, had higher prevalence in Africa than in the West before the spread of HIV.

==Duesberg claims that retroviruses like HIV must be harmless to survive==
Duesberg argues that [[retroviruses]] like HIV must be harmless to survive: they do not kill cells and they do not cause cancer, he maintains. Duesberg writes, "retroviruses do not kill cells because they depend on viable cells for the replication of their RNA from viral DNA integrated into cellular DNA."&lt;ref name="DuesbergJBiosci"/&gt; Duesberg elsewhere states that "the typical virus reproduces by entering a living cell and commandeering the cell's resources in order to make new virus particles, a process that ends with the disintegration of the dead cell."&lt;ref&gt;[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. {{ISBN|0-89526-399-8}}] Page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duesberg also rejects the involvement of retroviruses and other viruses in [[cancer]]. To him, virus-associated cancers are "freak accidents of nature" that do not warrant research programs such as the [[War on Cancer]]. Duesberg rejects a role in cancer for numerous viruses, including [[leukemia]] viruses, [[Epstein-Barr Virus]], [[Human Papilloma Virus]], [[Hepatitis B]], [[Feline Leukemia Virus]], and [[Human T-lymphotropic virus]].&lt;ref name="inventing"&gt;Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. {{ISBN|0-89526-399-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duesberg claims that the supposedly innocuous nature of all retroviruses is supported by what he considers to be their normal mode of proliferation: infection from mother to child ''in utero''. Duesberg does not suggest that HIV is an [[endogenous retrovirus]], a virus integrated into the [[germ line]] and genetically heritable:

{{Quotation|...[a mother] provides her child with a nine-month continuous exposure to her blood and therefore has at least a 50 percent chance of passing HIV to the baby.&lt;ref name="inventing"/&gt;}}

==Scientific response to the Duesberg hypothesis==
The [[scientific consensus|consensus]] in the [[scientific community]] is that the Duesberg hypothesis has been refuted by a large and growing mass of evidence showing that HIV causes AIDS, that the [[viral load|amount of virus in the blood]] correlates with disease progression, that a plausible mechanism for HIV's action has been proposed, and that anti-HIV medication decreases [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[opportunistic infection]] in people with AIDS.&lt;ref name="niaid"/&gt;

In the 9 December 1994 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (Vol. 266, No. 5191),&lt;ref name="phenom" /&gt; Duesberg's methods and claims were evaluated in a group of articles. The authors concluded that
* It is abundantly evident that HIV causes disease and death in [[hemophiliac]]s, a group generally lacking Duesberg's proposed risk factors.&lt;ref name="niaid"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7992044 | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. | year = 1994a | title = Duesberg and critics agree: Hemophilia is the best test | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/cohen/266-5191-1645a.pdf | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5191| pages = 1645–1646 | pmid = 7992044 | bibcode=1994Sci...266.1645C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness of antiretroviral medication===
The vast majority of people with AIDS have never received antiretroviral drugs, including those in developed countries prior to the licensure of AZT ([[zidovudine]]) in 1987, and people in developing countries today where very few individuals have access to these medications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/html/pub/publications/fact-sheets04/fs_treatment_en_pdf.pdf UNAIDS, 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614103019/http://www.unaids.org/html/pub/publications/fact-sheets04/fs_treatment_en_pdf.pdf |date=14 June 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIAID reports that "in the mid-1980s, clinical trials enrolling patients with AIDS found that AZT given as single-drug therapy conferred a modest survival advantage compared [with] placebo. Among HIV-infected patients who had not yet developed AIDS, placebo-controlled trials found that AZT given as single-drug therapy delayed, for a year or two, the onset of AIDS-related illnesses. Significantly, long-term follow-up of these trials did not show a prolonged benefit of AZT, but also did not indicate that the drug increased disease progression or mortality. The lack of excess AIDS cases and death in the AZT arms of these placebo-controlled trials in effect counters the argument that AZT causes AIDS. Subsequent clinical trials found that patients receiving two-drug combinations had up to 50 percent improvements in time to progression to AIDS and in survival when compared with people receiving single-drug therapy. In more recent years, three-drug combination therapies have produced another 50 to 80 percent improvement in progression to AIDS and in survival when compared with two-drug regimens in clinical trials."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hivatis.org/guidelines/adult/AA_040705.pdf HHS, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; "Use of potent anti-HIV combination therapies has contributed to dramatic reductions in the incidence of AIDS and AIDS-related deaths in populations where these drugs are widely available, an effect which clearly would not be seen if antiretroviral drugs caused AIDS."&lt;ref name="niaid"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199803263381301 | last1 = Palella | first1 = FJ Jr | last2 = Delaney | first2 = KM | last3 = Moorman | first3 = AC | last4 = Loveless | first4 = MO | last5 = Fuhrer | first5 = J | last6 = Satten | first6 = GA | last7 = Aschman | first7 = DJ | last8 = Holmberg | first8 = SD. | year = 1998 | title = Declining morbidity and mortality among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection.

===Opponents claim that nearly all HIV-positive people will develop AIDS===
Duesberg claims as support for his idea that many drug-free HIV-positive people have not yet developed AIDS; HIV/AIDS scientists note that many drug-free HIV-positive people have developed AIDS, and that, in the absence of medical treatment or rare genetic factors postulated to delay disease progression, it is very likely that nearly all HIV-positive people will eventually develop AIDS. Scientists also note that HIV-negative drug users do not suffer from immune system collapse.&lt;ref name="drugusenature"/&gt;

The '''European Centre for Minority Issues''' ('''ECMI''') is a [[research institute]] based in [[Flensburg]], [[Germany]], that conducts research into [[Minority group|minority]]-majority relations in [[Europe]]. ECMI is a non-partisan and interdisciplinary institution. It is a non-profit, independent foundation, registered according to German Civil Law.

[[File:ECMI logo 250x69.gif|thumb|ECMI Logo]]

ECMI was established in 1996 by the governments of [[Denmark]], Germany and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/rubrik/3/in+english/|title=About|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre is governed by a board composed of nine members: three from Denmark, three from Germany, one representative from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], one from the [[Council of Europe]] and one from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; The institute's first director was Stefan Troebst, now Professor of East European Cultural Studies at the [[University of Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="Starting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/76/2006/12/07/Starting-ECMI.php|title=Starting ECMI|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is Tove H. Malloy.&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/rubrik/17/ecmi+staff/|title=ECMI staff|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre employs a core staff and also hosts visiting [[fellow]]s and visiting research associates.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;
The Centre organizes its activities around three principal themes. It is concerned with the evaluation and further development of universal, regional, bilateral and national standards that may assist in consolidating democratic governance on the basis of ethnic diversity and human rights. In this context, ECMI is also particularly interested in the emerging convergence of standards between EU members and applicant states. A second area of involvement relates to implementation procedures and mechanisms for these diverse standards and the study of their effectiveness. At times, ECMI has been invited to consider standards implementation and majority-minority relations in particular states in cooperation with the government of that state and local groups.

==Publications==

Over the years,the European Centre for Minority Issues has produced a number of Monographs, Reports, Working Papers and Issue Briefs,as well as the peer reviewed online [[open access journal]], Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues  in Europe (JEMIE), in addition to co-editorship (with [[European_Academy_of_Bozen|EURAC Bozen]]) of the flagship publication European Yearbook of Minority Issues. The goal of this publication effort is to increase the awareness and dissemination of topics on minority issues, as well as to encourage further research in this field.

'''Forum for Democracy''' ({{lang-nl|Forum voor Democratie}}, '''FvD''') is a [[National conservatism|national-conservative]], [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] [[list of political parties in the Netherlands|political party]] in the [[Netherlands]], founded as a [[think tank]] by [[Thierry Baudet]] who has been the party's leader since 22 September 2016.

The party first participated in elections in the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 general election]], winning two seats in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]].

==History==
[[File:Thierry Baudet (2018).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Thierry Baudet]], founder and leader of the party]]
Forum for Democracy was established as a think tank; its main feat was campaigning for the [[Dutch Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement referendum, 2016|2016 Dutch Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement referendum]].&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4520bb4c-07e3-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=14 March 2017|title=Populists seize the moment as Dutch fall out of love with EU|author=Joshua Chaffin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, it converted itself into a political party and announced its intention to take part in the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 Dutch general election]]. In joining the democratic system, they hope to change the system.

In the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 general election]], the FvD ended up with 1.8% of the vote and 2 seats, entering parliament for the first time.

In March 2017 the FvD had approximately 5,000 members. The bulk of the Forum's parliamental candidates did not have prior active experience in other political parties.&lt;ref name=Spectator&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/01/geert-wilders-doesnt-threaten-dutch-liberalism-hes-defending-it/|title=Geert Wilders doesn’t threaten Dutch liberalism: he’s defending it|date=28 January 2017|author=Douglas Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/kandidatenlijst |title=Forum voor Democratie |publisher=Forumvoordemocratie.nl |accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018 the party suffered from internal issues with a number of prominent members leaving the party, because they felt the party had a lack of internal democracy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.parool.nl/binnenland/uittocht-bij-forum-voor-democratie-houdt-aan~a4567887/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dutch municipal elections, 2018|2018 municipal elections]], the FvD won 3 seats at the [[Amsterdam]] city council.

==Ideology==
=== Economy ===
The party is a proponent of the introduction of high tax free bracket for everyone, the abolition of taxes on gifts and inheritance and a radical simplification of tax brackets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/economie|title=Economie|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/belastingen|title=Belastingen|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the party is in favour of promoting environmental sustainability and innovation through tax cuts for [[renewable energy]], the [[sharing economy]] and [[organic agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/duurzaamheid-innovatie|title=Duurzaamheid &amp; innovatie|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as investments in digital infrastructure and reduction of regulation while ensuring privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/internet-privacy|title=Internet|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/privacy|title=Privacy|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is a proponent of drastic changes in elementary and secondary education, focusing on performance evaluations for teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/onderwijs|title=Onderwijs|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They want to expand the armed forces, expanding the [[National Reserve Corps]] and reverting defence budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/defensie|title=Defensie|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the party has promoted plans to privatize the Dutch public broadcasting organisation, the [[Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (organization)|Nederlandse Publieke Omroep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/petities/sanering-npo|title=Sanering Publieke Omroep|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electoral reform ===
[[File: Theo Hiddema (2018).jpg|thumb|[[Theo Hiddema]], speaking to the press]]
One of the major issues the party campaigns against is the perceived existence of a "party cartel", in which the main ruling parties of the country divide power among themselves and conspire towards the same goals, despite claiming to be competitors.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; The party promises [[direct democracy]] through binding [[referendum|referenda]],&lt;ref name=Spectator/&gt; as well as directly elected mayors and a directly elected [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/directe-democratie|title=Directe Democratie|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/kartel-bestrijding|title=Kartelbestrijding|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is also in favour of the government consisting of apolitical experts, and top civil servants having to reapply for their positions when a new cabinet is formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/gekozen-minister-president|title=Gekozen minister-president|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration and EU ===
The party opposes the [[European Union]] and campaigns for a referendum on [[Dutch withdrawal from the European Union|Dutch E.U. membership]]. It also adopts a [[Cultural nationalism|nationalist]] viewpoint in which the Dutch culture should be protected;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-22/the-dutch-election-is-about-more-than-nationalism|title=The Dutch Election Is About More Than Nationalism|date=22 February 2017|author=Leonid Bershidsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; the party is in favor of reinstating border controls and ending what it perceives as mass immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/wet-bnw|title=Wet Bescherming Nederlandse Waarden|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/immigratie-remigratie|title=Immigratie &amp; Remigratie|publisher=Forum voor Democratie|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It campaigns against unchecked immigration, and says it would introduce a "Dutch Values Protection Act" and wants to ban Islamic face veils and other face coverings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/forum-for-democracy-netherlands-eu-referendum-pvv-fvd-mark-rutte-a8217956.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Speight''' (['speːt]; born 1957{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}), occasionally known as '''Ilikini Naitini''', is a [[Fiji]]an businessman. He was the leader of the [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|Fiji coup of 2000]], in which he and an elite unit of Fiji's military detained thirty-six members of parliament and held them hostage from May 19, 2000 to July 13, 2000. He is serving [[life imprisonment]] for his role in the coup.

== Fiji coup of 2000 ==

{{main|2000 Fijian coup d'état}}

On May 19, 2000, a disparate gang led by Speight stormed the [[Parliament of Fiji|parliamentary]] complex and kidnapped [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] and 35 other parliamentarians for the i Taukei (indigenous) rights, including several [[Cabinet of Fiji|cabinet ministers]]. Announcing that he had deposed both the government and the President, Speight swore in serving ruling government member Timoci Silatolu as [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]], and proclaimed [[Jope Seniloli]] president in place of [[Kamisese Mara]]. Seniloli has since been convicted of [[treason]] for aiding and abetting the coup. President Mara tried to resist Speight's takeover, but was abruptly removed himself on 29 May by [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]], the Commander of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]] who subsequently abrogated the constitution, made himself Prime Minister and swore in his own President, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau (Ratu Jope Seniloli's cousin).

The overthrow of the government saw support for Speight's cause as outbreaks of violence occurred in [[Suva]], [[Levuka]], Naitasiri, Tailevu, Ra, Nadi, Yasawa, Serua, Namosi, and on July 7 an army base on [[Vanua Levu]] Island was overrun by his supporters.

Fifteen soldiers and two of their officers defected to the rebels and George Speight built up a strong private army. On June 9, Speight announced that he had abolished Fiji's multi-racial [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]]. Three days later, Speight's car was sprayed with gunfire, but the army denied that soldiers were involved in an operation to kill him. On June 25, four female hostages were released. On July 13, Chaudhry was released following an agreement between the rebels and the military administration of Commodore Bainimarama. Claiming that he had signed the agreement "under duress," Bainimarama promptly rescinded it. On 27 July, Speight was arrested with 369 of his followers and charged with treason.

== Motives for the coup ==

Speight claimed to be a Fijian nationalist and a champion of indigenous rights. He attracted support from elements of the Fijian population who were angered by the results of the 1999 [[Fijian general election, 1999|election]], which had swept away a government dominated by [[Fijians|ethnic Fijians]] and brought to power a [[multiracial]] government led by Mahendra Chaudhry, who became Fiji's first-ever [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] Prime Minister. Hints that the Chaudhry government might institute some form of [[land reform]] also generated considerable resentment among sections of the indigenous population, despite [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|constitutional]] guarantees that ethnic Fijian ownership of 83 percent of the land could not be changed without the support of 9 of the 14 [[Senate of Fiji|senators]] appointed by the [[Great Council of Chiefs]], a wholly indigenous body. The lead-up to the coup had seen politicians and other public figures play upon this resentment and foster public fear that native land might be alienated. Speight thus found a sizeable number of sympathizers when he launched the coup on 19 May.

Speight's partner, [[Torika Rawlinson]], told the student newspaper Wansolwara that the original intention had been to execute members of the deposed government the night before the coup actually took place. She denied others' reports that Indo-Fijian businessmen had been involved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109051946/http://www.usp.ac.fj/journ/docs/wansol/7102/7102torika.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2001, democracy was restored and in [[Fijian general election, 2001|the subsequent election]] Speight was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] using the name of Ilikimi Naitini. He was elected as a Representative for the [[Tailevu North (Fijian Communal Constituency, Fiji)|Tailevu North Fijian Communal]] constituency as a candidate of the [[Conservative Alliance-Matanitu Vanua|Conservative Alliance Matanitu Vanua Party]] despite his confinement on Nukulau Island. Speight was prevented by the speaker of the Fiji parliament, [[Epeli Nailatikau]], from taking up his seat in Parliament. That December he was expelled from Parliament for non-attendance.

==Sentence ==
On 18 February 2002, Speight was sentenced to death after pleading guilty to a charge of [[treason]]. However, the government of the Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]] had abolished the death sentence in the House of Representatives on the day that Speight was sentenced. [[President of Fiji|President]] [[Josefa Iloilo]], who had replaced Mara following the coup, followed the advice of the Prime Minister and commuted Speight's sentence to [[life imprisonment]]. Speight started serving his sentence on [[Nukulau|Nukulau Island]] where he had been living in exile. Following the decision of the military government to close the Nukulau facility, Speight was transferred on 20 December 2006. He is currently serving his sentence at the Naboro Maximum Security Prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=53891 | title=Speight off Nukulau, now in Naboro | date=21 December 2006 | agency=[[The Fiji Times]] | accessdate=6 August 2013 | location=Suva, Fiji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purported change of heart ==
On 15 September 2004, a source close to the Fijian government revealed that Speight had renewed his faith in [[Christianity]] during his imprisonment. {{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} According to the source, Speight's faith had led to a change of heart towards the Indo-Fijian community, and that he wished to participate in the upcoming [[Fiji Week, 2004|Fiji Week]], a series of prayer meetings and multicultural programmes aimed at reconciling Fiji's ethnic communities, planned for the week of 4 October through 11 October. "He now feels inspired by the word of God and would like to take part in the week of reconciliation," the source told the [[Australian Associated Press]].{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} This request for permission to leave his island prison to take part in the observances was refused, however. A spokesman for deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry said that he would be prepared to meet with Speight in principle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaudhry calls on Speight to come clean|url=http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2004/October/10-12-06.htm|website=Pacific Islands Report|publisher=Fiji Sun|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash;provided that he reveal the identities of the persons who had planned and financed the coup.

The [[Fiji Village]] news service reported on 29 January 2006 that Speight and his associates had indicated his willingness to face the government's proposed [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]] and reveal what they knew about the planning, financing, and execution of the coup. This was an apparent reversal of his earlier vow to remain silent.

''Fiji Live'' quoted Speight as alleging that the real reason for the strident opposition of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military]] to the legislation establishing the proposed Commission was that their and, in particular, Bainimarama's own role in the coup plot would be in danger of being revealed. The latest information revealed by some of the CRW troops arrested with Speight suggest that Bainimarama may have been the real coup leader after giving the go-ahead at the last security council meeting on Friday May 12, 2000 at Valelevu. Bainimara's subsequent departure for Norway ensured that he was free from coup conspiracy. On his return not long after the takeover he sent a delegation made up of military spokesmen Colonel Filipo Tarakinikini, Colonel [[Etueni Caucau]] and acting Commander Colonel Tuatoko to express his full support for Speight and ex SAS Warrant Officer, Ilisoni Ligairi. Both men were unaware of the pre-coup arrangements set up by Bainimarama. A dispute arose, though, as to who should be in the caretaker government as Bainimarama expected to run the country with a few of his close advisers such as Colonel Jerry Waqanisau, Colonel Kacisolomoni, Colonel Paul Manueli and others. This conflict led to a 56-day rule by Bainimarama after which he was forced to step down by Speight and to return the office of the Presidency to civilian rule. Inside sources allege that Bainimarama manipulated his oblivious officers to finally achieve his pre-May 19, 2000 objectives of ruling the country. {{fact|date=August 2018}}

The [[University of the South Pacific]] journalism school in [[Fiji]] provided coverage of the upheaval on its website [[Pacific Journalism Online]] and newspaper [[Wansolwara]] until its website was temporarily shut down on May 29 during the martial law period. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiapac.org.fj/PJR/issues/next/2001frontline.html][https://web.archive.org/web/20060503012846/http://journalism.uts.edu.au/archive/fiji_coup/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The students' coverage archive is at the [[University of Technology, Sydney]], Australia. &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060425084156/http://journalism.uts.edu.au/archive/coup.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
George Speight hails from [[Naivicula]], about ten kilometers from [[Korovou]] in [[Tailevu Province]]. He is the son of [[Sam Speight]] (sometimes known as Savenaca Tokainavo), a prosperous farmer of [[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]] and European descent. The elder Speight is a war veteran who served in the successful Malayan campaign.{{clarify|date=August 2018}} He subsequently served as a backbencher in Rabuka's governments throughout the 1990s. By the time his son attempted his coup in 2000, however, Sam Speight was an opposition member of [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], his [[Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei]] having lost power to the Indo-Fijian-led [[Fiji Labour Party|Labour Party]] of [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] in the [[Fijian general election, 1999|elections]] of 1999.

Speight has a son, Ely (born 1998) with Torika Rawlinson.

Speight graduated with [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] degrees in [[Business]] from [[Michigan]]'s [[Andrews University]]. He subsequently settled in [[Australia]], where he worked as a sales representative for the Computer Orchard, a Brisbane-based Apple [[Computer]] dealer, and later as a branch manager for Metway Bank before returning to Fiji in 1996. He then became chairman of [[Fiji Pine, Ltd.]] and of [[Fiji Hardwood Corporation, Ltd.]]. He also became a manager of [[Heath Fiji, Ltd.]] but resigned due to shareholder personality conflicts.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with deterministic [[Ranked_voting|ordinal electoral system]]s that choose a single winner. It states that for every voting rule, one of the following three things must hold:

# The rule is dictatorial, i.e. there exists a distinguished voter who can choose the winner; or
# The rule limits the possible outcomes to two alternatives only; or
# The rule is susceptible to [[tactical voting]]: in certain conditions some voter's sincere ballot may not defend their opinion best.

While the scope of this theorem is limited to ordinal voting, [[Gibbard's theorem]] is more general, in that it deals with processes of collective decision that may not be ordinal: for example, voting systems where voters assign grades to candidates. [[Gibbard's 1978 theorem]] and [[Hylland's theorem]] are even more general and extend these results to non-deterministic processes, i.e. where the outcome may not only depend on the voters' actions but may also involve a part of chance.

== Informal description ==
Consider some voters named &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;, who wish to select an option among four candidates named &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that they use the [[Borda count]]: each voter communicates her preference order over the candidates. For each ballot, 3 points are assigned to the top candidate, 2 points to the second candidate, 1 point to the third one and no point to the last one. Once all ballots have been counted, the candidate with most points is declared the winner.

Assume that preferences are as follows.&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{array}{c|c|c}
a &amp; c &amp; c \\
b &amp; b &amp; b \\
c &amp; d &amp; d \\
d &amp; a &amp; a
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;This notation means that voter &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; prefers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;; voters &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; both prefer &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. If the voters cast sincere ballots, then the scores are: &lt;math&gt;(a : 3, b : 6, c : 7, d : 2)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, candidate &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; get elected, with 7 points.

But voter &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; can figure out that another ballot defend her opinions better. Assume that she modifies her ballot, in order to produce the following situation.&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{array}{c|c|c}
b &amp; c &amp; c \\
a &amp; b &amp; b \\
d &amp; d &amp; d \\
c &amp; a &amp; a
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;Voter &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; has strategically upgraded candidate &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and downgraded candidate &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Now, the scores are: &lt;math&gt;(a : 2, b : 7, c : 6, d : 3)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is elected. Voter &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied of her ballot modification, because she prefers the outcome &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, which is the outcome she would obtain if she voted sincerely.

We say that the Borda count is ''manipulable'': there exists situations where a sincere ballot does not defend a voter's preferences best.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem states that a voting rule must be manipulable, except possibly in two cases: if there is a distinguished voter who has a dictatorial power, or if the rule limits the possible outcomes to two options only.

== Formal statement ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of ''alternatives'' (which is assumed finite), also called ''candidates'', even if they are not necessarily persons: they can also be several possible decisions about a given issue. We denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = \{1, \ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt; the set of ''voters''. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of [[Weak ordering|strict weak orders]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;: an element of this set can represent the preferences of a voter. A ''voting rule'' is a function &lt;math&gt;f: \mathcal{P}^n \to \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Its input is a profile of preferences &lt;math&gt;(P_1, \ldots, P_n) \in \mathcal{P}^n&lt;/math&gt; and it yields the identity of the winning candidate.

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''manipulable'' if and only if there exists a profile &lt;math&gt;(P_1, \ldots, P_n) \in \mathcal{P}^n&lt;/math&gt; where some voter &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, by replacing her ballot &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; with another ballot &lt;math&gt;P_i'&lt;/math&gt;, can get an outcome that she prefers (in the sense of &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;).

We denote by &lt;math&gt;f(\mathcal{P}^n)&lt;/math&gt; the image of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the set of ''possible outcomes'' for the election. For example, we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has at least three possible outcomes if and only if the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;f(\mathcal{P}^n)&lt;/math&gt; is 3 or more.

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''dictatorial'' if and only if there exists a voter &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; who is a ''dictator'', in the sense that the winning alternative is always her most-liked one among the possible outcomes ''regardless of the preferences of other voters''. If the dictator has several ex-aequo most-liked alternatives among the possible outcomes, then the winning alternative is simply one of them.

{{Math theorem
| math_statement = If a voting rule has at least 3 possible outcomes and if it is non-manipulable, then it is dictatorial.
| name = Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem
}}

== Examples ==

=== Serial dictatorship ===
The ''serial dictatorship'' is defined as follows. If voter 1 has a unique most-liked candidate, then this candidate is elected. Otherwise, possible outcomes are restricted to her ex-aequo most-liked candidates, whereas the other candidates are eliminated. Then voter 2's ballot is examined: if she has a unique best-liked candidate among the non-eliminated ones, then this candidate is elected. Otherwise, the list of possible outcomes is reduced again, etc. If there is still several non-eliminated candidates after all ballots have been examined, then an arbitrary tie-breaking rule is used.

This voting rule is not manipulable: a voter is always better off communicating her sincere preferences. It is also dictatorial, and its dictator is voter 1: the winning alternative is always her most-liked one or, if she likes several alternatives best, it is chosen among them.

=== Simple majority vote ===
If there are only 2 possible outcomes, a voting rule may be non-manipulable without being dictatorial. For example, it is the case of the simple majority vote: each voter assigns 1 point to her top alternative and 0 to the other, and the alternative with most points is declared the winner. This voting rule is not manipulable because a voter is always better off communicating her sincere preferences; and it is clearly not dictatorial. Many other rules are neither manipulable nor dictatorial: for example, assume that the alternative &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; wins if it gets two thirds of the votes, and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; wins otherwise.

=== A game form showing that the converse does not hold ===
Consider the following rule. All candidates are eliminated, except the candidate or candidates that are placed in top position in voter 1's ballot. Then, among the non-eliminated candidates, one is elected using the [[Borda count]]. This whole process is dictatorial, by definition. However, it is manipulable, for the same reasons as the usual Borda count. Thus, the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is an implication and not an equivalence.

== Corollary ==
We now consider the case where by assumption, a voter cannot be indifferent between two candidates. We denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; the set of [[Total order|strict total orders]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; and we define a ''strict voting rule'' as a function &lt;math&gt;f: \mathcal{L}^n \to \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. The definitions of ''possible outcomes'', ''manipulable'', ''dictatorial'' have natural adaptations to this framework.

For a strict voting rule, the converse of the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is true. Indeed, a strict voting rule is dictatorial if and only if it always selects the most-liked candidate of the dictator among the possible outcomes; in particular, it does not depend on the other voters' ballots. As a consequence, it is not manipulable: the dictator is perfectly defended by her sincere ballot, and the other voters have no impact on the outcome, hence they have no incentive to deviate from sincere voting. Thus, we obtain the following equivalence.
{{Math theorem
| math_statement = If a strict voting rule has at least 3 possible outcomes, it is non-manipulable if and only if it is dictatorial.
}}
In the theorem, as well as in the corollary, it is not needed to assume that any alternative can be elected. It is only assumed that at least three of them can win, i.e. are ''possible outcomes'' of the voting rule. It is possible that some other alternatives can be elected in no circumstances: the theorem and the corollary still apply. However, the corollary is sometimes presented under a less general form:&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Tjark|last1=Weber|title=Alternatives vs. Outcomes: A Note on the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem|journal=Technical report (University Library of Munich)|year=2009|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/pramprapa/17836.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of assuming that the rule has at least three possible outcomes, it is sometimes assumed that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; contains at least three elements and that the voting rule is ''onto'', i.e. every alternative is a possible outcome.&lt;ref name="reny"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Philip J.|last1=Reny|title=Arrow's Theorem and the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem: A Unified Approach|journal=Economics Letters|volume=70|issue=1|year=2001|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.130.1704&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|pages=99–105|doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(00)00332-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of being onto is sometimes even replaced with the assumption that the rule is ''unanimous'', in the sense that if all voters prefer the same candidate, then she must be elected.&lt;ref name="benoit"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jean-Pierre|last1=Benoît|title=The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem: A Simple Proof|journal=Economics Letters|volume=69|issue=3|date=2000|issn=0165-1765|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176500003128|pages=319–322|doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(00)00312-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sen"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Arunava|last1=Sen|title=Another Direct Proof of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem|journal=Economics Letters|volume=70|issue=3|date=2001|issn=0165-1765|url=http://econdse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/arunavags.pdf|pages=381–385|doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(00)00362-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sketch of proof ==
The Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem can be proved based on [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]], which deals with '''social ranking functions''', i.e. voting systems designed to yield a complete preference order of the candidates, rather than simply choosing a winner. We give a sketch of proof in the simplified case where the voting rule &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be unanimous. It is possible to build a social ranking function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rank}&lt;/math&gt;, as follows: in order to decide whether &lt;math&gt;a\prec b&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rank}&lt;/math&gt; function creates new preferences in which &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are moved to the top of all voters' preferences. Then, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rank}&lt;/math&gt; examines whether &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; chooses &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. It is possible to prove that, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is non-manipulable and non-dictatorial, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rank}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the properties: unanimity, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and it is not a dictatorship. [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] says that, when there are three or more alternatives, such a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rank}&lt;/math&gt; function cannot exist. Hence, such an &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; function also cannot exist.&lt;ref name="agt"&gt;{{Cite Algorithmic Game Theory 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|214–215}}

==History==
The strategic aspect of voting is already noticed in 1876 by Charles Dodgson, a pioneer in social choice theory, also known as [[Lewis Carroll]]. His quote (about a particular voting system) was made famous by [[Duncan Black]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The theory of committees and elections|last=Black|first=Duncan|publisher=University Press|year=1958|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This principle of voting makes an election more of a game of skill than a real test of the wishes of the electors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the 1950s, [[Robin Farquharson]] published influential articles on voting theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farquharson|first=Robin|date=February 1956|title=Straightforwardness in voting procedures|journal=Oxford Economic Papers, New Series|volume=8|issue=1|pages=80–89|jstor=2662065|authorlink=Robin Farquharson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article with [[Michael Dummett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Farquharson|first2=Robin|date=January 1961|title=Stability in voting|journal=Econometrica|volume=29|issue=1|pages=33–43|doi=10.2307/1907685|jstor=1907685|first1=Michael|last1=Dummett}}&lt;/ref&gt; he conjectures that deterministic voting rules with at least three issues face endemic [[tactical voting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dummett|first=Michael|year=2005|title=The work and life of Robin Farquharson|journal=Social Choice and Welfare|volume=25|issue=2|pages=475–483|doi=10.1007/s00355-005-0014-x|jstor=41106711}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Farquarson-Dummett conjecture is proven independently by [[Allan Gibbard]] and [[Mark Satterthwaite]]. In a 1973 article, Gibbard exploits [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] to prove the [[Gibbard's theorem|theorem]] that now bears his name, and he then deduces the present result, which is an immediate consequence of it.&lt;ref name="gibbard"/&gt; Independently, Satterthwaite proves the same result in his PhD dissertation in 1973, then publishes it in a 1975 article.&lt;ref name="satterthwaite"/&gt; His proof is also based on [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]], but he doesn't expose the more general version given by [[Gibbard's theorem]].

[[Gibbard's theorem]] deals with processes of collective choice that may not be ordinal, i.e. where a voter's action may not consist in communicating a preference order over the candidates. [[Gibbard's 1978 theorem]] and [[Hylland's theorem]] extend these results to non-deterministic mechanisms, i.e. where the outcome may not only depend on the ballots but may also involve a part of chance.

The [[Duggan–Schwartz theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=John|last1=Duggan|last2=Schwartz|first2=Thomas|date=2000|title=Strategic manipulability without resoluteness or shared beliefs: Gibbard-Satterthwaite generalized|doi=10.1007/PL00007177|journal=Social Choice and Welfare|volume=17|issue=1|pages=85–93|issn=0176-1714|jstor=41106341}}&lt;/ref&gt; extend this result in another direction, by dealing with deterministic voting rules that choose a nonempty subset of the candidates rather than a single winner.

== Posterity ==
The Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is generally presented as a result belonging to the field of [[social choice theory]], and applying to voting systems, but it can also be seen as the seminal result of [[mechanism design]], which deals with conceiving rules to make collective decisions, possibly in processes that involve a monetary transfer. [[Noam Nisan]] describes this relation:&lt;ref name="agt" /&gt;{{rp|215}}&lt;blockquote&gt;The GS theorem seems to quash any hope of designing incentive-compatible social-choice functions. The whole field of Mechanism Design attempts escaping from this impossibility result using various modifications in the model.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The main idea of these "escape routes" is that they deal only with restricted classes of preferences, in contrast to the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem, which deals with arbitrary preferences. For example, in this discipline, it is frequently assumed that agents have [[Quasilinear utility|quasi-linear]] preferences, which means that their [[Utility|utility function]] depends linearly on money. In that case, monetary transfers can be used to induce them to act truthfully. This is the idea behind the successful [[Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction]].

A '''grand duchy''' is a [[sovereign state|country]] or territory whose official [[head of state]] or ruler is a [[monarch]] bearing the title of [[grand duke]] or [[grand duchess]]. Relatively rare until the abolition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, the term was often used in the official name of countries smaller than most continental kingdoms of modern Europe (e.g., Denmark, Spain, United Kingdom) yet larger than most of the sovereign [[duchy|duchies]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Italy or Scandinavia (e.g. [[Duchy of Anhalt|Anhalt]], [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]]). During the 19th century there were as many as 14 grand duchies in Europe at once (a few of which were first created as [[exclave]]s of the [[Napoleonic empire]] but later re-created, usually with different borders, under another dynasty). Some of these were sovereign and nominally independent ([[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[Hesse and by Rhine]], [[Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], [[Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]], [[Saxe-Weimar]] and [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]]), some sovereign but held in [[personal union]] with larger realms by a monarch whose grand-dukedom was borne as a [[subsidiary title]] (Finland, Luxembourg, Transylvania), some of which were [[client state]]s of a more powerful realm ([[Grand Duchy of Berg|Cleves and Berg]]), and some whose territorial boundaries were nominal and the position purely titular ([[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]]).

In the 21st century, only [[Luxembourg]] remains a grand duchy.

==Luxembourg==
The only grand duchy still extant is [[Luxembourg]]. It regained its independence from [[Napoleon]]ic France and became a sovereign grand duchy in 1815 by decision of the [[Congress of Vienna]] which dealt with the political aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

In order to act as a sufficient counterbalance to France, the Congress decided to grant the dignity of grand duke of Luxembourg to the monarch of the newly created [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] which comprised present-day [[Netherlands]] and Belgium. Luxembourg remained in [[personal union]] with the crown of the Netherlands until 1890 when [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]], King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxembourg, died without leaving a male heir. He was succeeded on the Dutch throne by his daughter [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]] who could not become Grand Duchess of Luxembourg under the semi-[[Salic]] law established by the [[Congress of Vienna]], which allocated the grand ducal throne to any branch of the [[House of Nassau]] in which there were still male [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]] once males died out in other branches. As a consequence, William III was succeeded as grand duke by a distant male cousin, [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] from the elder branch of [[Nassau-Weilburg]] (at present ''Luxembourg-Nassau''). The current monarch is  [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] since 2000.

==Grand duchies of the past==
The contemporary independent republics of Finland and Lithuania have been grand duchies during certain eras of their history.

The same is true for the core state of what would ultimately become the Russian Empire: the [[Muscovy (Grand Duchy)|grand duchy of Muscovy]].

[[File:Grand Duchy of Tuscany (Magnus Ducatus Etruriae) in circa 1627.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] (1569–1860, part of Italy afterwards)]]

==Origin==
The term "grand duchy" is of relatively late invention, used at first in Western Europe in 1569 in the case of Tuscany, to denote either territories of a particularly mighty duke or territories of significant importance in political, economical or military matters without being of sufficient size or importance to be recognized internationally as a kingdom.

The number of duchies had inflated towards the end of the [[Middle Ages]] to an extent that included middle-sized towns or relatively small [[fief]]s, as compared to the national, pre-medieval tribal provinces. As a consequence, a new title was needed to make the difference between important and unimportant regional powers: the title grand duke was born.

One of the first examples was the unofficial use of the title for the dukes of Burgundy who almost succeeded in forming a new kingdom in the historic area called ''[[Lotharingia]]'', composed of modern-day eastern France (Burgundy, Franche-Comté, Alsatia, Lorraine, Champagne) as well as most of current Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (Benelux). The first monarchy ever officially titled a "grand duchy" was the [[Medici]] sovereignty over [[Tuscany]] under suzerainty of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, the first rulers receiving the title in 1569. Tuscany remained a grand duchy until 1860, when it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] which succeeded in establishing a united [[Kingdom of Italy]].

The [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] had an elective monarch since 1569 and came under the prolonged dominance of the [[Kingdom of Poland|Polish crown]], until both monarchies were eradicated in 1795 by the combined intervention of Russia, Prussia and Austria.

In the early nineteenth century, Napoléon I occasionally used the title "grand duchy" for several French [[satellite state]]s given to his relatives or generals. Other allies abandoned the orbit of the Holy Roman Empire to join Napoleon's nominally independent [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. The elevation of these [[vassal]]s to the title of grand duke was usually accompanied by an expansion of their realms with additional territory gathered at the expense of  subdued powers such as [[Prussia]]. Though Napoleon was defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and most of his newly created [[satellite state]]s abolished, the Congress of Vienna restored some of the previous sovereign duchies and principalities, while recognizing others as grand duchies. As a result, the 19th century saw the creation of a new group of grand duchies in central Europe, such as the grand duchies of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] and [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]].

Historically, in Europe a sovereign grand duke was one of the highest ranks among hereditary rulers after [[emperor]] and [[king]], and was equal to that of [[prince-elector]]; ranking as royalty, i.e., European rulers and, in Germany, the [[reign]]ing nobility (''[[German nobility#Hochadel|Hochadel]]''). The correct form of address (also for the [[heir apparent]] and his wife) is [[Royal Highness]] (HRH).

The title of grand duke borne under the [[Russian Empire]] by children and grandchildren of its rulers was a non-sovereign honorific, unrelated to any grand duchy, to which was attached the style of [[Imperial Highness]] (HIH). Ranking, internationally, no higher than the members of other reigning dynasties whose head held the title of emperor, the usage was an historical anomaly, persisting from the elevation of the [[Grand Duchy of Muscovy]] to the [[tsar]]dom and, later, empire of All Russia, until its collapse in 1917.

==Associated titles==
In several [[Balto-Slavic languages]] (such as Russian, Lithuanian, for example), the term often translated in English as "grand duke" is literally ''grand prince''. In some western European languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, etc.), the term "grand prince" was rare or non-existent, used to refer to some rulers of Russia, Transylvania or Tuscany prior to the 19th century. In German and Scandinavian languages, both titles co-exist: ''{{lang|de|Großherzog}}'' ("grand duke") and ''{{lang|de|Großfürst}}'' ("grand prince"), and are used to distinguish, respectively, a ruling grand duke and a [[cadet (genealogy)|cadet]] of the Russian imperial family.

Within Germany, use of the title expanded after 1815, but ''grand duke'' translates two different titles of German provenance. The German language has two distinct words for what is called a ''prince'' in English: one is used to refer to a member of the dynasty of a monarch (''{{lang|de|[[Prince|Prinz]]}}''), and the other is normally borne by a modern sovereign hereditary ruler of the lowest rank (''{{lang|de|[[Fürst]]}}''). Emerging from the [[Middle Ages]], the Grand Dukes of Lithuania and of [[Rurik dynasty|historic Russian states]], as well as other Eastern European princes and later Russian dynasts, were referred to by the title {{lang|ru|Великий Князь}} (''{{transl|ru|[[Knyaz|Veliky Knyaz]]}}'', {{lang-de|Großfürst}}), whose literal English translation is "grand prince" rather than "grand duke". Although ''grand prince'' is found in historical references, since the reign of [[Catherine the Great]], the Russian ''{{transl|ru|Veliky Knyaz}}'' has usually been translated into English as "grand duke". Since the 18th century it has been used to refer to [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] of the imperial [[House of Romanov]] who were children or [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] grandchildren of a Russian emperor. More remote descendants of emperors were titled "prince" ({{lang|ru|князь}}, ''{{transl|ru|knyaz}}'').

The title ''{{lang|la|Magnus Dux}}'' or "grand duke" ({{lang-lt|Didysis kunigaikštis}}) is said to have been used by the rulers of [[Lithuania]], and after rulers from the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] became Kings of [[Poland]], it was later found among the titles used by the kings of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Polish kings of the Swedish [[House of Vasa]] also used this grand-princely title for their non-Polish territories.
 
Junior members of the dynasties of historical grand duchies in Germany sometimes bore the style of [[Highness]], sometimes that of [[Grand Ducal Highness]], and continued to be accorded those styles [[abolition of monarchy|post-monarchy]] by courtesy in such reference works as the ''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'' and [[Burke's Peerage]].

==List==
Between the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and [[World War I]] there were several grand duchies in Europe. Some were created in the [[Napoleonic]] era and, others were recognized by the [[Congress of Vienna]] and were founding members of the [[German Confederation]].

* [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] (1569–1860, absorbed into Italy afterwards)
* [[Grand Duchy of Berg]] (1806–1813, absorbed into [[Prussia]] afterwards)
* [[Grand Duchy of Würzburg]] (1806–1814, absorbed into [[Bavaria]] afterwards)
* [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] (1806–1918, joined the [[German Empire]] in 1871)
* [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] (1806–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* Grand Duchy of [[Fulda#18th and 19th centuries|Fulda]] (1816–1866) part of the [[Electorate of Hesse]], annexed by Prussia 1866)
* [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt]] (1810–1813, part of several German states afterwards)
* [[Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine]] (1815–1822 as part of Prussia)
* [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (from 1815 in personal union with the Netherlands until 1890. Extant independently)
* [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] (1815–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] (1815–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] (1815–1848 as part of Prussia, ''{{lang|de|Großherzogtum Posen}}'')
* [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] (1815–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg]] (1829–1918, joined the [[German Empire]] in 1871)
* [[Grand Duchy of Cracow]] (1846–1918 in personal union with Austria, part of Poland, ''{{lang|de|Großherzogtum Krakau}}'')

The term "grand duchy" is often, but incorrectly, used in reference to [[Warsaw]] between 1807 and 1813, which was in fact the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].

Other jurisdictions often referred to historically as grand duchies were, properly, [[grand principality|grand principalities]]:

* [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Didžioji Kunigaikštystė, Ruthenian: Великое князство Литовське)
* [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] (Russian: {{lang|ru|Великое Княжество Московское}})
* [[Kievan Rus'|Grand Duchy of Kiev]] (Ruthenian: Вели́ке Кня́зівство Київське)
* [[Grand Duchy of Ryazan]] (Russian: {{lang|ru|Великое Княжество Рязанское}})
* [[Grand Duchy of Rus]] (Ruthenian: Велике Князівство Руське)
* [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] (Russian: {{lang|ru|Великое Княжество Финляндское}}, Finnish: ''{{lang|fi|Suomen suuriruhtinaskunta}}'', Swedish: ''{{lang|sv|Storfurstendömet Finland}}''; 1809–1917 in personal union with Russia. Republic since 1917)

==Metonymy==
In [[Belgium]], ''Grand-Duché'' (French for "grand duchy") is often used as a [[metonymy|metonym]] to refer to the neighbouring country, the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]]. This practice helps to avoid confusion with the adjacent [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Belgian Province of Luxembourg]], i.e. the [[Walloons|Walloon]]-speaking part of the portion of Luxembourg which was annexed by Belgium in 1839.

{{Politics of Syrian Opposition}}

The '''High Negotiations Committee (HNC)''' is an [[umbrella body]] which was created to represent the [[Syrian opposition]] in the planned [[Geneva peace talks on Syria (2016)|Geneva peace talks in 2016]].&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/27/russia-claims-peace-talks-syrian-rebels-assad-regime-opposition/|title=Russia claims peace talks between Syrian rebels and Assad regime - as the opposition denies all knowledge|date=27 December 2016|accessdate=30 December 2016|publisher=''The Telegraph''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Riyad Farid Hijab]], who was [[Prime Minister of Syria]] from June to August 2012. It is considered to be Syria's main or broadest&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt; opposition bloc.&lt;ref name="alj"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/syria-war-hnc-unveils-road-map-transition-160907140127669.html|title=Syria's war: HNC unveils road map for transition|date=7 September 2016|accessdate=30 December 2016|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}
The HNC was founded in December 2015 at a conference held in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syria-peace-talks-kick-key-opposition-figures-wavering-1843156957|title=Syria peace talks to kick off but key opposition figures wavering|date=29 January 2016|accessdate=30 December 2016|publisher=Middle East Eye}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was attended by around 100 delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/62239?lang=en|title=Riyadh, Rumeilan, and Damascus: All You Need to Know About Syria’s Opposition Conferences|last=Lund|first=Aron|date=9 December 2015|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the conference, a joint statement was issued to confirm the formation of "a High Negotiations Committee for the Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces (HNC), with its headquarters in Riyadh, to undertake the tasks of choosing a negotiating delegation and to act reference point for negotiators with the representatives of the Syrian regime on behalf of the participants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/syria/events/article/final-statement-of-the-conference-of-syrian-revolution-and-opposition-forces|title=Final Statement of the Conference of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces Riyadh (December 10, 2015)|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's chief negotiator, Mohammed Alloush, a member of [[Jaish al-Islam]], resigned from the HNC in May 2016 because of the lack of progress in the Syrian peace process. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/30/chief-syrian-rebel-negotiator-quits-in-anger-at-lack-of-progress/|title=Chief Syrian rebel negotiator quits in anger at lack of progress towards peace|date=30 May 2016|accessdate=30 December 2016|publisher=''The Telegraph''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the HNC set out a detailed transition plan for Syria, committing the country to democratic and [[religious pluralism]]. The 25-page document was launched in London&lt;ref name="alj" /&gt; and was welcomed by the [[United Kingdom]]'s government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/syrian-opposition-coalition-to-announce-democratic-transition-plan|title=Syrian opposition coalition to announce democratic transition plan|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=7 September 2016|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the HNC announced that it will support the [[Syrian peace process#January 2017 "Astana Process" talks|Syrian peace talks in Astana]], which began on 23 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/syria-negotiations-committee-backs-astana-peace-talks-170114172416608.html|title=Syria's main opposition bloc backs Astana peace talks|work=Al-Jazeera|date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2017, the HNC chief coordinator Riyad Farid Hijab rejected a statement by [[Staffan de Mistura]] that the latter will select delegates for the Syrian opposition in [[Geneva]]. He also objected to the participation [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]] (PYD) in the Geneva conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/020220171|title=Syria’s main opposition says PYD should not be at Geneva talks|work=Rudaw|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HNC, led by [[Naser al-Hariri]], participated in the [[Geneva peace talks on Syria (2017)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/syria-talks-geneva-170223213801586.html|title=Syria talks hit snag before opening ceremony in Geneva|work=Al-Jazeera|author=Dylan Collins|date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}
The HNC has faced criticism from Russia because it includes groups like [[Ahrar ash-Sham|Ahrar al-Sham]] and [[Jaysh al-Islam]].&lt;ref name="Arabiya12Dec15"&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/2015/12/12/Saudi-hails-Syrian-opposition-meeting-breakthrough-.html 'Saudi hails Syrian opposition meet ‘breakthrough’']. ''Al Arabiya News'', 12 December 2015. Retrieved 27 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Its transition plan in September 2016 was also criticized by the opposition [[Kurdish National Council]] and the [[Assyrian Democratic Organization]] due to it not addressing minority [[ethnic groups in Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/120920162|title=Kurds, Assyrians join forces to protect minority rights in Syrian peace talks|work=Rudaw|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurdish National Council withdrew from the HNC on 29 March 2017 in protest to the latter's opposition to [[federalism]] and [[human rights in Syria|human rights]] for [[Kurds in Syria]].&lt;ref name=komnews&gt;{{cite web|url=https://komnews.com/syrian-kurdish-knc-withdraws-geneva-talks-protest-opposition/|title=Syrian Kurdish KNC withdraws from Geneva talks in protest at opposition|work=Kom News|date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"i sing of Olaf"''' (sometimes referred to as '''"i sing of Olaf glad and big"''') is a poem by [[e.e. cummings]]. It first appeared in cummings' 1931 collection ''ViVa''. It depicts the life of Olaf, a [[conscientious objector]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] during the [[First World War]] who is [[torture]]d by the [[United States Army]] but nonetheless "will not kiss your fucking flag", and subsequently dies in prison.

==History==

The poem is based on the true story of a conscientious objector who cummings briefly knew while stationed at [[Camp Devens]] in 1918.&lt;ref name=Tramonta&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=noCrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=cummings+%22camp+devens%22+%22glad+and+big%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zs-xNDgcfA&amp;sig=I2AbL3D7kU_I5xZwa_wjRYewbUs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzlpuT95zdAhVGXK0KHdxxBeMQ6AEwBHoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cummings%20%22camp%20devens%22%20%22glad%20and%20big%22&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century], page 164-165, by Catherine Tramonta, edited by Eric L. Haralson; published 2014 by [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Critics have noted the similarity of the opening stanza to that of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', underlining the contrast between Olaf (whose heroic values are based in peace) and [[Achilles]] (whose heroic values were based in war).&lt;ref name=Achilles&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=dv1CjIIRWd0C&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=%22i+sing+of+olaf%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1qkOKo72yL&amp;sig=kZDvK97E43c7Gz13ccuT7gdUSV4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBnKPVtOTNAhUCbD4KHc7tAJYQ6AEIvAEwGw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22i%20sing%20of%20olaf%22&amp;f=false CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF "i sing of Olaf glad and big"], in "Bloom's Major Poets: E. E. Cummings", edited by [[Harold Bloom]], published 2009 by [[Infobase Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I don't know actually *who* it was who said this, since the book didn't credit it; I'm *guessing* it was Harold Bloom himself, but I honestly don't know. Anyone who has access to the actual text, as opposed to books.google, can add more info!--&gt;

==Censorship==

Although the poem's original publication contained the word "[[fuck]]ing", [[anthology|anthologies]] typically [[bowdlerism|bowdlerized]] this to "f.ing";&lt;ref name=Frieze&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=v4e-BBNl-kAC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=%22kiss+your+f.ing+flag%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d-o0qcEOch&amp;sig=i7lXnj2_z9PoemJV5g356-HGw_Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEsbaK6-bNAhXC64MKHf0GAmQQ6AEIczAW#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kiss%20your%20f.ing%20flag%22&amp;f=false A Frieze for a Temple of Love], by [[Edward Field (poet)|Edward Field]], published 1998 by [[David R. Godine, Publisher]]&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, Olaf's statement that "there is some shit i will not eat" is typically rendered as "there is some s. i will not eat".&lt;ref name=CSL&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wpkDRPueLiMC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;lpg=PR14&amp;dq=%22there+is+some+s.+i+will+not+eat%22+censorship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kf6EogFcWg&amp;sig=QPNnVhb00ppGtCfSgOCf6x5Nf40&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVpaG48ZzdAhVILKwKHYOSBDgQ6AEwAHoECBUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22there%20is%20some%20s.%20i%20will%20not%20eat%22%20censorship&amp;f=false E.

==Homages==

"i sing of Olaf" was the inspiration for [[Marco Stroppa]]'s 2005 piece "I will not kiss your fucking flag".&lt;ref name=SeenAndHeard&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/SandH/2005/Jan-Jun05/witten.htm Seen and Heard Festival Report: Wittener Tage fuer Neue Kammermusik], reviewed by John Warnaby, 2005; at MusicWeb International; retrieved September 2, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15283">The '''International Commission on Peace and Food''' (ICPF) was formed in 1989 as a private non-governmental initiative to bring an end to the arms race and thereby redirect the monetary resources of the world for accelerating global economic development.

Though the then Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] tried very much to deescalate the existing arms race between the NATO and Soviet Blocs, [[world military spending]] continued to spiral upwards and reached an all-time high of 1.2 trillion dollars in the year 1988. This sparked a wave of fear that an intentional or accidental nuclear war was very much likely to occur at any time. Apart from an intensification of efforts to lessen the arms race, there was another parallel movement to augment world food supplies so that nobody in the world went hungry for even a day.

Towards the end of that year [[The Mother's Service Society]], a social science research institute based in Pondicherry, South India approached the renowned Indian Scientist M. S. Swaminathan to explore the possibility of convening a group of experts to promote the efforts to increase food supply and also at the same time intensify efforts to bring down the arms race. The Commission was formed with Swaminathan as the Chairman and included 25 leading scientists, defense and development experts and politicians. Notable among the political members were [[Queen Noor of Jordan]] and the former First Lady of the United States Rosalynn Carter. By the time the first meeting of the Commission took place at the end of September 1989 the world political climate had changed considerably for the better. Barely six weeks later the Berlin Wall fell signaling the beginning of the end of the Cold War.

==Work of the Commission==

The Commission was active for five long years during which time it held many fact-gathering sessions. It also conducted extensive research and made many useful recommendations to national and international agencies. Cashing in on the growing positive climate in the world the Commission also focused its attention on possibilities to accelerate and magnify developmental efforts in the world. During the next five years it held successive meetings on these themes in such countries as Italy, Russia, India, Jordan, Norway, USA, France and Germany.

Among its many memorable efforts, one can make special mention of the efforts ICPF took to dispel fears about growing unemployment. In a daring initiative the ICPF took the stand that it was eminently possible for the industrialized and developing countries of the world to fully absorb their labor force in productive employment. In pursuit of such a visionary scheme the Commission drew up a plan to generate 100 million jobs over a period of ten years in India. It was aptly named "Prosperity 2000" and its recommendations were accepted and endorsed by the Indian Government in 1992. A similar effort was made to extend such a scheme to solve the problem of unemployment among the Palestinians in the Middle East.

The Commission took a special interest in the affairs of the East European countries following the disbanding of the Soviet Bloc. It enlisted the support of Mikhail Gorbachev in advocating a more gradual and less disruptive transition to market economy in these countries than the one recommended by Western governments and monetary agencies. Such efforts led to the formulation of an effective strategy to counter run-away inflation in Yugoslavia by Commission Member Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic in 1994.

==ICPF's Report to UN==

The Commission's final report, ''Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development'', was published in 1994 and formally presented to the UN Secretary General and member states by the Government of Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Peace and Food, ''Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development'', Zed Books, UK, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was one of the first to view security from a wider perspective that includes political, social, economic and institutional factors required for a stable and prosperous society.

The Commission emphasized the linkage between democracy, peace and development and laid stress on the fact that the UN needs to democratize its functioning in order to fully succeed in its mission of promoting development and guaranteeing peace and security among the member states. The report called for the total elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Also it noted the role played by the trade in small arms in aggravating terrorism and criminal behavior across the world and called for measures to control of arms trade. It was critical of the prevalent competitive security paradigm that makes the military preparedness of each nation a perceived threat to other surrounding nations. As an alternative ICPF proposed a cooperative security system that is backed by a world army which guarantees the safety and security of member countries by reducing down the aggressive capabilities of all of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherservice.org/ The Mother's Service Society - main&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission's belief  that long-standing political problems could be solved in a peaceful manner through economic progress stands vindicated by more recent events in Ireland, where rising prosperity has induced the IRA to give up its violent methods.

India's phenomenal success in the area of food production through the launching of The Green Revolution led the Commission to conclude that the world possesses the technological and organizational capabilities to raise food production on par with the growth in world population. Such a conviction also encouraged the Commission to call for revolutionary steps to increase food production.

ICPF also concluded that the persistence of hunger in the world was less an issue of inadequate food production and more a problem stemming from the absence of purchasing power among the poor of the world due to the lack of sufficient employment opportunities. The Commission took the stand that rising levels of unemployment are not inevitable and can be reversed by the adoption of sound strategies for job generation compatible with market-driven economics. It noted that the shrinking population in OECD countries would force these countries to adopt more liberal immigration policies and outsourcing methods in order to offset growing labor shortages in future.

Though the Commission was concerned with environmental problems arising from rampant exploitation of the earth's resources, it rejected the notion of limits to growth voiced by those who believed that the world's resources were limited. Instead it took the stand that infinite growth was possible if the mental and organizational resources available to humanity in the form of knowledge, technology, vocational skills and modes of organizations were fully utilized. ICPF noted with concern the marked absence of a body of theoretical knowledge concerning the process of development and issued a call for efforts to formulate a comprehensive theory of social evolution.

==Support==

The financial resources for the functioning of the Commission were contributed by its own members coupled with public donations and other forms of support from such agencies as UNDP, UNESCO, Ford Foundation, The [[Third World Academy of Science]], the Governments of USSR and Norway, The [[Gorbachev Foundation]], The [[Carter Center]] and [[The Mother's Service Society]].

==Follow-up==

[[The International Center for Peace and Development]] (ICPD), headquartered in Napa, California, was formed in 1995 to continue the work of the Commission. [[Harlan Cleveland]], former President of the [[World Academy of Art &amp; Science]], former US Ambassador to NATO, served as chairman from 1995 to 2008. Garry Jacobs, former Secretary of the Commission, is Executive Director. In 2000, ICPD approached the governments of India and Pakistan to explore the possibilities of widening the economic cooperation between the two countries as a means of fostering peace. The Prosperity 2000 strategy for India was updated with special emphasis on the multiplier effects and employment potential of bio-fuels. A ten-year review meeting of the Commission's work conducted in 2004 in collaboration with the [[World Academy of Art &amp; Science]] found many of its recommendations still relevant to the present world situation.&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Peace &amp; Food, preface to the 2nd edition, Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development.2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the main work of the Commission's report on nuclear disarmament, global governance, employment, social development and human resources have continued as part of the program of work of the [[World Academy of Art &amp; Science]]

The office of '''Keeper of the [[Privy Seal of Scotland]]''', one of the [[Great Officers of State]], first appears in the reign of [[David II of Scotland|David II]].  After the [[Act of Union 1707]] its holder was normally a [[peerage|peer]], like the [[Great Seal of Scotland|Keeper of the Great Seal]]. The office has remained unfilled since the death of Gavin, [[Marquess of Breadalbane]] in 1922.

The following is the '''list of well-known [[white nationalist]] organizations, groups and related media''':

'''White nationalism''' is a [[political ideology]] which advocates a [[Racialism|racial]] definition of [[national identity]] for [[white people]]; some [[white nationalist]]s advocate a separate all-white [[nation state]]. [[White separatism]] and [[white supremacism]] are subgroups within white nationalism.&lt;ref name=Swain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/news/releases/2003/4/11/interviews_offer_unprecedented_look_into_the_world_and_words_of_the_new_white_nationalism |title=Interviews offer unprecedented look into the world and words of the new white nationalism |first=Carol M. |last=Swain |publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]] |date=2003-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former seek a separate white nation state, while the latter add ideas from [[social Darwinism]] and [[Nazism|National Socialism]] to their ideology.&lt;ref name=Swain/&gt; A few white nationalists organizations leaders made a claim that they are mostly separatists, and only a smaller number are supremacists.&lt;ref name=Swain/&gt; Both schools of thought generally avoid the term ''supremacy'', saying it has negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;The New Nativism; The alarming overlap between white nationalists and mainstream anti-immigrant forces.

==Canada==
*[[Aryan Guard]], was founded in late 2006 but did not gain any media attention until 2007 when members began a flier campaign targeting [[immigrants]]. Some of these flyers had been surreptitiously placed in the free Calgary arts and culture newspaper, "Fast Forward" by Aryan Guard members. The Friends of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] for Holocaust Studies suspect that the individual responsible for the fliers may be Bill Noble, a neo-Nazi well known to law enforcement for his online racist activism and who has been in the past charged under Section 319 of the Canadian Criminal Code for wilful promotion of hatred.

*[[National Party of Europe]], (abbreviated ''NPE'') was a [[far-right]] [[Pan-European Nationalism|Pan-European Nationalist]] political party from 1962 to 1968.

Colonialism was to be brought to an end and each former [[colony]] replaced with a [[Overseas Territory|single-ethnic government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oswaldmosley.com/national-party-of-europe.htm National Party of Europe - the Venice Conference] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106062940/http://www.oswaldmosley.com/national-party-of-europe.htm |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPE was founded on March 1, 1962 when the European Declaration at Venice was signed by Europe's eminent [[far-right]] parties of the day: The [[Union Movement]] of Britain, [[Deutsche Reichspartei]] of West Germany, the [[Italian Social Movement]], and [[Jeune Europe]] &amp; [[Mouvement d'Action Civique]] of Belgium.
*[[European Social Movement]], (abbreviated ESM) was a [[neo-Fascist]] [[Europe]]-wide alliance formed in 1951 to promote [[Pan-European Nationalism]]. The ESM had its origins in the [[far-right]] [[Italian Social Movement]], and was replaced by the [[National Party of Europe]] in 1962.
*[[New European Order]], (abbreviated NEO) was, like the European Social Movement, a [[neo-Fascist]] [[Europe]]-wide alliance formed to promote [[Pan-European Nationalism]]. The NEO was founded in 1951 shortly after the founding of the European Social Movement, and in defiance of the ESM, which the NEO claimed was too moderate in its racialist and anti-communist views. After its founding, the NEO pledged a European war against [[communists]] and [[Person of color|non-whites]].

==France==
*[[Bloc Identitaire|Identity Bloc]], (Bloc Identitaire) is a French radical [[right-wing populist]] political party founded in 2003. Although [[neo-Nazi]] and [[neo-Fascist]] groups are illegal in [[France]], Identity Bloc has been called both [[far-right]] and [[White Nationalist]]. Identity Bloc has also been known to espouse [[Pan-European Nationalism]].

==Germany==
*[[National Democratic Party of Germany]],  (Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands; abbreviated NPD) is a [[far-right]] [[Pan-Germanism|German nationalist]] party formed in 1964. The NPD was founded in 1964 as a successor to the German Reich Party (German: Deutsche Reichspartei, DRP) and considers itself to be Germany's "only significant patriotic force." The leader of the NPD is Frank Franz.
*[[German People's Union]],  (Deutsche Volksunion; abbreviated DVU) was a German nationalist party formed in 1971 by Gerhard Frey. The DVU supports German [[ethnic nationalism]], [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Third Positionism]], and [[Right-wing populism]]. The party ends up in 2011 by joining the National Democratic Party of Germany.
*[[German League for People and Homeland]],  (Deutsche Liga für Volk und Heimat; abbreviated DLVH) is [[nationalist]] and [[conservative]] [[right-wing]] German political association which was formed in 1991 by the more extreme right-wing Harald Neubauer, who split from [[Die Republikaner]] in reaction to the over-moderately conservative REP leader, Franz Schönhuber. When it first emerged, the DLVH stated its goal was to unite all of Germany's far-right elements under one banner.
*[[The Republicans (Germany)|The Republicans]],  (Die Republikaner; abbreviated REP) is a [[Nationalist]] and [[Conservative]] political party in Germany, formed in 1983 and led by [[Rolf Schlierer]]. The REP promotes German nationalism, [[National Conservatism]], [[anti-immigration]], [[Right-wing populism]], and [[social conservatism]].
*[[Deutsche Heidnische Front|German Heathen's Front]],  (Deutsche Heidnische Front; abbreviated DHF) is a [[far-right]] [[Germanic Neopagan]] group formed by avowed [[neo-Nazi]] Hendrik Möbus in 1998 as the German section of the [[Allgermanische Heidnische Front]] (AHF), or All-Germanic Heathen's Front, an international [[Völkisch]] and [[Pagan]] group practicing [[Paganism|Heathenry]] in the forms of Germanic Neopaganism, [[Odinism]], and [[Wotanism]].
*[[Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front]] (abbreviated GdNF) was the main group in [[Germany]] for [[neo-Nazi]] activity in the 1990s. The small group was formed in 1985 by [[Michael Kühnen]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Brehl|de}} and [[Christian Worch]] after the 1983 banning of the [[Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists]]. The GdNF was soon formalized into a well-ordered organization, taking in the former ANS/NA membership. The GdNF placed itself within the more radical Sturmabteilung tradition of Nazism rather than simple devotion to Adolf Hitler, staging marches, paramilitary training and setting up cells in the German Democratic Republic. After Kühnen [[came out]] in 1986, the GdNF remained loyal, but in the resulting split, the group lost control of both the FAP and the organizations of celebrations for Hitler's 100th birthday. After Kühnen's death in 1991, the group gradually passed out of existence.
*[[National Offensive]], ({{lang-de|Nationale Offensive}}; abbreviated NO) was a [[Germany|German]] [[neo-Nazi]] party formed in 1990 by Michael Swierczek, former chairman of the Free German Workers' Party (FAP) in Bavaria. The focus of the platform of the NO was its fight against immigrants. It considered the blending of cultures to be genocide, and therefore called for the deportation of foreigners, tightening of German asylum laws, and making it more difficult to attain German nationality. In 1991 and 1992, the NO publicly supported former SS-member Josef Schwammberger while on trial for war crimes. the National Offensive was banned by the [[Federal Republic of Germany|German]] [[Interior Ministry]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=VSB1990&gt;{{de icon}} ''Verfassungsschutzbericht'' 1990. [[Verfassungsschutz]]. {{ISSN|0177-0357}}. Pg. 99&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[German Alternative]],  (Deutsche Alternative; abbreviated DA) was a minor [[neo-Nazi]] group set up by Michael Kühnen in 1989. Deutsche Alternative's declared goal was the restoration of the German Reich, and DA rejected the cession of German areas in Eastern Europe following World War II as well as all immigration to Germany claiming that there were already too many foreigners in the country.
*[[Free German Workers' Party]],  (Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; abbreviated FAP) was a [[neo-Nazi]] political association in Germany from 1979 to 1995. The FAP was relatively obscure until the larger and more active [[ANS/NA]] was banned in 1983, when prominent German [[neo-Nazi]] [[Michael Kühnen]] encouraged former members of the now-illegal ANS/NA to infiltrate the FAP in order to preserve a nucleus of organized [[National Socialism]] in Germany. However, the FAP itself was banned by the German government in 1995.
*[[Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists]],  (Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten/Nationale Aktivisten; abbreviated ANS/NA) was a German [[National Socialist]] group formed by [[Michael Kühnen]] in 1977, under the name Action Front of National Socialists (ANS), as a legal branch of the [[NSDAP/AO]]. The ANS merged with the National Activists (NA), another [[neo-Nazi]] group led by Thomas Brehl, in 1983, forming the ANS/NA as it existed until its ban by the German government. In 1983, the German [[Ministry of the Interior]] banned the ANS/NA, which officially disbanded soon after.
*[[Nationalist Front (Germany)|Nationalist Front]],  (Nationalistische Front; abbreviated NF) was a minor [[neo-Nazi]] group formed in 1982 as the Nationalist Front - League of Social Revolutionary Nationalists. The Nationalist Front was characterized for its support for [[Strasserism]] rather than the more usual forms of [[Nazism]], and also for having a large [[Pagan]] population and for forming links with the Ku Klux Klan in America, even performing [[cross burnings]].
*[[Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit|People's Socialist Movement of Germany/Labour Party]],  (Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit; abbreviated VSBD/PdA) was a German [[neo-Nazi]] group led by [[Friedhelm Busse]]. The Junge Front (Young Front), a youth movement attached to the party, was also organized. The VSBD/PdA adopted a more [[left-leaning]] view of [[Nazism]]: [[Strasserism]]. Strasserism, formed by two early left-leaning Nazis in the 1920s, the brothers [[Gregor Strasser|Gregor]] and [[Otto Strasser]], calls for a more radical, mass-action and worker-based form of [[National Socialism]], particularly hostile to [[finance capitalism]]. The VSBD/PdA was banned in Germany in 1982.
*[[Wiking-Jugend|Viking Youth]],  (Wiking-Jugend; abbreviated WJ) was a German [[neo-Nazi]] [[youth organization]] modeled after the original [[Hitler Youth]], the HJ ''Hitlerjugend''. The WJ was formed in 1952 as the successor to the ''Reichsjugend'', the youth branch of the [[Sozialistische Reichspartei]], which was banned. So when the German [[neo-Nazis]] went underground, the fragments of former [[National Socialist]] youth organizations and smaller follow-ups - the former ''Reichsjugend'', the ''Vaterländischer Jungenbund'', the ''Deutsche Unitarier-Jugend'' - were eventually all brought together as the [[Wiking-Jugend]]. The WJ was outlawed as unconstitutional in 1994.
*[[Socialist Reich Party|Socialist Reich Party of Germany]],  (Sozialistische Reichspartei Deutschlands; abbreviated SRP) was a [[far right]] West German political party founded in 1949, in the aftermath of World War II, as an openly [[National Socialist]] and [[neo-Nazi|Hitler-admiring]] split from the [[German Reich Party|Deutsche Reichspartei]]. Leading figures included Otto Ernst Remer, a former Major General in the Wehrmacht. The SRP claimed that Karl Dönitz was the last legitimate Führer of a [[pan-Germanism|pan-German]] Reich. The SRP also advocated Europe, led by a reunited German Reich, as a "[[Third position|third force]]" against both capitalism and communism. The SRP was banned by the West German government in 1952, and much of its membership re-joined the [[Deutsche Reichspartei]]
*[[Deutsche Reichspartei|German Reich Party]],  (Deutsche Reichspartei; abbreviated DRP) was a German nationalist political party formed from the defunct [[German Right Party]] in Germany in 1950. In 1949, the [[Socialist Reich Party]] split from the DRP; the SRP was openly [[National Socialist]] and [[neo-Nazi|Hitler-admiring]]. However, the DRP would be marked as the new force of [[neo-Nazism]] in 1952, when the [[Socialist Reich Party]] was declared unconstitutional and banned, and much of its membership joined or re-joined the DRP, including longtime [[Nazi]] and former Luftwaffe pilot, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, who joined in 1953. The German Reich Party remained the main force of the far-right in Germany until it dissolved in 1964, replaced by the National Democratic Party of Germany (''Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands'', or NPD)
*[[Deutsche Rechtspartei|German Conservative Party - German Right Party]],  (Deutsche Konservative Partei - Deutsche Rechtspartei) was a [[conservative]] and [[nationalist]] German post-World War II political party, formed in 1946 as a merger of the German Conservatives, Deutsche Aufbaupartei, and Deutsche Bauern- und Landvolk Partei. Originally intended as a continuation of the conservative pre-WWII [[German National People's Party]], it soon attracted a number of former Nazis and its program changed towards a more neo-Nazi stance. The Deutsche Rechtspartei continued to face pressure until eventually it merged with other right-wing groups, such as the National Democrats, to form the German Reich Party around 1950.

The '''Huế Massacre''' ({{lang-vi|Thảm sát tại Huế Tết Mậu Thân}}, or {{lang|vi|Thảm sát Tết Mậu Thân ở Huế}}, lit. translation: "[[Tet Offensive|Tết Offensive]] Massacre in Huế") is the name given to the [[summary execution]]s and [[Mass murder|mass killing]]s perpetrated by the [[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]] (VC) and [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) during their capture, [[military occupation|occupation]] and later withdrawal from the city of [[Huế]] during the [[Tet Offensive|Tết Offensive]], considered one of the longest and bloodiest [[battle]]s of the [[Vietnam War]].

The [[Battle of Huế]] began on January 31, 1968, and lasted a total of 26 days. During the months and years that followed, dozens of [[mass grave]]s were discovered in and around Huế. Victims included women, men, children, and infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Gerald |title=Huế: the massacre the Left wants us to forget |url=http://www.11thcavnam.com/education/hue.htm |accessdate=25 April 2014 |newspaper=The New Australian |date=16–22 February 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The estimated death toll was between 2,800 and 6,000 [[civilian]]s and [[prisoners of war]],&lt;ref name="huemassacre"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Fifty-Year Wound |last=Leebaert |first=Lee |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=2003 |pages=352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 5–10% of the total population of Huế.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Robert F. |title=Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development |year=1975 |publisher=Hoover Institution Publications |isbn=978-0817964313 |page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] released a list of 4,062 victims identified as having been either murdered or abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of Civilians Massacred by the Communists During "Tet Mau Than" in Thừa Thiên Province and Huế City |url=http://www.vvfh.org/uploads/massacres/List%20of%20Civilians%20Massacred%20by%20the%20Communists%20During%20%E2%80%9CTet%20Mau%20Than%E2%80%9D%20in%20Thua%20Thien%20Province%20ad%20Hue%20City1.pdf |publisher=RVN |accessdate=25 April 2014 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims were found bound, tortured, and sometimes [[premature burial|buried alive]]. Many victims were also clubbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;Kendrick Oliver, ''The My Lai Massacre in American History and Memory'' (Manchester University Press, 2006), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups around the World'', edited by James Minahan, vol. 4 (Greenwood, 2002), p. 1761.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Journod, "La France, les États-Unis et la guerre du Vietnam: l'année 1968", in ''Les relations franco-américaines au XX siècle'', edited by Pierre Melandri and Serge Ricard (L'Harmattan, 2003), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of U.S. and [[South Vietnam]]ese authorities as well a number of journalists who investigated the events took the discoveries, along with other evidence, as proof that a large-scale [[wiktionary:atrocity|atrocity]] had been carried out in and around Huế during its four-week occupation. The killings were perceived as part of a large-scale [[purge]] of a whole social stratum, including anyone friendly to American forces in the region. The Massacre at Huế came under increasing press scrutiny later, when press reports alleged that South Vietnamese "revenge squads" had also been at work in the aftermath of the battle, searching out and executing citizens that had supported the communist occupation.&lt;ref name="Oberdorfer, pp. 232–233"&gt;Oberdorfer, pp. 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Willbanks, pp. 101–102"&gt;Willbanks, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Ben Kiernan]] described the massacre as "possibly the largest atrocity of the war."&lt;ref name="Kiernan 444"/&gt;

==Executions during the course of the Communist occupation==
The Viet Cong set up provisional authorities shortly after capturing Huế in the early hours of January 31, 1968.  They were charged with removing the existing [[Republic of Vietnam|government administration]] from power within the city and replacing it with a "[[revolution]]ary administration." Working from lists of "cruel [[tyrant]]s and [[reactionary]] elements" previously developed by Viet Cong [[Espionage|intelligence officer]]s, many people were to be rounded up following the initial hours of the attack. These included [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) soldiers, [[civil servant]]s, [[political party]] members, local [[religious]] leaders, schoolteachers, [[Americans|American]] civilians and other international people.&lt;ref name=Tucker&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer|title=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: Political, Social, Military History|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1851099610|page=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadres called out the names on their lists over loudspeakers, ordering them to report to a local school. Those not reporting voluntarily were hunted down.&lt;ref name=his&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/tet-what-really-happened-at-hue.htm|title=Tet - What Really Happened at Hue - HistoryNet|author=|date=2011-01-25|website=www.historynet.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist preliminary occupation plans and orders===
[[File:Hue Massacre Interment.jpg|thumb|Burial of 300 unidentified victims]]
The communists' actions were based on a series of orders issued by the High Command and the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|PRG]]. In a 3500-page document issued on January 26, 1968, by the [[Quảng Trị Province|Trị]]-[[Thừa Thiên–Huế Province|Thiên]]-[[Huế]] Political Directorate, the political cadres were given specific instructions:&lt;ref name=Study&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/virtualarchive/items.php?item=2311314001|title=The Vietnam Center and Archive: Search Results|author=|date=|website=www.vietnam.ttu.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} 'Operating in close support of the regular military and guerrilla elements, the political cadre were to: destroy and disorganize the Republic of Viet Nam's ([[South Vietnam|RVN]]'s) administrative machinery "from province and district levels to the city wards, streets, and wharves;" motivate the people of Huế to take up arms, pursue the enemy, seize power, and establish a revolutionary government; motivate (recruit) local citizens for military and "security" forces .. transportation and supply activities, and to serve wounded soldiers . . . ;" "pursue to the end (and) punish spies, reactionaries, and "tyrants" and "maintain order and security in the city".

Another section, dealing with Target Area 1 ("the Phu Ninh ward") read: ""Annihilate all spies, reactionaries, and foreign teachers (such as Americans and Germans) in the area. Break open prisons. Investigate cadre, soldiers and receptive civilians imprisoned by the enemy. Search for tyrants and reactionaries who are receiving treatment in hospitals"&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|29–30}}  The orders for Target Area 2 ("the Phu Vinh ward") were similar; "Annihilate the enemy in the area...Rally the Buddhist force to advance the isolation of reactionaries who exploit the Catholics of Phu Cam".&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|30}}  The orders for Target Area 3 ("the wharves along the An Cuu River and from Truong Sung to the Kho Ren Bridge") followed the same pattern; "Search for and pursue spies, tyrants and reactionaries hiding near the wharf...Motivate the people in the areas along the River to annihilate the enemy."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|30}}  For Target Area 4 (the district including Phu Cam and the Binh Anh, Truong Giang, Truong Cuu and An Lang sections) the orders were; "Search for and pursue spies and reactionaries in the area...Destroy the power and influence of reactionary leaders..."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|31}}  For Area 1, Cell 3 was assigned the job of "Annihilation of tyrants and the elimination of traitors."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|32}}

In June 1968, American 1st Cavalry troops captured PAVN documents that included a directive written two days before the battle began. It included the following instructions: "For the purpose of a lengthy occupation of Huế, we should immediately liberate the rural areas and annihilate the wicked GVN administrative personnel.

Specific Mission .... We must attack the enemy key agencies, economic installations, and lines of communications.  We must also annihilate the enemy mobile troops, reactionary elements and tyrants."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|113}}

On February 1, the provincial administration, having taken control of Huế, issued a directive that ordered the troops, in part,&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|193}}  "To wipe out all puppet administrative organs of the puppet Thiệu-Kỳ (President [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]], Vice President [[Nguyễn Cao Kỳ]]) clique at all levels in the province, city and town down to every single hamlet."

On the same day, the Liberation Front radio announced, "We tell our compatriots that we are determined to topple the regime of the traitorous Thiệu-Kỳ clique and to punish and annihilate those who have been massacring and oppressing our compatriots ... we ask our compatriots to ... help us arrest all the U.S.-puppet cruel henchmen."&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|195}}

===Course of the occupation===
[[Foreign Service Officer]] [[Douglas Pike]] wrote that according to Viet Cong documents captured during and after the siege, members of the provincial administration were to be taken out of the city, held and punished for their [[kangaroo court|"crimes against the Vietnamese people"]]. The disposition of those who were previously in control of the city was carefully laid out, and the lists were detailed and extensive. Those in the Saigon-based-state police apparatus at all levels were to be rounded up and held outside the city.

Ordinary civil servants who worked for "the Saigon enemy" out of necessity, but did not oppose the communists, were destined for [[:wikt:reeducation|reeducation]] and later employment. Low-level civil servants who had at some point been involved in [[paramilitary]] activities were to be held for reeducation, but not employed.

Within days of the capture, [[US Marine Corps]] (USMC) and [[US Army]] as well as ARVN units were dispatched to counterattack and recapture the city after weeks of fierce fighting, during which the city and its outlying areas were exposed to repeated shelling and bombing. It was reported that during the USMC and ARVN attack, North Vietnam's forces had rounded up those individuals whose names it had previously collected and had them executed or sent North for "reeducation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gross|first=Chuck|title=Rattler One-seven: A Vietnam Helicopter Pilot's War Story|date=2006|publisher=University of North Texas Press|location=Denton, TX|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M_gYWTF04DMC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=hue+rounded+up+reeducation+camps#v=onepage&amp;q=hue%20rounded%20up%20reeducation%20camps&amp;f=false|isbn=9781574411782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of people had taken sanctuary from the battle in a local church. Several hundred of these people were ordered out to undergo [[indoctrination]] in the "liberated area" and told afterwards they would be allowed to return home. After marching the group south 9 kilometers, 20 of the people were separated, tried in a [[kangaroo court]], found guilty, executed and buried. The others were taken across the river and turned over to a local Communist unit in an exchange that even included written receipts. Douglas Pike notes that, while "It is probable that the [[Commissar]] intended that their prisoners should be reeducated and returned, but with the turnover, matters passed from his control." Sometime within the following several weeks, the communists decided to kill the individuals under their control.&lt;ref name=Pike&gt;{{cite news|last=Pike|first=Douglas|title=The VietCong Strategy of Terror|year=1970|url=http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/virtualarchive/items.php?item=2311404008|accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}}

===Eyewitness accounts===
[[File:Va006869.jpg|thumb|Searching – Bits of tattered clothing, sandals and slippers are examined by South Vietnamese women who lost relatives in the 1968 Tet massacre. The latest mass grave discovered in Huế yielded remains of 250 victims]]
Nguyễn Công Minh, daughter of the Deputy Mayor of Huế at the time, reported that her father, who was of old age, was arrested at his home in the beginning of the Communist occupation, 3 days after he ordered his children (incl. Nguyễn Công Minh) and wife to flee via the back of their house when Communist troops first came knocking at their home. Upon telling the troops that he was Deputy Mayor of Huế who was set to retire in one year (1969), he was ordered to report to a camp for reeducation, and pack clothing and food sufficient for 10 days. He was never seen again, nor were his remains recovered.  She recalled that in the search of her father's remains, she witnessed that many of the bodies she came across in the mass graves were found to be in a fetal position, with their hands tied behind their backs, and the back of the heads/skulls were smashed, indicating that they knelt on the ground prior to their deaths and they died due to [[blunt-force trauma]] to their heads.&lt;ref name=WGBHBoston&gt;{{cite web|last=Nguyễn|first=Minh Công|title=Nhân Chứng Sống Kể Lại Cuộc Thảm Sát Tết Mậu Thân 1968 Tại Huế|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-43b0a0-interview-with-mrs-nguyen-cong-minh|work=Video Interview|publisher=WGBH TV Boston|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, journalist Don Oberdorfer's book, ''Tet!,'' documented some eyewitness accounts of what happened in Huế during the PAVN/VC occupation. Pham Van Tuong, a part-time janitor for the Huế government information office who made it on the Viet Cong list of "reactionaries" for working there, was hiding with his family as the VC hunted for him. When he was found with his 3-year-old daughter, 5-year-old son and 2 nephews, the Viet Cong immediately gunned them all down, leaving their bodies on the street for the rest of the family to see.&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;

[[Don Oberdorfer]] spent five days in late 1969 with [[Paul Vogle]], an American English professor at [[Huế University]], going through Huế interviewing witnesses of the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong occupation. Oberdorfer classified all the killings into two categories: the planned execution of government officials and their families, political and civil servants, and collaborators with Americans; and those civilians not connected to the government who ran from questioning, who spoke harshly about the occupation, or who the occupiers believed "displayed a bad attitude" towards the occupiers.

Oberdorfer reported that on the 5th day of the Viet Cong occupation in the [[Catholic]] district of Huế, Phủ Cam, all able-bodied males over age 15, approximately 400 boys and men, who took refuge in [[Nhà thờ chính tòa Phủ Cam|Phủ Cam Cathedral]] were taken away and killed .&lt;ref name="his" /&gt; Some had been on the VC's blacklist, some were of military age and some just looked prosperous.&lt;ref name="his" /&gt; Oberdorfer interviewed Ho Ty, a VC commander who took part in the advanced planning of a general uprising.  He reported that Ty recounted that the Communist party "was particularly anxious to get those people at Phủ Cam... The Catholics were considered particular enemies of ours." It was apparently this group whose remains were later found in the Da Mai Creek bed.&lt;ref name="his" /&gt; The murders of 500 people at Da Mai were authorized by PRG command "on grounds that the victims had been traitors to the revolution."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|85}}&lt;ref name=Sentinel /&gt;

An American veteran who was in the Huế area has written an account of his unit's march to the discovery of the bodies at Dai Mai Creek.  He corroborates the information that the discovery was predicated on information revealed by three communist defectors who had witnessed the massacre.  His unit provided security for the authorities who investigated and recovered the remains, and they were honored by the citizens of Huế for their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hesterly|first1=Robert|title=Dai Mai Creek Massacre|url=https://roberthesterly.wordpress.com/2009/09/23/dai-mai-creek-massacre/|website=Space|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=18 February 2017|date=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three professors, Professor Horst-Günther Krainick, Dr. Alois Alteköster, and [[:de:Raimund Discher|Dr. Raimund Discher]], who taught at the Huế University's Faculty of Medicine and were members of the [[West Germany|West German]] Cultural Mission, along with Mrs. Elisabeth Krainick, were arrested and executed by North Vietnamese troops during their invasion of Huế in February 1968. On April 5, 1968, the bodies of the executed professors along with many Vietnamese civilians also executed, were discovered in mass graves near Huế.&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Obsidian /&gt;

Philip W. Manhard, a U.S. senior advisor in Huế province, was taken to a [[POW camp]] by the PAVN and held until 1973. Manhard recounted that during the PAVN's withdrawal from Huế, they summarily executed anyone in their custody who resisted being taken out of the city or who was too old, too young, or too frail to make the journey to the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=M.

Two French priests, Fathers Urbain and Guy, were seen being led away and suffered a similar fate. Urbain's body was found buried alive, bound hand and foot. Guy, who was 48, was stripped of his cassock and forced to kneel down on the ground where he was shot in the back of the head.

[[Alje Vennema]], a Dutch-Canadian doctor who lived in Huế and witnessed the battle and the massacre, wrote ''The Viet Cong Massacre at Huế''&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt; in 1976.  He recounts numerous stories of murders.  A 48-year-old street vendor, Mrs. Nguyen Thi Lao, was "arrested on the main street.  Her body was found at the school.  Her arms had been bound and a rag stuffed into her mouth; there were no wounds to the body.  She was probably buried alive."&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|131}}  A 44-year-old bricklayer, Mr. Nguyen Ty, was "seized on February 2, 1968...His body was found on March 1st; his hands were tied, and he had a bullet wound through his neck which had come out through the mouth."&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|136}}  At Ap Dong Gi Tay "110 bodies were uncovered; again most had their hands tied and rags stuffed in their mouth.  All of them were men, among them fifteen students, several military men, and civil servants, young and old."&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|137}}  "Sometimes a whole family was eliminated, as was the case with the merchant, Mr. Nam Long, who together with his wife and five children was shot at home."  "Mr. Phan Van Tuong, a laborer at the province headquarters, suffered a similar fate by being shot outside his house with four of his children."&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|141}}

Vennema listed 27 graves with a total of 2,397 bodies, most of which had been executed.&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|129–141}} He cited numerous eyewitness accounts of executions by PAVN and VC troops and described the condition of bodies found in the graves. Many had their hands tied behind their backs. Some were shot in the head. Some had rags stuffed in their mouths and had no evidence of wounds, apparently having been buried alive. Some had evidence of having been beaten. A few were identified as PAVN or VC troops killed during the battle.&lt;ref name=Vennema&gt;{{cite book|last=Vennema|first=Alje|title=The Viet Cong Massacre at Huế|year=1976|publisher=Vantage Press|isbn=978-0533019243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129–141}}

Some graves were found purely by accident. A farmer working in his field tripped on a wire sticking out of the ground. He pulled on it to remove it and a skeletal hand popped out of the ground. Other graves were found when people noticed suspiciously green grass in sandy areas.  The Da Mai Creek massacre was discovered after three VC [[Chieu Hoi|defected]] and told authorities about the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Massacre at Huế |url=http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/HIUS316/mbase/docs/hue.html |work=Time Magazine |accessdate=30 April 2014 |date=October 31, 1969 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308220933/http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/HIUS316/mbase/docs/hue.html |archivedate=March 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An ARVN soldier on patrol south of Huế noticed a wire sticking out of the ground. Thinking it was a booby trap, he very carefully worked to uncover it. He discovered the body of an old man, his hands tied together with the wire. Two days later 130 bodies had been uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wire Led to Discovery of Massacre|newspaper=Dallas Morning News|date=March 30, 1969|agency=UPI|location=Dallas, TX|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case,

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a squad with a death order entered the home of a prominent community leader and shot him, his wife, his married son and daughter-in-law, his young unmarried daughter, a male and female servant and their baby. The family cat was strangled; the family dog was clubbed to death; the goldfish scooped out of the fishbowl and tossed on the floor. When the Communists left, no life remained in the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Huế Massacre, 1968–1998, in English and Vietnamese|url=http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/virtualarchive/items.php?item=19350103001|work=The Vietnam Center and Archive|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An eyewitness, Nguyen Tan Chau, recounted how he was captured by Communist troops and marched south with 29 other prisoners bound together, in three groups of ten. Chau managed to escape and hide in the darkness just before the others were executed. From there he witnessed what happened next.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;The larger prisoners were separated into pairs, tied together back to back and shot. The others were shot singly. All were dumped into two shallow graves, including those who had been wounded but were not dead."&lt;ref name=Pike /&gt;{{rp|57}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Communist documents confirming the massacre===
Captured Viet Cong documents boasted that they "eliminated" thousands of enemy and "annihilated members of various reactionary political parties, henchmen, and wicked tyrants" in Huế.&lt;ref name=Hosmer /&gt;{{rp|72–78}} One regiment alone reported that it killed 1,000 people. Another report mentioned 2,867 killed. Yet another document boasted of over 3,000 killed. A further document listed 2,748 executions.&lt;ref name=Hosmer /&gt;{{rp|73–74}} A captured Viet Cong enemy document, which numerous writers cited, including [[Guenter Lewy]] in his 1980 book ''America in Vietnam'', and Peter Macdonald's 1993 book ''Giap'', recorded that the Communists "''eliminated 1,892 administrative personnel, 38 policemen, 790 tyrants''" – 2720 politically-persecuted persons in all, during the Communist occupation of the city.&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;

The translation of an official Vietnamese campaign study of the Tet Offensive in Thừa Thiên–Huế province released by the Communists recognized that Viet Cong cadres "hunted down and captured tyrants and Republic of Vietnam military and government personnel" and that "many nests of reactionaries [...] were killed." Hundreds of others "who owed blood debts were executed." Another official history from the Communist side, "The Tri-Thien-Huế Battlefield During the Victorious Resistance War Against the Americans to Save the Nation", recognized the widespread killings but claimed they were done by civilians who armed themselves and "rose up in a flood-tide, killing enemy thugs, eliminating traitors, and hunting down the enemy... The people captured and punished many reactionaries, enemy thugs, and enemy secret agents."&lt;ref name="his" /&gt; However, the word "eliminate" may be a mistranslation of the word "diet", and instead actually mean 
"destroy" or "neutralize" as in neutralizing their administrative function and eliminating of their political influence through detention, as opposed to physical liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/porterhue1.html|title=Gareth Porter, "The 1968 Hue Massacre", Part One.|author=|date=|website=msuweb.montclair.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chomsky.info/counter-revolutionary-violence/|title=Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact and Propaganda, Noam Chomsky and Edward S.

When [[Trương Như Tảng]] was appointed Viet Cong justice minister soon after Huế, he understood this to be a critical position because the massacre had, "left us with a special need to address fears among the Southern people that a revolutionary victory would bring with it a [[Bloodbath (disambiguation)|bloodbath]] or [[reign of terror]]."&lt;ref name="Trang"&gt;Truong Nhu Trang, ''A Viet Cong Memoir'' (1985), p. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt; This was because, "large numbers of people had been executed" including "captured American soldiers and several other international people who were not combatants." According to Trạng, "discipline in Huế was seriously inadequate" and "fanatic young soldiers had indiscriminately shot people, and angry local citizens who supported the revolution had on various occasions taken justice into their own hands...."&lt;ref name="Trang" /&gt; The massacre was, "one of those terrible spontaneous tragedies that inevitably accompany war."&lt;ref name="Trang" /&gt;

On February 4, Radio Hanoi announced,  "After one hour's fighting the Revolutionary Armed Forces occupied the residence of the puppet provincial Governor (in Huế), the prison and the offices of the puppet administration . . . . The Revolutionary Armed Forces punished most cruel agents of the enemy and seized control of the streets . . . rounded up and punished dozens of cruel agents and caused the enemy organs of control and oppression to crumble."&lt;ref name=Pike /&gt;{{rp|54}}  On Feb 14th, the Thừa Thiên-Huế People's Revolutionary Committee issued a statement that read in part,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerned over the country's survival and their own fate, on 31 January 1968, the Thừa Thiên-Huế people rose up holding weapons in their hands, smashed the puppet ruling apparatus from the provincial to the village and hamlet levels, and completely liberated the rural areas and the city of Huế. The enemy has suffered disastrous defeats. A number of ringleaders of the puppet administration have surrendered to the people or have been arrested and have been detained by the revolutionary forces. Except for some localities and scattered guard posts which have not yet been liquidated, the Thừa Thiên-Huế puppet administration has basically disintegrated.&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|196–197}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An entry in a captured communist document dated Feb 22nd stated, "Troop proselyting by the VC/PAVN forces was not successful because the troops had to devote themselves to combat missions. Moreover, they were afraid of being discovered by the enemy. It was very difficult for them to handle POWs so they executed the policy of "catch and kill."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|114}}  A February 25 captured communist document detailed some of the successes of the Special Action Company of the PAVN 6th Regiment. "We captured and exterminated thousands of people of the revolutionary network.  From province to village we broke the enemy's administrative grip for the people to rise."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|115}}

A report written immediately after the battle by a political officer of the People's Revolutionary Party listed 2,826 "administrative personnel, nationalist political party members, 'tyrants' and policemen that were killed by their troops."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Another document, undated, written by a senior political officer and marked "ABSOLUTE SECRET", entitled "Information On the Victory of Our Armed Forces in Huế from 31 January to 23 March 1968" was captured by the US 1st Cavalry Division on April 25, 1968.&lt;ref name=Hosmer /&gt;{{rp|212 – note 15}} It reported on the results of the political operation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We also killed one member of the Dai Viet Party Committee, one Senator of South Viet-Nam, 50 Quoc Dan Dang party members, six Dai Viet Party members, thirteen Can Lao Nhan Vi Party members, three captains, four 1st lieutenants, and liberated 35 hamlets with 32,000 people...We eliminated 1,892 administrative personnel, 38 policemen, 790 tyrants, six captains, two first lieutenants, 20 second lieutenants, and many NCOs.&lt;ref name=Hosmer /&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communist Document Tells of Civilian Massacre At Huế|url=http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/virtualarchive/items.php?item=2131109007|work=Vietnam Virtual Archive|publisher=Texas Tech University|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same document contained a passage that read

&lt;blockquote&gt;The people joined our soldiers in their search for tyrants, reactionaries and spies.  For instance, Mrs. Xuan followed our soldiers to show the houses of the tyrants she knew, although she had only six days before given birth to a child.&lt;ref name=Hosmer&gt;{{cite web|last=Hosmer|first=Stephen T.|title=Viet Cong Repression and Its Implications For the Future|url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2008/R475.1.pdf|work=The Rand Corporation|accessdate=30 April 2014|date=May 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 1968, in the official Hanoi press, the North reported,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Actively combining their efforts with those of the People's Liberation Armed Forces and population, other self-defense and armed units of the city of Huế arrested and called to surrender the surviving functionaries of the puppet administration and officers and men of the puppet army who were skulking. Die-hard cruel agents were punished.&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|191}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A March 6 document written by a VC sapper unit commander recounted that his unit "participated in the killing of tyrants and the digging of trenches"&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|112}}  A March 13, 1968 entry in captured documents reviewed the successes of the attack on Huế. "Enormous victory: We annihilated more than 3,000 tyrannical puppet army and government administrative personnel, including the Deputy Province Chief of Thừa Thiên."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|115–116}}  A report written by the commander of the 6th Regiment on March 30 stated that they had captured thousands of "local administrative personnel, puppet troops, and cruel tyrants" and successfully "annihilated members of various reactionary political parties, henchmen, and wicked tyrants."  It also stated that they had "killed 1,000 local administrative personnel, spies and cruel tyrants."&lt;ref name=Hosmer /&gt;{{rp|73}}

On April 26, 1968, Hanoi, reacting to the discovery of graves in Huế, announced that the people murdered by their troops were, "hooligan lackeys who had incurred blood debts of the Huế compatriots and who were annihilated by the Front's Armed Forces in the early spring of 1968."&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|191}}  On April 27, 1969, Radio Hanoi criticized authorities in Huế and South Vietnam, stating,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to cover up their cruel acts, the puppet administration in Huế recently played the farce of setting up a so-called committee for the search for burial sites of the hooligan lackeys who had owed blood debts to the Tri-Thien-Huế compatriots and who were annihilated by the Southern Armed Forces and people in early Mau Than spring.&lt;ref name=Vennema /&gt;{{rp|191–192}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cadre diary captured by 1st Cavalry Division troops contained an entry that read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The entire puppet administrative system from hamlet to province was destroyed or disintegrated.  More than 3,000 persons were killed.  The enemy could never reorganize or make up for his failure.  Although he could immediately use inexperienced elements as replacements, they were good for nothing.&lt;ref name=Hosmer /&gt;{{rp|73}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 1968 the Huế City People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee released a summary of the Party's accomplishments during Tet. The summary included the following statement: "Thousands of tyrants were killed. Many reactionary factions and organizations were exterminated."&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;{{rp|7}}

That same month, Don Oberdorfer reported,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ho Ty was arrested by the government police on Sept. 4 this year. At the time of his arrest, he was party secretary for a section of Huế city...Ho Ty reported that the part of the plan from higher headquarters was to destroy the government machinery of Huế and the people who made it work.....He said the killings were planned and executed by a separate group in charge of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oberdorfer|first=Don|title='68 killings by vietcong are detailed|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/143590548|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=Dec 7, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1987, at a Hanoi conference to discuss the history of the Tet offensive, Colonel General [[Trần Văn Quang|Tran Van Quang]], one of the commanders of the Huế operation, assessed the strengths and weaknesses of his forces, citing as one of their strengths:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We resolutely carried out the orders and fulfilled the requirements set out for us by the High Command. We motivated our cadre, soldiers, and the civilian population through the use of the slogans, 'Tri-Thien fights for Tri-Thien and for the entire nation,' and 'Heroically and resolutely conduct attacks and uprisings.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1968 Tet Offensive and Uprising in Tri-Thien-Huế|url=http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/virtualarchive/items.php?item=11271612001|work=Vietnam Virtual Archive|publisher=Texas Tech University|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 1988 Vietnamese Communist leaders admitted "mistakes" were made in Huế. [[List of central officeholders in the Communist Party of Vietnam|Col Nguyen Quoc Khanh]], commander of part of the forces that took over Huế stated that "There was no case of killing civilians purposefully.....Those civilians who were killed were killed accidentally, in cross fire."

A first summary was published for the U.S. Mission in Vietnam by [[Douglas Pike]], then working as a [[Foreign Service Officer]] for the [[United States Information Agency|U.S. Information Agency]] in 1970. Pike identified three distinct phases for the executions in Huế. In a report published in 1970, ''The Viet Cong Strategy of Terror'', the U.S. Information Agency analyst Douglas Pike wrote that at least half of the bodies unearthed in Huế revealed clear evidence of "atrocity killings: to include hands wired behind backs, rags stuffed in mouths, bodies contorted but without wounds (indicating burial alive)."&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pike" /&gt;{{rp|47}} Pike concluded that the killings were done by local VC cadres and were the result of "a decision rational and justifiable in the Communist mind.".&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pike" /&gt;{{rp|52}} The three phases are as follows:

* Phase one was a series of kangaroo court trials of local ARVN officials. The highly publicized trials lasted anywhere from 5 – 10 minutes and the accused were always found guilty of "crimes against the people".&lt;ref name=Pike/&gt;{{rp|54–55}}
* Phase two was implemented when the communists thought that they could hold the city long-term, and consisted of a campaign of "social reconstruction" along [[Maoist]] dogmatic lines. Those who the communists believed to be [[counter-revolutionaries]] were singled out in this phase. Catholics, intellectuals, prominent businessmen, and other "[[imperialist]] lackeys" were targeted in order to "build a new social order".&lt;ref name=Pike/&gt;{{rp|55–58}}
* The last phase began when it became evident that the communists could not hold the city and was designed to "leave no witnesses". Anyone who could identify individual VC members who participated in the occupation was to be killed and their bodies hidden.&lt;ref name=Pike/&gt;{{rp|58–60}}

After the Battle of Huế, between 1968 and 1969 a total of almost 2,800 bodies were recovered from mass graves, with 4 major mass grave finds.&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;
* A few months after the Battle, about 1,200 civilian bodies were found in 18 hastily concealed mass graves.&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;
* A second major group of graves were discovered In the first 7 months of 1969.&lt;ref name="his" /&gt; In February 1968, a list of 428 names of people identified from the recovered bones was released by local authorities.&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;
* In September 1969, three Communist defectors confessed to the 101st Airborne Division intelligence officers that they witnessed several hundred people being killed in a 100-yard area at Da Mai Creek bed (about 10 miles south of Huế).&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;
* In November 1969, another major mass grave were fount at Phu Thu Salt Flats, near the fishing village of Lương Viện, Vinh Hưng commune, Phú Lộc provincial district, 10 miles east of Huế and halfway between the cities of Huế and [[Đà Nẵng]].&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;

==Dispute==
In [[Bùi Tín]]'s 2002 memoir, ''From Enemy to Friend: a North Vietnamese perspective on the war'', the former PAVN Colonel acknowledged that executions of civilians did occur in Huế. However, he added that under the intensity of the American bombardment, discipline of the troops disintegrated. The "units from the north" had been "told that Huế was the stronghold of feudalism, a bed of reactionaries, the breeding ground of Cần Lao Party loyalists who remained true to the memory of former South Vietnamese president [[Ngô Đình Diệm]] and of Nguyễn Văn Thiệu's Democracy Party."&lt;ref name="Bùi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bùi|first=Tín|title=From enemy to friend: a North Vietnamese perspective on the war|date=May 17, 2002|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=University of Michigan|isbn=978-1557508812|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin explained that over 10,000 prisoners were taken at Huế, with the most important of them sent to North Vietnam for imprisonment. When U.S. Marines launched their counterattack to retake the city, Communist troops were instructed to move the prisoners with the retreating troops. According to Tín, in the "panic of retreat," the company and battalion commanders shot their prisoners "to ensure the safety of the retreat."&lt;ref name="his" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bùi" /&gt;

[[Marilyn B. Young]] disputes the "official figures" of executions at Huế. While acknowledging that there were executions, she cites freelance journalist Len Ackland, who was at Huế, who estimated the number to be somewhere between 300 and 400.&lt;ref name=his /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laderman&gt;{{cite book|last=Laderman|first=Scott|title=Tours of Vietnam: War, Travel Guides, and Memory|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=Duke University Press Books|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-0822344148|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zzXtbyYXu7cC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=marilyn+young+revolutionary+administration#v=onepage&amp;q=marilyn%20young%20revolutionary%20administration&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngo Vinh Long claims that 710 people were killed by the communists. In an interview he stated, "Yeah, there was a total of 710 persons killed in the Huế area, from my research, not as many as five thousand, six thousand, or whatever the Americans claimed at that time, and not as few as four hundred as people like some of the people in the peace movement here claim...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsang|first=Daniel C.|title=Vietnam Today, Ngo Vinh Long, interviewed by Daniel C.

The Italian journalist [[Oriana Fallaci]] reported that "In the last few days the Vietcong lost their heads and did nothing but make reprisals, kill, punish". But citing a French priest she spoke to in Huế, she also claimed that the death toll of up to 8,000 included deaths due to American bombardment, and at least 200 people, and perhaps as many as 1,100, who were killed following the liberation of Huế by the US and ARVN forces.&lt;ref name=Laderman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fallaci&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fallaci|first=Oriana|title=Working Up To Killing|journal=Washington Monthly|date=February 1972|pages=39–46|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/WashingtonMonthly-1972feb-00039|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley Karnow wrote that the bodies of those executed by South Vietnamese teams were thrown into common graves.&lt;ref name=Laderman /&gt; Some reports alleged that South Vietnamese "revenge squads" had also been at work in the aftermath of the battle, searching out and executing citizens that had supported the communist occupation.&lt;ref name="Oberdorfer, pp. 232–233"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willbanks, pp. 101–102"/&gt;

Historian [[David Hunt (historian)|David Hunt]] posited that Douglas Pike's study for the U.S. Mission was, "by any definition, a work of [[propaganda]]". In 1988 Pike said that he had earlier been engaged in a conscious "effort to discredit the Vietcong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laderman|first=Scott|title=Tours of Vietnam: War, Travel Guides, and Memory|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=Duke University Press Books|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-0822344148|page=90|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zzXtbyYXu7cC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=marilyn+young+revolutionary+administration#v=onepage&amp;q=marilyn%20young%20revolutionary%20administration&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the editor of the ''[[New York Times]]'', historian [[Gareth Porter]] stated that there was little evidence that the Communists carried out more than "several hundred" political executions and revenge killings in Huế, with only U.S. official assertions identifying all of over 2,800 bodies found as "victims of Communist executions". He alleged that the site of one set of mass graves was also the site of a major battle in which some 250 Communist troops were reported killed in U.S air strikes, and that Saigon's minister of health, after visiting burial sites, said the bodies could have been Communist soldiers killed in battle. He dismissed Douglas Pike's claim that there were Communist blacklists of students and intellectuals to be killed as unsupported by interviews and captured Communist documents.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Porter, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/29/opinion/l-little-evidence-of-1968-tet-massacre-in-hue-587087.html Little Evidence of 1968 Tet Massacre in Hue], ''New York Times'', Oct. 29, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian James Willbanks concluded that "We may never know what really happened at Huế, but it is clear that mass executions did occur".&lt;ref name="his" /&gt; According to [[Stanley Karnow]], "Balanced accounts have made it clear, however, that the Communist butchery at Huế did take place—perhaps on an even larger scale than reported during the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elliot|first=Duong Van Mai|title=RAND in Southeast Asia: A History of the Vietnam War Era|chapter=The End of the War|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2010|isbn=9780833047540|page=501}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Kiernan]]'s 2017 history of Vietnam acknowledges that "thousands" were killed at Huế in "possibly the largest atrocity of the war."&lt;ref name="Kiernan 444"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Ben Kiernan|last=Kiernan|first=Ben|title=Viet Nam: A History from Earliest Times to the Present|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2017|isbn=9780190627300|p=444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Reports of the Massacre had a profound impact on the South Vietnamese for many years after the Tet Offensive, with an anticipation of a bloodbath following any North Vietnamese takeover, like the one in Huế. Novelist James Jones, in a ''New York Times'' article wrote, "Whatever else they accomplished, the Huế massacres effectively turned the bulk of the South Vietnamese against the Northern Communists. In South Vietnam, wherever one went, from Can Tho in the delta to Tay Ninh to Kontum in the north, and of course in Huế, the 1968 Tet massacres were still being talked about in 1973."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=James|title=In the Shadow of Peace|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 10, 1973|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/118191345|agency=ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851–2010)|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipation of a bloodbath was a major factor in the widespread panic and chaos across South Vietnam when North Vietnam executed their [[1975 Spring Offensive]], and the panic culminated in the disintegration and defeat of South Vietnamese military forces, and the [[Fall of Saigon|fall of the Republic of Vietnam]] on April 30, 1975.&lt;ref name=his/&gt; Today, the Massacre remains unrecognized and entirely ignored in the Vietnamese communist government's [[War Remnants Museum]] in [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref name=Tucker/&gt; The Vietnamese Government still doesn't acknowledge that a massacre took place and does not allow any public dissent from this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/15/vietnam-war-government-accounts-1968-216973|title=Why Vietnam Isn't Talking About 1968|publisher=Politico|author=Bennett Murray|date=15 February 2018|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21286">'''Medicalization''' or '''medicalisation''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|see spelling differences]]) is the process by which human conditions and problems come to be defined and treated as [[medical conditions]], and thus become the subject of medical study, diagnosis, [[Preventive medicine|prevention]], or treatment. Medicalization can be driven by new evidence or hypotheses about conditions; by changing social attitudes or economic considerations; or by the development of new medications or treatments.

Medicalization is studied from a [[sociology|sociologic perspective]] in terms of the role and power of professionals, patients, and corporations, and also for its implications for ordinary people whose self-identity and life decisions may depend on the prevailing concepts of health and illness. Once a condition is classified as medical, a [[medical model of disability]] tends to be used in place of a [[social model of disability|social model]]. Medicalization may also be termed "'''pathologization'''" or (pejoratively) "[[disease mongering]]". Since medicalization is the social process through which a condition becomes a medical disease in need of treatment, medicalization may be viewed as a benefit to human society. Upon identification of a condition as a disease, certain symptoms and conditions can be treated, and this will improve the overall quality of life.

==Development of the concept==
The concept of medicalization was devised by sociologists to explain how medical knowledge is applied to behaviors which are not self-evidently medical or biological.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Kevin|title=An introduction to the sociology of health and illness|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0-7619-6400-2|pages=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bHxQBNWGHMC&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''medicalization'' entered the sociology literature in the 1970s in the works of [[Irving Zola]], [[Peter Conrad (sociologist)|Peter Conrad]] and [[Thomas Szasz]], among others. According to Dr. Cassell's book, ''The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine (2004),'' the expansion of medical social control is being justified as a means of explaining deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173843216|title=The nature of suffering and the goals of medicine|last=1928-|first=Cassell, Eric J.,|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195156164|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=173843216}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sociologists viewed medicalization as a form of social control in which medical authority expanded into domains of everyday existence, and they rejected medicalization in the name of liberation. This critique was embodied in works such as Conrad's "The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on medicalization of deviance", published in 1973 ([[Hyperkinetic disorder|hyperkinesis]] was the term then used to describe what we might now call [[ADHD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conrad P |title=The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on the medicalization of deviant behavior |journal=Soc Probl |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=12&amp;ndash;21 |date=October 1975 |pmid=11662312 |doi= 10.1525/sp.1975.23.1.03a00020|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[opium]] was used to pacify children in ancient Egypt before 2000 BC.

These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz,1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of "psychotechnology" (Chorover,1973).

In the 1975 book ''Limits to medicine: Medical nemesis'' (1975), [[Ivan Illich]] put forth one of the earliest uses of the term "medicalization". Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through [[iatrogenesis]], a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Illich saw iatrogenesis occurring on three levels: the ''clinical'', involving serious [[side effects]] worse than the original condition; the ''social'', whereby the general public is made docile and reliant on the medical profession to cope with life in their society; and the ''structural'', whereby the idea of aging and dying as medical illnesses effectively "medicalized" human life and left individuals and societies less able to deal with these "natural" processes.

The concept of medicalization dovetailed with some aspects of the 1970s [[feminist]] movement. Critics such as [[Barbara Ehrenreich|Ehrenreich]] and English (1978) argued that women's bodies were being medicalized by the predominantly male medical profession. Menstruation and pregnancy had come to be seen as medical problems requiring interventions such as [[hysterectomies]].

[[Marxist]]s such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive [[capitalist]] society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as [[social inequality]] and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. Others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Culture, Health and Illness|last = Helman|first = Cecil|publisher = Arnold|year = 2007|isbn = 9780340914502|location = London|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/?id=C3BoQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the power and prestige of the medical profession, including the use of terminology to mystify and of professional rules to exclude or subordinate others.

Tiago Correia (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Correia |first=Tiago |year=2017 |title=Revisiting Medicalization: A Critique of the Assumptions of What Counts As Medical Knowledge |journal=Front. Sociol. |volume=2 |issue=14 |doi=10.3389/fsoc.2017.00014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers an alternative perspective on medicalization. He argues that medicalization needs to be detached from biomedicine to overcome much of the criticism it has faced, and to protect its value in contemporary sociological debates. Building on [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]]'s hermeneutical view of medicine, he focuses on medicine's common traits, regardless of empirical differences in both time and space. Medicalization and social control are viewed as distinct analytical dimensions that in practice may or may not overlap. Correia contends that the idea of "making things medical" needs to include all forms of medical knowledge in a global society, not simply those forms linked to the established (bio)medical professions. Looking at "knowledge", beyond the confines of professional boundaries, may help us understand the multiplicity of ways in which medicalization can exist in different times and societies, and allow contemporary societies to avoid such pitfalls as "demedicalization" (through a turn towards [[complementary and alternative medicine]]) on the one hand, or the over-rapid and unregulated adoption of biomedical medicine in non-western societies on the other. The challenge is to determine what medical knowledge is present, and how it is being used to medicalize behaviors and symptoms.

== Professionals, patients, corporations and society ==
Several decades on the definition of medicalization is complicated, if for no other reason than because the term is so widely used. Many contemporary critics position [[pharmaceutical companies]] in the space once held by doctors as the supposed [[catalysts]] of medicalization. Titles such as ''"The making of a disease"'' or ''"Sex, drugs, and marketing"'' critique the [[pharmaceutical industry]] for shunting everyday problems into the domain of professional [[biomedicine]]. At the same time, others reject as implausible any suggestion that society rejects [[drugs]] or [[drug companies]] and highlight that the same drugs that are allegedly used to treat [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]s from [[societal norms]] also help many people live their lives. Even scholars who critique the societal implications of brand-name drugs generally remain open to these drugs' curative effects — a far cry from earlier calls for a revolution against the biomedical establishment.  The emphasis in many quarters has come to be on "overmedicalization" rather than "medicalization" in itself.

Others, however, argue that in practice the process of medicalization tends to strip subjects of their social context, so they come to be understood in terms of the prevailing biomedical [[ideology]], resulting in a disregard for overarching social causes such as unequal distribution of power and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15210098 | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.01.003 | volume=59 | issue=6 | title=The medical text: between biomedicine and hegemony |date=September 2004 | author=Filc D | journal=Soc Sci Med | pages=1275–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of publications by [[Mens Sana Monographs]] have focused on medicine as a [[corporate]] capitalist enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=2;spage=19;epage=51;aulast=Singh "Medicine as a corporate enterprise, patient welfare centered profession, or patient welfare centered professional enterprise?"] Mens Sana Monographs, 3(2), p19-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=1;spage=5;epage=35;aulast=Singh "The connection between academia and industry"], Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p5-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=1;spage=41;epage=80;aulast=Singh "Public welfare agenda or corporate research agenda?"], Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p41-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Relación Médico Paciente.png|thumb|right|Conversation between doctor and patient]]

The physician's role in this present-day notion of medicalization is similarly complex. On the one hand, the doctor remains an authority figure who [[prescribes]] [[pharmaceuticals]] to [[patient]]s. However, in some countries, such as the USA, ubiquitous [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] encourages patients to ask for particular drugs by name, thereby creating a conversation between consumer and drug company that threatens to cut the doctor out of the loop. Additionally, there is a widespread concern regarding the extent of the [[pharmaceutical marketing]] direct to doctors and other healthcare professionals. Examples of this direct marketing are visits by salespeople, funding of journals, training courses or conferences, incentives for prescribing, and the routine provision of "information" written by the pharmaceutical company.

The role of patients in this economy has also changed. Once regarded as passive victims of medicalization, patients can now occupy active positions as [[advocates]], [[consumer]]s, or even agents of change.

The antithesis of medicalization is the process of [[paramedicalization]], where human conditions come under the attention of [[alternative medicine]], [[traditional medicine]] or any of numerous non-medical health approaches. Medicalization and paramedicalization can sometimes be contradictory and conflicting, but they also support and strengthen each other since they both ensure that questions of health and illness stay in sharp focus in defining human conditions and problems.

== Areas ==
A 2002 editorial in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' warned of inappropriate medicalization leading to disease mongering, where the boundaries of the definition of illnesses are expanded to include personal problems as medical problems or risks of diseases are emphasized to broaden the market for medications. The authors noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inappropriate medicalisation carries the dangers of unnecessary labelling, poor treatment decisions, iatrogenic illness, and economic waste, as well as the opportunity costs that result when resources are diverted away from treating or preventing more serious disease. At a deeper level it may help to feed unhealthy obsessions with health, obscure or mystify sociological or political explanations for health problems, and focus undue attention on pharmacological, individualised, or privatised solutions.&lt;ref name=Moynihan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moynihan|first1=Ray|last2=Heath|first2=Iona|last3=Henry|first3=David|title=Selling sickness: the pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering|journal=[[BMJ]]|date=13 April 2002|volume=324 | issue = 7342 |pages=886–891|pmid=11950740|pmc=1122833|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For many years, marginalized psychiatrists (such as [[Peter Breggin]], [[Paula Caplan]], [[Thomas Szasz]]) and outside critics (such as [[Stuart A. Kirk]]) have "been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality". More recently these concerns have come from insiders who have worked for and promoted the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (e.g., [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]], [[Allen Frances]]).&lt;ref name=stuarta&gt;{{cite book |author= Kirk, S. A., Gomory, T., &amp; Cohen, D. |title=Mad Science: Psychiatric Coercion, Diagnosis, and Drugs |year=2013 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page= 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Rush]], the father of American psychiatry, claimed that Black people had black skin because they were ill with hereditary leprosy. Consequently, he considered [[vitiligo]] as a "spontaneous cure".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Thomas Szasz | title=The Manufacture of Madness | publisher=Syracuse University Press | year=1970 | pages=153–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Franco Basaglia]] and his followers, whose approach pointed out the role of psychiatric institutions in the control and medicalization of deviant behaviors and social problems, psychiatry is used as the provider of scientific support for social control to the existing establishment, and the ensuing standards of deviance and normality brought about repressive views of discrete social groups.&lt;ref name="Sapouna"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sapouna|first1=Lydia |last2=Herrmann|first2=Peter|title=Knowledge in Mental Health: Reclaiming the Social |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1-X6iP-m9UC&amp;pg=PA70|publisher=Nova Publishers |location=Hauppauge|year=2006|page=70|isbn=1-59454-812-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}} As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions code menaces to authority as mental diseases during political disturbances.&lt;ref name="Metzl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Metzl|first=Jonathan|title=The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease|year=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-8070-8592-8|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1Bg9QEiCAMC&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}

The [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] allegedly caused from the 1980s a "profound re-medicalization of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Aggleton, Peter |author2=Parker, Richard Bordeaux |author3=Barbosa, Regina Maria |title=Framing the sexual subject: the politics of gender, sexuality, and power |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-520-21838-8 |oclc= |doi=}} p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carole S. Vance "Anthropology Rediscovers Sexuality: A Theoretical Comment." Social Science and Medicine 33 (8) 875-884 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis of [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] has caused some controversy, and psychologist [[Peggy Kleinplatz]] has criticized the diagnosis as the medicalization of normal human behavior, that occurred while [[fluoxetine]] (also known as Prozac) was being repackaged as a PMDD therapy under the trade named [[Sarafem]].&lt;ref name="offman2004"&gt;Offman A, Kleinplatz PJ (2004). Does PMDD Belong in the DSM? Challenging the Medicalization of Women's Bodies. ''The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality'', Vol. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has received less attention, it is claimed that [[masculinity]] has also faced medicalization, being deemed damaging to health and requiring regulation or enhancement through drugs, technologies or therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60603319|title=Medicalized masculinities|date=2006|publisher=Temple University Press|others=Rosenfeld, Dana, 1958-, Faircloth, Christopher A., 1966-|isbn=1592130976|location=Philadelphia|oclc=60603319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kittrie, a number of phenomena considered "deviant", such as [[alcoholism]], [[drug addiction]], [[prostitution]], [[pedophilia]], and [[masturbation]] ("self-abuse"), were originally considered as moral, then legal, and now medical problems.&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Nick |title=The therapeutic community movement: charisma and routinization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lc4OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1989 |page=1 |isbn=0-415-02913-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Kittrie"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kittrie |first=Nicholas |title=The right to be different: deviance and enforced therapy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIVqAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |location= |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=0-8018-1319-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innumerable other conditions such as obesity, smoking cigarettes, draft malingering, bachelorhood, divorce, unwanted pregnancy, kleptomania, and grief, have been declared a disease by medical and psychiatric authorities who hold impeccable institutional credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Thomas Szasz | title=The Theology of Medicine | publisher=Harper &amp; Row | year=1977 | page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these perceptions, peculiar deviants were subjected to moral, then legal, and now medical modes of social control.&lt;ref name="Manning"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Similarly, Conrad and Schneider concluded their review of the medicalization of deviance by identifying three major paradigms that have reigned over deviance designations in different historical periods: deviance as sin; deviance as crime; and deviance as sickness.&lt;ref name="Manning"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conrad|first1=Peter|last2=Schneider |first2=Joseph |title=Deviance and medicalization: from badness to sickness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYpZjDD67dkC&amp;pg=PA36|publisher=Temple University Press|location=|year=1992|page=36|isbn=0-87722-999-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}}

According to Mike Fitzpatrick, resistance to medicalization was a common theme of the [[gay liberation]], [[anti-psychiatry]], and [[feminist movement]]s of the 1970s, but now there is actually no resistance to the advance of government intrusion in lifestyle if it is thought to be justified in terms of public health.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Mike|title=From ‘nanny state’ to ‘therapeutic state’|journal=[[The British Journal of General Practice]]|date=August 2004|volume=1|issue=54(505)|pages=645|pmid=15517694|pmc=1324868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the pressure for medicalization also comes from society itself.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick/&gt; Feminists, who once opposed state intervention as oppressive and patriarchal, now demand more coercive and intrusive measures to deal with child abuse and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick/&gt;

According to [[Thomas Szasz]], "the [[Therapeutic State|therapeutic state]] swallows up everything human on the seemingly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of health and medicine, just as the theological state had swallowed up everything human on the perfectly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of God and religion".&lt;ref name="Szasz, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=The Therapeutic State: The Tyranny of Pharmacracy|journal=[[The Independent Review]]|date=Spring 2001|volume=V|issue=4|pages=485–521|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_05_4_szasz.pdf|accessdate=20 January 2012|issn=1086-1653}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|515}}

Dunaway]] on a horse-drawn [[limbers and caissons]] during a military funeral procession at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], 2008.]]

A '''military funeral in the United States''' is a memorial or burial rite given by the U.S. [[military]] for a [[United States Army|Soldier]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], [[United States Navy|Sailor]], [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guardsman]], or [[United States Air Force|Airman]] who died in battle, a [[veteran]], or other prominent military figures or a president. A military [[funeral]] may feature [[Honor guard|guards of honor]], the firing of [[3-volley salute|volley shots]] as a salute, drumming and other military elements, with a [[flag]] draping over the [[coffin]].

In the [[United States]], the [[United States Army Military District of Washington]] (MDW) is responsible for providing military funerals. "Honoring Those Who Served" is the title of the program for instituting a dignified military funeral with full honors to the nation's veterans.

As of January 1, 2000, Section 578 of Public Law 106-65 of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] mandates that the [[United States Armed Forces]] shall provide the rendering of honors in a military funeral for any eligible veteran if requested by his or her family. As mandated by federal law, an [[honor guard]] detail for the burial of an eligible veteran shall consist of no fewer than two members of the Armed Forces. One member of the detail shall be a representative of the parent armed service of the deceased veteran. The honor guard detail will, at a minimum, perform a ceremony that includes the folding and presenting of the [[flag of the United States]] to the [[next of kin]] and the playing of ''[[Taps]]'' which will be played by a [[bugle (instrument)|lone bugler]], if available, or by [[audio recording]]. Today, there are so few buglers available that the United States Armed Forces often cannot provide one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryfuneralhonors.osd.mil/faqpage.html|title=What is Military Funeral Honors?|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, federal law allows [[Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States|Reserve]] and [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] units to assist with funeral honors duty when necessary.

Generally, federal law allows for military funeral honors for all veterans who were [[Military discharge|discharged]] under circumstances "other than [[Military discharge#Dishonorable|dishonorable]]."  Funeral directors will require the veteran's [[DD Form 214]] to establish eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfuneralhonors.osd.mil/eligpage.html|title=How do I establish veteran eligibility?|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who are eligible for military funerals and full honors in the United States include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryfuneralhonors.osd.mil/eligpage.html|title=Who is eligible for Military Funeral Honors?|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Active duty]] or [[Selected Reserve]] in the United States Armed Forces.
* Former active duty or Selected Reserve who departed under conditions other than dishonorable in the United States Armed Forces.
* Former [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] servicemen or servicewomen who completed at least one term or period of initial obligated service in the Selected Reserve and departed under conditions other than dishonorable.
* Former servicemen or servicewomen who were discharged due to a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty.

[[File:Taps Caspar Weinberger.jpg|right|225px|thumb|A bugler sounds ''[[Taps]]'' during the funeral of former United States Secretary of Defense [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], 2006.]][[File:US Navy 040224-N-6213R-007 Members of the U.S. Forces Honor Guard march during the funeral for retired Adm. Thomas H. Moorer.jpg|right|225px|thumb|Escort platoons marching during the military funeral of Admiral [[Thomas Hinman Moorer]] in Arlington National Cemetery, 2004.]]
In the United States, there are several types of military funerals such as those performed at Arlington National Cemetery, which include and omit certain components depending on the status of the deceased (active, retired, [[veteran]], [[Military rank|rank]]/occupation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arlington National Cemetery|publisher=Military.com|url=http://www.military.com/benefits/content/burial-and-memorial/arlington-national-cemetery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Standard honor''' military funerals include the following:
* A [[United States military chaplains|military chaplain]] for family members.
* A casket draped in the [[flag of the United States]] and as a [[Pall (funeral)|pall]].
* A casket team serving as [[honor guard]]s in a ceremonial role over the remains and as [[pallbearer]]s.
* For funerals for an enlisted [[Non-commissioned officer#United States|non-commissioned officer]] of E-9 and Officers, the casket is transported via a horse-drawn [[limbers and caissons]]. For all other funerals, the casket is transported using a [[hearse]].
* Fighter jets in [[missing man formation]] by the [[United States Air Force]] may perform an aerial flyover.
* The formation of a rifle party consisting of an odd number of service members, between 3 and 7, will fire a [[three-volley salute]] (size varies according to the rank of the deceased).
* The playing of ''[[Taps]]'' is performed by a lone [[bugle]]r or an audio recording, at a distance 30 to 50 yards from the grave site while a “[[Final Salute]]” is given.  (In specific cases with the United States Military Academy, a muffled [[drum roll]] might accompany the bugler.)

'''Full honor''' military funerals include all standard honors in addition to the following:
* For funerals of [[commanding officer]]s of O-6 ([[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]]/[[Captain (United States)|Captain]]) and above, a caparisoned, [[riderless horse]], symbolizing a fallen leader, will follow the limbers and caissons.
* For funerals of [[general officer]]s and [[flag officer]]s of O-10 ([[four-star rank]]), a 17 gun salute is fired; O-9 ([[three-star rank]]), a 15 gun salute is fired; O-8 ([[two-star rank]]), a 13 gun salute is fired; O-7 ([[one-star rank]]), an 11 gun salute is fired.
* A [[United States military bands|military band]] and an [[Platoon|escort platoon]] participate (size varies according to the rank of the deceased).

'''Armed forces''' military funerals include all standard and full honors in addition to the following:

* Escort platoons from all five branches of the United States Armed Forces participate.
* These funerals are reserved for the [[President of the United States]] (as [[commander-in-chief#United States|commander-in-chief]]), the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and officers granted multiple-service command.
* For funerals of presidents, a [[21 gun salute]] using [[artillery piece|artillery]] and [[artillery battery|battery piece]]s is fired (not to be confused with a [[three-volley salute]]), while all other high state officials receive 19 gun salutes.

When a spouse or other dependent of a current or former member of the United States Armed Forces is buried, the military service in which the primary party served will provide a casket team and a chaplain. No other military honors will be rendered unless the spouse served in the military.

The [[flag of the United States]] draped over the casket is meticulously folded thirteen times by a total of six honor guards, three on each side of the casket.  When the flag is completely folded, the stars point upwards, which remind Americans of their [[United States national motto|national motto]], ''[[In God We Trust]]''.&lt;ref name="American Legion"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.legion.org/flag/folding|title =Flag folding procedures and symbols|publisher = [[American Legion]]|accessdate = 2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlos Zamorano"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lti2VdlRkxEC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Flag+Folding++meaning#v=onepage&amp;q=Flag%20Folding%20%20meaning&amp;f=false|author=Carlos Zamorano|title =God Bless America|publisher =Xlibris, Corp.|accessdate = 2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="US Flag"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.usflag.org/foldflag.html|title =Flag Folding|publisher = US Flag|accessdate = 2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the flag is completely folded and tucked in, it takes on the appearance of a [[bicorne|tricorne]] hat, reminding Americans of the soldiers who served under General [[George Washington]], and the sailors and Marines who served under Captain [[John Paul Jones]], who were followed by their comrades and shipmates in the United States Armed Forces.&lt;ref name="American Legion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlos Zamorano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US Flag"/&gt;

An honor guard composed of one or more branches of the [[United States Armed Forces]], presents the flag to the [[next of kin]]. The presenter, if possible a member of the same service as the deceased, will lean forward &lt;ref&gt;https://www.veteransflagdepot.com/flag-presentation-protocol-and-flag-folding/&lt;/ref&gt; while presenting the folded flag, with the straight edge of the flag facing the recipient.  The presenter then recites the following wording, which was standardized on April 20, 2012:&lt;ref name="NFDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfda.org/additional-tools-veterans/3098-dept-of-defense-issues-standardized-flag-presentation-text.html|title=Dept. of Defense Issues Standardized Flag Presentation Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|On behalf of the President of the United States, the United States (Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force or Coast Guard ), and a grateful nation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one's honorable and faithful service.}}

Three spent [[Cartridge (firearms)|shell-casings]], each representing one of three volleys, were sometimes slipped into the folds of the flag before its presentation to the [[next of kin]].  The intention was to convey that the presence of the shell-casings proved that a rifle volley had taken place in connection with the members funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://usmilitary.about.com/od/theorderlyroom/f/funeralhonors.htm|title=What do the three bullets represent in military funerals?|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://byron.org/VFW/HonorGuard.htm |title=Honor Guard |publisher=Byron.org |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107081357/http://byron.org/VFW/HonorGuard.htm |archivedate=November 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this practice has become infrequent and is rarely seen today as Title 4, Section 8(h) of the [[United States Code]] specifies that the flag should not be used as a receptacle for holding anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 U.S. Code § 8 - Respect for flag|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/4/8|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ramp ceremonies==
A "ramp ceremony" is a memorial ceremony, not an actual funeral, for a soldier killed in a war zone held at an airfield near or in a location where an airplane is waiting nearby to take the deceased's remains to his or her home country. The term has been in use since about 2005 and became common during the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;{{cite book| last=Conrad | first=John D. | title=What the thunder said: reflections of a Canadian officer in Kandahar  | page=162 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VElVkyY0eIC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=%22ramp+ceremony%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ramp%20ceremony%22&amp;f=false | year=2009 | accessdate=7 July 2010 | isbn= 978-1-55488-408-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nairobi Agreement''' was a peace deal between the [[Uganda]]n government of [[Tito Okello]] and the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) rebel group led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]. The accords were signed in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] in December 1985.

==Background==
On July 27, 1985, an army brigade of the Ugandan army ([[Uganda National Liberation Army|UNLA]]), commanded by Brigadier [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], staged a [[coup d'état]] against Milton Obote's government. The [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]] was dissolved and a Military Council was established to rule the country, first with Olara Okello, and later General [[Tito Okello]] as Chairman. Meanwhile, [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s NRA rebels were gaining ground, having taken advantage of the chaotic situation in the country, caused by power struggles within the government and a demoralized and disintegrating UNLA. &lt;ref name="loc"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html "A Country Study: Uganda"], ''[[Library of Congress]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tito Okello immediately and publicly invited all parties to the violence in Uganda to join in national reconciliation and nation building. All the major armed groups accepted this invitation, with the exception of the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM), the political wing of the National Resistance Army (NRA). President [[Julius Nyerere]] of [[Tanzania]] was approached by Tito Okello to facilitate a negotiated agreement between the NRM/A and the Military Council. Museveni and the NRM failed to turn up to the first round of talks in [[Dar es Salaam]], as they were possibly suspicious of Nyerere's friendship with the ousted president, Milton Obote. Alternative arrangements were made for discussions presided over by a mutually acceptable Kenyan delegation headed by President [[Daniel arap Moi]].

==Negotiations==
The arduous negotiations continued from 26 August to 17 December and have been documented by the then Permanent Secretary in the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [[Bethuel Kiplagat]].&lt;ref name="Kiplagat"&gt;[http://www.c-r.org/accord/uganda/accord11/reachingagreement.shtml "Reaching the 1985 Nairobi Agreement"], Bethuel Kiplagat, from [http://www.c-r.org/accord/uganda/accord11/index.shtml Lucima et al., 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Museveni and the NRM/A were angry that the revolution for which they had fought for four years had been 'hijacked' by the UNLA, which they viewed as having been discredited by gross human rights violations during the second regime of Milton Obote, commonly referred to as 'Obote II'.&lt;ref name="TindigarukayoI"&gt;Uganda, 1979-85: Leadership in Transition, Jimmy K. Tindigarukayo, The Journal of Modern African Studies, Vol. 26, No. 4. (Dec., 1988), pp. 619. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/161322 (JSTOR)]&lt;/ref&gt; The talks occasionally degenerated into slanging matches. Museveni denounced previous Ugandan regimes as "primitives" and "backward", initially refusing to negotiate with the "criminal" Military Council. Museveni and the NRM adopted a mercurial negotiating position, changing their demands and reintroducing supposedly resolved issues, leading Okello's team to accuse the NRM of prolonging the discussions unnecessarily. On one occasion, Museveni disappeared to Europe for three days, tabling new demands on his return. Both groups charged each other with maintaining links with soldiers loyal to the former president [[Idi Amin]].

==Final agreement and breakdown==
The final agreement, signed in [[Nairobi]], called for a ceasefire, demilitarisation of [[Kampala]], integration of the NRA and government forces, and absorption of the NRA leadership into the Military Council.&lt;ref name="Times_23Jan86"&gt;"Kampala troops flee guerrilla attacks", ''[[The Times]]'', 23 January 1986&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions were never met, however, and the ceasefire broke down almost immediately. Article 17(c) of the agreement called for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into human rights violations in Uganda since independence. This provided a clear disincentive for the UNLA to implement the peace plan, as it was likely that many of its leaders would be implicated in the abuses that had occurred during Obote II. The UNLA was also dismayed by article 7, which prescribed a national army numbering less than 8,500 troops with consequent unemployment for a large percentage of its 15,000 men.

The prospects of a lasting agreement were damaged further by the immediate context of the negotiations. The Kenyan team lacked an in depth knowledge of the situation in Uganda, the key personalities involved and their views, failing to build a meaningful relationship with the parties to the conflict. The negotiations excluded relevant Ugandan organisations, including the political parties. Several external actors, [[Libya]], [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]], had direct interests in the outcome of the talks, supporting one or several factions. The presence of these parties and possibly neutral international partners (such as the [[United Nations|UN]] or [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]]) may have prevented the failure of what cynics called the "Nairobi peace jokes".

Whether Museveni and the NRM/A were ever interested in a negotiated agreement is open to question. There was certainly no unequivocal commitment to such a settlement. Museveni and his allies refused to share power with generals they did not respect, not least while the NRA had the capacity to achieve an outright military victory. It is possible that the NRM/A merely used the four-month negotiations to present a positive image to the world and reorganise their forces.

'''Nebraskans For Peace''', or NFP, is a peace advocacy organization based in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]].

==History==
Founded in 1970, NFP is a statewide progressive organization conducting active grassroots campaigns focused on promoting [[peace]] and [[social justice]]. NFP was preceded by Rural Nebraskans for Peace, formed in 1968, and a short-lived University of Nebraska-Lincoln student group called Nebraskans for Peace in Vietnam, formed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;"New Group Organizes to Seek Solution in Viet Nam, ''Daily Nebraskan'', April 7, 1966.  Love Library archives, University of Nebraska-Lincoln.&lt;/ref&gt; A chapter has existed at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] since at least 2002&lt;ref&gt;(2002) [http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2002/10/24/News/Peace.Group.To.Hold.Rallies-1723737.shtml Peace Group to Hold Rallies.] ''Daily Nebraskan.''

==Recent campaigns==
NFP has been campaigning the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] to make the community of [[Whiteclay, Nebraska|Whiteclay]] officially "dry" so that local businesses can no longer sell [[alcohol]] to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on the neighboring [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] in [[South Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=1096412638 "Whiteclay alcohol license renewals spark protests"], ''Indian Country Today.''

Retrieved 5/15/07.&lt;/ref&gt; They allied with reservation members on this issue, marching together in 1999 after two murders of Lakota men in Whiteclay.

In 2005 President [[Cecilia Fire Thunder]] of the [[Oglala Sioux Tribe]] and the Nebraska governor's office made an historic agreement to deputize tribal police to enforce laws in Whiteclay, as Nebraska law enforcement was based 22 miles away in the county seat.&lt;ref name=APpatrol/&gt;  Fire Thunder was impeached in 2006 based on other issues.  According to Mark Vasina, a Nebraska activist interviewed in 2007, internal tribal politics appeared to interfere with the tribe's proceeding to implement the agreement.&lt;ref name=APpatrol/&gt; By mid-2007 the OST had hired no police personnel and made no commitments of funds; it lost the federal earmarked funds of $200,000.&lt;ref name=APpatrol&gt;[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/top-stories/article_aba602e2-a06e-5dfb-9f3e-38465e9f5a66.html AP, "Two years after 'historic' agreement, no tribe patrols in Whiteclay"], ''Rapid City Journal'', 14 May 2007, accessed 13 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Vasina, former president of Nebraskans for Peace, released his documentary ''[[The Battle for Whiteclay]]'' in 2008, showing the work of tribal activists to end beer sales at Whiteclay. In 2009 it won an award for Political Documentaries at a New York film festival. In December 2010, the Nebraska legislature authorized $10,000 for increased police patrols in Whiteclay.

Nebraksans for Peace has also worked in anti-war campaigns, ranging from weekly vigils against the Iraq war at the [[Nebraska State Capitol|State Capitol Building]] in Lincoln to peaceful protests at the [[Offutt Air Force Base]] in Omaha to commemorate and protest the dropping of [[nuclear bombs]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Krejci, J.

Nebraskans For Peace has worked against [[Nebraska Legislative Bill 775]], legislation that exempts certain businesses from specific taxations as an incentive to draw more businesses to the state. NFP's position against LB775 is based on the amount of public funds being diverted from the state's coffers while businesses qualifying for the exemption program are waived millions of dollars in taxes.&lt;ref&gt;(2004) [http://catloversagainstthebomb.org/nebraskareport/pdfs/np_2004/2004febreport.pdf LB 775 Special Report].

In 2007 the [[ACLU]] was investigating allegations that the [[FBI]] was [[spy]]ing on a number of current Nebraskans for Peace leaders, including Nan Graf, a board member, and Tim Rinne, the State Coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;(2007) [http://www.aclunebraska.org/FOIA%20pictures%20and%20bios.pdf "Is the FBI spying on you?"], ACLU-Nebraska website, Retrieved 5/15/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''People's Movement''' ({{lang-ga|Gluaiseacht an Phobail}}) is an Irish pressure group which campaigns on a number of issues such as protecting [[Irish neutrality]] and against greater [[European Union]] integration. The movement has also campaigned against the [[war on Iraq]] and the use of [[Shannon Airport]] by the [[US military]]. 

==Sponsors==
The Peoples Movement is sponsored by a number of public figures - artist [[Robert Ballagh]], former TD Alderman [[Declan Bree]], former MEP [[Patricia McKenna]], Cllr [[Chris O'Leary]], [[Bronwen Maher]], [[Thomas Pringle (politician)|Thomas Pringle]] TD, Cllr Cieran Perry, [[Catherine Connolly]] TD, Irish-language broadcaster and independent councillor Cllr. [[Seósamh Ó Cuaig]]
and Prof. John Maguire. The late [[Tony Gregory]] TD was also a patron.

==Lisbon Treaty==
The group actively campaigned against the constitutional amendment to ratify the ([[Treaty of Lisbon]]) stating that it would increase Ireland involvement in military commitments of the EU,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.ie/english8.html Lisbon Treaty - Peoples Movement Website]&lt;/ref&gt; compromise worker's rights and reduce the accountability and power of the national parliament of Ireland. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionsireland.org/results/referendum/refresult.cfm?ref=2008R Lisbon Treaty Election result - electionsireland.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5155">The '''''Jean Chrétien Pledge to Africa Act''''', full title '''''An Act to amend the Patent Act and the Food and Drugs Act (The Jean Chrétien Pledge to Africa)''''', (the ''Act'') a key piece of legislation implementing [[Canada's Access to Medicines Regime]], was a bill introduced as C-9 in the third session of the [[37th Canadian Parliament]].  It represented the first implementation of the [[TRIPS]] flexibilities declared in the August 30, 2003, General Council decision. Enacted in May 2004, it allows Canada to enact [[compulsory license]]s to export [[essential medicines]] to countries without the capacity to manufacture their own. Other countries that have since enacted similar legislation include [[Norway]] and [[India]].

==Purpose==

The purpose of the ''Act'' is to improve access to drugs for developing countries that lack the resources to manufacture the drugs and cannot afford to buy them at the usual market cost.&lt;ref name="Stephen Lewis Foundation Newsletter"&gt;http://www.stephenlewisfoundation.org/documents/SLFNewsletter2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The drugs that fight these diseases are expensive to create and manufacture and thus are usually unaffordable for those who need them the most.&lt;ref name="Matthew Rimmer. The Jean Chrétien Pledge to Africa Act: Patent Law and Humanitarian Aid Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents Jul. 2005:889-909"&gt;[http://works.bepress.com/matthew_rimmer/12/ The Jean Chrétien Pledge to Africa Act: Patent Law and Humanitarian Aid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pledge to Africa Act'' allows for the [[patent]]s on these drugs to be overridden so that manufacturers can produce generic versions of the drug to sell in underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref name="Stephen Lewis Foundation Newsletter" /&gt;

==Criticisms==

Some questions have been raised concerning the ''Act'''s efficacy, or lack thereof, at increasing the availability of pharmaceuticals in poor nations.&lt;ref name="Is Canada Delivering on its Pledge to Aid Africa?"&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/dapina/lw2970/ip/?p=188 ipilogue » Blog Archive » Is Canada Delivering on its Pledge to Aid Africa?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Access to Drugs Initiative"&gt;[http://www.law.utoronto.ca/accesstodrugs/History.htm Access to Drugs Initiative - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803105114/http://www.law.utoronto.ca/accesstodrugs/History.htm |date=2008-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jean Chrétien Pledge to Africa Act and its Impact on Improving Access to HIV/AIDS Treatment in Developing Countries"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icad-cisd.com/pdf/publications/ACCESS_FSandCaseStudies_FINALAug4_06_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213111739/http://icad-cisd.com/pdf/publications/ACCESS_FSandCaseStudies_FINALAug4_06_EN.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It took a full year from the time the bill was introduced to the time that it came into effect. Since the ''Act'' came into effect in 2005, only one drug has been manufactured and exported under the act.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  It has been suggested that this is because restrictions incorporated into the ''Act'' make it too difficult for generic drug companies to get permission to produce a generic and to export it to countries in need.  The process for obtaining [[patent]] exemptions under the ''Act'' is quite costly, and the exemption must be renewed every two years.  As such, it may not be economically viable for generic drug makers to apply for an exemption, or even if it is, the expense and mandated frequent renewals may tend to discourage generic makers from applying.&lt;ref name="Is Canada Delivering on its Pledge to Aid Africa?" /&gt;  Additionally, exporting pharmaceuticals under the ''Act'' to countries that are not part of the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS agreement]] is made more difficult by further restrictions.&lt;ref name="Is Canada Delivering on its Pledge to Aid Africa?" /&gt;

'''Samuel Oppenheimer''' (born June 21, 1630, [[Heidelberg]] – May 3, 1703, [[Vienna]]) was a [[Ashkenazi Jew|Ashkenazi Jewish]] banker, imperial court diplomat, [[Factor (agent)|factor]], and military supplier for the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. He enjoyed special favor of Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], to whom he advanced considerable sums of money for the [[Great Turkish War]]. [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] brought him a large number of valuable Hebrew manuscripts from Turkey, which became the nucleus of the famous [[David Oppenheim (rabbi)|David Oppenheim]] Library, now part of the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford.

Although the [[Judaism|Jews]] had been recently expelled from Vienna in 1670, the emperor permitted Oppenheimer to settle there, together with his "Gesinde", his followers, who included a number of Jewish families. He even received the privilege of building a mansion in the heart of [[Vienna]]. He was appointed "''Oberfaktor''" and [[court Jew]] at the recommendation of Margrave [[Ludwig (given name)|Ludwig]] of [[Baden]], the imperial general in [[Hungary]], to whom he had advanced 100,000 [[South German gulden|gulden]] for war expenses. He also enabled Prince Eugene to provide medical attendance for the army during the Turkish war. About the year 1700, a riot broke out, possibly sanctioned by the royal court, to persuade Oppenheimer to relieve the court's debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Johnson (writer) |first=Paul |last=Johnson |title=A History of the Jews |publisher=Phoenix |location=London |year=1996 |pages=256–258 |isbn=1-85799-380-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the riot, houses were sacked and property looted, including Oppenheimer's. As a result, one man was hanged for sacking Oppenheimer's house and others were imprisoned for participating in the disturbance. &lt;!--When Austria was embarrassed by its depleted exchequer on the outbreak of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], in 1701, Samuel Oppenheimer and his two sons, together with the most the [[Upper Rhenish states]], [[Tyrol]], [[Bavaria]] ??? Complete the sentence?--&gt;

Oppenheimer took steps to suppress the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[Johann Andreas Eisenmenger#His Entdecktes Judenthum|''Entdecktes Judenthum'']] (''Judaism Unmasked'') treatise by spending large sums of money to win the court and the Jesuits to the side of the Jews. As a result, an imperial edict was issued forbidding circulation of the [[Johann Andreas Eisenmenger|Eisenmenger]]'s work. Oppenheimer was employed also by the emperor in political missions which were often of a delicate nature.

When Oppenheimer died, the state refused to honor its debts to his heir Emanuel and had his firm declared bankrupt. His death brought deep financial crisis to the state; it experienced great difficulty in securing the credit necessary to meet its needs. Emanuel appealed to European rulers to whom the state owed money and who intervened on his behalf. After deliberate procrastination, the state refused Emanuel's demand for 6 million florins and instead demanded 4 million florins from him. This amount was based on a sum which (with compound interest), according to the state, Oppenheimer had allegedly obtained by fraud at the beginning of his career. Emanuel died in 1721 and the Oppenheimer estate was auctioned in 1763. Although Oppenheimer was not himself learned, he was a benefactor on a scale hitherto unknown, building many synagogues and yeshivot and supporting their scholars.  He also paid ransom for the return of Jews captured during the Turkish wars and supported as well R. Judah he-Hasid’s voyage to Erez Israel in 1700.  Known as Judenkaiser by his contemporaries, he was a man whose complex personality, a mixture of pride and reserve, defied historical analysis.  Twenty years after his death it was estimated that more than 100 persons held residence in Vienna by virtue of their being included in Oppenheimer’s privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink= (writer) |first= |last= |title=Encyclopedia Judaica |year=1950 |publisher= |location= |pages=1431 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oppenheimer was buried in the Rossauer Cemetery, the oldest Jewish cemetery in Vienna (Seegasse 9). Stones in the cemetery were buried during WWII for protection. Many were recovered and the cemetery was restored in the 1980s. Samuel Oppenheimer's tombstone was not recovered. A photograph taken before the war reveals the elaborate inscriptions on his tombstone.

One of Oppenheimer's sons, [[Simon Wolf Oppenheimer]], established a banking house in [[Hanover]]. Simon Wolff's son, [[Jakob Wolf Oppenheimer]] continued the family banking house.  It was there, from 1757 to 1763, that [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] apprenticed and learned the banking business that would become synonymous with that [[Rothschild family|family name]]. Oppenheimer's descendants include the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]].

'''''Selling Apartheid: South Africa's Global Propaganda War''''' is a 2015 book by Ron Nixon, the Washington correspondent for the ''[[New York Times]]'' and a visiting associate in the Department of Media and Journalism Studies at the [[University of Witwatersrand]].

==Background and synopsis==
''Selling Apartheid'' is an in-depth investigation into the [[Foreign relations of South Africa during apartheid]] and the international propaganda campaign conducted by the apartheid government. Nixon's book contains a large number of previously secret records from archives in South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. It examines the diverse network of apartheid supporters and defenders from global corporations with business operations in South Africa to conservative religious organisations, and even anti-communist black conservatives aligned with right-wing [[Cold War]] politicians.

The book recalls a moment during Nixon's youth in which he was unwittingly given a [[propaganda magazine]] produced by South African intelligence services from his grandmother which painted a glowing picture filled with wild animals, sunsets and happy black people on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/01/selling-apartheid-new-book-lays-bare-south-africas-propaganda-war Selling apartheid: new book lays bare South Africa’s propaganda war] ''[[The Guardian]]'' Retrieved 15 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' Chris Serres wrote that ''Selling Apartheid'' "meticulously unpacks the complex web of relationships and covert money flows"&lt;ref name="startribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/review-selling-apartheid-by-ron-nixon/410586135/|title=Review: 'Selling Apartheid,' by Ron Nixon|website=StarTribune.com|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron Jacobs, writing for the ''Sri Lanka Guardian'' praised the book as an "essential addition to the volume of work on South Africa’s apartheid regime" which is "rich in detail".&lt;ref name="slguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slguardian.org/2016/12/selling-racism-a-lesson-from-pretoria/|website=slguardian.org|title=Selling Racism—A Lesson From Pretoria &amp;#8211; Sri Lanka Guardian|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{marketing}}
'''Social marketing''' is the use of marketing theory, skills and practices to achieve social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/social-marketing.html|title=What is social marketing? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the primary goal of achieving "[[Common good|social good]]". Traditional [[commercial marketing]] aims are primarily financial, though they can have positive social affects as well. In the context of public health, social marketing would promote general health, raise awareness and induce changes in behaviour. To see social marketing as only the use of standard commercial marketing practices to achieve non-commercial goals is an [[oversimplification|oversimplified view]].  

Social marketing seeks to develop and integrate [[marketing]] concepts with other approaches to [[social change]]. Social marketing aims to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good. The goal is to deliver competition-sensitive and segmented social change programs that are effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors=International Social Marketing Association, European Social Marketing Association &amp; Australian Association of Social Marketing|year=2013|title=Consensus Definition of Social Marketing|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Increasingly, social marketing is described as having "two parents." The "social parent" uses [[social science]] and [[social policy]] approaches. The "marketing parent" uses commercial and public sector [[marketing]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truss|first=Aiden|title=Social Marketing and Public Health: Theory and practice|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsEijRnC8GYC|editor=Jeff French |editor2=Clive Blair-Stevens |editor3=Dominic McVey |editor4=Rowena Merritt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent years have also witnessed a broader focus.  Social marketing now goes beyond influencing individual behaviour. It promotes socio-cultural and structural change relevant to social issues.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Jeff|last2=Gordon|first2=Ross|title=Strategic Social Marketing|date=2015|publisher=Sage|isbn=9781446248621|url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/strategic-social-marketing/book237965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, social marketing scholars are beginning to advocate for a broader definition of social marketing: "social marketing is the application of marketing principles to enable individual and collective ideas and actions in the pursuit of effective, efficient, equitable, fair and sustained social transformation".
The new emphasis gives equal weight to the effects (efficiency and effectiveness) and the process (equity, fairness and sustainability) of social marketing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saunders, S. G.|author2=Barrington, D. J.|author3=Sridharan, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2015|title=Redefining social marketing: beyond behavioural change|journal=Journal of Social Marketing|volume=5|issue=2|pages=160–168|doi=10.1108/JSOCM-03-2014-0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications ==
The first documented evidence of the deliberate use of marketing to address a social issue comes from a 1963 [[reproductive health]] program led by [[K. T. Chandy]] at the Indian Institute of Management in Calcutta, India.  Chandy and colleagues proposed, and subsequently implemented, a national [[family planning]] program with high quality, government brand condoms distributed and sold throughout the country at low cost. The program included an integrated consumer marketing campaign run with active point of sale promotion. Retailers were trained to sell the product aggressively, and a new organization was created to implement the program.&lt;ref&gt;Chandy, K.T., Balakrishman, T.R., Kantawalla, J.M., Mohan, K., Sen, N.P., Gupta, S.S. &amp; Srivastva, S. (1965). Proposals for family planning promotion: A marketing plan. Studies in Family Planning;1(6):7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Developing country|developing countries]], the use of social marketing expanded to [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|HIV prevention]], control of childhood [[diarrhea]] (through the use of [[Oral rehydration therapy|oral re-hydration therapies]]), [[malaria]] control and treatment, [[Portable water purification|point-of-use water treatment]], [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|on-site sanitation]] methods and the provision of basic health services.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R. C. (2011). An integrative model for social marketing. Journal of Social Marketing;1:54–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health promotion campaigns began applying social marketing in practice in the 1980s. In the United States, The National High Blood Pressure Education Program&lt;ref&gt;Roccella, E.J. &amp; Ward, G.W. (1984). The National High Blood Pressure Education Program: A description of its utility as a generic program model. Health Education Quarterly, 11(3): 225-242&lt;/ref&gt; and the community heart disease prevention studies in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and at Stanford University&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. &amp; Flora, J.A. (1988). Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention (Portable Document Format). Health Education Quarterly; 15 (3): 300, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach to address population-based risk factor behaviour change. Notable early developments also took place in Australia. These included the Victoria Cancer Council developing its [[smoking cessation|anti-tobacco]] campaign "Quit" (1988) and "SunSmart" (1988), its campaign against [[skin cancer]] which had the slogan "[[Slip-Slop-Slap|Slip! Slop! Slap!]]"&lt;ref name="VicHealth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |title=VicHealth History: Major Events and Milestones |work=VicHealth |publisher=Victorian Health Promotion Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719032451/http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, the field has rapidly expanded around the world to include active living communities, disaster preparedness and response, [[ecosystem]] and species conservation, environmental issues, development of volunteer or indigenous workforces, financial literacy, global threats of [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]], government corruption, improving the quality of health care, injury prevention, landowner education, [[marine conservation]] and ocean sustainability, patient-centered health care, reducing health disparities, [[sustainable consumption]], transportation demand management, [[water treatment]] and [[sanitation]] systems and youth gambling problems, among other social needs (See&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013) Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (Ed). Social marketing: Six volume set. London: SAGE Publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;).

On a wider front, by 2007, government in the United Kingdom announced the development of its first social marketing strategy for all aspects of health.&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"&gt;UK Department of Health, ''[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4094550 Choosing Health: Making Healthy Choices Easier]'', Cmd.6374 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US national health objectives&lt;ref name="HealthyPeople2020"&gt;US Department of Health and Human Services, ''[http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objectiveslist.aspx?topicId=18 Health Communication and Health Information Technology]''&lt;/ref&gt; included increasing the number of state health departments that report using social marketing in health promotion and disease prevention programs and increasing the number of schools of public health that offer courses and workforce development activities in social marketing.

Two other public health applications include the CDC's CDCynergy training and software application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthmarketing/cdcynergy/ |title=CDC - CDCynergy (NCHM) |accessdate=2007-10-19 |date=2006-06-27 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SMART (Social Marketing and Assessment Response Tool) in the U.S.&lt;ref name="SMART"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CTG/is_2-3_18/ai_108194963/ |title=Positioning Social Marketing as a Planning Process for Health Education |accessdate=2012-01-13 |last= Neiger |first=Brad L. |author2=Rosemary Thackeray |author3=Michael D. Barnes |author4= James F. McKenzie  |year=2003 |journal=American Journal of Health Studies |volume=18 |issue=2/3 |pages=75–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social marketing theory and practice has been progressed in several countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK, and in the latter a number of key government policy papers have adopted a strategic social marketing approach. Publications such as "Choosing Health" in 2004,&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"/&gt; "[http://www.nsmcentre.org.uk/component/remository/NSMC-Publications/Its-Our-Health-%28Summary-Report%29/ It's our health!]" in 2006 and "[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4139514 Health Challenge England]" in 2006, represent steps to achieve a strategic and operational use of social marketing. In India, [[AIDS]] controlling programs are largely using social marketing and social workers are largely working for it. Most of the social workers are professionally trained for this task.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

A variation of social marketing has emerged as a systematic way to foster more sustainable behavior. Referred to as community-based social marketing (CBSM) by Canadian environmental psychologist Doug McKenzie-Mohr, CBSM strives to change the behavior of communities to reduce their impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie-Mohr, D. (2000). Fostering sustainable behavior through community-based social marketing. American Psychologist, 55(5), 531-537.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that simply providing information is usually not sufficient to initiate behavior change, CBSM uses tools and findings from social psychology to discover the perceived barriers to behavior change and ways of overcoming these barriers. Among the tools and techniques used by CBSM are focus groups and surveys (to discover barriers) and commitments, prompts, social norms, social diffusion, feedback and incentives (to change behavior). The tools of CBSM have been used to foster sustainable behavior in many areas, including energy conservation,&lt;ref&gt;Schultz P. W., Nolan J. M., Cialdini R. B., Goldstein N. J., Griskevicius Vladas (2007). The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms. ''Psychological Science'', 18(5), 429-434.&lt;/ref&gt; environmental regulation&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, A. (2010). Using Community-Based Social Marketing Techniques to Enhance Environmental Regulation. ''Sustainability'', 2(4), 1138-1160&lt;/ref&gt; and recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Haldeman, T. &amp; Turner, J. (2009). Implementing a community-based social marketing program to increase recycling. ''Social Marketing Quarterly'', 15(3), 114-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the concept of strategic social marketing has emerged, which identifies that social change requires action at the individual, community, socio-cultural, political and environmental level, and that social marketing can and should influence policy, strategy and operational tactics to achieve pro-social outcomes.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"/&gt;

Other social marketing can be aimed at products deemed, at least by proponents, as socially unacceptable. One of the most notable is [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) which for many years has waged social marketing campaigns against the use of natural fur products. The campaigns' efficacy has been subject to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peek|first=Liz|title=Warm Weather Torments City Furriers|url=http://www.nysun.com/business/warm-weather-torments-city-furriers/43889/|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=New York Sun|date=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all social marketing campaigns are effective everywhere. For example, anti-smoking campaigns such as [[World No Tobacco Day]] while being successful (in concert with government tobacco controls) in curbing the demand for tobacco products in North America and in parts of Europe, have been less effective in other parts of the world such as China, India and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Fedyashin, [Opinion &amp; Analysis: World No Tobacco Day, Futile Attempt to Curb Smoking. http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20090529/155119204.html], RiaNovosti (Russia), May 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Prevalence of tobacco consumption]])

==Types ==
Social marketing uses the benefits of doing social good to secure and maintain [[customer engagement]]. In social marketing the distinguishing feature is therefore its "primary focus on social good, and it is not a secondary outcome.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Not all public sector and not-for-profit marketing is social marketing.

Public sector bodies can use standard marketing approaches to improve the promotion of their relevant services and organizational aims. This can be very important but should not be confused with social marketing where the focus is on achieving specific behavioral goals with specific audiences in relation to topics relevant to social good (e.g., health, sustainability, recycling, etc.). For example, a 3-month marketing campaign to encourage people to get a H1N1 vaccine is more tactical in nature and should not be considered social marketing. A campaign that promotes and reminds people to get regular check-ups and all of their vaccinations when they're supposed to encourages a long-term behavior change that benefits society. It can therefore be considered social marketing.

Social marketing can be confused with commercial marketing. A commercial marketer may only seek to influence a buyer to purchase a product. Social marketers have more difficult goals.  They want to make potentially difficult and long-term behavior changes in target populations, which may or may not involve purchasing a product.  For example, reducing cigarette smoking or encouraging use of condoms have difficult challenges to overcome that go beyond purchasing decisions.

Social marketing is sometimes seen as being restricted to a client base of non-profit organizations, health services groups, the government agency. However, the goal of inducing social change is not restricted to this narrow spectrum of organizations. Corporations, for example, can be clients.  Public relations or social responsibility departments may champion social causes such funding for the arts, which would involve social marketing.

Social marketing should not be confused with the societal marketing concept which was a forerunner of [[sustainable marketing]] in integrating issues of [[corporate social responsibility|social responsibility]] into commercial marketing strategies. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to social issues.

Social marketing applies a "customer oriented" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like anti-smoking campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

Social marketers must create competitive advantage by constantly adapting to and instigating change. With climate change in mind, adaptations to market changes are likely to be more successful if actions are guided by knowledge of the forces shaping market behaviours and insights that enable the development of sustainable competitive advantages.&lt;ref&gt;Shocker, Allan D., Rajendra K. Srivastava, and Robert W. Ruekert. "Challenges and Opportunities Facing Brand Management: An Introduction to the Special Issue." Journal of Marketing Research 31.2 (1994): 149. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confusion==
In 2006, [[Jupitermedia]] announced its "Social Marketing" service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/r_craiig_lefebvres_social/2006/08/hello_jupiter_a.html |title=Hello Jupiter? Anyone Home? |accessdate=2006-09-01 |last=Lefebvre |first=R. Craig |date=2006-08-30 |work=On Marketing and Social Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; with which it aims to enable website owners to profit from [[social media]]. Despite protests from the social marketing communities over the perceived hijacking of the term, Jupiter stuck with the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |title=Social Marketing vs. Social Marketing |accessdate=2006-09-01 |last=Schatsky |first=David |date=2006-09-01 |work=Jupiterresearch Analyst Weblogs |publisher=Jupitermedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303050738/http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |archivedate=2007-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jupiter's approach is more correctly (and commonly) referred to as [[social media optimization]].

==History ==

Many scholars ascribe the beginning of the field of social marketing to an article published by G.D. Wiebe in the Winter 1951-1952 edition of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiebe|first=G.D.|title=Merchandising Commodities and Citizenship on Television|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951–1952|volume=15|issue=Winter|pages=679|doi=10.1086/266353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Wiebe posed a rhetorical question: "Why can’t you sell brotherhood and rational thinking like you can sell soap?” He then went on to discuss what he saw as the challenges of attempting to sell a social good as if it were a commodity, thus identifying social marketing (though he did not label it as such) as a discipline unique from c
mmodity marketing. Yet, Wilkie &amp; Moore (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W. L., &amp; Moore, E. S. (2003). Scholarly research in marketing: Exploring the “4 eras” of thought development. Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing; 22(2):116–146.&lt;/ref&gt; note that the marketing discipline has been involved with questions about the intersection of marketing and society since its earliest days as a discipline.

A decade later, organizations such as the [[KfW Entwicklungsbank]] in Germany, the Canadian International Development Agency, the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs in The Netherlands, UK Department for International Development, [[US Agency for International Development]], [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]] began sponsoring social marketing interventions to improve family planning and achieve other social goals in Africa, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Michael|title=The Marketing Book|year=2012|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|pages=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=R. Craig|title=Social Marketing and Social Change: Strategies and Tools to Improve Health, Well-Being and the Environment\year=2013|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next milestone in the evolution of social marketing was the publication of "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change" in the ''[[Journal of Marketing]]'' by [[Philip Kotler]] and [[Gerald Zaltman]].&lt;ref name="Kotler 1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kotler|first=Philip|author2=Gerald Zaltman |title=Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=July 1971|volume=35|pages=3–12|url=https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/faculty/laba_m/425/07-fall/documents/Kotler-Zaltman.PDF|doi=10.2307/1249783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotler and Zaltman coined the term 'social marketing' and defined it as "the design, implementation, and control of programs calculated to influence the acceptability of social ideas and involving considerations of product planning, pricing, communication, distribution, and marketing research." They conclude that "social marketing appears to represent a bridging mechanism which links the behavior scientist's knowledge of human behavior with the socially useful implementation of what that knowledge allows."

Craig Lefebvre and June Flora introduced social marketing to the public health community in 1988,&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"/&gt; where it has been most widely used and explored. They noted that there was a need for "large scale, broad-based, behavior change focused programs" to improve public health (the community wide prevention of cardiovascular diseases in their respective projects) and outlined eight essential components of social marketing that still hold today:
#A consumer orientation to realize organizational (social) goals
#An emphasis on the voluntary exchanges of goods and services between providers and consumers
#Research in audience analysis and segmentation strategies
#The use of formative research in product and message design and the pretesting of these materials
#An analysis of distribution (or communication) channels
#Use of the [[marketing mix]]—using and blending product, price, place and promotion characteristics in intervention planning and implementation
#A process tracking system with both integrative and control functions
#A management process that involves problem analysis, planning, implementation and feedback functions&lt;ref name="Lefebvre"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lefebvre |first=R. Craig |author2=June A. Flora  |year=1988 |title=Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention |journal=Health Education Quarterly |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=300, 301 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/Publications/Social_Marketing_and_Public_Health_Intervention.pdf |format=Portable Document Format |accessdate=2008-04-30 |doi=10.1177/109019818801500305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of what they termed "social change campaigns", Kotler and [[Ned Roberto]] introduced the subject by writing, "A social change campaign is an organized effort conducted by one group (the change agent) which attempts to persuade others (the target adopters) to accept, modify, or abandon certain ideas, attitudes, practices or behavior." Their 1989 text was updated in 2002 by [[Philip Kotler]], [[Ned Roberto]] and Nancy Lee.&lt;ref name="Kotler2002"&gt;Kotler, Philip, Ned Roberto and Nancy Lee. ''Social Marketing: Improving the Quality of Life'', SAGE, 2002. ({{ISBN|0-7619-2434-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[University of Stirling]] was the first university to open a dedicated research institute to Social Marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ism.stir.ac.uk/|title=Institute for Social Marketing – University of Stirling|author=|date=|website=www.ism.stir.ac.uk|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2007, [[Middlesex University]] became the first university to offer a specialized [[postgraduate]] programme in Health &amp; Social Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524003618/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been an important development to distinguish between "strategic social marketing" and "operational social marketing".

Much of the literature and case examples focus on operational social marketing, using it to achieve specific behavioral goals in relation to different audiences and topics. However, there has been increasing efforts to ensure social marketing goes "upstream" and is used much more strategically to inform policy formulation and strategy development. Here the focus is less on specific audience and topic work but uses strong customer understanding and insight to inform and guide effective policy and strategy development.

Social marketing is also being explored as a method for social innovation, a framework to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices among professionals and organizations, and as a core skill for public sector managers and social entrepreneurs. It is being viewed as an approach to design more effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable approaches to enhance social well-being that extends beyond individual behavior change to include creating positive shifts in social networks and social norms, businesses, markets and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013). Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of social marketing research, with over 120 papers compiled in a six volume set.&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"/&gt;). For example, research now shows ways to reduce the intentions of people to binge drink or engage in dangerous driving. Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A. S., Christina K.C. Lee, Clinton Weeks and Maria Kaya (2013), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf "How to stop binge drinking and speeding motorists: Effects of relational-interdependent self-construable and self-referencing on attitudes toward social marketing "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160914/http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf |date=2015-04-27 }}, ''Journal of Consumer Behavior'', 12, 81-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6914">The phrase "'''Spieprzaj dziadu!'''" (which is sometimes translated from [[Polish language|Polish]] as "Piss off, you old git!").&lt;ref name=sarkozy&gt;[http://www.news24.com/World/News/Sarkozys-outburst-rings-bells-20080225 ''Sarkozy's outburst rings bells''], news24.com&lt;/ref&gt; was used by the late [[Poland|Polish]] President [[Lech Kaczyński]] on the street in the [[Praga]] district of [[Warsaw]] in response to a middle-aged [[heckler]] during the November 2002 Warsaw mayoral campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80271,5831123.html Gazeta.pl]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2002, after an afternoon campaign meeting, Kaczyński was about to get into his car when a unidentified passerby wearing a hat and dark glasses heckled him.
: Passerby: "You've changed parties, you've run away like rats."
: Lech Kaczyński: "Sir, piss off Sir! That's what I'd say to you."
: Passerby: "'Piss off, Sir'? Sir, you are just afraid of the truth!"
: Lech Kaczyński (closing door, from the seat of his car): "Piss off, old man!"
: Passerby (shouting to a journalist): "How can anyone respond like that: 'Piss off Sir'? I asked the man politely."&lt;ref&gt;Original Polish text reads:
: Passerby: "''Partie żeście zmienili, pouciekaliście jak szczury.''"
: Lech Kaczyński: "''Panie, spieprzaj pan! Oto panu powiem.''"
: Passerby: "'''Spieprzaj pan'? Panie, bo pan się prawdy boisz!''"
: Lech Kaczyński: "''Spieprzaj, dziadu!''"
: Passerby: "''Ale jak tak się można odzywać: 'spieprzaj pan'? Ja się grzecznie spytałem człowieka.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the passerby was, as of November 2009, unknown.&lt;ref name="biznes.banzaj.pl"&gt;[http://www.biznes.banzaj.pl/Spieprzaj-dziadu-srodkiem-platniczym-3100.html ''"Spieprzaj, dziadu!" środkiem płatniczym...''], Banzaj.pl&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the phrase had been quoted in television programmes and in films, had inspired websites, appeared on [[T-shirts]] and on a multitude of other objects.&lt;ref name=Wiadomosci&gt;[http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/gid,11828269,title,Wpadki-Lecha-Kaczynskiego,galeria.html Wiadomosci.pl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Afterwards, Lech Kaczyński explained that politicians also have the right to defend their honour: "I put up with the first lot of his insults. It was only after the second lot, that I told him firmly – though mildly for a Praga street – to go away."&lt;ref name=Wiadomosci/&gt;

In a separate incident in [[Lublin]], in 2008, a man identified only as Przemysław D., 34, also shouted "Spieprzaj, dziadu!" in the vicinity of Kaczyński and was prosecuted for insulting the President. The Polish edition of ''[[Newsweek]]'' questioned, in its own editorial, how Kaczyński could have complained that someone was rude to him, when his own phrase used in 2002 was equally rude to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redakcja.newsweek.pl/Tekst/Polityka-Polska/534194,Spieprzaj-dziadu-nie-zniewazylo-lecha-kaczynskiego.html ''"Spieprzaj dziadu" nie znieważyło Lecha Kaczyńskiego''], Newsweek.pl&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was brought up again by candidate [[Donald Tusk]], now Polish Prime Minister, during the 2005 presidential election campaign. On 26 September, during a televised debate with Kaczyński. According to Tusk, Kaczyński's remark had caused a furore at the time.{{fact|date=June 2012}}

In 2007, the [[Civic Platform]] political party included footage of the original incident in one of their campaign television advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.money.pl/archiwum/wiadomosci/artykul/spieprzaj;dziadu;-;po;przypomina;wpadki;pis-u,170,0,265386.html ''Spieprzaj dziadu – PO przypomina wpadki PiS-u''], Money.pl&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2007, [[Jerzy Szmajdziński]], the leader of the [[Democratic Left Alliance]], told Kaczyński "Spieprzaj dziadu!" after Kaczyński criticised the period of [[People's Republic of Poland|communism in Poland]] by saying that [[socialism]] was "a system run by riffraff for riffraff" ("socjalizm to był ustrój hołoty, dla hołoty").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=102581 ''"Spieprzaj dziadu" na "ustrój hołoty"''], Wprost&lt;/ref&gt; Kaczyński and Szmajdziński both later died in the same [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|plane crash in Smolensk]].

In 2009, while in Lublin, a member of the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Polish Parliament]] [[Janusz Palikot]] quoted the phrase in reference to Kaczyński and was reported to the police for insulting the President, a criminal offence in Poland. However, linguists were divided as to whether the insult, being a quotation, had a satirical function and was therefore protected by [[freedom of speech]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/wydarzenia/artykuly/146778,prokurator-poci-sie-nad-spieprzaj-dziadu.html ''Prokurator poci się nad "spieprzaj, dziadu"''], Dziennik&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Polish popular culture==
The phrase has been repeated in various television programmes, notably the [[sitcom]] ''[[Świat według Kiepskich]]'' ("The World According to the Kiepskis") and cult cartoon ''[[Włatcy móch]]''.&lt;ref name=Wiadomosci/&gt; It is used in the Polish versions of the computer game ''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]'' and also appears in a milder form ("Zjeżdżaj, dziadu" – "Get lost, old man") in the translations for the animated films ''[[Astérix at the Olympic Games (film)|Astérix at the Olympic Games]]'', ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.&lt;ref name=Wiadomosci/&gt; Wristbands have also been produced by those opposed to Kaczyński sporting the phrase.&lt;ref name=sarkozy/&gt;
In November 2009, seven years after the original incident, a new coin called the ''Seven Old Men of the Capital'' was introduced by a local businessman in Praga to commemorate the event. It was not legal tender, but could be exchanged for services in participating outlets in the Praga area. 10,000 coins were produced and each was worth seven [[zloties]].&lt;ref name="biznes.banzaj.pl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,7227340,_Spieprzaj_dziadu__w_bilonie.html ''"Spieprzaj dziadu" w bilonie''], Gazeta Wyborcza&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fakt.pl/Spieprzaj-dziadu-na-monecie,artykuly,56563,1.html ''Spieprzaj dziadu na... monecie''], Fakt&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379''', adopted on 10 November 1975 by a vote of 72 to 35 (with 32 abstentions), "determine[d] that [[Zionism]] is a form of [[racism]] and racial discrimination". The vote took place approximately one year after UNGA 3237 granted the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] "observer status", following PLO president [[Yasser Arafat]]'s "olive branch" speech to the General Assembly in November 1974. The resolution was passed with the support of the [[Soviet bloc]] and other then Soviet-aligned nations, in addition to the Arab- and Muslim-majority countries.

The determination that "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination", contained in the resolution, was revoked in 1991 with [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/86|UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86]].&lt;ref name="NYT: U.N. Repeals Its '75 Resolution Equating Zionism With Racism"/&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main|List of United Nations resolutions concerning Israel}}
In July 1920, at the [[San Remo conference]], a [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Class "A" League of Nations mandates over Palestine was allocated to the British]]. The preamble of the mandate document declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas the Principal Allied Powers have also agreed that the Mandatory should be responsible for putting into effect the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|declaration originally made on November&amp;nbsp;2nd, 1917]], by the Government of His Britannic Majesty, and adopted by the said Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a [[national home for the Jewish people]], it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&lt;ref name="AvalonPalmanda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp|title=The Avalon Project : The Palestine Mandate|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 29 November 1947, the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted a resolution recommending "to the United Kingdom, as the mandatory Power for Palestine, and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation, with regard to the future government of Palestine, of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union" as [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Resolution 181 (II)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel |url= http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |date=29 November 1947 |publisher=United Nations  |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan contained a proposal to terminate the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] and partition Palestine into "independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem." On 14 May 1948, the day on which the British Mandate over Palestine expired, the [[Jewish People's Council]] gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum, and approved a proclamation which declared ''[[Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel|the establishment]] of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]], to be known as the [[State of Israel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm|title=Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel|work=GxMSDev|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 1949, Israel was admitted to membership in the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/83E8C29DB812A4E9852560E50067A5AC Admission of Israel to UN: Retrieved 24 May 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615041505/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/83E8C29DB812A4E9852560E50067A5AC |date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''3379 (XXX). Elimination of all forms of racial discrimination'''

''The General Assembly,''

''Recalling'' its resolution 1904 (XVIII) of 20 November 1963, proclaiming the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and in particular its affirmation that "any doctrine of racial differentiation or superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous" and its expression of alarm at "the manifestations of racial discrimination still in evidence in some areas in the world, some of which are imposed by certain Governments by means of legislative, administrative or other measures",

''Recalling also'' that, in its resolution 3151 G (XXVIII) of 14 December 1973, the General Assembly condemned, ''inter alia'', the [[Unholy Alliance (geopolitical)|unholy alliance]] between South African racism and zionism,

''Taking note'' of the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace 1975, proclaimed by the World Conference of the [[International Women's Year]], held at [[Mexico City]] from 19 June to 2 July 1975, which promulgated the principle that "international co-operation and peace require the achievement of national liberation and independence, the elimination of [[colonialism]] and [[neo-colonialism]], foreign occupation, zionism, ''[[apartheid]]'' and racial discrimination in all its forms, as well as the recognition of the dignity of peoples and their right to self-determination",

''Taking note also'' of resolution 77 (XII) adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the [[Organization of African Unity]] at its twelfth ordinary session, held at [[Kampala]] from 28 July to 1 August 1975, which considered "that the racist regime in occupied [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the racist regime in [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]] have a common [[imperialism|imperialist]] origin, forming a whole and having the same racist structure and being organically linked in their policy aimed at repression of the dignity and integrity of the human being",

''Taking note also'' of the Political Declaration and Strategy to Strengthen International Peace and Security and to Intensify Solidarity and Mutual Assistance among Non-Aligned Countries, adopted at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Aligned Countries]] held at [[Lima]] from 25 to 30 August 1975, which most severely condemned zionism as a threat to world peace and security and called upon all countries to oppose this racist and imperialist ideology,

''Determines'' that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination.

In his address to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] the same day, 10 November 1975, Israeli Ambassador [[Chaim Herzog]] stated:&lt;ref name="Blaisdell2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blaisdell|first=Bob|title=Great Speeches of the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qxNeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=9 November 2017|date=18 August 2014|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486315560|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|"I can point with pride to the Arab ministers who have served in my government; to the Arab deputy speaker of my Parliament; to Arab officers and men serving of their own volition in our border and police defense forces, frequently commanding Jewish troops; to the hundreds of thousands of Arabs from all over the Middle East crowding the cities of Israel every year; to the thousands of Arabs from all over the Middle East coming for medical treatment to Israel; to the peaceful coexistence which has developed; to the fact that Arabic is an official language in Israel on a par with Hebrew; to the fact that it is as natural for an Arab to serve in public office in Israel as it is incongruous to think of a Jew serving in any public office in an Arab country, indeed being admitted to many of them. Is that racism? It is not! That ... is Zionism."}}

In his response he also said that the resolution was:
{{Quote|"another manifestation of the bitter anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish hatred which animates Arab society. Who would have believed that in this year, 1975, the malicious falsehoods of the '[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Elders of Zion]]' would be distributed officially by Arab governments? Who would have believed that we would today contemplate an Arab society which teaches the vilest anti-Jewish hate in the [[kindergarten]]s? ... We are being attacked by a society which is motivated by the most extreme form of racism known in the world today"}}

Herzog ended his statement, while holding a copy of the resolution, with these words: {{Quote|"For us, the Jewish people, this resolution based on hatred, falsehood and arrogance, is devoid of any moral or legal value. For us, the Jewish people, this is no more than a piece of paper and we shall treat it as such."}} As he concluded his speech, Herzog tore the resolution in half.

The name of "The UN avenue" in Haifa, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv was switched to "The Zionism avenue" as a response to the UN's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Forms/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9A%20%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%95%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA%20-%20%D7%93%20-%20%D7%94.pdf|title=Tel Aviv-Jaffa Streets Guide|last=פדן|first=יחיעם|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=158|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Before the vote, [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], the United States ambassador to the United Nations, warned that, "The United Nations is about to make anti-Semitism international law."&lt;ref&gt;Gil Troy, "Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism is Racism", page 134&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered a speech against the resolution, including the famous line, "[The United States] does not acknowledge, it will not abide by, it will never acquiesce in this infamous act ... A great evil has been loosed upon the world."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Meisler, ''United Nations: A History'', 2011, page 215&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Campbell, California]], in the [[United States]], a group of high school students attempted to solicit signatures on the premises of a local shopping center for a petition against Resolution 3379. The result was the landmark [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins]]'' (1980) that supported states' rights to expand the exercise of free speech, which California held was legal in what were considered public areas of a shopping mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/447/74|title=Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins|work=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico's vote in favor of the resolution led some United States Jews to organize a tourism boycott of Mexico. This ended after Mexican foreign minister [[Emilio Óscar Rabasa]] made a trip to Israel (Rabasa shortly afterward was forced to resign).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottix.net/~nagual/amate.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/VIII_2/cimet.htm|title=Estudios Interdisciplinarios de América Latina y el Caribe|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statement of revocation ===
[[George H. W. Bush]] personally introduced the motion to revoke 3379 with these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And now, for the first time, we have a real chance to fulfill the U.N. Charter's ambition of working "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and nations large and small to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom". Those are the words from the charter. We will not revive these ideals if we fail to acknowledge the challenge that the renewal of history presents.&lt;br&gt;

....No one here can promise that today's borders will remain fixed for all time. But we must strive to ensure the peaceful, negotiated settlement of border disputes. We also must promote the cause of international harmony by addressing old feuds. We should take seriously the charter's pledge "to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors."&lt;br&gt;

UNGA Resolution 3379, the so-called "Zionism is racism" resolution, mocks this pledge and the principles upon which the United Nations was founded. And I call now for its repeal. Zionism is not a policy; it is the idea that led to the creation of a home for the Jewish people, to the State of Israel. And to equate Zionism with the intolerable sin of racism is to twist history and forget the terrible plight of Jews in World War II and, indeed, throughout history. To equate Zionism with racism is to reject Israel itself, a member of good standing of the United Nations.

This body cannot claim to seek peace and at the same time challenge Israel's [[right to exist]]. By repealing this resolution unconditionally, the United Nations will enhance its credibility and serve the cause of peace.&lt;ref name="presidency.ucsb.edu"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Vice President of Sudan''' is the second highest [[political]] position obtainable in [[Sudan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9454">'''Voice of Namibia''' ('''VoN''') was a pirate radio station propagating [[Namibia]]n independence, and the political mouthpiece of the [[South West African People's Organization]] (SWAPO) during the [[Namibian War of Independence]]. It operated from 1966 until Namibian independence in 1990 from different hosting stations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

==Background and establishment==
After World War I the [[League of Nations]] gave [[South West Africa]], formerly a [[German colonial empire|German colony]], to the United Kingdom as a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] under the title of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Vantaa"&gt;{{cite web

On 19 April 1960 SWAPO was founded as the successor of the [[Ovamboland People's Organization]] that was established in 1959.&lt;ref name="Kae"&gt;{{cite news |title= The founder of Swapo|first= Kae|last= Matundu-Tjiparuro |newspaper= [[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]]|date= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1962 SWAPO had emerged as the dominant nationalist organisation for the Namibian people, co-opting other groups such as the [[South West Africa National Union]] (SWANU), and in 1976 the [[Namibia African People's Democratic Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Katjavivi [https://books.google.com/books?id=PFYhaULYUr4C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=Namibia+African+People's+Democratic+Organisation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=rO9rbpaKTD&amp;sig=5PnriYMAjOkYm8sIQso1r7vVRUU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result A History of Resistance in Namibia], Page 99, {{ISBN|0-86543-144-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; SWAPO used [[guerrilla tactics]] to fight the South African military. On 26 August 1966 the first major clash of the conflict took place, when a unit of the South African Police, supported by South African Air Force, exchanged fire with SWAPO forces at [[Omugulugwombashe]]. This date is generally regarded as the start of what became known in South Africa as the [[South African Border War|Border War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13891138|title=Namibia profile - Timeline|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voice of Namibia was part of the propaganda wing of SWAPO. It started with a one-hour program called ''Namibian Hour'' that was broadcast from [[Tanzania]] in 1966. [[Radio Zambia]] began relaying the ''Namibian Hour'' as from 1973, and the following year the program was renamed ''Voice of Namibia''. [[Luanda]] joined the hosting stations in 1976. Further stations hosting ''Voice of Namibia'' were [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[Voice of Revolutionary Ethiopia]], and [[Voice of the Revolution]] from [[Congo-Brazzaville]].&lt;ref name="AMR"&gt;{{cite journal

==Operation and reception==
VoN was the counter-propaganda station to the [[South West African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SWABC), the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] outpost in [[South West Africa]].&lt;ref name="AMR"/&gt;

Throughout the 1980s VoN established a network of freelance journalists within South West Africa. Unlike other pirate stations that promoted independence in Sub-Saharan Africa it was thus able to keep contact with the local population, a property that positively influenced its reception in the target territory. Further sources of information for the Voice of Namibia were faxes and telephone calls to its London office, and clandestine courier services to Angola via [[Ovamboland]]. When the [[Namibia Press Agency]] (NAMPA) was established in 1987 as a press agency of SWAPO, news updates were [[telex]]ed to all VoN dependencies after being cleared by SWAPO.&lt;ref name="AMR"/&gt;

Voice of Namibia had a large local audience among the black population, particularly due to technical reasons: Weak local radio offerings before the 1970s had caused the spread of [[short wave]] radio sets which were better suited to receive international channels than the [[FM broadcast band|FM]] sets predominant in [[South Africa]]. When [[Radio Owambo]], an FM channel destined for the indigenous [[Ovambo people]], was started in 1969, it could not change the already existing regular practice of assessing radio offerings on the short wave band.&lt;ref name="AMR"/&gt;

==Namibian independence==
Upon [[Independence of Namibia|Namibian independence]] in March 1990, the South West African Broadcasting Corporation (SWABC) was renamed as the [[Namibia Broadcasting Corporation]] (NBC), and VoN was merged into it. The NBC was officially disassociated from SWAPO and declared an independent state broadcaster. However, staff from SWABC stayed on and pro-apartheid personnel had to be reconciled with returning VoN partisan journalists, which created considerable tensions.&lt;ref name="AMR"/&gt;

==Notable staff==
A number of journalists and administrators at VoN became high-ranking politicians after Namibian independence, among them:

The '''Vroom–Yetton contingency model''' is a [[situational leadership theory]] of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] developed by [[Victor Vroom]], in collaboration with Phillip Yetton (1973) and later with Arthur Jago (1988). The situational theory argues the best style of leadership is contingent to the situation. This model suggests the selection of a leadership style of [[groups decision-making]].

[[File:Vroom–Yetton Leader Styles.svg|thumb|350px|Leader Styles]]

The Vroom-Yetton-Jago Normative Decision Model helps to answer above questions. This model identifies five different styles (ranging from autocratic to consultative to group-based decisions) on the situation and level of involvement. They are:

; Autocratic Type 1 (AI): Leader makes own decision using information that is readily available to him or her at the time. This type is completely autocratic.
; Autocratic Type 2 (AII): Leader collects required information from followers, then makes decision alone. Problem or decision may or may not be informed to followers. Here, followers' involvement is just providing information.
; Consultative Type 1 (CI): Leader shares problem to relevant followers individually and seeks their ideas and suggestions and makes decision alone. Here followers do not meet each other and the leader’s decision may or may not reflect his followers' influence. So, here followers' involvement is at the level of providing alternatives individually.
; Consultative Type 2 (CII): Leader shares problem to relevant followers as a group and seeks their ideas and suggestions and makes decision alone. Here followers meet each other, and through discussions they understand other alternatives. But the leader’s decision may or may not reflect the followers' influence. So, here followers involvement is at the level of helping as a group in decision-making.
; Group-based Type 2 (GII): Leader discuss problem and situation with followers as a group and seeks their ideas and suggestions through brainstorming. Leader accepts any decision and does not try to force his or her idea. Decision accepted by the group is the final one.

Vroom and Yetton formulated following seven questions on decision quality, commitment, problem information and decision acceptance, with which leaders can determine level of followers involvement in decision. Answer to the following questions must be either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ with the current scenario:
# ''Is there a quality requirement? Is the nature of the solution critical? Are there technical or rational grounds for selecting among possible solutions?''
# ''Do I have sufficient information to make a high quality decision?''
# ''Is the problem structured? Are the alternative courses of action and methods for their evaluation known?''
# ''Is acceptance of the decision by subordinates critical to its implementation?''
# ''If I were to make the decision by myself, is it reasonably certain that it would be accepted by my subordinates?''
# ''Do subordinates share the organizational goals to be obtained in solving this problem?''
# ''Is conflict among subordinates likely in obtaining the preferred solution?''

Based on the answers one can find out the styles from the graph.''

'''Water politics in the Jordan River basin''' refers to [[water politics|political issues of water]] within the [[Jordan River]] [[drainage basin]], including competing claims and water usage, and issues of [[riparian rights]] of [[surface water]] along [[International|transnational]] rivers, as well as the availability and usage of [[ground water]]. [[Water resources]] in the region are scarce, and these issues directly affect the five political subdivisions ([[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]]) located within and bordering the basin, which were created since the collapse, during World War I, of the former single controlling entity, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Because of the scarcity of water and a unique political context, issues of both supply and usage outside the physical limits of the basin have been included historically.

The Jordan river basin and its water are central issues of both the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] (including [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]), as well as the more recent [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/jordan/.premium-1.758168 Syrian Civil War Has Several Environmental Side-effects on Israel and Jordan] "The bloody civil war in Syria has had a number of unintended environmental side-effects, one of which was revealed last week: A steep reduction in agricultural activity in the southern part of the country. As a result, farmers have used much less water from natural sources and much more water now flows in the Yarmouk River, the largest tributary of the Jordan River."&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordan River is {{convert|251|km|mi}} long and, over most of its distance, flows at elevations below sea level. Its waters originate from the high [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] areas in and near the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]] in the north, and flow through the [[Sea of Galilee]] and [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan River Valley]] ending in the [[Dead Sea]] at an elevation of minus 400 metres, in the south.

==Geography of Jordan basin==
Downstream of the Sea of Galilee, where the main tributaries enter the Jordan Valley from the east, the valley bottom widens to about {{convert|15|mi|km}}. This area is characterized by higher [[fluvial terrace|alluvial]] or [[Raised beach|beach]] terraces paralleling the river; this area is known as the ''Ghor'' (or ''Ghawr'').  These terraces are locally [[incised]] by side [[wadi]]s or rivers forming a maze of ravines, alternating with sharp crests and rises, with towers, pinnacles and a [[badlands]] [[Geomorphology|morphology]].

At a lower elevation is the active Jordan River [[floodplain]], the ''zhor'' (or ''Zur''), with a wildly [[meandering river|meandering]] course, which accounts for the excessive length of the river in comparison to the straight-line distance to reach the Dead Sea.  Small dams were built along the river within the Zhor, turning the former thickets of reeds, tamarisk, willows, and white poplars into irrigated fields. After flowing through the Zur, the Jordan drains into the Dead Sea across a broad, gently sloping [[river delta|delta]].

In the upper Jordan river basin, upstream of the Sea of Galilee, the tributaries include:
* The [[Hasbani River|Hasbani]] ({{lang-ar|الحاصباني}}), ''Snir'' ({{lang-he|שניר}}), which flows from Lebanon.
* The [[Banias]] ({{lang-ar|بانياس }}), ''Hermon'' ({{lang-he|חרמון}}), arising from a spring at Banias near the foot of [[Mount Hermon]].
* The [[Dan River (Israel)|''Dan'']] ({{lang-he|דן}}), ''Leddan'' ({{lang-ar|اللدان}}), whose source is also at the base of Mount Hermon.
* ''Berdara'' ({{lang-ar|دردره}}), or ''Braghith'' ({{lang-ar|براغيث}}), The Iyon or Ayoun ({{lang-he|עיון}}), a smaller stream which also flows from Lebanon.

The lower Jordan River tributaries include:
* The Jalud in the [[Beth Shean]] valley
* The [[Yarmouk River]], which originates on the south-eastern slopes of [[Mount Hermon]] and the [[Hauran|Hauran Plateau]], forms the southern limit of the [[Golan Heights]] and flows into the Jordan River below the Sea of Galilee.  It also defines portions of the border between Jordan and Syria, as well as a shorter portion between Jordan and Israel.
* The [[Zarqa River]], the Biblical Jabbok
* Jabesh (Wadi Yabis) named after [[Jabesh-Gilead]]

==Hydrology of the Jordan River==
The riparian rights to the Jordan River are shared by 4 different countries: [[Lebanon]], Syria, [[Jordan]], Israel as well as the [[Palestinian territories]]; although Israel as the occupying authority has refused to give up any of the water resources to the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine is characterised by limited surface and groundwater water resources. The main surface water system in the region is the Jordan River basin which begins in three headwaters. The Hasbani River originates in Lebanon and has at least parts of its flow in Lebanon with an average flow of 138 million cubic metres per year. The Dan and Banias (Nahal Hermon in Israel) Rivers originate in the Golan Heights and both flow into the Jordan above Tabariyya Lake [Lake Galilee] having an average flow of 1.3&amp;nbsp;km³/yr. The Jordan River Basin is considered under international law as an international river with water shared by; Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestine.'' Daibes-Murad, Fadia (2005) A New Legal Framework for Managing the World's Shared Groundwaters: A Case Study from the Middle East IWA Publishing, {{ISBN|1-84339-076-0}} pp 37–39&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordan River originates near the borders of three countries, Israel, Lebanon, and Syria, with most of the water derived from the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]] and [[Mount Hermon]] to the north and east. Three spring-fed [[headwater]] rivers converge to form the Jordan River in the north:
# The [[Hasbani River]], which rises in south Lebanon, with an average annual flow of 138 million cubic metres,
# The [[Dan, Israel|Dan]] River, in Israel, averaging 245 million cubic metres per year, and
# The [[Banias River]] flowing from the [[Golan Heights]], averaging 121 million cubic metres per year.
These streams converge six kilometres inside Israel and flow south to the Sea of Galilee, wholly within Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Lowi, Miriam R. (1995) Water and Power: The Politics of a Scarce Resource in the Jordan River Basin Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-55836-0}} p 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Water quality is variable in the river basin. The three tributaries of the upper Jordan have a low [[salinity]] of about 20 ppm.&lt;ref name="TAWRM"&gt;John D. Keenan, Technological Aspects of Water Resources Management: Euphrates and Jordan, in Country Experiences with Water Resources Management 37–49, at 37 (World Bank Technical Paper No. 175, 1992) (Guy Le Moigne &amp; Shakwi Barghouti eds.).&lt;/ref&gt; The salinity of water in Lake Tiberias ranges from 240 ppm in the upper end of the lake (marginal for irrigation water), to 350 ppm (too high for sensitive citrus fruits) where it discharges back into the Jordan River.&lt;ref name="TAWRM"/&gt; The salt comes from the saline subterranean springs. These springs pass through the beds of ancient seas and then flow into Lake Tiberias, as well as the groundwater sources that feed into the lower Jordan. Downstream of Tiberias, the salinity of the tributary Yarmouk River is also satisfactory, at 100 ppm,&lt;ref name="TAWRM"/&gt; but the lower Jordan river becomes progressively more saline as it flows south.  It reaches twenty-five percent salinity (250,000 ppm) where it flows in the Dead Sea, which is about seven times saltier than the ocean.&lt;ref name="ISWR"&gt;Aaron Wolf &amp; John Ross, The Impact of Scarce Water Resources on the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 32 Nat. Resources J. 919, 922 (1992). The Dead Sea receives an average flow from the Jordan River of 1.85&amp;nbsp;km³/yr (1.85 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a resource for freshwater the Jordan River drainage system is vital for most of the population of Palestine, Israel and Jordan, and to a lesser extent in Lebanon and Syria who are able to use water from other national sources. (Although Syrian riparian rights to the [[Euphrates]] has been severely restricted by [[Turkey]]'s dam building programme, a series of 21 dams and 17 hydroelectric stations built on the Euphrates and [[Tigris]] rivers, in the 1980s, 90s and projected to be completed in 2010, in order to provide irrigation water and hydroelectricity to the arid area of southeastern Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Turkey. Clive Agnew, Ewan W. Anderson (1992) ''Water Resources in the Arid Realm'' Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-04346-8}} pp 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;) The CIA analysis in the 1980s placed the Middle East on the list of possible conflict zones because of water issues. Twenty per cent of the region’s population lack access to adequate potable water and 35% of the population lack appropriate sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, Ashok (2004) Managing Water Conflict: Asia, Africa, and the Middle East Routledge, {{ISBN|0-7146-5566-X}} p 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing water resources involves the issue of water use, water rights, and distribution of amounts. The [[Palestinian National Authority]] wished to expand and develop the agricultural sector in the West Bank to decrease their dependency on the Israeli labour market, while Israel have prevented an increase in the irrigation of the West bank.&lt;ref&gt;Shapland Greg (1997) Rivers of Discord: International Water Disputes in the Middle East C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, {{ISBN|1-85065-214-7}} p 52&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan also wishes to expand its agricultural sector so as to be able to achieve food security.&lt;ref&gt;Shapland Greg (1997) ibid p 53&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 1997 the UN General Assembly adopted a [[United Nations Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses|Convention on the Law of Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses]].&lt;ref name="Convention"&gt;[http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_3_1997.pdf  UN Document A/RES/51/229 8 July 1997] Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey Stephen C. (2001) The Law of International Watercourses: Non-navigational Uses Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-825787-2}} Annex A pp 446–464&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles establish two principles for the use of international watercourses (other than navigation): "equitable and reasonable utilization".&lt;ref name="Convention"/&gt; and "the ‘due diligence’ obligation not to cause significant harm."&lt;ref name="Convention"/&gt; Equitable and reasonable utilization requires taking into account all relevant factors and circumstances, including:
* (a) Geographic, hydrographic, hydrological, climatic, ecological and other factors of a natural character;
* (b) The social and economic needs of the watercourse States concerned;
* (c) The population dependent on the watercourse in each watercourse State;
* (d) The effects of the use or uses of the watercourses in one watercourse State on other watercourse States;
* (e) Existing and potential uses of the watercourse;
* (f) Conservation, protection, development and economy of use of the water resources of the watercourse and the costs of measures taken to that effect;
* (g) The availability of alternatives, of comparable value, to a particular planned or existing use.&lt;ref&gt;36 I.L.M. 700 (1997). Was passed by a vote of 103 in favour, to 3 against (Burundi, China, Turkey), with 27 abstentions (Andorra, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Israel, Mali, Monaco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Rwanda, Spain, Tanzania and Uzbekistan). The Convention has been signed by Finland, Luxembourg, Portugal, South Africa, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Venezuela. [United Nations, Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary General, 12 February 1998. The Convention will enter into force 90 days after it has been ratified or accepted by thirty five signatories, (Article 36)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shine, Clare and de Klemm, Iucn, Cyrille (1999) Wetlands, Water and the Law: Using Law to Advance Wetland Conservation and Wise Use  IUCN, {{ISBN|2-8317-0478-2}}, pp 273–275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical timeline==
===Ottoman and Mandatory periods===
Studies of regional water resources and their development, in modern terms, date from the early 1900s during the period of Ottoman rule;&lt;ref name="PloHistDev"&gt;[http://www.nad-plo.org/nego/permanent/water/related/Howb.pdf Historical Development Plans for the Jordan River Basin]&lt;/ref&gt; they also follow in light of a significant engineering milestone and resource development achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Roberts |first=Chalmers |date=December 1902 |title=Subduing the Nile  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoDNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2861 |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=V |pages=2861–2870  |accessdate=10 July 2009 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based largely on geographic, engineering and economic considerations many of these plans included common components, but political considerations and international events would soon follow.&lt;ref name="PloHistDev"/&gt;

After the First World War, the Jordan River Basin began to be seen as a problem of quantitative allocations.&lt;ref name= "Brooks"&gt;David B. Brooks and Julie Trottier, [http://foeme.org/uploads/13411307571~%5E$%5E~Water_Agreement_FINAL.pdf "An Agreement to Share Water Between Israelis and Palestinians: the FoEME proposal"], "FoEME", March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s and mid-1940s, Transjordan and the [[World Zionist Organization]] commissioned mutually exclusive competing water resource studies. The Transjordanian study, performed by Michael G. Ionides, concluded that the available water resources are not sufficient to sustain a Jewish state which would be the destination for Jewish immigration. The Zionist study, by the American engineer Walter Clay Lowdermilk, concluded that by diverting water from the Jordan basin to support agriculture and residential development in the [[Negev]], a Jewish state supporting 4 million new immigrants would be sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;Water Resources in Jordan, Munther J. Haddadin, pp 237–238, Resources for the Future, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Mandatory period===
{{main|War over Water (Jordan river){{!}}The "War over Water"}}
At the end of the [[1948 Arab Israeli War]] with the signing of the General Armistice Agreements in 1949, both Israel and Jordan embarked on implementing their competing initiatives to utilize the water resources in the areas under their control.

The first "Master Plan for Irrigation in Israel" was drafted in 1950 and approved by a Board of Consultants (of the USA) on 8 March 1956. The main features of the Master Plan was the construction of the Israeli [[National Water Carrier of Israel|National Water Carrier]] (NWC), a project for the integration of all major regional projects into the Israeli national grid. Tahal – Water Planning for Israel Ltd., an Israeli public corporate body, was established in 1952, being largely responsible for planning of water development, drainage, etc., at the national level within Israel, including the NWC project which was commissioned in 1965.

In 1952, the Bunger plan was issued by Jordan in collaboration with UNRWA and US Technical Cooperation Agency's Point IV program, aiming to provide water to 100,000 resettled Palestinian refugees, to be relocated into Northern Jordan.&lt;ref name=sosland&gt;Jeffrey K. Sosland. ''Cooperating Rivals: The Riparian Politics of the Jordan River Basin''. Pp.28–29&lt;/ref&gt; The plan included construction of major Maqarin dam over Yarmouk river to store some 500 million cubic meters of water and serve Jordan and Syria, allowing Jordan to avoid from storing water in the mostly Israeli-controlled Lake Tiberias.&lt;ref name=sosland/&gt; The Maqarin dam was also designated to provide electricity, while a smaller dam at Adasiya was supposed to divert Yarmouk-originated water to the Jordanian East Ghor Canal, aimed to irrigate Jordanian areas east to the Jordan river. A plan was also issued concerning the West Ghor Canal, envisioning a siphone to irrigate also the West Bank.&lt;ref name=sosland/&gt; In March 1953, Jordan and UNRWA signed a preliminary agreement to implement the Bunger plan. Shortly, on June 1953, Jordan and Syria signed a complementary treaty in this regard. Despite the expected objection of Israel, Jordan moved with the plan and in July 1953 allocated funding for the project in collaboration with UNRWA and US Government, pending later agreement with Israel.&lt;ref name=sosland /&gt; The Israeli government protested to US over the Maqarin dam plan, over not taking into account its rights on the Yarmouk waters downstream. While Israel convinced the US to pause the project until the issue is resolved, it also offered its eagerness to discuss it with the Arab governments.

In 1953, Israel began construction of a [[National Water Carrier of Israel|water carrier]] to take water from the [[Sea of Galilee]] to the populated center and agricultural south of the country, while Jordan concluded an agreement with Syria, known as the Bunger plan, to dam the [[Yarmouk River]] near Maqarin, and utilize its waters to irrigate Jordanian territory, before they could flow to the Sea of Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;Water Resources in Jordan, Munther J. Haddadin, p 239, Resources for the Future, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Military clashes ensued, and US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] dispatched ambassador Johnston to the region to work out a plan that would regulate water usage.&lt;ref&gt;Water Resources in Jordan, Munther J. Haddadin, p 32, Resources for the Future, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six-Day War and aftermath===
On 10 June 1967, the last day of the [[Six-Day War]], Golani Brigade forces quickly invaded the village of Banias where a caliphate era Syrian fort stood. Eshkol's priority on the Syrian front was control of the water sources.&lt;ref&gt;Eshkol reiterated his position: he really only wanted to control the northern Golan and the water sources.

===Regional stagnation (1980s)===
In 1980, Syria unilaterally started a programme of dam building along the Yarmouk.

The southern slopes of Mount Hermon (Jebel esh-Sheikh) as well as the Western Golan Heights, were unilaterally annexed by Israel in 1981.

In 1988, the Syrian-Jordanian agreement on development of the Yarmouk was blocked when Israel, as a riparian right holder, refused to ratify the plan and the World Bank withholds funding. Israel's augments its Johnson plan allocation of 25,000,000 m³/yr by a further 45,000,000–75,000,000 m³/yr.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

===Jordanian-Israeli peace deal and aftermath===
The water agreement formed a part of the broader political treaty which was signed between Israel and Jordan in 1994, and the articles relating to water in this agreement do not correspond with Jordan’s rights to water as they were originally claimed. The nature and significance of the wider 1994 treaty meant that the water aspect was forced to cede importance and priority in negotiations, giving way to areas such as borders and security in terms of armed force, which were perceived by decision-makers as being the most integral issues to the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Allan, ‘The Jordan-Israel Peace Agreement – September 1994’, in Allan and J. H. O. Court, (1996) ''Water, Peace and the Middle East: Negotiating Resources in the Jordan Basin'' (I. B. Tauris Academic Studies, London, St. Martin's Press [distributor]), {{ISBN|1-86064-055-9}} pp 207/21&lt;/ref&gt; Main points from the water sharing in the Jordan/Israel Peace treaty.&lt;ref&gt;*Water from the Yarmouk River
…Summer Period: 15 May to 15 October of each year, Israel pumps 12,000,000 m³ and Jordan gets the rest of the flow.
… Winter Period: 16 October to 14 May of each year, Israel pumps 13,000,000 m³ and Jordan is entitled to the rest of the flow.
* Water from the Jordan River
…Summer Period: 15 May to 15 October of each year, Israel concedes to transfer to Jordan in the summer period 20,000,000 m³ in return for the additional water that Jordan concedes to Israel in winter
… Winter Period: 16 October to 14 May of each year, Jordan is entitled to store for its use a minimum average of 20,000,000 m³ of the floods in the Jordan River.
Jordan is entitled to an annual quantity of 10,000,000 m³ of desalinated water fromm the desalination of about 20,000,000 m³ of saline springs now diverted to the Jordan River.
* Additional water
…Israel and Jordan shall cooperate in finding sources for the supply to Jordan of an additional quantity of 50,000,000 m³/yr of water of drinkable standards.
* Storage
…Israel and Jordan shall cooperate to build a diversion/storage dam on the Yarmouk River directly downstream of the Adassiya Diversion
…Israel and Jordan shall cooperate to build a system of water storage on the Jordan River, along their common boundary&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan being a country that borders on the Jordan has riparian rights to water from the Jordan basin and upper Jordan tributaries. Due to the water diversion projects the flow to the river Jordan has been reduced from 1,300 million–1,500 million cubic metres to 250 million–300 million cubic metres. Where the water quality has been further reduced as the flow of the river Jordan is made of run-off from agricultural irrigation and saline springs.&lt;ref&gt;Amery, Hussein A. and Wolf, Aaron T. (2000) Water in the Middle East: A Geography of Peace University of Texas Press, {{ISBN|0-292-70495-X}} p 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/09/israel Guardian] 9 March 2005 ''Once mighty Jordan reduced to a trickle'' After decades of extracting water, Israel and its neighbour discuss how to avert ecological disaster in river kept alive by the flow of sewage&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's subsequent developments have been mainly aimed at enlarging the main distribution system of Israel, run-off interception, reclamation of waste-water, and increasing the operational efficiency of water distribution networks. Over the years, the irrigated area within Israel has increased from 28,000 ha in 1948 to some 220,000 ha in 1997.

Problems can be seen to have emerged in 1999, when the treaty’s limitations were revealed by events concerning [[water shortage]]s in the Jordan basin. A reduced supply of water to Israel due to drought meant that, in turn, Israel which is responsible for providing water to Jordan, decreased its water provisions to the country, provoking a diplomatic disagreement between the two and bringing the water component of the treaty back into question.&lt;ref&gt;Ha'aretz ‘A dry Israel must cut water flow to Jordan’ by A. Cohen, 15 March 1999 as quoted in ''Hydro-Peace in the Middle East: Why no Water Wars?: A Case Study of the Jordan River Basin'' SAIS Review – Volume 22, Number 2, Summer-Fall 2002, pp 255–272 and Allan John Anthony, (2001) ''The Middle East Water Question: Hydropolitics and the Global Economy'' I.B.Tauris, {{ISBN|1-86064-813-4}} p 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's complaints that the reduction in water from the tributaries to the river Jordan caused by the Jordanian-Syrian dam look to go unheeded due to the conflict of interest between Israel and her neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/776388.html Ha'aretz] 18 October 2006, ‘Environmentalists: New dam may cause Jordan River to dry up’ By Tzafrir Rinat,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syrian Civil War and its effect on Jordan basin===
The dramatic drought, which hit Levant between 1998 to 2012, was identified by scientists to be the most severe in 900 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-finds-drought-in-eastern-mediterranean-worst-of-past-900-years]&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic effect of the drought on southern Syria is proposed as one of the factors which led to the eruption of the Syrian Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.vice.com/article/the-drought-that-preceded-syrias-civil-war-was-likely-the-worst-in-900-years]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, prior to the eruption of Syrian War in 2011, the Syrian government had developed a series of 21 dams in the Yarmouk drainage basin to divert water into large reservoirs used for irrigation of agricultural land. Jordan had built a large dam of its own on the Yarmouk, the Al-Wehda Dam, in order to exploit the water for its own agriculture.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt; However, prior to the Syrian War, the amount of water it collected by Jordanian dam had fallen as Syria dammed the river upstream.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt; While the Yarmouk flows into the Jordan River, most of its water has been used in Syria and Jordan before reaching the river. Since the civil war broke out, hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled the area of southern Syria, many of whom were farmers. Most fled to refugee camps in Jordan.&lt;ref name=ha&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/jordan/.premium-1.758168 Syrian Civil War Has Several Environmental Side-effects on Israel and Jordan] "The bloody civil war in Syria has had a number of unintended environmental side-effects, one of which was revealed last week: A steep reduction in agricultural activity in the southern part of the country. As a result, farmers have used much less water from natural sources and much more water now flows in the Yarmouk River, the largest tributary of the Jordan River."&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, much more water now flows in the Yarmouk River and thus greater quantities of water are reaching the parts of the river that flow through Jordan, and later into Israel as well.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt;

After the cessation of World War II hostilities, and at the time Syria was granted Independence (April 1946), the former mandate powers, France and Britain, bilaterally signed an agreement to pass control of Banias to the British mandate of Palestine. This was done against the expressed wishes of the Syrian government who declared France's signature to be invalid. While Syria maintained its claim on Banias in this period, it was administered from Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fectio.org.uk/sites/banyas1990.htm Fectio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson John F (2004) {{ISBN|1-85043-440-9}}, p 178 ''Syria claimed that France’s signature on the border agreement was invalid, but the British would not discuss the situation. A ‘Demilitarised zone’ was created at the three disputed points along the border, one of which was the territory around Banias, with Syria withdrawing troops, but continuing to lay claim to the territory within the zone. Thus from the beginning of the Syrian state to the Six-Day War, there was no settled border.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasbani===
The [[Hasbani]] River derives most of its discharge from two [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] in Lebanon&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]] (Water Resources section) {{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries/lebanon/index.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409054730/http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries/lebanon/index.stm |archivedate=9 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;blockquote&gt;Overall, there are about 40 major streams in Lebanon and, based on the hydrographic system, the country can be divided into five regions: …[including] the Hasbani river basin in the south-east. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations University|UNU]] The Jordan River [http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E06.htm] &lt;blockquote&gt;The Dan spring, the largest of the sources of the upper Jordan, lies wholly within Israel close to the border with Syria. The spring sources of the Hasbani River lie entirely within Lebanon. The spring source of the Banias River is in Syria. These three small streams unite 6 km inside Israel at about 70 m above sea level to form the upper Jordan River. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Wazzani]] and the [[Haqzbieh]], the latter being a group of springs on the uppermost Hasbani.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations University|UNU]] The Jordan River [http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E06.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hasbani runs for {{convert|25|mi|km}} in Lebanon before crossing the border and joining with the [[Banias River|Banias]] and [[Dan River (Israel)|Dan Rivers]] at a point in northern Israel, to form the River Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[[MERIP]] Heightened Israeli-Lebanese Tensions Over Jordan's Headwaters [http://www.merip.org/mero/mero093002.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  For about four kilometres downstream of Ghajar, the Hasbani forms the border between Lebanon and northern Israel.

Surface water flow to Israel is estimated at 160 million m³/year, of which about 138 million m³ through the Hasbani river including a contribution of 30 million m³ from its tributary, the Wazzani spring.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; emerges from the Wazzani Spring  at [[Ghajar]], close to the Lebanese Israeli border, about 3 kilometres west of the base of [[Mount Hermon]]. The contribution of the spring is very important, because it is the only continuous year-round flow in the river in either Lebanon or Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[MERIP]] Heightened Israeli-Lebanese Tensions Over Jordan's Headwaters

===Dan===
The Dan River is the largest [[tributary]] of the [[Jordan river]], whose source is located at the base of [[Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred Pearce (2007) When the Rivers Run Dry: Water, the Defining Crisis of the Twenty-first Century Beacon Press, {{ISBN|0-8070-8573-1}} p 169&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1967 Six-Day War, the Dan River was the only source of the river Jordan wholly within [[Israel]]i territory. Its flow provides up to 238 million cubic metres of water annually to the [[Hulah Valley]]. In 1966 this was a cause of dispute between water planners and conservationists, with the latter prevailing after three years of court adjudication and appeals. The result was a conservation project of about {{convert|120|acre|km2}} at the source of the river called the [[Tel Dan Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jafi.org.il/education/noar/SITES/teldan.htm Jewish agency for Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huleh marshes===
In 1951 the tensions in the area were raised when, in the lake Huleh area (10&amp;nbsp;km from Banias), Israel initiated a project to drain the marsh land to bring {{convert|15000|acre|km2}} into cultivation. The project caused a conflict of interests between the Israeli government and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Arab villages in the area and drew Syrian complaints to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;''The first Arab summit conference ratified the Arab strategy to thwart Israel’s NWC Plan [drainage of the Hula marshes]. The strategy was designed to divert [2 out of the 3 of] Jordan’s tributaries [Hasbani, Banias] and prepare the Arab armies for the defence of the engineering operations.''

This refusal on the part of Israel not only constituted a flagrant violation of the General Armistice Agreement, but also contributed to an increase of tension in the area. The Security Council itself strongly condemned the attitude of Israel, in its resolution of 18 May 1951, as being "inconsistent with the objectives and intent of the Armistice Agreement"&lt;ref name="UNDOC"/&gt;

Under [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UN]] auspices and with encouragement from the [[Eisenhower administration]] 9 meetings took place between 15 and 27 January 1953, to regularise administration of the 3 DMZs.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, Avi (2000) ibid p 75&lt;/ref&gt; At the eighth meeting Syria offered to adjust the armistice lines, and cede to Israel's 70% of the DMZ, in exchange for a return to the pre 1946 international border in the Jordan basin area, with Banias water resources returning uncontested to Syrian sovereignty. On 26 April, the Israeli cabinet met to consider the Syrian suggestions; with head of Israel’s Water Planning Authority, Simha Blass, in attendance. Blass noted that while the land to be ceded to Syria was not suitable for cultivation, the Syrian map did not suit Israel’s water development plan. Blass explained that the movement of the international boundary in the area of Banias would affect Israel’s water rights.&lt;ref name="ASIW"&gt;Shlaim, Avi (2000) Ibid pp 75–76 At the eighth meeting on 13 April, the Syrian delegates seemed very anxious to move forward and offered Israel around 70% of the DMZ’s. Significant results were achieved and a number of suggestions and summaries put in writing, but they required decisions by the two governments. The Israeli cabinet convened on 26 April to consider the Syrian suggestions for the division of the DMZs. Simha Blass, head of Israel’s Water Planning Authority, was invited to the meeting. Dayan showed Blass the Syrian suggestions on the map. Blass told Dayan that although most of the lands that Israel was expected to relinquish were not suitable for cultivation, the map did not suit Israel’s irrigation and water development plans.... Although phrased in a positive manner, this decision appears to have killed the negotiations. It involved changes to the preliminary accord and new conditions that made it difficult to go forward. At the last two meetings, on 4 and 27 May Israel presented its new conditions. These were rejected by Syria, and the negotiations ended without agreement.... That a set of proposals that had the support of the political and military elite was emasculated because it did not satisfy the requirements of a water expert seems surprising. It suggests lack of leadership and lack of statesmanship on Ben Gurion's part when it came to the crunch. In the final analysis, it was Israel's insistence on exclusive and unfettered rights over the lakes and the Jordan river that seems to have upset the apple cart. An opportunity for an agreement with a major adversary existed and was allowed to slip away. Yet the fact that the negotiations came so close to success is in itself significant because it shows that, contrary to popular Israeli perceptions, Syria was capable of behaving in a practical, pragmatic and constructive fashion. There was definitely someone to talk to on the other side.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli cabinet rejected the Syrian proposals but decided to continue the negotiations by making changes to the accord and placing conditions on the Syrian proposals. The Israeli conditions took into account Blass’s position over water rights and Syria rejected the Israeli counteroffer.&lt;ref name="ASIW"/&gt;

On 4 June 1953 Jordan and Syria concluded a bilateral plan to store surface water at Maqarin (completed in 2006 as [[Al-Wehda Dam]]), so as to be able to use the water resources of the Yarmouk river in the Yarmouk-Jordan valley plan, funded through the Technical Cooperation Agency of the United States of America, the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]] and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;Haddadin, Munther J.

===Israeli National Water Carrier project===
{{main|National Water Carrier of Israel}}
In September 1953, Israel unilaterally started a water diversion project within the Jordan River basin to divert water from the Jordan River at [[Jacob's Ford]] (B'not Yacov) to help irrigate the coastal Sharon Plain and eventually the Negev desert. The diversion project consisted of a nine-mile (14&amp;nbsp;km) channel midway between the [[Hula Valley|Huleh Marshes]] and Lake Galilee (Lake Tiberias) in the central DMZ to be rapidly constructed. Syria claimed that it would dry up {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} of Syrian land. The UNTSO Chief of Staff Major General [[Vagn Bennike]] of Denmark noted that the project was denying water to two Palestinian water mills, was drying up Palestinian farm land and was a substantial military benefit to Israel against Syria. The US cut off aid to Israel. The Israeli response was to increase work.

Israel finally backed off by moving the intake out of the DMZ and for the next three years the US kept its economic sanctions by threatening to end aid channelled to Israel by the Foreign Operations Administration and insisting on tying the aid with Israel's behaviour.&lt;ref name="JSCR"/&gt; The Security Council ultimately rejected Syrian claims that the work was a violation of the Armistice Agreements and drainage works were resumed and the work was completed in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/f45643a78fcba719852560f6005987ad/cbf1b65e5de19c1c052564e30046d1b3!OpenDocument UN Doc S/4271] Letter dated 25 February 1960 from the representative of Israel to the President of the Security Council 25 February 1960&lt;/ref&gt; This caused shelling from Syria and friction with the Eisenhower Administration; the diversion was moved to the southwest to Eshed Kinrot into the [[National Water Carrier of Israel|Israeli National Water Carrier]] project, designed by [[Water supply and sanitation in Israel|Tahal]] and constructed by [[Mekorot]].&lt;ref name="JSCR"&gt;Sosland, Jeffrey (2007) ''Cooperating Rivals: The Riparian Politics of the Jordan River Basin'' SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-7201-9}} p 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNU"&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0m.htm United Nations University] In 1955 the Unified (Johnston) Plan to develop a multilateral approach to water management failed to be ratified, which reinforced unilateral development. Nevertheless, both Jordan and Israel undertook to operate within their allocations, and two major successful projects were undertaken: the Israeli National Water Carrier and Jordan's East Ghor Main Canal.... Design of the East Ghor canal was begun by Jordan in 1957. It was intended as the first section of a much more ambitious plan known as the Greater Yarmouk project. Additional sections included (1) construction of two Dams on the Yarmouk (Mukheiba and Maqarin) for storage and hydroelectricity, (2) construction of a 47-km West Ghor canal, together with a siphon across the Jordan River near wadi Faria to connect it with the East Ghor Canal, (3) construction of seven dams to utilise seasonal flow on side wadis flowing into the Jordan, and (4) construction of pumping stations, lateral canals, and flood protection and drainage facilities. In the original Greater Yarmouk project the East Ghor Canal was scheduled to provide only 25% of the total irrigation scheme.... Construction of the Canal began in 1959. By 1961 its first section was completed; sections two and three, down Wadi Zarqa, were in service by June 1966. Shortly before completion of the Israeli Water Carrier in 1964, an Arab summit conference decided to try to thwart it. Discarding direct military attack, the Arab states chose to divert the Jordan headwaters. Two options were considered: either the diversion of the Hasbani to the Litani and the diversion of the Banias to the Yarmouk, or the diversion of both the Hasbani and the Banias to the Yarmouk. The latter was chosen, with the diverted waters to be stored behind the Mukhaiba dam.... The Arabs started work on the Headwater Diversion Project in 1965. Israel declared that it would regard such diversion as an infringement of its sovereign rights. According to the estimates completion of the project would have deprived Israel of 35% of its contemplated withdrawal from the upper Jordan, constituting one ninth of Israel's annual water budget.

===Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan===
{{main|Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan}}
1955 US ambassador [[Eric Johnston]] negotiated the [[Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan]].&lt;ref name="Cronin, Patrick M. 2008 p 189"/&gt; The plan was for the unified development of the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] water resources based on an earlier plan commissioned by [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA). Modeled upon the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] development plan, it was approved by technical water committees of all the regional [[riparian]] countries – [[Israel]], Jordan, [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="shapland"&gt;The UNRWA commissioned a plan for the development of the Jordan River; this became widely known as “The Johnston plan”. The plan was modelled on the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] development plan for the development of the Jordan River as a single unit. Greg Shapland, (1997) Rivers of Discord: International Water Disputes in the Middle East C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, {{ISBN|1-85065-214-7}} p 14&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was formally rejected by the Arab Higher Committee, but Nasser, the Egyptian president, assured the Americans that the Arabs would not exceed the water quotas prescribed by the Johnston plan.&lt;ref  name="Gat2003p101"/&gt; Jordan undertook to abide by their allocations under the plan. The plan was initially  un-ratified by Israel, but after the US linked the Johnston plan to aid, also agreed to accept the allocation provisions.&lt;ref name="JSCR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nad-plo.org/nego/permanent/water/related/Howb.pdf Historical Developmental Plans of the Jordan River Basin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sosland, Jeffrey (2007) Cooperating Rivals: The Riparian Politics of the Jordan River Basin SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-7201-9}} p 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The East Ghor canal formed part of a larger project – the Greater Yarmouk project – which envisioned two storage dams on the Yarmouk, and a West Ghor Canal, on the West Bank of the Jordan. These projects were never built, due to Israel's occupation of the [[West Bank]] of the Jordan River during the Six-Day War. After the Six-Day War, The [[PLO]] operated from bases within Jordan, and launched several attacks on Israeli settlements in the Jordan valley, including attacks on water facilities. Israel responded with raids in Jordan, in an attempt to force [[King Hussein]] of Jordan to rein in the PLO. The canal was the target of at least 4 of these raids, and was virtually knocked out of commission. The United states intervened to resolve the conflict, and the canal was repaired after Hussien undertook to stop PLO activity in the area.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, Stephen C.

===Headwater Diversion Plan===
{{main|Headwater Diversion Plan (Jordan River)}}
First summit of Arab Heads of State was convened in Cairo between 13–17 January 1964, called by [[Nasser]] the Egyptian president, to discuss a common policy to confront Israel's national water carrier project which was nearing completion. The second Arab League summit conference voted on a plan which would have circumvent and frustrated it. The Arab and North African states chose to divert the Jordan headwaters rather than the use of direct military intervention. The heads of State of the Arab League considered two options:

# The diversion of the Hasbani to the Litani combined with the diversion of the Banias to the Yarmouk,
# The diversion of both the Hasbani and the Banias to the Yarmouk.

The Arab league plan selected was for the Hasbani and Banias waters to be diverted to Mukhaiba and stored.&lt;ref name="UNU"/&gt; The scheme was only marginally feasible, was technically difficult and expensive. Arab political considerations were cited to justify the diversion scheme.&lt;ref  name="Murakami1995p296"/&gt; In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo and decided:
&lt;blockquote&gt; The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And Since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.&lt;ref name="AS229"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the 2nd Arab summit conference in Cairo of January 1964 (with the backing of all 13 [[Arab League]] members), Syria in a joint project with Lebanon and Jordan, started the development of the water resources of Banias for a canal along the slopes of the Golan toward the [[Yarmouk River]]. While Lebanon was to construct a canal form the Hasbani River to Banias and complete the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;The diversion consisted of:-

# Diversion of tributaries in Lebanon.
:A The upper Hasbani- the excavation of a canal from the Hasbani springs in the hasbaya region and a canal from the wadi Shab’a for carrying water to the kawkaba tunnels and from there to the Litani River. (This project would transport 40–60 million cubic metres of water annually).
:B. The Middle hasbani-two diversion points-the first in the hasbani riverbed; the second in wadi Sarid. The Hasbani and Sarid would flow in a canal to the Banias and from there to the Yarmuk. According to the plan, 20–30 million cubic metres of water would flow annually to Syria (if Lebanon did not divert the hasbani’s floodwater to the Litani, the Sarid canal could transport up to 60 million cubic metres of water a year).
:C. The Wazani Spring in the Lower Hasbani Riverbed-this would include an irrigation canal (carrying 16 million cubic metres of water a year) for local use in Lebanon; an irrigation canal in Syria (8 million cubic metres a year); and three pumping units to transport the Wanzani’s overflow to Syria via the Sarid-Banias canal at a rate of 26 million cubic metres a year.
:2. Diversions in Syrian territory
:A. Diversion of the Banias-The diversion plan for the Banias called for a 73 kilometre long canal to be dug 350 metres above sea level that would link the banias with the Yamuk. The canal would carry the Banias’s fixed flow plus the overflow from the hasbani (including water from the Sarid and Wazani). The Banias diversion would provide 90 million cubic metres of water for irrigation of riverine areas. The designers calculated that eighteen months would be sufficient for executing the plan. The cost was estimated at five million pounds sterling (including two tunnels), that is, approximately two million pounds more than the Arab plan.
:B. The butayha Project-The Syrians feared that if the Arabs implemented their diversion plan, Israel would block the batayha Valley inhabitants, annual pumping of 22 million cubic metres from the Jordan as proposed in the Johnston plan. In order to guarantee the villagers their vital water supply, the Arab plan contained a proviso designed to incorporate primary and secondary canals from the Sea of Galilee.
:3. The water plans in Jordan.
:The construction of a dam in the Kingdom of Jordan (the Mukheiba dam on the Yarmuk River) was designed to hold 200 million cubic metres of water. Work on the dam would take 30 months at a cost of ten and one quarter million pounds sterling. The Mukheiba Dam (and the Makarin Dam) would hurt Israel if it was incorporated into the diversion plans for the Jordan River’s northern sources, and without the Mukheiba dam all of the diverted water would flow back to the Yarmuk and return to the Jordan’s riverbed south of the Sea of galilee. Excluding this plan, the rest of the Jordan’s water projects correspond with the main parts of the Johnson Plan.

Shemesh, Moshe (2008) Arab Politics, Palestinian Nationalism and the Six Day War: The Crystallization of Arab Strategy and Nasir's Descent to War, 1957–1967 Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|1-84519-188-9}} pp 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AS229"&gt;Shlaim, Avi (200) ibid pp 229–230 In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo. The main item on the agenda was the threat posed by Israel's diversion of water from the north to irrigate the south and the expected reduction in the water supplies available to Syria and Jordan. The reaction of the summit to this threat was deadly serious. The preamble to its decision stated,
:'''The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And Since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.'''&lt;/ref&gt; The project was to divert 20 to 30 million cubic metres of water from the river Jordan tributaries to Syria and Jordan for the development of Syria and Jordan.&lt;ref name="AS229"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Political Thought and Political History: Studies in Memory of Elie Kedourie By Elie Kedourie, M. Gammer, Joseph Kostiner, Moshe Shemesh, Routledge, (2003) {{ISBN|0-7146-5296-2}} p 165&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian construction of the Banias to Yarmouk canal got under way in 1965. Once completed, the diversion of the flow would have transported the water into a dam at Mukhaiba for use by Jordan and Syria before the waters of the Banias Stream entered Israel and the Sea of Galilee. Lebanon also started a canal to divert the waters of the Hasbani, whose source is in Lebanon, into the Banias. The Hasbani and Banias diversion works would have had the effect of reducing the capacity of Israel's carrier by about 35% and Israel's overall water supply by about 11%. Israel declared that it would regard such diversion as an infringement of its sovereign rights. The Finance of the project was through contributions by Saudi Arabia and Egypt.&lt;ref name="UNU"/&gt; This led to [[War over Water (Jordan river)|military intervention]] from Israel, first with tank and artillery fire and then, as the Syrians shifted the works further southwards, with airstrikes.

'''The Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship''' is a program of the [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation]] that recruits, supports, and prepares individuals for teaching careers, typically in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

President [[Barack Obama]] cited the Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship as a model of STEM teacher preparation in a January 2010 speech on his administration’s Educate to Innovate initiative.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-educate-innovate-campaign-and-science-teaching-and-mentoring-awar "Remarks by the President on the 'Educate to Innovate' Campaign and Science Teaching and Mentoring Awards"] (January 2, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2007, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation began to focus on the closing of [[achievement gap]], both at the K-12 level and also for institutions of higher education.

According to studies by various researchers and organizations, improvement in teacher expertise is the best way to improve student achievement,&lt;ref name="nctaf"&gt;[http://www.nctaf.org/documents/WhatMattersMost.pdf ''What Matters Most''], pp. 6-8 (September 1996), The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sanders"&gt;See, for example, William L. Sanders and June C. Rivers, [http://www.mccsc.edu/~curriculum/cumulative%20and%20residual%20effects%20of%20teachers.pdf "Cumulative and Residual Effects of Teachers on Future Student Academic Achievement"] (November 1996), The University of Tennessee-Knoxville, and Reginald Clark, [http://www.ncrel.org/gap/clark/summary.htm "Closing the Achievement Gaps"] (November 2002), Learning Point Associates/North Central Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; and teacher preparation is an important factor in improving learning outcomes.&lt;ref name="corcoran"&gt;Sean Corcoran, "Human Capital Policy and the Quality of the Teacher Workforce," in Dan Goldhaber and Jane Hannaway, eds., ''Creating a New Teaching Profession'' (Washington, DC: The Urban Institute Press, 2010), p. 31; see also Donald Boyd, Pamela Grossman, Hamilton Lankford, Susanna Loeb,
and James Wyckoff, [http://www.caldercenter.org/PDF/1001255_teacher_preparation.pdf "Teacher Preparation and Student Achievement"] (August 2008), CALDER Working Paper No. 20, The Urban Institute, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these findings, the Foundation created the Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship program. Teacher candidates who are graduating from or have graduated from college, including graduating college seniors, recent graduates, and midcareer or second-career professionals, are selected to receive fellowships of approximately $30,000, which they use to enroll in master's degree programs for teacher preparation at universities selected by the Foundation. They teach at associated local public secondary schools from the beginning of their master’s work. In exchange for the Fellowship, Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellows commit to teach in high-need urban or rural schools for three years. During the three-year period they receive ongoing mentoring from both their university and the school district in which they are placed.

===The Leonore Annenberg Teaching Fellowship===
The first Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship, called the Leonore Annenberg Teaching Fellowship, was created in 2007 with funding from the [[Annenberg Foundation]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;"Foundation Hopes to Lure Top Students to Teaching"(December 20, 2007), ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; Its Fellows enroll in master’s-level teacher preparation at four selected national universities—[[Stanford University]] and the Universities of [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[University of Virginia|Virginia]], and [[University of Washington|Washington]]. Each of the four universities conducts its own application and admissions process, with review by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.

===State-based Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowships===
In late 2007, the foundation launched the Woodrow Wilson Indiana Teaching Fellowship.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;"Project's aim: Revamp colleges, create better teachers" (December 20, 2007), ''The Indianapolis Star.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiana2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Indiana|title=Acts: Laws Enacted by the ... General Assembly at the ... Special Session and the ... Regular Session|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YccfAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Central Publishing Company|page=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supported by Lilly Endowment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.chalkbeat.org/2014/09/03/new-principal-training-program-will-expand-with-lillys-support/#.Vbjgofl0elo "New principal training program will expand with Lilly’s support"]. ''Chalkbeat Indiana''. Hayleigh Colombo, September 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the WW Indiana Teaching Fellowship focuses on STEM teaching, recruiting 80 Fellows per year to attend teacher preparation programs at [[Ball State University]], IUPUI, [[Purdue University]], and the [[University of Indianapolis]]. IUPUI and the University of Indianapolis prepare teachers for Indianapolis-area schools—while Ball State works with the Muncie and Anderson schools and Purdue prepares teachers specifically for a network of rural Indiana schools.

The next states to create Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowships, Michigan and Ohio, launched their programs in late 2009 &lt;ref name="DNews1"&gt;[http://detnews.com/article/20091107/SCHOOLS/911070357 "Michigan lures teachers to inner cities with $16.7M program"] (November 7, 2009), ''The Detroit News.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freep"&gt;"Colleges get grant for math, science teachers" (January 7, 2010), ''The Detroit Free Press.''&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010,&lt;ref name="Dispatch"&gt;"4 Ohio colleges among leaders in training science, math teachers" (March 3, 2010), ''The Columbus Dispatch.''&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. The first classes of Fellows in these states begin their studies in summer 2011.

The W.K. Kellogg Foundation’s Woodrow Wilson Michigan Teaching Fellowship, works with six universities: [[Eastern Michigan University]], [[Grand Valley State University]], [[Michigan State University]], [[University of Michigan]], [[Wayne State University]], and [[Western Michigan University]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Julie. [http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/06/13_win_fellowships_to_study_at.html "Quit your job and go into teaching? Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship puts math, science professionals in the classroom"], ''MLive''.&lt;/ref&gt; Partner school districts include Battle Creek,  Benton Harbor, Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Kalamazoo.

The Woodrow Wilson Ohio Teaching Fellowship, supported by the Ohio Board of Regents’ Choose Ohio First program, with additional funds from a statewide group of private philanthropies, works with [[John Carroll University]], [[The Ohio State University]], the [[University of Akron]], and the [[University of Cincinnati]]. Partnering Ohio districts include Akron, Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus.

Like the Indiana program, the Fellowships in Michigan and Ohio programs focus specifically on preparing teachers in the STEM fields for high-need secondary schools in their states.

Georgia institutions Columbus State University, Kennesaw State University and Piedmont College are also hosting Woodrow Wilson  Teaching Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[Columbus State part of Georgia's inaugural class of fellows to improve STEM teachers"]. ''Ledger-Inquirer''. By MARK RICE June 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Woodrow Wilson-Rockefeller Brothers Fund (WW-RBF) Fellowship for Aspiring Teachers of Color===
Created by the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] in 1992, the WW-RBF Fellowship was transferred to the Woodrow Wilson Foundation in 2009. The program works to recruit, support, and retain individuals of color as K-12 public school teachers in the United States. Fellows must use their awards for master’s programs at one of  27 teacher preparation programs designated by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.

Part of the [[Thomson Reuters]] Risk Management Solutions suite, the '''World-Check''' [[database]] of [[Politically exposed person|Politically Exposed Persons]] (PEPs) and heightened risk individuals and organisations is used around the world to help to identify and manage financial, regulatory and reputational risk.

The creation of the database was in response to legislation aimed at reducing the incidence of [[financial crimes]]. To begin with, World-Check's intelligence was used by banks and financial institutions as a comprehensive solution for assessing, managing and remediating risk. However, as legislation has become increasingly complex and its reach has become increasingly global, the demand for such intelligence has grown beyond the financial sector to include organisations from all sectors.

== Research coverage ==
World-Check's research team monitors emerging risks in more than 60 languages, covering over 240 countries and territories worldwide. All information used is in the public domain and research analysts profile individuals and entities using open-source research methodology ([[OSINT]]) while adhering to strict protocol such as that laid down by the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] (UK).

In 2011, World-Check received independent assurance under the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ([[ISAE 3000]]) for the internal processes and controls that govern its global sanctions platform and dataset.

A dedicated team of research analysts correlates sanction and embargo lists from around the world, including lists such as OFAC, UK HMT, EU, OSFI, FATF and the Australian DFAT. Regulatory and enforcement lists are monitored as well as lists of debarred and banned parties.

Specific areas of interest, such as terrorism, organised crime and the [[Middle East]], are covered by specialist research teams.

==About World-Check==

Registered in [[London]], World-Check was founded in 2000 by David Leppan to address the risk mitigation requirements of the Swiss banking community. During 2008, World-Check launched Country-Check, an index that ranks over 240 countries and territories worldwide in terms of risk. A statistical algorithm is used to aggregate various information sources across political, financial and criminal factors and this quantifies risk attached to customers and transactions according to their country of origin. Based on statistics and not perception, Country-Check provides practical intelligence for informed decision-making, useful for mergers and acquisitions, security of supply chain, cross border expansion and exploration, and production.

In 2009 World-Check increased its offering by acquiring IntegraScreen, a provider of enhanced due diligence reporting services. IntegraScreen reports are used when a detailed background check on any entity or individual is required, and research can be carried out no matter where the location.

== Leak of Database and Security Compromises ==
In a reddit post, a user declared that he had acquired a copy of the World-Check database with information up to 2014. This leak online apparently was possible due to an incomplete assessment of the security, and was downloaded through the website Shodan, a search engine that lets the user find specific types of computers connected to the internet using a variety of filters, raising questions about the allegedly privacy and security of the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/4q840n/terrorism_blacklist_i_have_a_copy_should_it_be/:|title=Terrorism Blacklist: I have a copy. Should it be shared? • r/privacy|website=reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False claims==
===PSC===
In 2017, World-Check admitted that the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) should never have been placed on their database at all and, specifically, should not have been associated with "terrorism", stressing that there were no grounds to suggest that PSC were either associated with terrorism related activity or that the organisation presented any kind of financial risk. The PSC and World-Check have reached an agreement to address the harm done to the reputation of the PSC and its chair, Mr. Hugh Lanning, and to resolve the matters between them arising from that profile.&lt;ref&gt;http://imemc.org/article/palestine-solidarity-campaign-removed-from-world-check-terrorist-listing/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finsbury Park Mosque===
World-Check was forced to pay compensation and apologise to [[Finsbury Park Mosque]] in 2017 after falsely claiming that it had a current association with terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Van attack shatters calm at mosque with a troubled history|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d31780c4-550a-11e7-9fed-c19e2700005f|accessdate=21 June 2017|publisher=Financial Times|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thomson Reuters ==

In 2011, [[Thomson Reuters]] acquired World-Check as a key component of their Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://risk.thomsonreuters.com/|title=English|website=Thomson Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
