'''Argyle Street''' was a Victorian terraced street in Norwich, Norfolk. It became a [[squatting|squat]] lasting from January 1980 to February 1985 until the street was demolished 1986. 

==History==
A Victorian street consisting of small two up to down terraced houses, according to Morant's map, Argyle Sreet was partly built in 1873; Eyre Bros. 1883-4 Directory lists 106 families and their occupations, mainly manual workers with a significant number of men employed by the railway. Jarrolds Directory of 1889 lists one shopkeeper. It was saved from slum clearance in the early 1960s, after the nearby area of Richmond, or the village on the hill was completely demolished. 

===Slums===
The [[University of East Anglia]] planned to buy the Victorian terraced housing of Argyle Street from [[Norwich City Council]] for student homes in 1979, however, in December of that year a handful of squatters moved in and Britain's longest-running and biggest squat began. In 1980, the squatters formed a [[co-operative]], which was backed by Norwich City Council, which at the time included [[Patricia_Hollis,_Baroness_Hollis_of_Heigham|Pat Hollis]]. Together they applied for a grant from the Government-funded Housing Corporation. In 1981 a £1 million grant was agreed for a major renovation scheme, but in 1982 the [[Department of the Environment]] blocked Norwich City Council's plan to sell or lease the houses to the co-operative.&lt;ref&gt; http://issuu.com/alstokes/docs/argyle_street_&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Revelopment===
In 1984 Norwich City Council decided to demolish the area and develop it for sheltered homes. The final eviction of squatters from Argyle Street occurred in February 1985.&lt;ref&gt; http://issuu.com/alstokes/docs/argyle_street_ &lt;/ref&gt; Some of the redeveloped houses, built in 1986, were demolished in 2015 after subsidence occurred. 

==Legacy==
In 1981 Argyle Street became the setting for scenes of a filmed adaptation of [[Doris Lessing]]'s [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian novel]] ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]''.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1766/year/1981.html &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Awareness''' is the ability to directly know and [[perception|perceive]], to feel, or to be cognizant of events. More broadly, it is the state of being [[consciousness|conscious]] of something.

==Concept==
Awareness is a relative [[concept]]. It may be focused on an internal state, such as a visceral feeling, or on external events by way of sensory perception.

==Self-awareness==
{{Main|Self-awareness}}
Popular ideas about [[consciousness]] suggest the phenomenon describes a condition of being aware of oneself (self-awareness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-awareness|title=Definition of SELF-AWARENESS|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to describe consciousness in [[neurological]] terms have focused on describing networks in the [[brain]] that develop awareness of the [[qualia]] developed by other networks.&lt;ref name=ed1998&gt;{{Cite book |year=1998 |title=Self-awareness: its nature and development |pages=12–13 |isbn=1-57230-317-4 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
Neural systems that regulate [[attention]] serve to attenuate awareness among complex animals whose [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] provides more information than [[cognition|cognitive]] areas of the brain can assimilate. Within an attenuated system of awareness, a [[mind]] might be aware of much more than is being contemplated in a focused [[extended consciousness]].

===Basic awareness===
Basic awareness of one's internal and external world depends on the [[brain stem]]. Bjorn Merker,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070915/bob9.asp Consciousness in the Raw], Science News Online, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; an independent neuroscientist in Stockholm, Sweden, argues that the brain stem supports an elementary form of conscious thought in infants with [[hydranencephaly]]. "Higher" forms of awareness including [[self-awareness]] require cortical contributions, but "primary consciousness" or "basic awareness" as an ability to integrate sensations from the environment with one's immediate goals and feelings in order to guide behavior, springs from the brain stem which human beings share with most of the [[vertebrates]]. Psychologist [[Carroll Izard]] emphasizes that this form of primary [[consciousness]] consists of the capacity to generate emotions and awareness of one's surroundings, but not an ability to talk about what one has experienced. In the same way, people can become conscious of a feeling that they can't label or describe, a phenomenon that's especially common in pre-verbal infants.

Due to this discovery medical definitions of [[brain death]] as a lack of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] activity face a serious challenge.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Basic interests===
Down the brain stem lie interconnected regions that regulate the direction of [[human eye|eye]] gaze and organize decisions about what to do next, such as reaching for a piece of food or pursuing a potential mate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Changes in awareness===
The ability to consciously detect an image when presented at near-threshold stimulus varies across presentations. One factor is "baseline shifts" due to top down attention that modulates ongoing brain activity in sensory cortex areas that affects the neural processing of subsequent perceptual judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sylvester CM, Shulman GL, Jack AI, Corbetta M |title=Asymmetry of anticipatory activity in visual cortex predicts the locus of attention and perception |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=27 |issue=52 |pages=14424–33 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18160650 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3759-07.2007 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/27/52/14424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such top down biasing can occur through two distinct processes: an attention driven baseline shift in the [[alpha wave]]s, and a decision bias reflected in [[gamma wave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Wyart | first1 = V.| last2 = Tallon-Baudry | first2 = C. | title = How Ongoing Fluctuations in Human Visual Cortex Predict Perceptual Awareness: Baseline Shift versus Decision Bias| journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29| issue = 27 | pages = 8715–8725 | date=July 2009 | pmid = 19587278 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0962-09.2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living systems view==
Outside of [[neuroscience]] biologists, [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] contributed their [[Santiago theory of cognition]] in which they wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Capra, Fritjof |authorlink=Fritjof Capra |title=The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y |year=1996 |isbn=0-385-47676-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This theory contributes a perspective that cognition is a process present at organic levels that we don't usually consider to be aware. Given the possible relationship between awareness and [[cognition]], and [[consciousness]], this theory contributes an interesting perspective in the [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]] dialogue of awareness and [[living systems theory]].

==Communications and information systems==

In cooperative settings, awareness is a term used to denote “knowledge created through the interaction of an agent and its environment — in simple terms ‘knowing what is going on’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutwin|first1=Carl|last2=Greenberg|first2=Saul|title=A Descriptive Framework of Workspace Awareness for Real-Time Groupware|journal=Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)|date=September 2002|volume=11|issue=3-4|pages=411–446|doi=10.1023/A:1021271517844}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this setting, awareness is meant to convey how individuals monitor and perceive the information surrounding their colleagues and the environment they are in. This information is incredibly useful and critical to the performance and success of collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dourish|first1=Paul|last2=Bellotti|first2=Victoria|title=Awareness and Coordination in Shared Workspaces|journal=Computer Supported Cooperative Work|date=1992|issue=November|pages=107–114|doi=10.1145/143457.143468}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Kjeld|title=The problem with 'awareness': Introductory remarks on 'awareness in CSCW'|journal=Computer Supported Cooperative Work|date=2002|volume=11|issue=3-4|pages=285–298|doi=10.1023/A:1021272909573}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness can be further defined by breaking it down into a set of characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gutwin|first1=Carl|last2=Greedberg|first2=Saul|title=A framework of awareness for small groups in sharedworkspace groupware|date=1999|publisher=Department of Computer Science|location=University of Saskatchewan, Canada|edition=Technical Report 99-1|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is knowledge about the state of some environment
* Environments are continually changing, therefore awareness knowledge must be constantly maintained 
* Individuals interact with the environment, and maintenance of awareness is accomplished through this interaction. 
* It is generally part of some other activity – generally making it a secondary goal to the primary goal of the activity.

Different categories of awareness have been suggested based on the type of information being obtained or maintained:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg|first1=Saul|last2=Gutwin|first2=Carl|last3=Cockburn|first3=Andy|title=Awareness Through Fisheye Views in Relaxed-WYSIWIS Groupware|journal=Proceedings of the conference on Graphics interface '96|date=1996|pages=28–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informal awareness is the sense of who’s around and what are they up to. E.g. Information you might know from being collocated with an individual 
* Social awareness is the information you maintain about a social or conversational context. This is a subtle awareness maintained through non-verbal cues, such as eye contact, facial express, etc.  
* Group-structural awareness is the knowledge of others roles, responsibilities, status in a group. It is an understanding of group dynamics and the relationship another individual has to the group.  
* Workspace awareness – this is a focus on the workspace’s influence and mediation of awareness information, particularly the location, activity, and changes of elements within the workspace.

These categories are not mutually exclusive, as there can be significant overlap in what a particular type of awareness might be considered. Rather, these categories serve to help understand what knowledge might be conveyed by a particular type of awareness or how that knowledge might be conveyed. Workspace awareness is of particular interest to the [[Computer-supported cooperative work|CSCW]] community, due to the transition of workspaces from physical to virtual environments.

While the type of awareness above refers to knowledge a ''person'' might need in a particular situation, ''[[context awareness]]'' and ''[[location awareness]]'' refer to information a ''computer system'' might need in a particular situation. These concepts of large importance especially for AAA ([[authentication]], [[authorization]], [[accounting]]) applications.

The term of location awareness still is gaining momentum with the growth of ubiquitous computing. First defined by networked work positions ([[network location awareness]]), it has been extended to mobile phones and other mobile communicable entities. The term covers a common interest in whereabouts of remote entities, especially individuals and their cohesion in operation. The term of context awareness is a superset including the concept of location awareness. It extends the awareness to context features of an operational target as well as to the context of an operational area.

==Covert awareness== &lt;!-- This section was merged and is linked from redirect "Covert awareness" --&gt;
{{See also|Blindsight}}
Covert awareness is the knowledge of something without knowing it. Some patients with specific [[brain damage]] are for example unable to tell if a pencil is horizontal or vertical.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} They are however able to grab the pencil, using the correct orientation of the hand and wrist. This condition implies that some of the knowledge the mind possesses is delivered through alternate channels than conscious intent.{{or|date=August 2009}}

==Other uses==
Awareness forms a basic concept of the theory and practice of [[Gestalt therapy]].

In general, "awareness" may also refer to public or common knowledge or understanding about a social, scientific, or political issue, and hence many movements try to foster "awareness" of a given subject, that is, "[[raising awareness]]". Examples include [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] awareness and [[multicultural]] awareness.

Awareness may refer to [[anesthesia awareness]].

A '''bathymetric chart''' is the submerged equivalent of an above-water [[topographic map]]. Bathymetric charts are designed to present accurate, measurable description and visual presentation of the submerged terrain. 

In an ideal case, the joining of a bathymetric chart and topographic map of the same [[Scale (measurement)|scale]] and [[Map projection|projection]] of the same geographic area would be seamless. The only difference would be that the values begin increasing after crossing the zero at the designated [[sea level]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]]. Thus the topographic map's [[mountain]]s have the greatest values while the bathymetric chart's greatest depths have the greatest values. Simply put, the bathymetric chart is intended to show the land if overlying waters were removed in exactly the same manner as the topographic map.

A bathymetric chart differs from a [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] chart in that accurate presentation of the underwater features is the goal while safe [[navigation]] is the requirement for the hydrographic chart. A [[hydrographic chart]] will obscure the actual features to present a simplified version to aid [[sailor|mariners]] in avoiding underwater hazards.

Bathymetric surveys are a [[subset]] of the science of [[hydrography]]. They differ slightly from the [[Hydrographic survey|survey]]s required to produce the product of hydrography in its more limited application and as conducted by the national and international agencies tasked with producing [[chart]]s and [[publication]]s for safe navigation. That chart product is more accurately termed a navigation or hydrographic chart with a strong bias toward the presentation of essential safety information. 

Bathymetric surveys and charts are more closely tied to the science of [[oceanography]], particularly [[marine geology]], and [[underwater engineering]] or other specialized purposes.

Bathymetric charts can also be converted to [[topographic profile|bathymetric profiles]].

A '''blue flower''' ({{lang-de|'''Blaue Blume'''}}) was a central symbol of inspiration for the [[Romanticism]] movement, and remains an enduring [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] in Western art today.&lt;ref name="BlueflowerHistory"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands for [[Desire (emotion)|desire]], [[love]], and the metaphysical striving for the [[Infinity (philosophy)|infinite]] and unreachable. It symbolizes hope and the beauty of things.

==Early use of the symbol==
German author [[Novalis]]  used the symbol in his unfinished [[Bildungsroman]], entitled ''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UwdCyBv2KCgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=novalis+Heinrich+von+Ofterdingen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis_9mhsI7YAhXMz4MKHTlYAxsQ6AEIUjAH#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Henry of Ofterdingen: a Romance, By Novalis (English Translation)]&lt;/ref&gt;After contemplating a meeting with a stranger, the young Heinrich von Ofterdingen dreams about a blue flower which calls to him and absorbs his attention.

==Explanation of the symbol==
In the book ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' the blue flower symbolises the joining of humanity with nature and the spirit so the understanding of nature and of the self is growing.
In the Romantic the meaning of humanity was a continuation from [[Humanism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], but the focus was on one's own emotions, not on abstract theory.
Understanding and thinking rise in the comprehension of Romanticism from one's own individual love.
Feeling is based on the self, thinking is based on the self, and the development of the self leads and inspires the individual person. Also, contemplation is very important. Through feeling, thinking, and contemplation, personal inward cognition is possible. The process of cognition merges again with individual love. The self and nature are in this theory always linked.

==Use of the symbol==
[[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] wrote a poem called ''Die blaue Blume'' (The blue flower). [[Adelbert von Chamisso]] saw the core of Romanticism in the motif, and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] searched for the "Urpflanze" or "original plant" in Italy, which in some interpretations could refer to the blue flower. [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] used the Blue Flower as a symbol for the poetry of ''Novalis'' and the "holy miracle of nature" in his short tale ''"Nachricht von den neuesten Schicksalen des Hundes Berganza"''.

In 1902, Charles Scribner's Sons published ''The Blue Flower'', a collection of short stories by [[Henry Van Dyke]], the first two of which, "The Blue Flower" and "The Source", refer to the blue flower as a symbol of desire and hope, and the object of the narrator's search. This volume also includes Van Dyke's most famous story, "[[The Other Wise Man]]".

[[File:Bluerosecropped.jpg|thumb|[[Blue rose]]]]
[[Walter Benjamin]] used the image of the blue flower several times in his writing. For example, the opening sentence of his essay ''Dream Kitsch'': "No one really dreams any longer of the Blue Flower. Whoever awakes as Heinrich von Ofterdingen today must have overslept." Also in his ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Work of Art]]'' essay: "The equipment-free aspect of reality has here become the height of artifice, and the vision of immediate reality the Blue Flower in the land of technology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/BENWOR.html ''The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility, and Other Writings on Media''], [[Harvard University Press]], {{ISBN|0-674-02445-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.S. Lewis]], in his autobiographical book, ''Surprised By Joy,'' references the "Blue Flower" when speaking of the feelings of longing that beauty elicited when he was a child of six. He associates it with the German word [[sehnsucht]], and states that this intense longing for things transcendent made him "a votary of the Blue Flower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OskozFVBMYC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=c+s+lewis+surprised+by+joy+blue+flower&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vd7DBpp-aO&amp;sig=oBzJKQbI2obbo7_Ha547WMIgMLU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjB9JWWlP_eAhVk6oMKHZymBYMQ6AEwEHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=c%20s%20lewis%20surprised%20by%20joy%20blue%20flower&amp;f=false | title=C.S.

English writer [[Penelope Fitzgerald]]'s historical novel ''[[The Blue Flower]]'' is based on Novalis's early life. In [[John le Carré]]'s 1968 novel ''[[A Small Town in Germany]]'', the character Bradfield says, "I used to think I was a Romantic, always looking for the blue flower" (Pan edition, p.&amp;nbsp;286 – chap. 17). Substance D, a fictitious drug in [[Philip K. Dick]]'s 1977 novel ''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'', is derived from a plant with blue flower.

[[Tennessee Williams]] used images of blue roses in his play, ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', to symbolize the frailty and uniqueness of Laura, a central character that reflects the life of Williams' sister, who underwent a lobotomy. In the play, Laura is nicknamed "Blue Roses" after another character misheard her say "pleurosis".

In his fantasy series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', American author [[George R. R. Martin]] uses the blue flower as a reoccurring symbol to represent young women of the noble [[House Stark]], often with hints to an illicit love affair. In one instance, Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen#Rhaegar|Rhaegar Targaryen]] uses blue winter roses to crown the Lady [[House Stark#Lyanna|Lyanna Stark]] as the "Queen of Love and Beauty" at the Tournament of Harrenhal, passing over his own wife, Princess [[Major houses in A Song of Ice and Fire#Elia|Elia of Dorne]].

"Blaue Blume" is the name of a Danish pop band, whose lyrics are often about the themes of love, hope, emotion and longing. 

"Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud" is a lyric in the song "[[Strawberry Letter 23]]" written by Shuggie Otis in 1971. In 1977, a cover of the song produced by Quincy Jones went on to become a number one hit on the US R&amp;B charts for the Brothers Johnson. 

"Blue Flower" is the name of a song by the British avant-garde pop band of the early 1970s, [[Slapp Happy]], later covered by the 1990s indy rock bands [[Pale Saints]] and [[Mazzy Star]]. "Blue Flowers" is a song by the alternative [[MC]], [[Kool Keith]] (AKA Dr. Octagon), on his 1996 album, ''[[Dr. Octagonecologyst]]''.

===Wandervogel movement===
In 1960 [[Werner Helwig]] published the book ''The Blue Flower of the [[Wandervogel]]'' (''Die blaue Blume des Wandervogels'') a history of the [[youth movement]]. Within the movement, a number of folk songs used the motif.

===The German student movement of the 60s===
In Berlin in 1968, one slogan of the [[German student movement]] stated ''"Schlagt die Germanistik tot, färbt die blaue Blume rot!"'' ("Strike [[Germanistics]] dead, color the blue flower red!") The discipline of Germanistics was targeted as a sclerotic field, not suited to the needs of the people of the present.

===Television, film, and theatre===
[[David Lynch]] uses the symbol of the blue flower in the 2010 short film "[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]", a 16-minute, promotional short film for fashion designer [[Dior]] starring [[Marion Cotillard]], among others. In the film a blue flower is hidden in a [[Dior]] handbag, at first feared and finally embraced by the female protagonist. It may be said that Lynch is associating the handbag with "divine" inspiration and creativity.

Stanley Kubrick made use of the Blue Flower in his final film, Eyes Wide Shut. Sandor Szavost (Sky Dumont) is wearing one while dancing with Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman).

In the movie follow-up to [[David Lynch]]'s television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', entitled ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'', two FBI agents are informed about their upcoming task through a woman named Lil. On her lapel is a tiny, artificial blue rose, clearly symbolic of something; but when Sam asks, Chet simply replies, "But I can't tell you about that."

Blue flower is featured in the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stephenfollows.com/resource-docs/scripts/batman_begins.pdf|title=Batman Begins shooting script|website=www.stephenfollows.com|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, a fear-intensifying hallucinogenic drug is manufactured from blue flowers. The drug is used by [[Ra's al Ghul]] and Dr. Jonathan Crane (the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]), who plan to terrorize [[Gotham City]] by weaponizing the drug into a concentrated powder form and release it into the city's water supply.

Blue flower is again used as the source of a fictitious mind-altering drug, here called Substance D, in the [[A Scanner Darkly (film)|2006 adaptation]] of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''A Scanner Darkly''.

A display of blue ''[[Baptisia australis]]'' flowers is used as a symbol of private support for an annual night of extrajudicial killings that serves as the central plot device of 2013 motion picture ''[[The Purge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/06/06/the-purge-review/2107159/|title='Purge' this social experiment from your to-do list|website=www.usatoday.com|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Ruth Bauer, husband and wife collaborative team, wrote an unconventional music theatre piece entitled ''The Blue Flower'' at the turn of the 21st century. Speaking through liberally fictionalized versions of artists [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], and [[Hannah Höch]] as well as pivotal female scientific figure [[Marie Curie]], the piece works with the romantic significance of the blue flower as it meditates on the brutal political and cultural turmoil of World War I, the short lived [[Weimar Republic]], and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in the [[Nazi Party]].

In ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', blue flower is prominent in the first cut scene where Solid Snake meets up with Naomi at the lab in South America.

A 2012 episode of the BBC television series ''[[New Tricks (TV series)|New Tricks]]'', entitled "Blue Flower", concerns the murder of an East German refugee who had been involved in the Blue Flower organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plot Summary for "New Tricks": Blue Flower (2012)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2128051/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl|work=IMDb|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue flower is used in the 2016 film ''[[Zootopia]]''. In it, the flowers are called "night howlers" and are the source of a drug that causes mammals to become savage and attack anyone who comes near.

'''Clumping''' is a behavior in an [[organism]], usually [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]], in which individuals of a particular species group close to one another for beneficial purposes. Clumping can be caused by the abiotic environment surrounding an organism. [[Barnacles]], for example, group together on rocks that are exposed for the least amount of time during the low tide.&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite book|last=Karleskint|first=George|title=Introduction to Marine Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBXTCQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=clumping+of+sessile+organisms&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|date=26 April 2012|page=22|publisher=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, clumping in sessile animals starts when one organism binds to a hard substrate, such as rock, and other members of the same species attach themselves afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boucot|first=A.J|title=Evolutionary Paleobiology of Behavior and Coevolution|date=22 October 2013|publisher=Elsevier|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFPgBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=clumping+of+sessile+organisms&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbivorous [[snails]] are known to clump around where sufficient algae are present.&lt;ref name =george /&gt; The clumping of [[mussels]] (shown right) has been found to be influenced by competition with other species.

In [[mathematics]], and particularly [[category theory]] a '''coherence condition''' is a collection of conditions requiring that various compositions of elementary morphisms are equal. Typically the elementary morphisms are part of the data of the category. A coherence theorem states that, in order to be assured that all these equalities hold, it suffices to check a small number of identities.

==An illustrative example: a monoidal category==

Part of the data of a [[monoidal category]] is a chosen morphism
&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{A,B,C}&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''associator'':

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{A,B,C} \colon (A\otimes B)\otimes C \rightarrow A\otimes(B\otimes C)&lt;/math&gt;

for each triple of objects &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt; in the category. Using compositions of these &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{A,B,C}&lt;/math&gt;, one can construct a morphism

: &lt;math&gt;( ( A_N \otimes A_{N-1} ) \otimes A_{N-2} ) \otimes \cdots \otimes A_1) \rightarrow ( A_N \otimes ( A_{N-1}  \otimes \cdots \otimes ( A_2 \otimes A_1) ). &lt;/math&gt;

Actually, there are many ways to construct such a morphism as a composition of various &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{A,B,C}&lt;/math&gt;. One coherence condition that is typically imposed is that these compositions are all equal.

Typically one proves a coherence condition using a [[coherence theorem]], which states that one only needs to check a few equalities of compositions in order to show that the rest also hold. In the above example, one only needs to check that, for all quadruples of objects &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,D&lt;/math&gt;, the following diagram commutes.
[[Image:Monoidal category pentagon.svg|640px|center]]

Any pair of morphisms from &lt;math&gt; ( ( \cdots ( A_N \otimes A_{N-1} ) \otimes \cdots ) \otimes A_2 ) \otimes A_1) &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; ( A_N \otimes ( A_{N-1}  \otimes ( \cdots \otimes ( A_2 \otimes A_1) \cdots ) ) &lt;/math&gt; constructed as compositions  of various &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{A,B,C}&lt;/math&gt; are equal.

==Further examples==

Two simple examples that illustrate the definition are as follows. Both are directly from the definition of a category.

===Identity===
Let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''}} be a morphism of a category containing two objects ''A'' and ''B''. Associated with these objects are the identity morphisms {{nowrap|1&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A'' → ''A''}} and {{nowrap|1&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''B'' → ''B''}}. By composing these with ''f'', we construct two morphisms:
:{{nowrap|''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; 1&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A'' → ''B''}}, and
:{{nowrap|1&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''}}.
Both are morphisms between the same objects as ''f''. We have, accordingly, the following coherence statement:
:{{nowrap|1= ''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; 1&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; = ''f'' &amp;nbsp; = 1&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''}}.

===Associativity of composition===
Let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''}}, {{nowrap|''g'' : ''B'' → ''C''}} and {{nowrap|''h'' : ''C'' → ''D''}} be morphisms of a category containing objects ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D''. By repeated composition, we can construct a morphism from ''A'' to ''D'' in two ways:
:{{nowrap|(''h'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g'') &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f'' : ''A'' → ''D''}}, and
:{{nowrap|''h'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; (''g'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f'') : ''A'' → ''D''}}.
We have now the following coherence statement:
:{{nowrap|1= (''h'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g'') &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f'' = ''h'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; (''g'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f'')}}.

In these two particular examples, the coherence statements are ''theorems'' for the case of an abstract category, since they follow directly from the axioms; in fact, they ''are'' axioms. For the case of a concrete mathematical structure, they can be viewed as conditions, namely as requirements for the mathematical structure under consideration to be a concrete category, requirements that such a structure may meet or fail to meet.

Note that this use of the term has practically no relevance to the questionably meaningful concept of evolutionarily [[Devolution (biology)|degenerate]] populations that have lost [[Ancestor|ancestral]] functions.

== Biological examples ==
Examples of degeneracy are found in the [[genetic code]], when many different [[nucleotide sequences]] encode the same [[polypeptide]]; in [[protein folding]], when different polypeptides fold to be structurally and functionally equivalent; in [[protein]] functions, when overlapping binding functions and similar catalytic specificities are observed; in [[metabolism]], when multiple, parallel [[biosynthetic]] and [[catabolic]] pathways may coexist.
More generally, degeneracy is observed in proteins of every functional class (e.g. [[enzymatic]], structural, or regulatory),&lt;ref name="Atamas"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Atamas | title =  Les affinités électives |  journal = Pour la Science | year = 2005 | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 39–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Wagner | title =  The role of population size, pleiotropy and fitness effects of mutations in the evolution of overlapping gene functions |  journal = Genetics | year = 2000 | volume = 154 | issue = 3 | pages = 1389–1401 |  pmid = 10757778 |  pmc = 1461000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[protein complex]] assemblies,&lt;ref name="Kurakin"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Kurakin | title =  Scale-free flow of life: on the biology, economics, and physics of the cell |  journal = Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling | year = 2009 | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pmid=19416527 | doi=10.1186/1742-4682-6-6 | pmc=2683819 | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ontogenesis]],&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Newman | title =  Generic physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis: A common basis for development and evolution |  journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year = 1994 | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 480 |  doi = 10.1046/j.1420-9101.1994.7040467.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[nervous system]],&lt;ref name="Tononi et al."&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Tononi | title =  Measures of degeneracy and redundancy in biological networks |  journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | year = 1999 | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 3257–3262 |  doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.6.3257| last2 =  Sporns | first2 =  O. | last3 =  Edelman | first3 =  G.

== Contribution to robustness ==
Degeneracy contributes to the [[Robustness (evolution)|robustness]] of [[biological trait]]s through several mechanisms. Degenerate components compensate for one another under conditions where they are functionally redundant, thus providing robustness against component or pathway failure. Because degenerate components are somewhat different, they tend to harbor unique sensitivities so that a targeted attack such as a specific [[:wikt:inhibitor|inhibitor]] is less likely to present a risk to all components at once.&lt;ref name="Whitacre" /&gt; There are numerous biological examples where degeneracy contributes to robustness in this way. For instance, [[Gene family|gene families]] can encode for diverse proteins with many distinctive roles yet sometimes these proteins can compensate for each other during lost or suppressed [[gene expression]], as seen in the developmental roles of the [[Adhesin molecule (immunoglobulin -like)|adhesins]] gene family in [[Saccharomyces]].&lt;ref name="Guo et al."&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Guo | title =  A Saccharomyces gene family involved in invasive growth, cell-cell adhesion, and mating |  journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | year = 2000 | volume = 97 | issue = 22 | pages = 12158–12163 |  doi = 10.1073/pnas.220420397| last2 =  Styles | first2 =  C.

== Theory ==
[[File:Relationships between degeneracy, complexity, robustness, and evolvability.png|thumb|right|300px|Theoretical relationships between biological properties that are important to evolution. For a review of evidence that supports these relationships, see.&lt;ref name="Whitacre"/&gt;]]

Several theoretical developments have outlined links between degeneracy and important biological measurements related to robustness, complexity, and [[evolvability]]. These include:
* Theoretical arguments supported by simulations have proposed that degeneracy can lead to distributed forms of robustness in protein interaction networks.&lt;ref name="Whitacre and Bender"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Whitacre and Bender | title =  Networked buffering: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems |  journal = Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling | year = 2010 | volume = 7 | issue = 20 | pages = 20| id = | url = http://www.tbiomed.com/content/7/1/20 | accessdate = 2011-03-11 |  doi = 10.1186/1742-4682-7-20 |  last2 = Bender |  first2 = Axel | pmid=20550663 | pmc=2901314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those authors suggest that similar phenomena is likely to arise in other biological networks and potentially may contribute to the resilience of [[ecosystem]]s as well.
* Tononi ''et al.'' have found evidence that degeneracy is inseparable from the existence of hierarchical complexity in [[neural population]]s.&lt;ref name="Tononi et al."/&gt; They argue that the link between degeneracy and complexity is likely to be much more general.
* Fairly abstract simulations have supported the hypothesis that degeneracy fundamentally alters the propensity for a genetic system to access novel heritable [[phenotype]]s&lt;ref name="Whitacre and Bender_b"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Whitacre and Bender | title =  Degeneracy: a design principle for achieving robustness and evolvability |  journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | year = 2010 | volume = 263 | issue = 1 | pages = 143–153 | id = | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=19925810 | accessdate = 2011-03-11 |  doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.11.008 |  pmid = 19925810 |  last2 = Bender |  first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that degeneracy could therefore be a precondition for open-ended [[evolution]].
* The three hypotheses above have been integrated in&lt;ref name="Whitacre"/&gt; where they propose that degeneracy plays a central role in the open-ended evolution of biological complexity. In the same article, it was argued that the absence of degeneracy within many designed (abiotic) complex systems may help to explain why robustness appears to be in conflict with flexibility and adaptability, as seen in software, [[systems engineering]], and [[artificial life]].&lt;ref name="Whitacre"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
[[Image:absolute complement.svg|200px|thumb|In this image, the '''universal set''' U (the entire rectangle) is dichotomized into the two sets A (in pink) and its complement A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; (in grey).]]
A '''dichotomy''' {{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|t|ə|m|i}} is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a whole (or a set) into two parts (subsets). In other words, this couple of parts must be
* [[jointly exhaustive]]: everything must belong to one part or the other, and
* [[mutually exclusive]]: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts.

Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition.

&lt;!-- this is a confused sentence - clearly ME and JE are NOT mutually exclusive, please re-phrase if you know how it works: 
These two ways to [[partition of a set|partition]] elements are themselves a dichotomy. --&gt;
The two parts thus formed are [[Complement (set theory)|complements]]. In [[logic]], the partitions are [[dual (category theory)|opposites]] if there exists a [[proposition]] such that it holds over one and not the other.

Treating [[continuous variable]]s or multi[[categorical variable]]s as [[binary variable]]s is called [[discretization|dichotomization]]. The [[discretization error]] inherent in dichotomization is temporarily ignored for [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes.

== Etymology ==

The term ''dichotomy'' is from the Greek language {{lang-el|διχοτομία}} ''dichotomía'' "dividing in two" from δίχα ''dícha'' "in two, asunder" and τομή ''tomḗ'' "a cutting, incision".

== Usage and examples==

* The above applies directly when the term is used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], or [[linguistics]]. For example, if there is a concept A, and it is split into parts B and not-B, then the parts form a dichotomy: they are mutually exclusive, since no part of B is contained in not-B and vice versa, and they are jointly exhaustive, since they cover all of A, and together again give A.
* In [[set theory]], a dichotomous relation ''R'' is such that either ''aRb'', ''bRa'', but not both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komjath|first1=Peter|last2=Totik|first2=Vilmos|title=Problems and Theorems in Classical Set Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbCmt-2NxtIC&amp;lpg=PA497&amp;ots=_iKgXwG7Qa&amp;dq=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;pg=PA497#v=onepage&amp;q=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=17 September 2014|pages=497|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[statistics]], dichotomous data may only exist at first two [[levels of measurement]], namely at the [[nominal scale|nominal]] level of measurement (such as "British" vs "American" when measuring nationality) and at the [[ordinal scale|ordinal]] level of measurement (such as "tall" vs "short", when measuring height). A variable measured dichotomously is called a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. 
* In the [[classification of mental disorders]] in [[psychiatry]] or [[clinical psychology]], dichotomous classification or [[categorization]] refers to the use of cut-offs intended to separate disorder from non-disorder at some level of abnormality, severity or disability.
* A [[false dichotomy]] is an [[informal fallacy]] consisting of a supposed dichotomy which fails one or both of the conditions: it is not jointly exhaustive and/or not mutually exclusive. In its most common form, two entities are presented as if they are exhaustive, when in fact other alternatives are possible. In some cases, they may be presented as if they are mutually exclusive although there is a broad middle ground (see also [[undistributed middle]]).
* The divine dichotomy is mentioned in the ''[[Conversations With God]]'' series of books by religious author [[Neale Donald Walsch]].
* In economics, the [[classical dichotomy]] is the division between the real side of the economy and the monetary side. According to the classical dichotomy, changes in monetary variables do not affect real values such as output, employment, and the real interest rate. Money is therefore neutral in the sense that its quantity cannot affect these real variables.
* In [[biology]], a dichotomy is a division of organisms into two groups, typically based on a characteristic present in one group and absent in the other. Such dichotomies are used as part of the process of identifying species, as part of a [[dichotomous key]], which asks a series of questions, each of which narrows down the set of organisms. A well known dichotomy is the question "does it have a backbone?" used to divide species into [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.
* In [[botany]], a dichotomy is a mode of branching by repeated [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]] - thus a focus on branching rather than on division.
* In [[computer science]], more specifically in programming-language engineering, dichotomies are fundamental dualities in a language's design. For instance, [[C++]] has a dichotomy in its memory model (heap versus stack), whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system (references versus primitive data types).
* In the anthropological field of [[theology]] and in [[philosophy]], dichotomy is the belief that humans consist of a soul and a body. (See [[Mind-body dichotomy]].) This stands in contrast to [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]].
* Perceived dichotomies are common in Western thought. [[C. P. Snow]] believes that Western society has become an argument culture ([[The Two Cultures]]). In ''The Argument Culture'' (1998), [[Deborah Tannen]] suggests that the dialogue of Western culture is characterized by a warlike atmosphere in which the winning side has truth (like a trophy). Such a dialogue virtually ignores the middle alternatives.
* In [[sociology]] and [[semiotics]], dichotomies (also sometimes called 'binaries' and/or 'binarisms') are the subject of attention because they may form the basis to divisions and inequality. For example, the [[Domestic-public dichotomy|domestic–public dichotomy]] divides men's and women's roles in a society; the [[East-West dichotomy]] contrasts the [[Orient]] and the [[Western world|Occident]]. Some social scientists attempt to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] dichotomies in order to address the divisions and inequalities they create: for instance [[Judith Butler]]'s deconstruction of the [[gender]]-dichotomy (or [[gender binary]]) and [[Val Plumwood]]'s deconstruction of the human-[[social environment|environment]] dichotomy.
* The [[I Ching]] and [[taijitu]] represent the yin yang theories of traditional [[Chinese culture]]. However, these do not represent a true dichotomy as the symbol incorporates a portion of each in the other, representing a dialectic.
* In [[dialectical behavioral therapy]], a treatment shown to have some success in treating some clients with [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], an essential tool used is based on the idea of dichotomy. Dichotomy, in this case, is a self-defeating behavior using "all-or-nothing" or [[splitting (psychology)|"black-and-white" thinking]]. The therapy teaches the patient how to change the dichotomy to a more "[[dialectical]]" (or "seeing the middle ground") way of thinking.
* One type of dichotomy is dichotomous classification - classifying objects by recursively splitting them into two groups until all are separated and in their own unique category.
* [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/mwc/16540/dichotomy Astronomy] defines a dichotomy as "the phase of the moon or an inferior planet in which half its disk appears illuminated".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14083">The '''ethics of care''' (alternatively '''care ethics''' or '''EoC''') is a [[normative ethics|normative]] [[ethics|ethical theory]] that holds that moral action centers on interpersonal relationships and care or benevolence as a virtue. EoC is one of a cluster of normative ethical theories that were developed by [[feminists]] in the second half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;“Care Ethics” Maureen Sander-Staudt,  The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, http://www.iep.utm.edu/, 22/3/2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] and [[deontology|deontological]] ethical theories emphasize generalizable standards and impartiality, ethics of care emphasize the importance of response to the individual. The distinction between the general and the individual is reflected in their different moral questions: "what is just?" versus "how to respond?".&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, Carol. "Moral Orientation and Moral Development." The Feminist Philosophy Reader. By Alison Bailey and Chris J. Cuomo. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2008. N. pag. 469 Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilligan criticizes the application of generalized standards as "morally problematic, since it breeds [[moral blindness]] or indifference."&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, Carol. "Moral Orientation and Moral Development." The Feminist Philosophy Reader. By
on Bailey and Chris J. Cuomo. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2008. N. pag. 471 Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some beliefs of the theory are basic:
# Persons are understood to have varying degrees of dependence and interdependence on one another. 
# Individuals impacted by the consequences of one's choices deserve consideration in proportion to their vulnerability.
# Details determine how to safeguard and promote the interests of those involved.

==Historical background==
===Carol Gilligan and ''In a Different Voice''===
The founder of Ethics of Care (EoC) was [[Carol Gilligan]], an American ethicist and psychologist. Gilligan was a student of developmental psychologist [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]. Gilligan developed EoC in contrast to her mentor's theory of [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]]. She held that measuring progress by Kohlberg's model resulted in boys being found to be more morally mature than girls, and this held for adult men and women as well (although when education is controlled for there are no gender differences).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, L.J. (1991). "Sex differences in moral reasoning.” In W.M. Kurtines and J. L. Gewirtz (eds.) ''Handbook of moral behavior and development'': Vol, 2. Research. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilligan further argued that Kohlberg's model was not an objective scale of moral development. Gilligan consider it as a masculine perspective on morality, founded on [[justice]] and abstract [[Duty|duties]] or obligations. Dana Ward has stated, in a paper that appears never to have been formally published for critical peer review, that the scale is [[psychometrics|psychometrically]] sound.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Dana (2000). "Still Hearing Voice: The Persistent Myth of Gendered Judgment," Keynote address presented at the VIIIth Biennial conference of the International Society for Justice Research, Rishon LeZion, Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilligan's ''[[In a Different Voice]]'' offered the perspective that men and women have tendencies to view morality in different terms. Her theory claimed women tended to emphasize empathy and compassion over the notions of morality that are privileged in Kohlberg's scale.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, Carol. ''In A Different Voice'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Subsequent research suggests that the discrepancy in being oriented towards care-based or justice-based ethical approaches may be based on gender differences, or on differences in actual current life situations of the genders.&lt;ref&gt;Ford and Lowery (1986). "Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning: A Comparison of the Use of Justice and Care Orientations". ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology''. 50(4), 777-783; Rothbart, Hanley and Albert (1986). "Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning." ''Sex Roles''. 15 (11&amp;12), 645-653; and Krebs, D.L., Vermeulen, S.C., Denton, K., and Carpendale, J. I. (1994). "Gender and perspective differences in moral judgment and moral orientation". ''Journal of Moral Education''. 23, 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to traditional ethical positions==
Care ethics contrasts with more well-known ethical models, such as [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] theories (e.g. [[utilitarianism]]) and deontological theories (e.g. [[Kantian ethics]]) in that it seeks to incorporate traditionally feminized virtues and values which, proponents of care ethics contend, are absent in such traditional models of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/#CarEthTheDifVoi|title=Feminist Ethics|last=Tong|first=Rosemarie|last2=Williams|first2=Nancy|date=May 4, 2009|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care ethics as feminist ethics==
While some feminists have criticized care-based ethics for reinforcing traditional stereotypes of a "good woman"&lt;ref name=Bartky&gt;{{cite book | last = Bartky | first = Sandra Lee | author-link = Sandra Bartky | title = Femininity and domination: studies in the phenomenology of oppression | pages = 104–105 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780415901864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; others have embraced parts of this paradigm under the theoretical concept of care-focused feminism.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosmarie page 162-165"&gt;Tong, Rosmarie: Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction, page 162-165. Westview Press, Charlotte, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Care-focused feminism is a branch of feminist thought, informed primarily by ethics of care as developed by [[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]].&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosmarie page 162-165"/&gt; This body of theory is critical of how caring is socially engendered, being assigned to women and consequently devalued.  “Care-focused feminists regard women’s capacity for care as a human strength”&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosmarie page 162-165"/&gt; which can and should be taught to and expected of men as well as women.  Noddings proposes that ethical caring has the potential to be a more concrete evaluative model of moral dilemma, than an ethic of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education, page 3-4. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noddings’ care-focused feminism requires practical application of [[Nel Noddings#Nel Noddings' relational ethics|relational ethics]], predicated on an ethic of care.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Women and Evil, page 222. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics of care is also a basis for care-focused feminist theorizing on maternal ethics. These theories recognize caring as an ethically relevant issue.&lt;ref&gt;Held, Virginia.  Ethics of Care, page 64. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical of how society engenders caring labor, theorists [[Sara Ruddick]], [[Virginia Held]], and [[Eva Feder Kittay]] suggest caring should be performed and care givers valued in both public and private spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Kittay, Eva Feder:  Love’s Labor: Essays on Women, Equality and Dependency, page 20. Routledge, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;   This proposed paradigm shift in ethics encourages the view that an ethic of caring be the social responsibility of both men and women.

[[Joan Tronto]] argues that the definition of the term "ethic of care" is ambiguous due in part to the lack of a central role it plays in moral theory.&lt;ref name="Tronto"&gt;{{citation | last = Tronto | first = Joan C. | author-link = Joan Tronto | contribution = An ethic of care | editor-last1 = Cudd | editor-first1 = Ann E. | editor-last2 = Andreasen | editor-first2 = Robin O. | editor-link1 = Ann Cudd | title = Feminist theory: a philosophical anthology | pages = 251–263 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | location = Oxford, UK Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781405116619 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that considering moral philosophy is engaged with human goodness, then care would appear to assume a significant role in this type of philosophy.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; However, this is not the case and Tronto further stresses the association between care and "naturalness". The latter term refers to the socially and culturally constructed gender roles where care is mainly assumed to be the role of the woman.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; As such, care loses the power to take a central role in moral theory.

Tronto states there are four ethical elements of care:

#'''Attentiveness''' &lt;br/&gt;Attentiveness is crucial to the ethics of care because care requires a recognition of others' needs in order to respond to them.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; The question which arises is the distinction between ignorance and inattentiveness.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; Tronto poses this question as such, "But when is ignorance simply ignorance, and when is it inattentiveness"?&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt;
#'''Responsibility''' &lt;br/&gt;In order to care, we must take it upon ourselves, thus responsibility.  The problem associated with this second ethical element of responsibility is the question of obligation.  Obligation is often, if not already, tied to pre-established societal and cultural norms and roles.  Tronto makes the effort to differentiate the terms "responsibility" and "obligation" with regards to the ethic of care.  Responsibility is ambiguous, whereas obligation refers to situations where action or reaction is due, such as the case of a legal contract.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; This ambiguity allows for ebb and flow in and between class structures and gender roles, and to other socially constructed roles that would bind responsibility to those only befitting of those roles.
#'''Competence''' &lt;br/&gt;To provide care also means competency.  One cannot simply acknowledge the need to care, accept the responsibility, but not follow through with enough adequacy - as such action would result in the need of care not being met.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt;
#'''Responsiveness''' &lt;br/&gt;This refers to the "responsiveness of the care receiver to the care".&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; Tronto states, "Responsiveness signals an important moral problem within care: by its nature, care is concerned with conditions of vulnerability and inequality".&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; She further argues responsiveness does not equal reciprocity.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; Rather, it is another method to understand vulnerability and inequality by understanding what has been expressed by those in the vulnerable position, as opposed to re-imagining oneself in a similar situation.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt;

The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], since 1992, has shadowed and recorded the top four hundred people who make the most [[gross income]], and they are call the Fortunate 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/article/fortunate-400|title=The Fortunate 400|website=Tax Foundation|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The Fortunate 400 are basically the richest people in the [[United States]]. In 1992, when the IRS starting tracking the people who make the most money, the 400th richest person in America made $24 million. Then In 2007, the 400th [[The World's Billionaires|richest human]] produced $138 million (or $87 million, inflation-adjusted).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/how-the-richest-400-people-in-america-got-so-rich/259520/|title=How the Richest 400 People in America Got So Rich|last=Thompson|first=Derek|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These riches have come from [[capital gain]], and the rich keep making more money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/how-the-richest-400-people-in-america-got-so-rich/259520/|title=How the Richest 400 People in America Got So Rich|last=Thompson|first=Derek|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a constant question and debate in politics whether or not the rich need more tax cuts or need to pay more [[Taxation in the United States|taxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalmemo.com/david-cay-johnston-the-fortunate-400/|title=David Cay Johnston: The Fortunate 400 - The National Memo - Smart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2821">The '''Gajski-Kuhn chart''' (or ''Y diagram'') depicts the different perspectives in [[VLSI|VLSI hardware design]].&lt;ref name=grout&gt;{{cite book|last=Grout|first=Ian|title=Digital Systems Design with FPGAs and CPLDs|year=2008|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|isbn=075068397X|pages=724}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mostly, it is used for the development of [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Daniel Gajski]] and Robert Kuhn developed it in 1983. In 1985, Robert Walker and Donald Thomas refined it.

According to this model, the development of hardware is perceived within three '''domains''' that are depicted as three axis and produce a Y. Along these axis, the '''abstraction levels''' that describe the degree of abstraction. The outer shells are generalisations, the inner ones refinements of the same subject.

The issue in hardware development is most often a [[top-down design]] problem. This is perceived by the three domains of behaviour, structure, and the layout that goes top-down to more detailed abstraction levels. The designer can select one of the perspectives and then switch from one view to another. Generally, the design process is not following a specific sequence in this diagram.

* On the '''system level''', basic properties of an electronic system are determined. For the behavioural description, [[block diagram]]s are used by making abstractions of signals and their time response. Blocks used in the structure domain are [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s, [[Computer memory|memory chip]], etc.
* The '''algorithmic level''' is defined by the definition of concurrent algorithms (signals, loops, variables, assignments). In the structural domain, blocks like [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]s are in use.
* The '''[[register-transfer level]]''' (RTL) is a more detailed abstraction level on which the behaviour between communicating registers and logic units is described. Here, data structures and data flows are defined. In the geometric view, the design step of the [[floorplan (microelectronics)|floorplan]] is located.
* The '''logical level''' is described in the behaviour perspective by [[boolean equation]]s. In the structural view, this is displayed with [[Logical gate|gate]]s and [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]]. In the geometric domain, the logical level is described by [[standard cell]]s.
* The behaviour of the '''circuit level''' is described by mathematics using [[differential equation]]s or [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|logical equation]]s. This corresponds to [[transistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s up to [[crystal lattice]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11451">__NOTOC__
The '''grotesque body''' is a concept, or [[literary trope]], put forward by Russian [[literary critic]] [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] in his study of [[François Rabelais]]' work. The essential principle of grotesque realism is degradation, the lowering of all that is abstract, spiritual, noble, and ideal to the material level. Through the use of the grotesque body in his novels, Rabelais related political conflicts to human [[anatomy]]. In this way, Rabelais used the concept as "a figure of unruly biological and social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perforations: Grotesque Corpus |url=http://www.pd.org/topos/perforations/perf3/grotesque_corpus.html |accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is by means of this information that Bakhtin pinpoints two important [[subtext]]s: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]), and the second is ''grotesque realism'' (grotesque body). Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Katerina and Michael Holquist 297-299, ''Mikhail Bakhtin''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carnival ==
[[File:GreatSouthCarnivalMaskers.jpg|thumb|321x321px|Grotesque masks are shown here, worn by many at a carnival.]]
The [[Carnival]] is known as the feast of fools. In today's world, this is better known as [[Mardi Gras]]. Mardi Gras is a religious celebration where people consume copious amounts of food and wine and have a large party to celebrate. The grotesqueness in the carnival is seen as the abundance and large amount of food consumed by the body. There is much emphasis put on the mouth  (where the body can be entered). Eating, drinking, burping from excess, etc. is all done through the mouth. Rabelais uses the Carnival to refer to politics and critique the world based on human anatomy.

In the Italian celebration of Carnival, masks play a major role as many people wear them during the celebration. Many of these masks can be seen as an exaggeration of the grotesque as they feature enlarged facial elements such as an enlarged nose (which is a part of the grotesque body). The Italian celebration of carnival is similar to that of Mardi Gras where food and alcohol are consumed in excess.

Both renditions of Carnival are celebrated immediately before the Christian season of [[Lent]] which is about a 40-day season for people of Christian (primarily Catholic) faith to cleanse themselves and become pure before [[Easter]] Sunday.

== Grotesque realism ==

Exaggeration, hyperbole, and expressiveness are all key elements of the grotesque style. Certain aspects of the body are referenced when talking about the grotesque. These things include elements of the body that either protrude from the body or a part of the body that can be entered. This is because the body in many cases is seen as pure where as the outside world is not. Therefore, parts of the body that allow the outside world in or allow elements inside the body out, are seen and used as an exaggeration of the grotesque. In the article, "Absurdity and Hidden Truth: Cunning Intelligence and Grotesque Body Images as Manifestations of the Trickster", Koepping refers back to Bakhtin's statement, "The themes of cursing and of laughter are almost exclusively a subject of the grotesqueness of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor = 1062254|title = History of Religions, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Feb., 1985), pp. 191-214|date = Feb 1985|publisher = University of Chicago Press|last = Koepping|first = Klaus-Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Small grotesque scoffing.JPG|thumb|255x255px|The grotesque is used here through the use of the mouth in the architecture of a building.]]
Italian satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] explained: "[[satire]] exhibits the grotesque body, which is dominated by the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|primary needs]] (eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, sex) to celebrate the victory of life: the social and the [[Corporeality|corporeal]] are joyfully joint in something indivisible, universal and beneficial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Se Dio avesse voluto che credessimo in lui, sarebbe esistito (in Italian) |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/276|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin explained how the grotesque body is a celebration of the cycle of life: the grotesque body is a comic figure of profound ambivalence: its positive meaning is linked to birth and renewal and its negative meaning is linked to death and decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazen Brides Grotesque Daughters Treacherous Mothers by Felicity Collins (Bakhtin, 308-317) |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/23/women_funny_oz/ |accessdate=2008-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513042917/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/02/23/women_funny_oz.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rabelais' epoch (1500–1800) "it was appropriate to ridicule the [[king]] and [[clergy]], to use dung and [[urine]] to [[wikt:degradation|degrade]]; this was not to just [[Insult|mock]], it was to unleash what Bakhtin saw as the people’s power, to renew and regenerate the entire [[social system]]. It was the power of the people’s festive-carnival, a way to turn the official spectacle inside-out and upside down, just for a while; long enough to make an impression on the participating official stratum. With the advent of modernity (science, technology, [[industrial revolution]]), the mechanistic overtook the organic, and the officialdom no longer came to join in festive-carnival. The bodily lower stratum of humor dualized from the upper stratum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boje | first = David M. |date=March 2004 | title = Grotesque Method | journal = Proceedings of First International Co-sponsored Conference, Research methods Division, Academy of Management: Crossing Frontiers in Quantitative and Qualitative Research methods. | volume = 2 | pages = 1085–1114 | url = http://peaceaware.com/McD/papers/Lyon%20proceedings%20Boje%202994%20Grotesque%20Method%20.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early uses of grotesque ==
Before people began to develop literature or art, leaders would sit in their halls surrounded by their warriors amusing themselves by mocking their opponents and enemies. The warriors would laugh at any weakness or defect, either physical or mental, giving nicknames which exaggerated these traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art|last = Wright|first = Thomas|publisher = Virtue Brothers &amp; CO.|year = 1865|isbn = |location = London|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon warriors sought to give a more permanent form to their ridicule, which led to rude depictions on bare rocks, or any other surface that was convenient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Medieval Grotesque Carnival, emphasis is put on the nether regions of the body as the center and creation of meaning. The spirit rather than coming from above comes from the belly, buttocks, and genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Lübker, Henrik. "The Method of In-between in the Grotesque and the Works of Leif Lage." Continent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6566">In [[mathematics]], a '''Hardy field''' is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] consisting of [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] of [[real-valued function]]s at infinity that is closed under [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]].  They are named after the English mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]].

==Definition==

Initially at least, Hardy fields were defined in terms of germs of real functions at infinity.  Specifically we consider a collection ''H'' of functions that are defined for all large real numbers, that is functions ''f'' that map (''u'',∞) to the real numbers '''R''', where ''u'' is some real number depending on ''f''.  Here and in the rest of the article we say a function has a property "[[Eventually (mathematics)|eventually]]" if it has the property for all sufficiently large ''x'', so for example we say a function ''f'' in ''H'' is ''eventually zero'' if there is some real number ''U'' such that ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''U''.  We can form an [[equivalence relation]] on ''H'' by saying ''f'' is equivalent to ''g'' if and only if ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''g'' is eventually zero.  The equivalence classes of this relation are called germs at infinity.

If ''H'' forms a field under the usual addition and multiplication of functions then so will ''H'' modulo this equivalence relation under the induced addition and multiplication operations.  Moreover, if every function in ''H'' is eventually differentiable and the derivative of any function in ''H'' is also in ''H'' then ''H'' modulo the above equivalence relation is called a Hardy field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Boshernitzan | first1=Michael | title=Hardy fields and existence of transexponential functions | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f853371068v83301/ | year=1986 | journal=[[Aequationes Mathematicae]] | doi=10.1007/BF02189932 | volume=30 | number=1 | pages=258&amp;ndash;280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of a Hardy field are thus equivalence classes and should be denoted, say, [''f'']&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; to denote the class of functions that are eventually equal to the representative function ''f''.  However, in practice the elements are normally just denoted by the representatives themselves, so instead of [''f'']&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; one would just write ''f''.

==Examples==

If ''F'' is a [[Field extension|subfield]] of '''R''' then we can consider it as a Hardy field by considering the elements of ''F'' as constant functions, that is by considering the number α in ''F'' as the constant function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; that maps every ''x'' in '''R''' to α.  This is a field since ''F'' is, and since the derivative of every function in this field is 0 which must be in ''F'' it is a Hardy field.

A less trivial example of a Hardy field is the field of [[rational function]]s on '''R''', denoted '''R'''(''x'').  This is the set of functions of the form ''P''(''x'')/''Q''(''x'') where ''P'' and ''Q'' are polynomials with real coefficients.  Since the polynomial ''Q'' can have only finitely many zeros by the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], such a rational function will be defined for all sufficiently large ''x'', specifically for all ''x'' larger than the largest real root of ''Q''.  Adding and multiplying rational functions gives more rational functions, and the [[quotient rule]] shows that the derivative of rational function is again a rational function, so '''R'''(''x'') forms a Hardy field.

Another example is the field of functions that can be expressed using the standard arithmetic operations, exponents, and logarithms, and are well-defined on some interval of the form &lt;math&gt;(x,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt; G. H. Hardy, ''Properties of Logarithmico-Exponential Functions'', Proc. London Math. Soc. (2), 54-90, '''10''', 1911 &lt;/ref&gt; Such functions are sometimes called ''Hardy L-functions''.  Much bigger Hardy fields (that contain Hardy L-functions as a subfield) can be defined using [[transseries]].

==Properties==

Any element of a Hardy field is eventually either strictly positive, strictly negative, or zero.  This follows fairly immediately from the facts that the elements in a Hardy field are eventually differentiable and hence [[Continuous function|continuous]] and eventually either have a multiplicative inverse or are zero.  This means periodic functions such as the sine and cosine functions cannot exist in Hardy fields.

This avoidance of periodic functions also means that every element in a Hardy field has a (possibly infinite) limit at infinity, so if ''f'' is an element of ''H'', then
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
exists in '''R'''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{&amp;minus;∞,+∞}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Rosenlicht | first1=Maxwell | title=The Rank of a Hardy Field | jstor=1999639 | year=1983 | journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society | volume=280 | number=2 | pages=659&amp;ndash;671 | doi=10.2307/1999639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also means we can place an [[Total order|ordering]] on ''H'' by saying ''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''g'' if ''g''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''f'' is eventually strictly positive.  Note that this is not the same as stating that ''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''g'' if the limit of ''f'' is less than the limit of ''g''.  For example, if we consider the germs of the identity function ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' and the exponential function ''g''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; then since ''g''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''x'' we have that ''g''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''f''.  But they both tend to infinity.  In this sense the ordering tells us how quickly all the unbounded functions diverge to infinity.

==In model theory==

The modern theory of Hardy fields doesn't restrict to real functions but to those defined in certain structures expanding [[real closed field]]s.  Indeed, if ''R'' is an [[o-minimal theory|o-minimal]] expansion of a field, then the set of unary definable functions in ''R'' that are defined for all sufficiently large elements forms a Hardy field denoted ''H''(''R'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kuhlmann | first1=Franz-Viktor | last2=Kuhlmann | first2=Salma | title=Valuation theory of exponential Hardy fields I | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/jbkltyacb2mfq10w/ | year=2003 | journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift | doi=10.1007/s00209-002-0460-4 | volume=243 | number=4 | pages=671&amp;ndash;688}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The properties of Hardy fields in the real setting still hold in this more general setting.

'''Harry Heinz Schwarz''' (13 May 1924 – 5 February 2010) was a South African lawyer, statesman and long-time [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|political opposition]] leader against [[apartheid]] in South Africa, who eventually served as the [[South African Ambassador to the United States]] during the country's transition to [[majority rule]].

Schwarz rose from the childhood poverty he experienced as a German-Jewish refugee to become a lawyer and a member of the [[Transvaal Provincial Council]], where from 1963 to 1974, he was [[Leader of the Opposition]]. In the 1964 [[Rivonia Trial]] he was a defence lawyer. Advocating a more aggressive political opposition to the National Party's racial policies in the 1960s and 1970s, as Leader of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] in [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and leader of the liberal "Young Turks", he clashed with the United Party establishment. He pioneered the call in white politics for a negotiated end to apartheid and in 1974 signed the [[Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]] with [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] for a non-racial democratic society in South Africa. He was in the opposition for over 40 years and was a founding member of the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]]. In light of his record, his appointment as South African Ambassador to the United States in 1990 was widely heralded as symbolic of the government's commitment to ending apartheid,&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Battersby |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1991/0325/25151.html |title=South Africa's Unlikely New Envoy |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played a significant role in renewing the nation's image as the new democratic South Africa.&lt;ref name="14163.tif"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1990/007/14163.tif|format=TIF|title=New Envoy to America : Sign of Changing Times|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="14253.tif"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1990/007/14253.tif|format=TIF|title=New Ambassador|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="14445.tif"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1990/007/14445.tif|format=TIF|title=New Phase for SA  Politics - De Beer|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[South African Air Force]] [[World War II]] veteran during the 1950s, Schwarz co-founded the [[Torch Commando]], an ex-soldiers' movement to protest against the disenfranchisement of coloured people in South Africa. Described as South Africa's "most feisty politician" and a political "maverick",&lt;ref name="samedia.uovs.ac.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2056613|title=Battling Ways of Air Man Schwarz|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2056613|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was known for his parliamentary clashes with the apartheid government over its racial and economic policies. In his political career spanning 43 years, in which he gained respect from across the political spectrum, he never lost an election.&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.za/content/25.03%20INSESSION%20Mar%20final.pdf|format=PDF|title=In Session magazine|publisher=Parliament.gov.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727181931/http://www.parliament.gov.za/content/25.03%20INSESSION%20Mar%20final.pdf|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he received the [[Order for Meritorious Service]] and received several [[Honorary Doctorate]]s.  He was also one of the South African Jewish community's foremost leaders and spoke out strongly against anti-semitism.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= Community and Conscience: The Jews and Apartheid South Africa |last= Shimoni |first= Gideon |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2003|publisher= University Press of New England |location= Hanover, N.H. |isbn= 1-58465-329-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarz was described by the [[University of Stellenbosch]] as "one of the conceptual and moral fathers of the new South Africa"&lt;ref&gt;[http://70.84.171.10/~etools/newsbrief/1995/news0923] {{dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that he had not only been one of apartheid's most prominent opponents, but his ideas and the initiatives he had taken had played a key role in the development of the concept of a negotiated democracy in South Africa, based on the principles of [[Political freedom|freedom]] and justice. [[Nelson Mandela]], a friend of his whom he visited while in prison, described him as a "champion of the poor".&lt;ref name="parliament" /&gt;

==Refugee from Germany==
Harry Schwarz was born Heinz Schwarz to Fritz (1897–1969) and Alma Schwarz (1901–1999) in [[Cologne]], Germany. His family belonged to the [[Glockengasse Synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajr.org.uk/journalpdf/1986_september.pdf|format=PDF|title=WINDS OF CHANGE : New Perspectives at the Annual General Meeting |publisher=ajr.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in South Africa as a Jewish refugee from Germany in 1934 with his mother and younger brother Kurt. His father Fritz, a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] activist, left for South Africa the night the Nazis came to power. They boarded the [[SS Giulio Cesare]] in [[Genoa]], Italy which took them to South Africa. When they arrived in [[Cape Town]] they stayed in one room in a house in Kloof Street. Schwarz described how he was "lucky" as eventually he was able to sleep in a bathroom in a rusty bath. He spoke no [[Afrikaans]] or English at first and had strong memories of being taunted on the schoolyard for being different. Schwarz stated in an interview in 1991 that "I know what the word discrimination means, not because I've read it in a book, but because I've been the subject of it. And I know what it means to be hungry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-12/news/wr-1224_1_new-south-africa?pg=3 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Scott | last=Kraft | date=12 February 1991 | title=Profile : S. Africa's De Klerk Sends Best Foe to Washington : Is he crazy to appoint Harry Schwarz the new ambassador? Like a fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrimination and financial difficulties of his family left a strong impression on Schwarz and helped shape his political philosophy with its emphasis on social justice and the rule of law.

He attended Tamboerskloof School and [[South African College Schools]] in Cape Town and then [[Jeppe High School for Boys]] in Johannesburg.

===Military service===
{{Main|Military history of South Africa during World War II}}
Following his graduation from school in 1943, he was offered a job working for a stockbroker, as well as a university scholarship. However, Schwarz instead joined the South African Air Force during World War II in order to defeat Nazism. He served as a navigator and fought in North Africa, Crete and Italy. It was in the air force that he adopted the name Harry, as his Colonel said Heinz would not stand him in good stead if he were captured by Germans. He was in [[15 Squadron SAAF|15 Squadron]] and seconded to the RAF. In 1984 he was made an Honorary Colonel of the 15th Squadron.

==Wits University==
In 1946 he went to [[University of the Witwatersrand]] (more commonly known as Wits University) in Johannesburg with the help of a Government loan and grant, where he first befriended fellow students and future anti-apartheid political activists [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Joe Slovo]]. He joined the United Party and assisted in the 1948 election. However, as a result of the National Party victory, he was determined to become more active and was elected Chairman of the United Party branch at the university. He argued that the National Party's victory in 1948 was reversible and anyone who opposed them should concentrate on defeating them. In an interview in 1991, Schwarz said on the National Party victory that "To me, they were the people who had supported Germany during the war. As a young man, it was very objectionable to me that the very people I had been fighting against were the people that the National Party had supported." He was also president of the university's ex-servicemen's league and chair of the Law Students Council. He stood as a candidate for treasurer of the Students Representative Council and refrained from voting for himself which he considered to be unethical. When the votes were counted, it was announced that Schwarz had lost by one vote.&lt;ref name="samedia.uovs.ac.za"/&gt;

He was awarded a BA, with distinctions in both history and [[economic history]], and later an [[Bachelor of Laws#South Africa|LLB]]. In 1949 he was admitted as a solicitor and, later, as a barrister (Member of [[Middle Temple]]) in London, United Kingdom. In 1953, he became  [[Advocate#South Africa|advocate at the South African Bar]].

==Rivonia trial==
{{Main|Rivonia Trial}}
In 1963, [[Nelson Mandela]] and many other political opponents were arrested and brought to court in the famous [[Rivonia Trial]]. Harry Schwarz was one of the defence barristers in the trial defending Accused No. 8 [[James Kantor|Jimmy Kantor]], who was a close friend of his. Kantor was Mandela's lawyer in the trial until he too was arrested and charged with the same crimes as Mandela. After being the subject of vicious taunting and many attempts to place him as a vital cog of MK by [[Percy Yutar]], finally Judge [[Quartus de Wet]] discharged him, stating Accused No 8 has no case to answer. Kantor along with [[Rusty Bernstein]] were the only accused who were acquitted. Kantor noted in his autobiography, A Healthy Grave, that Schwarz refused payment. Schwarz was refused access to Mandela while he was imprisoned on [[Robben Island]], however he was granted access to visit him after 1988 when he was transferred to [[Victor Verster Prison]]. After the trial he left the Bar and became a solicitor so that he could concentrate on fighting apartheid.

During the trial he presented the case for Kantor as follows, "My Lord, it is difficult to reply in a restrained fashion. My learned friend must not use words such as 'Communist' lightly, when he refers to Kantor. Kantor is not a Communist. My learned friend has used the tactics of McCarthyism in an endeavour to smear him. I think, with respect, my learned friend is allowing himself to run away with facts that are not there. His complaint in count one is not that they found files with evidence. Oh not, he says that 'we found files with nothing in them', not in Kantor's office, but in the office of Wolpe. Then my learned friend [held] that the practice had been ruined and liquidated Kantor's practice. My lord, it is not Kantor. It is not Kantor! Why I say it is so difficult to be restrained, is that my learned friend has thrown in everything that concerns every accused in this case, and says 'that is why I don't want Kantor to get bail.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kantor |first=James |year=1967 |title=A healthy grave |publisher=Seven Seas Books|asin=B0006D1XN4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to politics==
Harry Schwarz's political career started with his election to the [[Johannesburg]] City Council in 1951 for Booysens, which had been said to be an unwinnable seat against the National Party. Schwarz won the seat by 954 votes. Despite being the youngest person in the city council, he became chairman of the council's management committee - the most influential committee on the council. While in the council, Schwarz focused on challenging forced evictions of black and coloured people in Johannesburg, and attempted to improve housing and education. Booysens had once been occupied by [[Labour Party (South Africa)|Labour Party]] politician [[Jimmy Green (South African politician)|Jimmy Green]], who was his wife's uncle, who was first elected in 1920 to the City Council.

In 1958 during a by-election Schwarz was elected into the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] provincial council for the Hospital constituency. The constituency eventually was renamed [[Hillbrow]]. In 1963 he became Leader of the Opposition in the Transvaal Provincial Council, a post he would hold until 1974. He continued to practice law whilst serving in the Provincial Council and throughout his political career. However, he briefly withdrew from law between 1969 and 1974 to take up the position of Chief Executive of Merchant Bank.

Schwarz's vision for the post-apartheid South Africa was embodied in a document named the "Act of Dedication", of which he presented to the provincial council in 1973. The document, written by him, called for the Transvaal and the rest of South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the principles of a non-discriminatory society. While the UP Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused to allow it to be debated in the council and parliament. Schwarz pushed for the adoption of the act in the 1973 National UP Congress, in which he succeeded.

==Tensions within United Party==
In 1959, Schwarz remained in the United Party after 11 liberal United Party members broke away from the party to form the Progressive Party in 1959, opting instead to change the UP from within. By the early 1970s Schwarz had become known as the leader of the liberal faction of the party, dubbed the "Young Turks", who wanted the UP to adopt a more aggressive approach to the National Party and its policy of apartheid. Schwarz and his Young Turks faced fierce opposition and resistance from the party's national leader Sir [[De Villiers Graaff]] and other members of the UP's "Old Guard". Schwarz achieved prominence as a race relations and economic reformist in the party. In 1971 he became deputy leader of the UP in the Transvaal, a post specially created for him. However, internal divisions in the party between liberals and conservatives came to a head in August 1973 when Schwarz ousted Marais Steyn as the leader of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] in the Transvaal. Steyn had been a MP for almost 25 years and for 15 years had been a close adviser to [[De Villiers Graaff]]. After Steyn lost the election he defected to the National Party. Schwarz's victory was a visible sign of strength from the liberals within the party.

===Mahlabatini Declaration===
{{Main|Mahlabatini Declaration}}
On 4 January 1974, Harry Schwarz met and had discussions with Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi|Buthelezi]], Chief Executive Councillor of the black homeland of [[KwaZulu]]. They agreed on a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa that became known as the [[Mahlabatini Declaration|Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]]. The declaration's purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa for racial peace in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Thomas |year=2002|title=Indispensable traitors: liberal parties in settler conflicts|publisher=[[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]]|isbn=0-313-31774-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing opportunity for all with a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] to safeguard these rights. It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also first affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means. The concept of a non-discriminatory society had been outlined in the 'Act of Dedication' of 1973 that Schwarz had written, while Leader of the Opposition in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. Schwarz had called for the Transvaal and South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the act. While the United Party Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused for it to come to debate. The principles of the act were adopted at the 1973 National United Party Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201973.pdf|format=PDF|title=A SURVEY OF RACE RELATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA: 1973 |publisher=Nelsonmandela.org|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration was the first of such agreements by acknowledged black and white leaders in South Africa that affirmed to these principles. The commitment to the peaceful pursuit of political change was declared at a time when neither the National Party or African National Congress were looking for peaceful solutions or dialogue. The declaration was heralded by the English speaking press as a breakthrough in race relations in South Africa. The declaration was endorsed by several chief ministers of the [[black homelands]], including [[Cedric Phatudi]] ([[Lebowa]]), [[Lucas Mangope]] ([[Bophuthatswana]]) and Hudson Nisanwisi ([[Gazankulu]]). The declaration also received praise from liberal figures such as [[Alan Paton]].

The declaration drew much media interest from both inside and outside South Africa. However, the declaration provoked an angry response from the UP's 'Old Guard', including the party's leader De Villiers Graaff and led to Schwarz and other liberals being expelled from the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201975.pdf|format=PDF|title=A SURVEY OF RACE RELATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA: 1975|publisher=Nelsonmandela.org |accessdate=13 January 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1974 Chief Phatudi, Harry Schwarz and M. I. Mitchell (United Party MP), had discussions at [[Seshego]]. They issued a joint statement, endorsing the principles embodied in the Mahlabatini Declaration. It also stated that all South Africans must be united to meet any external threats, subversion, or terrorism, and that the best way of uniting the people to meet such threats was to give them a real stake in society which they were asked to defend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201974.pdf|format=PDF|title=A SURVEY OF RACE RELATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA: 1974 |publisher=Nelsonmandela.org|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary career==
[[File:HSchwarz.JPG|thumb|Harry Schwarz was expelled from the United Party in 1975 after delivering his "I am my brother's keeper" speech to Parliament]]

===Realigning opposition===
Harry Schwarz played a key role in the realignment of the opposition in South Africa. In the [[South African general election, 1974|1974 general election]], Schwarz was elected into Parliament for [[Yeoville]], along with other liberal members of Schwarz's Young Turks. In February 1975, Dick Enthoven MP was expelled from the United Party by Sir de Villiers Graaff for "disloyalty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-A32-84-al.sff.document.nusa197504.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February 1975, when asked in Parliament by a National Party MP if he supported Enthoven's liberal positions, Schwarz replied "I make no secret of it. I am my brother's keeper". For not following the party line, Schwarz was expelled from the party. This led to the resignation of four other MP's, Senator Brian Bramford, ten members of the Transvaal Provincial Council, which made it the official opposition party in the Transvaal Provincial Council, 14 out of the 36 Johannesburg City Councillors and four Randburg City Councillors. On the night of the expulsion, the [[Reform Party (South Africa)|Reform Party]] was launched, of which Schwarz as elected leader. The party's charter mainly incorporated the [[Mahlabatini Declaration]]'s principles and called for [[universal franchise]] and for equality to be extended to all.

On 25 July 1975, the Reform Party merged with the [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]] to form the [[Progressive Reform Party (South Africa)|Progressive Reform Party]]. Schwarz became the party's spokesman on finance, education and Chairman of the Federal Executive, while [[Colin Eglin]], the former leader of the Progressives was elected leader of the newly merged party. In 1977 the party was renamed the [[Progressive Federal Party]], when additional defectors from the United Party joined. This served to finally realign opposition politics in South Africa, as the PFP became the official opposition party in South Africa, following the [[South African general election, 1977|1977 General Election]].

===Leader of the opposition===
Schwarz, as one of his party's co-founders, finance spokesman (1975–91), defence spokesman (1975–84) and Chairman of the Federal Executive (1975–79), was one of its foremost leaders and a prominent leader of the opposition. He was regarded the PFP's "star performer" in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leon|first=Tony|year=2009|title=On the Contrary: Leading the Opposition in the New South Africa|publisher=Jonathan Ball Publishers|isbn=1-86842-259-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109013446/https://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article305270.ece/|title=Times LIVE|date=2017-11-09|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with others such as [[Colin Eglin]], he was an iconic opposition figure. He was known nationwide for his sharp attacks on the National Party. According to veteran progressive MP [[Helen Suzman]], Schwarz carried out his role so effectively as Shadow Finance Minister that National Party Finance Ministers lived in terror of him, particularly when the time came for delivering the annual budget speech. He served as deputy chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance and was on the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee. During his 17 years in parliament Schwarz, along with other opposition leaders like Colin Eglin, [[Zach de Beer]] and [[Frederik van Zyl Slabbert]] forcefully denounced the government's racial policies, as well as its press restrictions and economic policies. Schwarz also played a key role exposing the [[Muldergate Scandal]] of 1979, that led to the resignation of Prime Minister [[John Vorster|B. J. Vorster]], acting as the PFP's representative to the investigation commission. On several occasions, Schwarz received behind-the-scenes offers to take up a Cabinet position under a National Party government, which he refused every time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045204/http://www.sajewishreport.co.za/pdf/latest_issue/NJWED00410.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|last=|first=|date=2013-05-11|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarz was often involved in heated clashes in parliament with government figures. In June 1980, Prime Minister P.W. Botha said to Schwarz, "You're the last person who will dictate to me", who was responding to Schwarz's accusation that the PM would be failing in his duty to South Africa unless he publicly repudiated the Minister of Posts, Hennie Smit, for his 'slow-thinking' remarks on Schwarz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1897581|title=PM and Schwarz Clash over Smit|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093918/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1897581|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1989, Schwarz debated with Minister of the Budget [[Kent Durr]] live on Television in the House of Assembly. Schwarz  slammed the NP economic policies and was regarded to have won the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2032551 |title=Survey favours Schwarz in TV debate with Durr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043936/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2032551 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to press restrictions===
In 1979, Schwarz appealed to the National Party and its leader to reconsider a bill that would, in the PFP's view, heavily restrict press freedom. He urged the Prime Minister: "I make this appeal to Mr Botha: Show this statesmanship, show that at this time you will not allow our unity of purpose to overcome the real problems to be threatened."  In 1980, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] introduced the National Key Points Act that made those responsible for unauthorised reporting of incidents of sabotage or other attacks on declared national strategic targets a criminal. Schwarz slammed the attempts to restrict press freedoms, and stated that "Society as a whole is not condemned because individuals transgress, and nor should the press as a whole be judges by the actions of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=20734481|title=Schwarz Slams Bid to Curb Press|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=20734481|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=20706601|title=A-G Bill a 'Turning Point' in SA Politics|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=20706601|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stating that press restrictions marked a "turning point" in South African politics, he also argued that press freedom was a "precious treasure" and a free and courageous press was a major weapon in South Africa's defence against external threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1979/031/01823.tif|format=TIF|title=Withdraw This Sledgehammer, Schwarz Pleads |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill of Rights proposal===
In August 1983 during the [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitutional Reform Debate]] Harry Schwarz submitted a motion calling for a 'Bill of Rights' to be incorporated in the new constitution of South Africa, the first motion of its kind ever brought before Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917284|title=PFP's Lone Stand on 'Rights'|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227153032/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917284|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the Bill should guarantee freedom from discrimination on the ground of race, colour, sex or creed, freedom of conscience and religion, of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press, of association, peaceful assembly and movement, and freedom to pursue the gaining of a livelihood. It also included freedom from deprivation of life, liberty, security and property, except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. It would also guarantee equality before the law and equal protection and benefit of law.

Schwarz argued that if included in the constitution of the republic, it would act as a "protector of rights many people had struggled to achieve in South Africa" as well as to "act as an inspiration" to the people of South Africa and would "be a unifying factor in a country in which unity of people is essential for survival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1983/027/07120.tif|format=TIF|title=Bill of Rights Woyuld Help Unite - PFP |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While virtually all MPs of the Progressive Federal Party supported the bill, no other party in Parliament supported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917319|title=Right Wing Defeats PFP's Bill of Rights|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013446/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917319|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting Schwarz's proposal, Daan van der Merwe of the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] stated that the bill, based on a "leftist-liberal political philosophy", would jeopardise the freedom of the white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917014|title=PFP Fails in Lone Fight for Bill of Rights|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224121/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917014|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Republic Party (South Africa)|New Republic Party]] leader [[Vause Raw]] said Schwarz "a master at platitudes" was seeking idealistic freedoms that did not exist anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1983/027/07128.tif|format=TIF|title=Change Would Cause Court Chaos|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rejection of Schwarz's bill, fellow PFP MPs' [[Helen Suzman]], [[Colin Eglin]], Ray Swart and Dave Dalling attempted a further four times to introduce a Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1911320|title=A Fourth Attempt to Change Reform Bill|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022635/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1911320|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bills' were effectively blocked by the National Party by placing them at the end of the order paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1910703|title=PFP Launches Another Bid for Constitution Bill|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020745/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1910703|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of the new South Africa, signed into law in 1996, includes a Bill of Rights, which includes the same principles of the 1983 motion.

===Divisions within PFP===
While distinctly on the left of South African politics, he was perceived to be on the right-wing of the PFP mainly due to his favouring strong military defence and his insistence that political change must take place without the disruption of law and order, which earned him the nickname "Harry the Hawk Schwarz". He often found himself in dispute with some members of the original Progressive Party, particularly [[Helen Suzman]]. Colleagues would often refer the clashes they had in the parliamentary caucus meetings as "the Helen and Harry show". Suzman wrote of her relations with Schwarz in her autobiography, ''In No Uncertain Terms: A South African Memoir'': following the merger between the PP and Schwarz's Reform Party "I stayed in the party, but relations between Harry Schwarz and myself were very strained for some time thereafter. They improved only in 1986 when [[Frederik van Zyl Slabbert]] resigned from Parliament and the Progressive Federal Party. Harry Schwarz and I were the two most outraged members of the caucus, and our other differences faded into insignificance as a result. We developed a mutual respect for one another. Schwarz was an extremely able MP with a good financial brain, and a hard worker who could devastate National Party members in Parliament, especially [[Minister of Finance (South Africa)|Ministers of Finance]], who feared his vigorous attacks. Like me, he could be unpleasant both in and out of the House. The differences we had were not on racial policy, but on his hawkish support of the [[South African Defence Force]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Suzman |first=Helen |year=1993 |title=In No Uncertain Terms: A South African Memoir|publisher=Knopf|isbn=0-679-40985-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic Party===
Schwarz was one of the founding members of the Democratic Party. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, as its Spokesman on Finance, formulated its social market policy. Given South Africa's complex character, Mr Schwarz supported a federal system similar to that of the United States, as well as a justiciable Bill of Rights to protect the rights of minorities as well as the majority. This was also longstanding policy of the former Progressive Party dating back to the report of their Molteno Commission of the early 1960s. His economic philosophy was summed up in a phrase he often used: "Freedom is incomplete if it is exercised in poverty".

On 6 February 1991, he ended his career in parliament following his appointment as the South African ambassador to the United States. His farewell speech to parliament was entitled  "Look after my people while I'm gone".

==Mandela prison visit==
After the 1964 Rivonia Trial, where Schwarz had been on the defence team and where his university friend Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, Schwarz was barred from gaining access to Mandela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1989/026/04205.tif|format=TIF|title=Schwarz Meets Mandela |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Mandela was moved to [[Victor Verster Prison]], various restrictions were lifted upon Mandela, including more lenient visitation rights. On 23 November 1989, Schwarz, following a request from Mandela, visited him in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2164009 |title=The Mandela Merry-Go-Round |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za |accessdate=14 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093957/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2164009 |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his visit, Schwarz called for the "immediate and unconditional" release of Mandela, stating that this was "in the interest of all South Africans - black and white - that this should happen as soon as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1989/032/04057.tif|format=TIF|title=Free Mandela Immediately Says Schwarz |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South African Ambassador to United States==
[[File:New South African flag unveiling.jpg|thumb|Ambassador Harry Schwarz unveiling the new [[South African flag]] to the United States and President [[Bill Clinton]] in May 1994]]

Harry Schwarz was the first serving politician from the parliamentary [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] ranks to be appointed to a senior ambassadorial post in [[South African]] history as well as the first Jewish ambassador. He was also accredited as the first South African High Commissioner to [[Barbados]] in 1993 when diplomatic relations opened. Schwarz had previously received behind-the-scenes offers to accept a Cabinet position, by President P.W. Botha and Prime Minister B.J. Vorster, but refused every time due to his opposition to apartheid. He agreed to the appointment of ambassador because of the government's commitment to the fundamental reforms that he had fought for, as well as on the terms that the National Party would not try to take his seat in [[Yeoville]].

In an interview with the [[New York Times]] Schwarz said that "He hasn't asked me to change my political convictions," speaking of President de Klerk. "He knows that I'm implacably opposed to apartheid. Otherwise, there's no logic in asking me to do this job." Nor, Mr. Schwarz added, was he bound for Washington to represent South Africa's five million whites. "I've made it clear that I want to be ambassador for 37 million people." A comment in the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', typified the reaction among much of the US press: "When a man who has devoted most of his life to the struggle for a new South Africa tells you that apartheid is dead and that sanctions are holding up its burial, he speaks with a moral authority that is difficult to assail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jeff Jacoby |url=http://www.jeffjacoby.com/13588/this-apartheid-foe-says-sanctions-hurt |title=This apartheid foe says sanctions hurt |publisher=Jeff Jacoby |date=1991-05-08 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Schwarz, a well known and respected anti-apartheid leader was willing to accept the post was widely acknowledged in South Africa as a further demonstration of President F. W de Klerk's determination to introduce a new democratic system.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

[[File:AmbassadorSchwarz,Bush.jpg|thumb|left|200|Harry Schwarz handing his credentials to President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1991]]

===Diplomatic legacy===
Schwarz has been credited as having played one of the leading roles in the renewal of relations between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1994/007/09915.tif|format=TIF|title=It's a Triumph for Schwarz |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cape Times described Schwarz as having "engineered a state of US/South Africa relations better than it has ever been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=940042|title=A Job Well Done, Harry!|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094003/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=940042|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Schwarz, for decades a well known anti-apartheid figurehead, was willing to accept the position was widely acknowledged as a highly symbolic demonstration of President F. W de Klerk's determination to introduce a new democratic system.&lt;ref name="14163.tif" /&gt;&lt;ref name="14253.tif" /&gt;&lt;ref name="14445.tif" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1991/007/04818.tif|format=TIF||title=Schwarz Delivers Message of Change |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Schwarz's tenure, he negotiated the lifting of US sanctions against South Africa, secured a $600 million aid package from President [[Bill Clinton]], signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1991 and hosted President Mandela's state visit to the US in October 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1994/007/05929.tif|format=TIF|title=Schwarz Highly Rated |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[African National Congress]] victory in the 1994 General election, President Nelson Mandela requested Schwarz remain as ambassador until after his state visit in October of that year, of which Schwarz agreed. Schwarz resigned his post as ambassador and returned to South Africa in November 1994, following his three and-a-half-year tenure as South African ambassador to the United States. At an event sponsored by the South African Jewish Board of Deputies in his honour, Schwarz urged the Jewish community to make the best of the changes taking place in South Africa and to contribute actively to the success of the country.

==Jewish community leadership==
Beginning in the mid-seventies, Schwarz emerged as one of the South African Jewish community's foremost leaders. Schwarz often led the opposition to anti-semitic comments and movements by prominent public figures, and was often involved in heated clashes in parliament. In April 1982, Schwarz was ordered out of the parliamentary chamber after he described Nationalist MP Andre Fourie as "vuilgoed' (rubbish), in response to Fourie saying that he was "enough to make a Jew anti-Semitic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1904180|title=Schwarz Ordered From House|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1904180|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1986, he took up the issue of anti-semitism within the far-right Conservative Party after its leader [[Clive Derby-Lewis]] responded to a question of whether Jews were "money and power grabbers" by asking "Is that anti-semitic or fact?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2194868|title=MP Takes Up Issue of Anti Semitism|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2194868|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also slammed the CP's supporters use of Nazi symbols and banners, and for burning the Israeli flags. While affirming that "the days of the Jews walking into the gas chambers are over", Schwarz also warned that the Jewish community should "not paint everybody with a broad brush", and that impulsive reactions should be avoided before "waging war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=636702|title=Anti Semitism in SA|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=636702|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Schwarz would often use his access and relations with government ministers, police and the military establishment to investigate incidents of anti-semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1658112|title=Train Terror: Anti Semitism Unlikely|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1658112|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Schwarz was involved in a heated clash with [[Eugène Terre'Blanche]], Leader of the far-right paramilitary [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]], after Schwarz confronted him during a speech over the organisation's racial policy towards non-Afrikaans and non-Christian citizens of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1987/026/00246.tif|format=TIF|title=Odd Couple |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the confrontation Schwarz received a huge standing ovation from both English and Afrikaans members of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1862186|title=MP Addresses AWB Leader Over Views About Jews|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1862186|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to apartheid, Schwarz argued that Judaism was fundamentally opposed to segregation, and that "If we rationalise or condone discrimination against one group, we have compromised our principles and we are then not true to our beliefs or our history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1552889|title=Harry Schwarz addresses Passover meeting|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914005308/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1552889|archivedate=14 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that violent change could ultimately lead to a nondemocratic government, incompatible with Jewish ethics and with the interests of the Jewish community. He emphasized that Jews needed not only a democratic society for all, but also "The right to follow [their] own religion and love for [[Israel]] freely." He was assured in private meetings by [[Israel]]i Prime Minister's [[Shimon Peres]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]] that Jews in South Africa would not become isolated and links with Israel would be maintained. He played an increasingly important role on the Jewish Board of Deputies from the 1970s, serving as chairman of its committee on international relations and often acting as spokesman for the board to Jewish agencies abroad. In 2005, he was made an honorary vice-president of the board, and remained active until his death.

Schwarz's lifelong friendship with Nelson Mandela also helped to ensure Jews in South Africa did not feel isolated with the unbanning of the [[African National Congress]], and the subsequent election of Mandela as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=898206|title=Jews Want Meeting With Mandela on Israel|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=898206|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=899130|title=Give Mandela Benefit of the Doubt|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=899130|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==
While serving as a senior politician as well as practicing law, Harry Schwarz was also a prominent and respected business figure in South Africa. He held directorships of multiple companies, notably serving as Chief Executive of Merchant Bank between 1969 and 1974.

==Later life==
Harry Schwarz retired from politics upon returning from Washington, and returned to law to practice in Schwarz-North in [[Johannesburg]] and continued to work until he died. His areas of legal practice were primarily corporate and commercial with special interests in banking, insurance, diplomacy and advocacy. He was highly critical of the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]]'s decision to merge with the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] in 2000 and in 2008 stated that the DP "should have sought an alliance with black political groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SAPA |url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=93012 |title=Harry Schwartz dies at 85 &amp;#124; Archive &amp;#124; BDlive |publisher=Businessday.co.za |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained active in the Jewish community, notably serving as president of the South Africa-Israel Chamber of Commerce between 1999 and 2010 and vice-president of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies. Schwarz delivered his final public speech at the South African Parliament in November 2009 at a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the formation of the Progressive Party, in which he stated that "freedom is incomplete if it is exercised in poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=152985&amp;sn=Detail |title=Reflections on SA`s liberals in politics - FEATURES |publisher=Politicsweb |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to South Africa, Schwarz and his wife set up a charity trust called the Schwarz Upliftment Trust. He lived in [[Johannesburg]] with his wife Annette, who is an accomplished artist and ran all of his election campaigns. They were married for 57 years with three children and four grandchildren.

===Death and tributes===
On the morning of 5 February 2010, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies announced that Schwarz had died, following a short illness, at the age of 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichmarksentinel.com/rs_headlines.asp?recid=3849|title=Dieta para perder barriga|publisher=Therichmarksentinel.com|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113041321/http://www.therichmarksentinel.com/rs_headlines.asp?recid=3849|archivedate=13 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried on Sunday 7 February in the section of honor in the West Park Cemetery in Johannesburg; the funeral was attended by hundreds of guests and family members.

[[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] leader and Leader of the Opposition [[Helen Zille]] led tributes to Schwarz. She said

&lt;blockquote&gt;Harry Schwarz will be remembered for his signal contribution to the development of our democracy. His piercing intellect, and long professional experience in banking, made him the most astute analyst in Parliament on economic and financial matters during his terms in office. He had strong leadership qualities and could inspire people to great achievements. He was an outstanding debater, both inside and outside Parliament. He could stand his ground against all-comers. His principled and steadfast resistance to racial nationalism was rooted in the key role he played in fighting Nazism during World War 2. He continued his resistance to racial nationalism through his long and distinguished career in South African opposition politics. He has engraved his place in South Africa's political history. We will always remember him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/da-statement-by-helen-zille-democratic-alliance-leader-expressing-condolences-on-the-passing-of-harry-schwarz-05022010-2010-02-05 |title=DA: Statement by Helen Zille, Democratic Alliance leader, expressing condolences on the passing of Harry Schwarz (05/02/2010) |publisher=Polity.org.za |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

South African [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Jacob Zuma]] paid tribute to Schwarz in the introduction of his State of the Nation address to [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] on 11 February 2010, the 20th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's release from prison and the 35th anniversary of the founding of Schwarz's Reform Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.iafrica.com/features/2222360.htm |title=iafrica.com State of the Nation text |publisher=News.iafrica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement the Jewish Board of Deputies said of Schwarz: "One of the last of a generation of German Jewish refugees from Nazism who came to South Africa in the 1930s, he rendered sterling service to his adopted country, whether in the political, diplomatic, human rights, legal or Jewish communal fields." It stated that he was "amongst the most forthright and effective campaigners against apartheid" and said how he "remained actively involved in Jewish communal work to the very end." Zev Krengel, chairman of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, said that "He was a man of formidable intellect and absolute integrity and was throughout his life a brave, unyielding fighter for justice." Rabbi Mendel Rabinowitz, who conducted the funeral said "Those like Harry, who contribute to society in so many capacities for so many years never die. Their bodies are laid to rest but the memory of them continues to live on."

Others such as former Leader of the Opposition [[Frederik van Zyl Slabbert]], former Foreign Minister [[Pik Botha]] and the [[African Christian Democratic Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acdp.mobi/wnewsdisp.php?id=4294 |title=Latest News |publisher=Acdp.mobi |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid tribute to Schwarz for his record as an anti-apartheid campaigner and for his contribution to democracy and human rights in South Africa.

==Quotes==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Freedom is incomplete if it is exercised in poverty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To risk making predictions is rather presumptuous and unwise. If I'm wrong, it will never be forgotten. If I'm right, no one will remember.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Finweek/To-my-mind/Predictions-work-sometimes-20050920-2 |title=Predictions work – sometimes |publisher=Fin24.com |date=2004-05-05 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Morality is cheap when someone else is paying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1030957|title=Israel Economic Team: No Talk of Sanctions|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913220302/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1030957|archivedate=13 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Laws alone is not enough to ensure that freedom is safeguarded. What is required is a spirit of freedom among the people concerned. There must be an atmosphere of respect, a feeling of belonging together, an atmosphere of harmony with fellow beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2000874|title=Govt. cares about power, not people|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093949/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2000874|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are a country with a people who are removing the shackles of apartheid and will create a just economic system and a true democracy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is important that in the process of change, existing institutions of value and means of production are not destroyed. The fabric of society, however critical one may be of its present structures, should be adopted and modified where required, but not destroyed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Headhunting''' is the practice of taking and [[Human trophy collecting|preserving a person's head]] after killing the person. Headhunting was practised in historic times in parts of [[Oceania]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]], [[Mesoamerica]], and [[Europe]]. It occurred in Europe to the end of the Middle Ages in Ireland and the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] regions, and until the 20th century in [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Albania]], and western parts of [[Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/258121/headhunting |title=headhunting (anthropology) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headhunting practice has been the subject of intense study within the [[anthropology|anthropological community]], where scholars try to assess and interpret its social [[Social role|roles]], [[Social function|functions]], and motivations. Anthropological writings explore themes in headhunting that include [[mortification of the flesh|mortification]] of the rival, [[ritual murder|ritual violence]], [[cosmology|cosmological]] balance, the display of [[manhood]], [[cannibalism]], dominance over the body and soul of his enemies in life and afterlife, as a trophy and proof of killing (achievement in hunting), show of greatness, prestige by taking on a rival's spirit and power, and as a means of securing the services of the victim as a slave in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;E-Modigliani, "Un viaggio a Nias," Fratelli Treves Editori Milano 1890&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's scholars generally agree that headhunting's primary function was ritual and ceremonial. It was part of the process of structuring, reinforcing, and defending [[Social hierarchy|hierarchical relationships]] between communities and individuals.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Some experts theorize that the practice stemmed from the belief that the head contained "[[Soul (spirit)|soul]] matter" or life force, which could be harnessed through its capture.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, J. H. "The Significance of Head-Hunting in Assam." ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', vol. 58, 1928, pp. 399–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[Marind-anim]] in New Guinea were famed because of their headhunting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 9&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was rooted in their belief system and linked to the name-giving of the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 111&lt;/ref&gt; The skull was believed to contain a [[mana]]-like force.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: blurb&lt;/ref&gt; Headhunting was not motivated primarily by cannibalism, but the dead person's flesh was consumed in ceremonies following the capture and killing.&lt;ref name=cannibalism&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Korowai people|Korowai]], a [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] tribe in the southeast of [[Irian Jaya]], live in [[tree houses]], some nearly 40 metres high. This is believed to be a defensive practice, presumably as protection against the [[Citak]], a tribe of neighbouring headhunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/03/980309043026.htm |title=Head-Hunters Drove Papuan Tribe Into Tree-Houses |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=1998-03-09 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe that the American [[Michael Rockefeller]], who disappeared in New Guinea in 1961 while on a field trip, may have been taken by headhunters in the [[Asmat Regency|Asmat]] region.

In ''[[The Cruise of the Snark]]'' (1911), the account by [[Jack London]] of his 1905 adventure sailing in Micronesia, he recounted that headhunters of [[Malaita]] attacked his ship during a stay in [[Langa Langa Lagoon]], particularly around [[Laulasi Island]]. His and other ships were kidnapping villagers as workers on plantations, a practice known as [[blackbirding]].

=== Southeast Asia ===

In Southeast Asia, anthropological writings have explored headhunting and other practises of the [[Murut people|Murut]], [[Ilongot people|Ilongot]], [[Igorot]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], Berawan, Wana, and Mappurondo tribes. Among these groups, headhunting was usually a ritual activity rather than an act of war or feuding. A warrior would take a single head. Headhunting acted as a catalyst for the cessation of personal and collective [[mourning]] for the community's dead. Ideas of manhood and marriage were encompassed in the practice, and the taken heads were highly prized. Other reasons for headhunting included capture of enemies as slaves, looting of valuable properties, intra and inter-ethnic conflicts, and territorial expansion.

Italian anthropologist and explorer [[Elio Modigliani]] visited the headhunting communities in South [[Nias]] (an island to the west of Sumatra) in 1886; he wrote a detailed study of their society and beliefs. He found that the main purpose of headhunting was the belief that, if a man owned another person's skull, his victim would serve as a slave of the owner for eternity in the afterlife. Human skulls were a valuable commodity.&lt;ref&gt;E.Modigliani, "Un viaggio a Nias", Fratelli Treves Editori Milano 1890&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic headhunting continued in Nias island until the late 20th century, the last reported incident dating from 1998.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Headhunting was practised among [[Sumba people]] until the early 20th century. It was done only in large war parties. When the men hunted wild animals, by contrast, they operated in silence and secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, Janet. ''The Play of Time: Kodi Perspectives on Calendars, History, and Exchange.'' Berkeley:  University of California Press,  c1993 1993. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0x0n99tc/ p.312-314&lt;/ref&gt; The skulls collected were hung on the skull tree erected in the center of village. As recently as 1998, in [[Waikabubak]], a major clash of clans resulted in some people being decapitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-58-apr-jun-1999/tragedy-in-sumba-2209694 |title=Tragedy in Sumba |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322175551/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-58-apr-jun-1999/tragedy-in-sumba-2209694 |archivedate=March 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}. insideindonesia.org&lt;/ref&gt; This was reminiscent of the headhunting tradition.

Kenneth George wrote about annual headhunting rituals that he observed among the Mappurondo religious minority, an upland [[tribe]] in the southwest part of the Indonesian island of [[Sulawesi]]. Heads are not taken; instead, surrogate heads in the form of coconuts are used in a ritual ceremony. The ritual, called ''pangngae,'' takes place at the conclusion of the rice-harvesting season. It functions to bring an end to communal [[mourning]] for the deceased of the past year; express intercultural tensions and polemics; allow for a display of manhood; distribute communal resources; and resist outside pressures to abandon Mappurondo ways of life.

United States authorities in the Philippines suppressed headhunting among the [[Ilongot people|Ilongot]] in the 1930s. The [[Igorot people|Igorot]] in the [[Philippines]] also practiced headhunting.

The [[Va people|Wa]] tribe, whose domain straddles the Burma-China border, were once known to Europeans as the "Wild Wa" for their "savage" behavior. Until the 1970s, the Wa practiced headhunting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/covers/1101021216/story.html "Soldiers of Fortune"], TIME Asia&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punan's heads taken by Sea Dayaks Wellcome M0005506.jpg|thumb|[[Punan Bah|Punan]]'s heads taken by [[Iban people|Sea Dayaks]]]]
In [[Sarawak]], the north-western region of the island of [[Borneo]], [[James Brooke]] and his descendants established a colonial dynasty. They eradicated headhunting in the hundred years before World War II. Before Brooke's arrival, the Iban had migrated from the middle Kapuas region into the upper Batang Lupar river region by fighting and displacing the small existing tribes, such as the Seru and Bukitan. Another successful migration by the Iban was from the Saribas region into the Kanowit area in the middle of the Batang Rajang river, led by the famous Mujah, Buah Raya. They fought and displaced such tribes as the Kanowit and Baketan.

Brooke first encountered the headhunting Iban of the Saribas-Skrang in Sarawak at the Battle of Betting Maru in 1849. He gained the signing of the Saribas Treaty with the Iban chief of that region, who was named Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana "Bayang". Subsequently, the Brooke dynasty expanded their territory from the first small Sarawak region to the present-day state of Sarawak. They enlisted the Malay, Iban, and other natives as a large but unpaid force to crush and pacify any rebellions in the states. The Brooke government prohibited headhunting  (''ngayau'' in Iban language) and added penalties for disobeying the Rajah-led government decree. During expeditions sanctioned by the Brooke government, they allowed headhunting. The natives who participated in Brooke-approved punitive expeditions were exempted from paying annual tax to the Brooke government and/or given new territories in return for their service. There were intra-tribal and intertribal headhunting.

The most famous Iban warrior to resist the colonial Brooke government was Libau "Rentap". The Brooke government had to send three punitive expeditions in order to defeat Rentapi at his fortress on the top of Sadok Hill.

The Iban conducted a third major migration, from upper Batang Ai region in the Batang Lupar region into Katibas and onward to Baleh/Mujong region in the upper Batang Rajang region. They displaced the existing tribes of the Kayan, Kajang, Ukit, etc. The Brooke government sanctioned the last migrations of the Iban, and reduced fighting to a minimum. The Iban conducted sacred ritual ceremonies with special and complex incantations to invoke god's blessings, which were associated with headhunting. An example was the Bird Festival in the Saribas/Skrang region and Proper Festival in the Baleh region, both required for men of the tribes to become effective warriors.

During the Japanese occupation during the Second World War, headhunting was revived among the natives. The Sukarno-led Indonesian forces fought against the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Forces of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak fought in addition, and headhunting was observed during the communist insurgency in Sarawak and what was then Malaya. The Iban were noted for headhunting, and were later recognised as good rangers and trackers during military operations, during which they were awarded fourteen medals of valour and honour.

Since 1997 serious inter-ethnic violence has erupted on the island of Kalimantan, involving the indigenous [[Dayak people]]s and immigrants from the island of [[Madura]]. Events have included the [[Sambas riots]] and [[Sampit conflict]]. In 2001 during the [[Sampit conflict]] in the Central [[Kalimantan]] town of [[Sampit]], at least 500 [[Madurese people|Madurese]] were killed and up to 100,000 Madurese were forced to flee. Some Madurese bodies were decapitated in a ritual reminiscent of the Dayak headhunting tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/natres/timber/2001/0301brno.htm |title=Behind Ethnic War, Indonesia's Old Migration Policy |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2001-03-01 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ambonese]], a tribe of mixed Malay-Papuan origin living in the [[Moluccas]], were fierce headhunters until the Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia suppressed the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunusaku.com/pdfs/politicians_magicans.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In what is now known as New Zealand, the [[Māori people|Māori]] preserved the heads of enemies in a form known as ''[[mokomokai]].'' They removed the brain and eyes, and smoked the head. The heads were sold to European collectors in the late 1800s, in some instances having been commissioned and 'made to order.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/weather-delays-return-toi-moko-4703230 "Weather delays return of toi-moko"], TNVZ (national news)&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently the Māori are attempting to reclaim the heads of their own ancestors held in museums outside New Zealand. Twenty heads were returned to them by French authorities in January 2012, repatriated from museums.

===China===
During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]]&lt;!-- give dates --&gt;, [[Qin (state)|Qin]] soldiers frequently collected their enemies' heads. Most of the soldiers were conscripted [[serfs]] and were not paid. Instead, the soldiers earned promotions and rewards from superiors by collecting the heads of enemies, a type of [[body count]]. In this area, authorities displayed heads of executed criminals in public spaces up to the 20th century.

When a battle ended, the warrior, true to his mercenary origins, would ceremoniously present trophy heads to a general, who would variously reward him with promotions in rank, gold or silver, or land from the defeated clan. Generals displayed the heads of defeated rivals in public squares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/asia/japan/samurai-text/1 Tom O'Neill, "Samurai: Japan's Way of the Warrior"], ''National Geographic Magazine.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Headhunting was a common practice among [[Taiwanese aborigines]]. All tribes practised headhunting except the [[Yami people]], who were previously isolated on [[Orchid Island]], and the [[Ivatan people]]. It was associated with the peoples of the Philippines.

[[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines]], [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese people (Han)]] and [[Yamato people|Japanese]] settlers were choice victims of headhunting raids by Taiwanese Mountain Aborigines. The latter two groups were considered invaders, liars, and enemies. A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields or set a dwelling on fire, and then kill and behead those who fled from the burning structure. The practice continued during the [[Japanese occupation of Taiwan]], but ended in the 1930s due to suppression by the colonial Japanese government.

[[File:Taiwan aborigines headhunting 06.jpg|thumb|The headhunting ritual of aborigines in Taiwan]]
The [[Taiwanese Aboriginal]] tribes, who were allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the [[Guo Huaiyi Rebellion]] in 1652, turned against the Dutch in turn during the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]].

At the [[Battle of Tamsui]] in the [[Keelung Campaign]] during the [[Sino-French War]] on 8 October 1884, the Chinese took prisoners and beheaded 11 French marines who were injured, in addition to ''La Gailissonniere's'' captain Fontaine. The heads were mounted on bamboo poles and displayed to incite anti-French feelings. In China pictures of the beheading of the Frenchmen were published in the ''Tien-shih-tsai Pictorial Journal'' in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlnKRaZ0f4QC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=French+severed+heads+bamboo+poles+Tamsui&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QjJJVJ_LJ5Gj8gGI4ICgAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=French%20severed%20heads%20bamboo%20poles%20Tamsui&amp;f=false|title=Maritime Taiwan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A most unmistakable scene in the market place occurred. Some six heads of Frenchmen, heads of the true French type were exhibited, much to the disgust of foreigners. A few visited the place where they were stuck up, and were glad to leave it—not only on account of the disgusting and barbarous character of the scene, but because the surrounding crowd showed signs of turbulence. At the camp also were eight other Frenchmen's heads, a sight which might have satisfied a savage or a Hill-man, but hardly consistent with the comparatively enlightened tastes, one would think, of Chinese soldiers even of to-day. It is not known how many of the French were killed and wounded; fourteen left their bodies on shore, and no doubt several wounded were taken back to the ships. (Chinese accounts state that twenty were killed and large numbers wounded.)

In the evening Captain Boteler and Consul Frater called on General Sun, remonstrating with him on the subject of cutting heads off, and allowing them to be exhibited. Consul Frater wrote him a despatch on the subject strongly deprecating such practices, and we understand that the general promised it should not occur again, and orders were at once given to bury the heads. It is difficult for a general even situated as Sun is—having to command troops like the Hillmen, who are the veriest savages in the treatment of their enemies—to prevent such barbarities.

It is said the Chinese buried the dead bodies of the Frenchmen after the engagement on 8th instant by order of General Sun.

Several tribes of the [[Jivaroan]] group, including the [[Shuar people|Shuar]] in Eastern Ecuador and Northern Peru, along the rivers [[Chinchipe river|Chinchipe]], [[Bobonaza River|Bobonaza]], [[Morona]], [[Upano River|Upano]], and [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], main tributaries of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], practised headhunting for trophies. The heads were [[shrunken head|shrunk]], and were known locally as ''Tzan-Tzas''. The people believed that the head housed the soul of the person killed.

In the 21st century, the Shuar produce Tzan-tza replicas. They use their traditional process on heads of [[Silvery woolly monkey|monkeys]] and [[sloths]], selling the items to tourists. It is believed that splinter groups in the local tribes continue with these practises when there is a tribal feud over territory or as revenge for a crime of passion. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A ''[[tzompantli]]'' is a type of wooden rack or palisade documented in several [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations. It was used for the public display of [[human skull]]s, typically those of war captives or other [[human sacrifice|sacrificial victims]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-archaeology-skulls-idUSKBN19M3Q6 Tower of human skulls in Mexico casts new light on Aztecs]". Reuters. July 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A tzompantli-type structure has been excavated at the [[La Coyotera]], [[Oaxaca]], site. It is dated to the Proto-Classic [[Zapotec civilization]], which flourished from c. 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1982), pp. 236–239&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tzompantli'' are also noted in other Mesoamerican [[pre-Columbian]] cultures, such as the [[Toltec]] and [[Mixtec]].

Based on numbers given by the [[conquistador]] [[Andrés de Tapia]] and Fray [[Diego Durán]], Bernard Ortiz de Montellano&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz de Montellano 1983&lt;/ref&gt; has calculated in the late 20th century that there were at most 60,000 skulls on the ''Hueyi Tzompantli'' (great Skullrack) of [[Tenochtitlan]]. There were at least five more skullracks in Tenochtitlan, but, by all accounts, they were much smaller.

Other examples are indicated from [[Maya civilization]] sites. A particularly fine and intact inscription example survives at the extensive [[Chichen Itza]] site.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Celts===
{{see also|Celtic decapitation}}
The [[Celts]] of Europe practised headhunting as the head was believed to house a person's soul. Ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] recorded the Celts' habits of nailing heads of personal enemies to walls or dangling them from the necks of horses.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[Diodorus Siculus]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=agd-eLVNRMMC&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA315,M1 5.2]&lt;/ref&gt;  Headhunting was still practised for a great deal longer by the Celtic [[Gaels]]. In the ''[[Ulster Cycle]],'' [[Cúchulainn]] is described as beheading the three sons of Nechtan and mounting their heads on his chariot. This is believed to have been a traditional warrior, rather than religious, practice. The practice continued approximately to the end of the [[Middle Ages]] in Ireland and the Anglo-Scottish marches.&lt;ref name=Headhunt&gt;[http://www.lard.net/headhunters.html "Headhunters", ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; The religious reasons for collecting heads were likely lost after the Celts' conversion to Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018|reason=Saying the Celts stopped headhunting once they converted to Christianity is a bold claim.  Especially when the previous sentence says that headhunting was for cultural, not religious, reasons.}} Heads were also taken among the [[Germanic tribes]] and among [[Iberians]], but the purpose is unknown.

===Scythians===
The [[Scythians]] were excellent horsemen. Ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that some of their tribes practised human sacrifice, drinking the blood of victims, [[scalping]] their enemies, and drinking wine from the enemies' skulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/logos4_10.html |title=Summary of and commentary on Herodotus' Histories, book 4 |publisher=Livius.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montenegrins===
The [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] are an ethnic group in Southeastern Europe who are centered around the [[Dinaric Mountains|Dinaric mountains]]. They practiced headhunting until 1876, allegedly carrying the head from a lock of hair grown specifically for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KCZhBWVkgMC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=montenegrin+headhunting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OmY8wE7VYx&amp;sig=qG1x69JYkHZLpPkbp8iVc94q3Hk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y_ThUsGxJsnyoASVsoDQBw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=montenegrin%20headhunting&amp;f=false|title=Albania and the Albanians|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1830s, Montenegrin ruler [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš]] started building a tower called ''"Tablja"'' above [[Cetinje Monastery]]. The tower was never finished, and Montenegrins used it to display Turkish heads taken in battle, as they were in frequent conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In 1876 King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] ordered that the practise should end. He knew that European diplomats considered it to be barbaric. The ''Tablja'' was demolished in 1937.

During World War II, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] (specifically including American) troops occasionally collected the skulls of dead Japanese as personal trophies, as souvenirs for friends and family at home, and for sale to others. (The practice was unique to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theater]]; United States forces did not take skulls of German and Italian soldiers.)  In September 1942, the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet mandated strong disciplinary action against any soldier who took enemy body parts as souvenirs. But such trophy-hunting persisted: ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' published a photograph in its issue of May 22, 1944, of a young woman posing with the autographed skull sent to her by her Navy boyfriend.

Historians{{who|date=February 2018}} have suggested that the practice related to Americans viewing the Japanese as [[American mutilation of Japanese war dead#Dehumanization|lesser people]] and in response to mutilation and torture of American dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wei92|Weingartner 1992]]: 67&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Borneo]], retaliation by natives against the Japanese was based on atrocities having been committed by the Japanese Army in that area. Following their ill treatment by the Japanese, the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] of Borneo formed a force to help the Allies. Australian and British special operatives of [[Z Special Unit]] developed some of the inland Dayak tribesmen into a thousand-man headhunting army. This army of tribesmen killed or captured some 1,500 Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/09/opinion/edheiman.php "'Guests' can succeed where occupiers fail"], ''International Herald Tribune,'' 9 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7100">'''Health Web Science''' ('''HWS''') is a sub-discipline of [[Web science|Web Science]] that examines the interplay between health sciences, health and well-being, and the Web. It assumes that each domain influences the others. HWS thus complements and overlaps with [[Health 2.0|Medicine 2.0]] (medicine enabled by emerging technologies).&lt;ref&gt;McHattie LS, Cumming G, French T. Transforming Patient Experience: Health Web Science Meets Medicine 2.0 Med 2.0 2014;3(1):e2 URL:http://www.medicine20.com/2014/1/e2 DOI: 10.2196/med20.3128.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has uncovered [[emergent properties]] that arise as individuals interact with each other, with healthcare providers and with the Web itself.

==History==
HWS began at the Web Science Curriculum meeting in the summer of 2010 at the University of Southampton where approximately forty scholars came together to discuss the subject. That was followed by a foundational Workshop in Koblenz 2011 under the aegis of [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Elizabeth H.|last2=Cumming|first2=Grant P.|last3=Luciano|first3=Joanne S.|date=2011-01-01|title=Health Web Science: Application of Web Science to the Area of Health Education and Health Care|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2064741.2064746|journal=Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Web Science and Information Exchange in the Medical Web|series=MedEx '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=11–14|doi=10.1145/2064741.2064746|isbn=9781450309509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/|title=ACM|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogue to more precisely define HWS as a sub-discipline of Web Science began among Web-oriented investigators at the 2012 Medicine 2.0 Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicine20congress.com/ocs/index.php/med/med2012|title=Medicine 2.0'12 (Boston, USA)|website=www.medicine20congress.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Joanne S.|last2=Cumming|first2=Grant P.|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Mark D.|last4=Kahana|first4=Eva|date=2013-01-01|title=The emergent discipline of health web science|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=15|issue=8|pages=e166|doi=10.2196/jmir.2499|issn=1438-8871|pmc=3758025|pmid=23968998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formalized in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Joanne S.|last2=Cumming|first2=Grant P.|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Mark D.|last4=Kahana|first4=Eva|date=2013-01-01|title=The emergent discipline of health web science|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=15|issue=8|pages=e166|doi=10.2196/jmir.2499|issn=1438-8871|pmc=3758025|pmid=23968998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nascent discipline of Health Web Science is further described and developed in the monograph "Health Web Science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Joanne S.|title=Health Web Science|url=http://www.nowpublishers.com/articles/foundations-and-trends-in-web-science/WEB-019|journal=Foundations and Trends® in Web Science|volume=4|issue=4|pages=269–419|doi=10.1561/1800000019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A call to action at the ACM Web Science workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.websci13.org/workshops/wk9-life-web-science-workshop/|title=WK9 - Life Web Science Workshop - ACM Web Science 2013|website=www.websci13.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked the community to consider how to accelerate the discipline. In particular, beyond the available knowledge-gathering technologies (e.g. [[blogs]], social-medicine portals, experience mining, [[graph theory]], [[Network theory|network analysis]], and [[game theory]]), what additional is required to deal with the Health Web's emergent properties? For example, what is needed to curate, interrogate, and visualize the combination of both '[[Big Data]]' – arising from the increasingly pervasive sources and sensors including "the [[Internet of Things|Internet of things]], the [[Quantified Self|quantified self]], [[smart cities]], and smart homes – and smaller-scale data arising from individual patient conversations, self-reporting, and self-exploration? How are small-scale innovations safely and efficiently scaled up to the size of the Web and scaled out to millions of patients?&lt;ref&gt;Gillam et al.

One research group argued for technologies that enable predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory (P4) medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hood|first=Leroy|last2=Friend|first2=Stephen H.|title=Predictive, personalized, preventive, participatory (P4) cancer medicine|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.227|journal=Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology|volume=8|issue=3|pages=184–187|doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stated needs include an "Expert Patient" capable of making sense of online medical information in a personal context, tools to cope with information overload through e.g., [[text mining]] and semantic technologies, in particular through algorithm-aided decision making.

The Web Science Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webscience.org/|title=Web Science Trust|website=Web Science Trust|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of a Web observatory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webscience.org/web-observatory/|title=Web Observatory|website=Web Science Trust|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an integrated collection of data sources and analysis tools that enables observation and experimentation for Web study,&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Wendy and Tiropanis, Thanassis (2012) Web Evolution and Web Science.

HWS combines the axiom of 'first do no harm' ([[Hippocrates]]) with 'do no evil' ([[Google]]), paying specific attention to technology and safeguards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5439">'''Heroic virtue''' is a phrase coined by [[Augustine of Hippo]] to describe the [[virtue ethics|virtue]] of early [[Christian]] martyrs and used by the [[Catholic Church]].  The Greek pagan term [[hero]] described a person with possibly superhuman abilities and great goodness, and "it connotes a degree of bravery, fame, and distinction which places a man high above his fellows".&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia of 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was later applied to other highly virtuous persons who do extraordinary good works.

Heroic virtue is one of the requirements for [[beatification]] in the Catholic Church.  The modern process for declaring heroic virtue is internal to the church and conducted by those in senior positions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Quoting the Catholic view  from the article on Heroic Virtue by J. Wilhelm in the 1917 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Together with the four [[cardinal virtues]] the Christian saint must be endowed with the [[three theological virtues]], especially with Divine [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], the virtue which informs all other virtues.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As charity stands at the summit of all virtues, so [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] stands at their foundation. For by faith God is first apprehended, and the soul lifted up to supernatural life. Faith is the secret of one's conscience; to the world it is made manifest by the good works in which it lives, "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:2). Such works are: the external profession of faith, strict observance of the Divine commands, [[prayer]], filial devotion to the Church, the [[fear of God (religion)|fear of God]], the horror of sin, [[penance]] for sins committed, patience in adversity, etc. All or any of these attain the grade of heroicity when practiced with unflagging perseverance, during a long period of time, or under circumstances so trying that by them men of but ordinary perfection would be deterred from acting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Hope (virtue)|Hope]] is a firm trust that God will give us eternal life and all the means necessary to obtain it; it attains heroicity when it amounts to unshakeable confidence and security in God's help throughout all the untoward events of life, when it is ready to forsake and sacrifice all other goods in order to obtain the promised felicity of heaven.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Charity inclines man to love God above all things with the love of friendship. The perfect friend of God says with St. Paul: "With Christ I am nailed to the cross. And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me" (Galatians 2:19-20). For love means union. Its type in heaven is the Divine Trinity in Unity; its highest degree in God's creatures is the [[beatific vision]], i.e. participation in God's life. On earth it is the fruitful mother of holiness, the one thing necessary, the one all-sufficient possession. It is extolled in I Cor., xiii, and in St. John's Gospel and Epistles; the beloved disciple and the fiery missionary of the cross are the best interpreters of the mystery of love revealed to them in the [[Sacred Heart|Heart of Jesus]]. With the commandment to love God above all Jesus coupled another: "And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these" (Mark 12:31). The likeness, or the linking of the two commandments, lies in this: that in our neighbor we love God's image and likeness, His adopted children and the heirs of His Kingdom. Hence, serving our neighbor is serving God. And the works of spiritual and temporal mercy performed in this world will decide our fate in the next: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom. . .For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. . .Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me" ({{bibleref|Matthew|25:34–40}}).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Prudence]], which enables us to know what to desire or to avoid, attains heroicity when it coincides with the "gift of counsel", i.e. a clear, Divinely aided insight into right and wrong conduct.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Justice]], which gives every one his due, is the pivot on which turn the virtues of religion, piety, obedience, gratitude, truthfulness, friendship, and many more. Jesus sacrificing His life to give God His due, [[Abraham]] willing to sacrifice his son in obedience to God's will, these are acts of heroic justice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Courage|Fortitude]], which urges us on when difficulty stands in the way of our duty, is itself the heroic element in the practice of virtue; it reaches its apex when it overcomes obstacles which to ordinary virtue are insurmountable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]], which restrains us when passions urge us to what is wrong, comprises becoming deportment, modesty, abstinence, chastity, sobriety, and others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''In fine'' it should be remarked that almost every act of virtue proceeding from the Divine principle within us has in it the elements of all the virtues; only mental analysis views the same act under various aspects.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">'''Hypostatic abstraction''' in [[mathematical logic]], also known as '''hypostasis''' or '''subjectal abstraction''', is a [[formal calculation|formal operation]] that transforms a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] into a [[Relation (philosophy)|relation]]; for example "Honey ''is'' sweet" is transformed into "Honey ''has'' sweetness". The relation is created between the original subject and a new term that represents the [[Property (philosophy)|property]] expressed by the original predicate.

Hypostasis changes a [[propositional formula]] of the form ''X is Y'' to another one of the form ''X has the property of being Y'' or ''X has Y-ness''. The logical functioning of the second object ''Y-ness'' consists solely in the truth-values of those propositions that have the corresponding abstract property ''Y'' as the predicate.  The object of thought introduced in this way may be called a ''hypostatic object'' and in some senses an ''[[abstract object]]'' and a ''formal object''.

The above definition is adapted from the one given by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (CP 4.235, "The Simplest Mathematics" (1902), in ''Collected Papers'', CP 4.227–323). As Peirce describes it, the main point about the formal operation of hypostatic abstraction, insofar as it operates on formal linguistic expressions, is that it converts an adjective or predicate into an extra subject, thus increasing by one the number of "subject" slots—called the ''[[arity]]'' or ''adicity''—of the main predicate.

The transformation of "honey is sweet" into "honey possesses sweetness" can be viewed in several ways:

[[Image:Hypostasis-diagram.png|400px]]

The grammatical trace of this hypostatic transformation is a process that extracts the adjective "sweet" from the predicate "is sweet", replacing it by a new, increased-arity predicate "possesses", and as a by-product of the reaction, as it were, precipitating out the substantive "sweetness" as a second subject of the new predicate.

The abstraction of hypostasis takes the concrete physical sense of "taste" found in "honey is sweet" and gives it formal [[metaphysical]] characteristics in "honey has sweetness".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14718">'''Internal set theory''' ('''IST''') is a mathematical theory of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] developed by [[Edward Nelson]] that provides an axiomatic basis for a portion of the [[non-standard analysis]] introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]]. Instead of adding new elements to the [[real number]]s, Nelson's approach modifies the axiomatic foundations through syntactic enrichment.  Thus, the axioms introduce a new term, "standard", which can be used to make discriminations not possible under the conventional  [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms|axioms for sets]].  Thus, IST is an enrichment of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]: all axioms of ZFC are satisfied for all classical predicates, while the new unary predicate "standard" satisfies three additional axioms I, S, and T.  In particular, suitable non-standard elements within the set of real numbers can be shown to have properties that correspond to the properties of [[infinitesimal]] and unlimited elements.

Nelson's formulation is made more accessible for the lay-mathematician by leaving out many of the complexities of meta-mathematical [[logic]] that were initially required to justify rigorously the consistency of number systems containing infinitesimal elements.

==Intuitive justification==
Whilst IST has a perfectly formal axiomatic scheme, described below, an intuitive justification of the meaning of the term ''standard'' is desirable. This is '''not''' part of the formal theory, but is a pedagogical device that might help the student interpret the formalism. The essential distinction, similar to the concept of [[definable number]]s, contrasts the finiteness of the domain of concepts that we can specify and discuss with the unbounded infinity of the set of numbers; compare [[finitism]].
* The number of symbols one writes with is finite.
* The number of mathematical symbols on any given page is finite.
* The number of pages of mathematics a single mathematician can produce in a lifetime is finite.
* Any workable mathematical definition is necessarily finite.
* There are only a finite number of distinct objects a mathematician can define in a lifetime.
* There will only be a finite number of mathematicians in the course of our (presumably finite) civilization.
* Hence there is only a finite set of whole numbers our civilization can discuss in its allotted lifespan.
* What that limit actually is, is unknowable to us, being contingent on many accidental cultural factors.
* This limitation is not in itself susceptible to mathematical scrutiny, but that there is such a limit, whilst the set of whole numbers continues forever without bound, is a mathematical truth.

The term ''standard'' is therefore intuitively taken to correspond to some necessarily finite portion of "accessible" whole numbers. The argument can be applied to any infinite set of objects whatsoever – there are only so many elements that one can specify in finite time using a finite set of symbols and there are always those that lie beyond the limits of our patience and endurance, no matter how we persevere. We must admit to a profusion of ''non-standard'' elements — too large or too anonymous to grasp — within any infinite set.

===Principles of the ''standard'' predicate===

The following principles follow from the above intuitive motivation and so should be deducible from the formal axioms. For the moment we take the domain of discussion as being the familiar set of whole numbers.
* Any mathematical expression that does not use the new predicate ''standard'' explicitly or implicitly is an ''internal formula''.
* Any definition that does so is an ''external formula''.
* Any number ''uniquely'' specified by an internal formula is standard (by definition).
* Non-standard numbers are precisely those that cannot be uniquely specified (due to limitations of time and space) by an internal formula.
* Non-standard numbers are elusive: each one is too enormous to be manageable in decimal notation or any other representation, explicit or implicit, no matter how ingenious your notation. Whatever you succeed in producing is &lt;u&gt;by-definition&lt;/u&gt; merely another standard number.
* Nevertheless, there are (many) non-standard whole numbers in any infinite subset of '''N'''.
* Non-standard numbers are completely ordinary numbers, having decimal representations, prime factorizations, etc. Every classical theorem that applies to the natural numbers applies to the non-standard natural numbers. We have created, not new numbers, but a new method of discriminating between existing numbers.
* Moreover, any classical theorem that is true for all standard numbers is necessarily true for all natural numbers. Otherwise the formulation "the smallest number that fails to satisfy the theorem" would be an internal formula that uniquely defined a non-standard number.
* The predicate "non-standard" is a [[logically consistent]] method for distinguishing ''large'' numbers — the usual term will be ''illimited''. Reciprocals of these illimited numbers will necessarily be extremely small real numbers — ''infinitesimals''. To avoid confusion with other interpretations of these words, in newer articles on IST those words are replaced with the constructs "i-large" and "i-small".
* There are necessarily only finitely many standard numbers - but caution is required: we cannot gather them together and hold that the result is a well-defined mathematical set. This will not be supported by the formalism (the intuitive justification being that the precise bounds of this set vary with time and history). In particular we will not be able to talk about the largest standard number, or the smallest non-standard number. It will be valid to talk about some finite set that contains all standard numbers - but this non-classical formulation could only apply to a non-standard set.

==Formal axioms for IST==
IST is an axiomatic theory in the [[first-order logic]] with equality in a [[signature (logic)|language]] containing a binary predicate symbol ∈ and a unary predicate symbol st(''x''). Formulas not involving st (i.e., formulas of the usual language of set theory) are called internal, other formulas are called external. We use the abbreviations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\exists^\mathrm{st}x\,\phi(x)&amp;=\exists x\,(\operatorname{st}(x)\land\phi(x)),\\
\forall^\mathrm{st}x\,\phi(x)&amp;=\forall x\,(\operatorname{st}(x)\to\phi(x)).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
IST includes all axioms of the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of choice]] (ZFC). Note that the ZFC schemata of [[Axiom of separation|separation]] and [[Axiom of replacement|replacement]] are ''not'' extended to the new language, they can only be used with internal formulas. Moreover, IST includes three new axiom schemata – conveniently one for each letter in its name: '''I'''dealisation, '''S'''tandardisation, and '''T'''ransfer.

===''I'': Idealisation===
*For any internal formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; without free occurrence of ''z'', the universal closure of the following formula is an axiom:
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall^\mathrm{st}z\,(z\text{ is finite}\to\exists y\,\forall x\in z\,\phi(x,y,u_1,\dots,u_n))\leftrightarrow\exists y\,\forall^\mathrm{st}x\,\phi(x,y,u_1,\dots,u_n).&lt;/math&gt;
*In words: For every internal relation ''R'', and for arbitrary values for all other free variables, we have that if for each standard, finite set ''F'', there exists a ''g'' such that ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f'') holds for all ''f'' in ''F'', then there is a particular ''G'' such that for ''any standard'' ''f'' we have ''R''(''G'',&amp;nbsp;''f''), and conversely, if there exists ''G'' such that for any standard ''f'', we have ''R''(''G'',&amp;nbsp;''f''), then for each finite set ''F'', there exists a ''g'' such that ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f'') holds for all ''f'' in ''F''.

The statement of this axiom comprises two implications. The right-to-left implication can be reformulated by the simple statement that elements of standard finite sets are standard. The more important left-to-right implication expresses that the collection of all standard sets is contained in a finite (non-standard) set, and moreover, this finite set can be taken to satisfy any given internal property shared by all standard finite sets.

This very general axiom scheme upholds the existence of "ideal" elements in appropriate circumstances. Three particular applications demonstrate  important consequences.

====Applied to the relation ≠====
If ''S'' is standard and finite, we take for the relation ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f''): ''g'' and ''f'' are not equal and ''g'' is in ''S''.  Since "''For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that {{nowrap|g ≠ f}} for all f in F''" is false (no such ''g'' exists when {{nowrap|''F'' {{=}} ''S''}}), we may use Idealisation to tell us that "''There is a G in S such that {{nowrap|G ≠ f}} for all standard f''" is also false, i.e. all the elements of ''S'' are standard.

If ''S'' is infinite, then we take for the relation ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f''): ''g'' and ''f'' are not equal and ''g'' is in ''S''. Since "''For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that {{nowrap|g ≠ f}} for all f in F''" (the infinite set ''S'' is not a subset of the finite set ''F''), we may use Idealisation to derive "''There is a G in S such that {{nowrap|G ≠ f}} for all standard f''."  In other words, every infinite set contains a non-standard element (many, in fact).

The power set of a standard finite set is standard (by Transfer) and finite, so all the subsets of a standard finite set are standard.

If ''S'' is non-standard, we take for the relation ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f''): ''g'' and ''f'' are not equal and ''g'' is in ''S''. Since "''For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that {{nowrap|g ≠ f}} for all f in F''" (the non-standard set ''S'' is not a subset of the standard and finite set ''F''), we may use Idealisation to derive "''There is a G in S such that {{nowrap|G ≠ f}} for all standard f.''"  In other words, every non-standard set contains a non-standard element.

As a consequence of all these results, all the elements of a set ''S'' are standard if and only if ''S'' is standard and finite.

====Applied to the relation &amp;lt;====
Since "''For every standard, finite set of natural numbers F there is a natural number g such that {{nowrap|g &gt; f}} for all f in F''" – say, {{nowrap|''g'' {{=}} maximum(''F'') + 1}} – we may use Idealisation to derive "''There is a natural number G such that {{nowrap|G &gt; f}} for all standard natural numbers f''."  In other words, there exists a natural number greater than each standard natural number.

====Applied to the  relation ∈====
More precisely we take for ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f''): ''g'' is a finite set containing element ''f''. Since "''For every standard, finite set F, there is a finite set g such that {{nowrap|f ∈ g}} for all f in F''" – say by choosing {{nowrap|''g'' {{=}} ''F''}} itself – we may use Idealisation to derive "''There is a finite set G such that {{nowrap|f ∈ G}} for all standard f''."&lt;!--  In other words, all standard sets can be contained in a finite set as elements. --&gt; For any set ''S'', the intersection of ''S'' with the set ''G'' is a finite subset of ''S'' that contains every standard element of ''S''. ''G'' is necessarily nonstandard.

===S: Standardisation===
*If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is any formula (it may be external) without a free occurrence of ''y'', the universal closure of
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall^\mathrm{st}x\,\exists^\mathrm{st}y\,\forall^\mathrm{st}t\,(t\in y\leftrightarrow(t\in x\land\phi(t,u_1,\dots,u_n)))&lt;/math&gt;
:is an axiom.
*In words: If ''A'' is a standard set and P any property, internal or otherwise, then there is a unique, standard subset ''B'' of ''A'' whose standard elements are precisely the standard elements of ''A'' satisfying ''P'' (but the behaviour of ''B''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s non-standard elements is not prescribed).

===T: Transfer===
*If &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,u_1,\dots,u_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an internal formula with no other free variables than those indicated, then
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall^\mathrm{st}u_1\dots\forall^\mathrm{st}u_n\,(\forall^\mathrm{st}x\,\phi(x,u_1,\dots,u_n)\to\forall x\,\phi(x,u_1,\dots,u_n))&lt;/math&gt;
:is an axiom.
*In words: If all the parameters  ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ..., ''W'' of an internal formula ''F'' have standard values then {{nowrap|''F''(''x'', ''A'', ''B'',..., ''W'')}} holds for all ''x''{{'}}s as soon as it holds for all standard ''x''{{'}}s&amp;mdash;from which it follows that all uniquely defined concepts or objects within classical mathematics are standard.

==Formal justification for the axioms==
Aside from the intuitive motivations suggested above, it is necessary to justify that additional IST axioms do not lead to errors or inconsistencies in reasoning. Mistakes and philosophical weaknesses in reasoning about infinitesimal numbers in the work of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Johann Bernoulli]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], and others were the reason that they were originally abandoned for the more cumbersome{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[real number]]-based arguments  developed by [[Georg Cantor]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]], which were perceived as being more rigorous by Weierstrass's followers.

The approach for internal set theory is the same as that for any new axiomatic system - we construct a [[model theory|model]] for the new axioms using the elements of a simpler, more trusted, axiom scheme. This is quite similar to justifying the consistency of the axioms of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] by noting they can be modeled by an appropriate interpretation of [[great circle]]s on a sphere in ordinary 3-space.

In fact via a suitable model a proof can be given of the relative consistency of IST as compared with ZFC: if ZFC is consistent, then IST is consistent.  In fact, a stronger statement can be made: IST is a [[conservative extension]] of ZFC: any internal formula that can be proven within internal set theory can be proven in the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms with the Axiom of Choice alone.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Edward (1977).

An '''intimate part''', '''personal part''' or '''private part''' is a place on the human body which is customarily kept covered by [[clothing]] in public venues and conventional settings, as a matter of [[fashion]] and cultural norms. In several cultures, revealing these parts is seen as a religious offence.

Definitions vary, but usually they are primarily the parts involved in [[sexual arousal]], [[reproduction|procreation]], and elimination of [[excreta]] and related matter, including:
*for both genders: the [[buttocks]], [[human anus|anus]], [[perineum]], [[mons pubis]] and [[groin]]
*for males: the [[human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]]
*for females: the [[vulva]] (including [[pudendal cleft]]), [[vagina]] and [[breasts]].

The term ''intimate parts'' may be construed to mean only the external body parts that are visible when [[nudity|naked]], rather than the body parts more commonly referred to. For example, when naked, a woman's pudendal cleft is predominantly visible rather than the [[vagina]], and a man's scrotum is visible rather than the [[testes]] which are contained within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/nine/000957635.htm |title=Health Information—Find Articles, Tools, and Tips at MerckEngage.com|publisher=Mercksource.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female breasts are considered as parts that would be covered in most contexts but with a degree of tolerance for [[toplessness]] varying in different regions and cultures. For example, Fischtein, Herold and Desmarais (2005) found that acceptance of toplessness in a sample of [[Canadians]] varied depending on both personal factors (such as the respondent's gender, age, and religion) and contextual factors (i.e. toplessness in streets, parks, or beaches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_3-4_14/ai_n29238305/?tag=content;col1 |title=Canadian attitudes toward female topless behaviour: a national survey |journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality |first1=Dayna S. |last1=Fischtein |first2=Edward S. |last2=Herold |first3=Serge |last3=Desmarais |year=2005 |accessdate=2011-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119080421/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_3-4_14/ai_n29238305/?tag=content%3Bcol1 |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some periods of [[History of Europe|European history]], female shoulders and legs may have been considered intimate parts.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} More conservative viewpoints in the West in some contexts still find it appropriate that females should cover their shoulders, particularly when entering a [[Church (building)|church]] or other sacred space.

In Islamic traditions, the definition of [[awrah]] is similar to the definition of intimate parts in [[Western culture]]. The extent of cover for the female body depends upon the situation, but may include the hair, shoulders, and neck in addition to the aforementioned "intimate parts". A majority of scholars agree that the entire body except the face and hands should be covered in public or in front of unrelated non-Muslim women and in front of unrelated men. The exceptions are the scholars from [[Hanafi]] school of thought, which has the largest number of followers, which agree that the feet are not part of the awrah and therefore may be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/hijab_1.shtml#section_4 |title=Religions - Islam: Hijab |publisher=BBC |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For males, most scholars regard all parts of body from the navel to the knees as awrah.

The intentional exposure of one's intimate parts is a form of [[exhibitionism]]. Such exposure may be subject to strict [[Sociology|social rules]], [[social control]] and even [[criminal justice]], if it is considered to be a form of [[indecent exposure]]. The unintentional exposure of intimate parts (as in the case of a "[[wardrobe malfunction]]") may be connected with feelings of [[shame]].

Intentionally touching the intimate parts of another person, even through [[clothing]], is often associated with [[human sexual behaviour|sexual]] [[intent (law)|intent]]. If this is done without legally valid consent of the person being touched, it is considered groping or in some cases [[sexual harassment]] or [[sexual assault]].

[[Naturism]] is a lifestyle choice that is characterized by the practice of nudity both alone and in groups. Some naturists hold that nakedness is not automatically a sexual state and that covering areas of the body is merely a [[social construct]]: they believe that the [[social norms|norms]] of society can be upheld even when all are nude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inf-fni.org/ International Naturist Federation] Welcome page.

Teasdale]] (Cambridge) and [[Zindel Segal]] (Toronto) he developed [[Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy]] (MBCT; [http://www.mbct.co.uk]) for prevention of relapse and recurrence in depression, and several RCTs have now found that MBCT significantly decreases the recurrence rate in those who have suffered three or more previous episodes of major depression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.octc.co.uk/content.asp?PageID=194 Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7134">'''Jurisprudence of values''' or '''jurisprudence of principles''' is a school of legal philosophy. This school represents, according to some authors, a step in overcoming the contradictions of [[legal positivism]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It is a school that has, since the end of the 19th century, characterized the law as a dogmatic institution, or man's imposition over man, in opposition to the former school, [[legal naturalism]], that treated law as a result of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]]-[[rationalism|rationalist]] and [[science|scientific]] [[sources of law|sources]] (''natural'' consequence of the other sciences' conclusions and even work of [[God]]). The image of legal positivism nonetheless has deteriorated because of being used to favor class [[oppression]].&lt;/ref&gt; and, for this reason, it has been considered by some authors as a ''post-positivism'' school.&lt;ref name="OABJST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/9463/velhos-novos-direitos|title=Velhos Novos Direitos|author=Teixeira Júnior, Senomar|date=1 January 2007|publisher=OAB|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisprudence of values is referred to in various works all over the world.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=448582|title=Recent Developments in Political Jurisprudence|date=4 December 1983|author=Shapiro, Martin|publisher=The Western Political Quarterly|volume=36|pages=541–548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RJI"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.juridicainternational.eu/building-a-just-society-the-role-of-the-constitutional-judge-idea-of-justice-in-the-contemporary-value-jurisprudence-and-the-process-of-argumentation|title=Building a Just Society: the Role of the Constitutional Judge. Idea of Justice in the Contemporary Value Jurisprudence and the Process of Argumentation|author=Linntam, Marika|date=1 January 2002|journal=International Law Magazine|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''modus'' of thinking of focuses on [[Principles of the constitution|constitutional principles]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The [[legal principle|principle]], as opposed to the ''legal rule'', is more subjective, and the traditional interpretation gave it minor importance. Jurisprudence of values focuses on achieving the ideals underlying these legal principles.&lt;/ref&gt;

The jurisprudence of values centers on the concepts of incidence and [[Statutory interpretation|interpretation]] of the ''legal norm'', as well as rules and [[principle]]s, and concepts like [[Social equality|equality]], [[Political freedom|freedom]], and [[justice]].&lt;ref name="JNEMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/8126/o-carater-normativo-dos-principios-juridicos|title=O Caráter Normativo Dos Princípios Jurídicos|author=Meyer, Emílio Pesulo|date=1 March 2006|publisher=Jus Navigandi|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juridical norms ==
According to [[Pontes de Miranda]],&lt;ref&gt;Pontes de Miranda, 1973:3&lt;/ref&gt; "The juridical rule is the norm with which the man, willing to subordinate the events to an order and foreseeability, tries to distribute the life's goods". Mankind seeks to somehow control the facts; the juridical norm is used as a tool to decide what is right and wrong. The norm, according to this school, is seen as a creation of man, thus man is controlling man.

Pontes de Miranda explains the concept of ''fact support''. Fact support is the fact that is previewed by the norm; it is the abstract fact; it is the fact that, if it is verified true in the ''world of facts'' the norm will ''fall upon'' it. In other words, there is a world of concrete facts and there is another world of ideas or ''types''. Thus, the legislator tries to use words to group possible concrete facts into sets, related to the world of ideas. This paradigm makes possible to attribute judicial effects to life's facts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6089">'''LOVEINT''' is the practice of [[intelligence service]] employees making use of their extensive monitoring capabilities to spy on their [[love interest]] or [[spouse]]. The term was coined in resemblance to intelligence terminology such as [[Signals Intelligence|SIGINT]], [[COMINT]] or [[HUMINT]].

== National Security Agency ==
The term LOVEINT originated at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], where approximately one such incident has been reported per year. In 2013, eight had been reported in the past decade, and they are the lion's share of unauthorized accesses reported by the NSA.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57605051-38/nsa-offers-details-on-loveint-thats-spying-on-lovers-exes/ |title=NSA offers details on 'LOVEINT' (that's spying on lovers, exes) |author=Edward Moyer |work=CNET |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHk7ld6C?url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57605051-38/nsa-offers-details-on-loveint-thats-spying-on-lovers-exes/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most incidents are self-reported, for example during a [[polygraph]] test. The NSA sanctions them with administrative action, up to termination of employment.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/08/23/nsa-officers-sometimes-spy-on-love-interests/ |title=NSA Officers Spy on Love Interests |author=Siobhan Gorman |work=Washington Wire |publisher=The Wallstreet Journal |date=2013-08-23 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkHTCmo?url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/08/23/nsa-officers-sometimes-spy-on-love-interests/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/24/loveint-when-nsa-officers-use-their-spying-power-on-love-interests/ |title=LOVEINT: When NSA officers use their spying power on love interests |author=Andrea Peterson |work=The Washington Post |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkYSmlK?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/24/loveint-when-nsa-officers-use-their-spying-power-on-love-interests/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/09/loveint-given-immense-powers-nsa-employees-super-cyber-stalked-their-crushes/ |title=‘LoveINT’: Given Immense Powers, NSA Employees Super Cyber-Stalked Their Crushes |author=Lee Ferran |work=American Broadcasting Company |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkfSDh5?url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/09/loveint-given-immense-powers-nsa-employees-super-cyber-stalked-their-crushes/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbcnews-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/loveint-nsa-letter-discloses-employee-eavesdropping-girlfriends-spouses-v20709855 |title='Loveint': NSA letter discloses employee eavesdropping on girlfriends, spouses |author=National Broadcasting Company |work=National Broadcasting Company |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkoKNmP?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/loveint-nsa-letter-discloses-employee-eavesdropping-girlfriends-spouses-v20709855 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In five of the cases, the NSA employee resigned, preempting any administrative action. In two other cases, they retired.&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt; The worst administrative sanction handed out was "a reduction in pay for two months, a reduction in grade, and access to classified information being revoked". One case was forwarded to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], which however declined to prosecute.&lt;ref name="slate-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/27/loveint_how_nsa_spies_snooped_on_girlfriends_lovers_and_first_dates.html |title=Loveint: How NSA spies snooped on girlfriends, lovers, and first dates. |author=Ryan Gallagher |work=Future Tense |publisher=Slate |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkwh19K?url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/27/loveint_how_nsa_spies_snooped_on_girlfriends_lovers_and_first_dates.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Market moving information''' is a term used in [[stock market]] investing, defined as information that would cause any reasonable investor to make a buy or sell decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 2579510|title = Reasonable Investor(s)|last = |first = |date = 2015|journal = Boston University Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also sometimes referred to as [[material information]].

When a public company insider fails to publicly disclose material, market moving information to everyone and only to certain parties, that is called [[selective disclosure]], an act that is prohibited by the SEC's [[Regulation FD]].

Many types of events can be considered market moving information.  A bad freeze in Florida can cause the price of orange juice to increase.  An expected drought in the Midwest might cause corn or soybean prices to rise on fears of poor crop outputs and limited supplies.

It is based on maintaining coherence across [[Scale (analytical tool)|scales]] and different dimensions (e.g. economic, demographic, energetic) of quantitative assessments generated using different metrics. It is designed to detect and analyze patterns in the societal use of resources and the impacts they create on the environment. The approach was created around 1997 by Mario Giampietro and Kozo Mayumi, and has been developed since then by the members of the IASTE (Integrated Assessment: Sociology, Technology and the Environment) group at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the ''Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona'' and its external collaborators. MuSIASEM strives to characterize metabolic patterns of Socio-Ecological Systems (how and why humans use resources and how this use depends on and affects the stability of the ecosystems embedding the society). This integrated approach allows for a quantitative implementation of the [[DPSIR]] framework (Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses) and application as a decision support tool. Different alternatives of the option space can be checked in terms of feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control), viability (compatibility with processes under human control) and desirability (compatibility with normative values and institutions). The ability to integrate quantitative assessments across dimensions and scales makes MuSIASEM particularly suited for different types of sustainability analysis: (i) the nexus between food, energy, water and land uses; (ii) urban metabolism; (iii) waste metabolism; (iv) tourism metabolism; (v) rural development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20341">[[Daniel Dennett]]'s '''multiple drafts model of consciousness''' is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] theory of [[consciousness]] based upon [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], which views the [[mind]] in terms of [[information processing]]. The theory is described in depth in his book, ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', published in 1991. As the title states, the book proposes a high-level explanation of consciousness which is consistent with support for the possibility of [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI.]]

Dennett describes the theory as ''first-person [[operationalism]]''. As he states it:
{{quote|The Multiple Drafts model makes [the procedure of] "writing it down" in memory criterial for consciousness: that is ''what it is'' for the "given" to be "taken" ... There is no reality of conscious experience independent of the effects of various vehicles of content on subsequent action (and hence, of course, on memory).&lt;ref name="dennett1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel, C. |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The thesis of multiple drafts==
Dennett's thesis is that our modern understanding of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of [[René Descartes]]. To show why, he starts with a description of the [[color phi phenomenon|phi illusion]]. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour ''before'' the second light is observed.

Dennett claims that conventional explanations of the colour change boil down to either ''Orwellian'' or ''Stalinesque'' hypotheses, which he says are the result of Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[show trial]]s, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.
{{quote|[W]e can suppose, both theorists have ''exactly'' the same theory of what happens in your brain; they agree about just where and when in the brain the mistaken content enters the causal pathways; they just disagree about whether that location is to be deemed pre-experiential or post-experiential. ... [T]hey even agree about how it ought to "feel" to subjects: Subjects should be unable to tell the difference between misbegotten experiences and immediately misremembered experiences. [p. 125, original emphasis.]}}

Dennett argues that there is no principled basis for picking one of these theories over the other, because they share a common error in supposing that there is a special time and place where unconscious processing becomes consciously experienced, entering into what Dennett calls the "[[Cartesian theatre]]". Both theories require us to cleanly divide a sequence of perceptions and reactions into before and after the instant that they reach the seat of consciousness, but he denies that there is any such moment, as it would lead to infinite regress. Instead, he asserts that there is no privileged place in the brain where consciousness happens. Dennett states that, "[t]here does not exist ... a process such as 'recruitment of consciousness' (into what?), nor any place where the 'vehicle's arrival' is recognized (by whom?)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121095257/http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 November 2005|title=Multiple Drafts...|date=21 November 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Cartesian materialism]] is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of "presentation" in experience because ''what happens there'' is what you are conscious of. ... Many theorists would insist that they have explicitly rejected such an obviously bad idea. But ... the persuasive imagery of the Cartesian Theater keeps coming back to haunt us—laypeople and scientists alike—even after its ghostly dualism has been denounced and exorcized. [p. 107, original emphasis.]}}

With no theatre, there is no screen, hence no reason to re-present data after it has already been analysed. Dennett says that, "the Multiple Drafts model goes on to claim that the brain does not bother 'constructing' any representations that go to the trouble of 'filling in' the blanks. That would be a waste of time and (shall we say?) paint. The judgement is already in so we can get on with other tasks!"

According to the model, there are a variety of sensory inputs from a given event and also a variety of interpretations of these inputs. The sensory inputs arrive in the brain and are interpreted at different times, so a given event can give rise to a succession of discriminations, constituting the equivalent of multiple drafts of a story. As soon as each discrimination is accomplished, it becomes available for eliciting a behaviour; it does not have to wait to be presented at the theatre.

Like a number of other theories, the Multiple Drafts model understands conscious experience as taking time to occur, such that percepts do not instantaneously arise in the mind in their full richness. The distinction is that Dennett's theory denies any clear and unambiguous boundary separating conscious experiences from all other processing. According to Dennett, consciousness is to be found in the actions and flows of information from place to place, rather than some singular view containing our experience. There is no central experiencer who confers a durable stamp of approval on any particular draft.

Different parts of the neural processing assert more or less control at different times. For something to reach consciousness is akin to becoming famous, in that it must leave behind consequences by which it is remembered. To put it another way, consciousness is the property of having enough influence to affect what the mouth will say and the hands will do. Which inputs are "edited" into our drafts is not an exogenous act of supervision, but part of the self-organizing functioning of the network, and at the same level as the circuitry that conveys information bottom-up.

The conscious self is taken to exist as an abstraction visible at the level of the [[intentional stance]], akin to a body of mass having a "centre of gravity". Analogously, Dennett refers to the self as the "centre of narrative gravity", a story we tell ourselves about our experiences. Consciousness exists, but not independently of behaviour and behavioural disposition, which can be studied through [[heterophenomenology]].

The origin of this operationalist approach can be found in Dennett's immediately preceding work. Dennett (1988) explains consciousness in terms of ''access consciousness'' alone, denying the independent existence of what [[Ned Block]] has labeled ''phenomenal consciousness''.&lt;ref name="block1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Block, N. |title=On a confusion about a function of consciousness |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=18 |pages=227–287 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038188}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Everything real has properties, and since I don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties". Having related all consciousness to properties, he concludes that they cannot be meaningfully distinguished from our judgements about them. He writes: 
{{quote|The [[infallibilist]] line on [[qualia]] treats them as properties of one's experience one cannot in principle misdiscover, and this is a mysterious doctrine (at least as mysterious as papal infallibility) unless we shift the emphasis a little and treat qualia as logical constructs out of subjects' qualia-judgments: a subject's experience has the quale F if and only if the subject judges his experience to have quale F. We can then treat such judgings as constitutive acts, in effect, bringing the quale into existence by the same sort of license as novelists have to determine the hair color of their characters by fiat. We do not ask how Dostoevski knows that Raskolnikov's hair is light brown.&lt;ref name="dennett2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel C. |title=Quining Qualia |year=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, once we've explained a perception fully in terms of how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there is no such thing as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a [[quale]]). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.
{{quote|So when we look one last time at our original characterization of qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible properties of experience, we find that there is nothing to fill the bill. In their place are relatively or practically ineffable public properties we can refer to indirectly via reference to our private property-detectors—private only in the sense of idiosyncratic. And insofar as we wish to cling to our subjective authority about the occurrence within us of states of certain types or with certain properties, we can have some authority—not infallibility or incorrigibility, but something better than sheer guessing—but only if we restrict ourselves to relational, extrinsic properties like the power of certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re-identification. So contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there simply are no qualia at all.&lt;ref name="dennett2"/&gt;}}

The key to the multiple drafts model is that, after removing qualia, explaining consciousness boils down to explaining the behaviour we recognise as conscious. Consciousness is as consciousness does.

==Critical responses==
Some of the criticism of Dennett's theory is due to the perceived tone of his presentation. As one grudging supporter admits, "there is much in this book that is disputable. And Dennett is at times aggravatingly smug and confident about the merits of his arguments ... All in all Dennett's book is annoying, frustrating, insightful, provocative and above all annoying" (Korb 1993).

Bogen (1992) points out that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical. That being the case, if Cartesian materialism is true, there might be ''two'' Cartesian theatres, so arguments against only one are flawed.&lt;ref name="bogen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogen, J.E. |title=Descartes' fundamental mistake: Introspective singularity |year=1992 |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |issue=15 |pages=184–247 | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x00033914 |volume=17}} Commentary on Daniel C. Dennett and Marcel Kinsbourne (1992) ''Time and the observer: The where and when of consciousness in the brain.''&lt;/ref&gt; Velmans (1992) argues that the phi effect and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]] demonstrate that there is a delay whilst modelling occurs and that this delay was discovered by Libet.&lt;ref name="vel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Velmans, M. |title=Is Consciousness Integrated? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=15 |pages=229–230 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00068473}}(commentary on Dennett &amp; Kinsbourne "Time and the observer", BBS, 1992, 15(2): 183–201) Copyright Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that the argument in the multiple drafts model does not support its conclusion.&lt;ref name="bring"&gt;{{cite web |author=Bringsjord, S. |url=http://citeseer.ifi.unizh.ch/bringsjord96explaining.html |title=Explaining Phi Without Dennett's Exotica: Good Ol' Computation Suffices |&lt;!-- accessdate=1996 --&gt;}} {{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Straw man"===
Much of the criticism asserts that Dennett's theory attacks the wrong target, failing to explain what it claims to. Chalmers (1996) maintains that Dennett has produced no more than a theory of how subjects report events.&lt;ref name="chalmers"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chalmers, David |title=The Conscious Mind |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some even parody the title of the book as "Consciousness Explained Away", accusing him of [[greedy reductionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3005001 BBC.co.uk] – Some Modern Theories of Consciousness&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of criticism disputes the accuracy of Dennett's characterisations of existing theories:
{{quote|The now standard response to Dennett's project is that he has picked a fight with a [[straw man]]. Cartesian materialism, it is alleged, is an impossibly naive account of phenomenal consciousness held by no one currently working in cognitive science or the philosophy of mind. Consequently, whatever the effectiveness of Dennett's demolition job, it is fundamentally misdirected (see, e.g., Block, 1993, 1995; Shoemaker, 1993; and Tye, 1993).&lt;ref name="bando"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Brien, G.  |author2=Opie, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A defense of Cartesian Materialism |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=59 |pages= 939–63 |doi=10.2307/2653563}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Unoriginality===
Multiple drafts is also attacked for making a claim to novelty. It may be the case, however, that such attacks mistake which features Dennett is claiming as novel. Korb states that, "I believe that the central thesis will be relatively uncontentious for most cognitive scientists, but that its use as a cleaning solvent for messy puzzles will be viewed less happily in most quarters." (Korb 1993) In this way, Dennett uses uncontroversial ideas towards more controversial ends, leaving him open to claims of unoriginality when uncontroversial parts are focused upon.

Even the notion of consciousness as drafts is not unique to Dennett. According to Hankins, Dieter Teichert suggests that [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s theories agree with Dennett's on the notion that "the self is basically a narrative entity, and that any attempt to give it a free-floating independent status is misguided." [Hankins] Others see [[Derrida]]'s (1982) representationalism as consistent with the notion of a mind that has perceptually changing content without a definitive present instant.&lt;ref name="derrida"&gt;{{cite book |author=Derrida, J. |title=Margins of Philosophy |publisher=The University of Chicago Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To those who believe that consciousness entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as [[eliminativism|eliminativist]], since it denies the existence of [[qualia]] and the possibility of [[philosophical zombie]]s. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate: whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.

===Information processing and consciousness===
The role of information processing in consciousness has been criticised by [[John Searle]] who, in his [[Chinese room]] argument,&lt;ref name="searle"&gt;Searle, J. (1980) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070611104618/http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html Minds, Brains and Programs]"&lt;/ref&gt; states that he cannot find anything that could be recognised as conscious experience in a system that relies solely on motions of things from place to place. Dennett sees this argument as misleading, arguing that consciousness is not to be found in a specific part of the system, but in the actions of the whole. In essence, he denies that consciousness requires something in addition to capacity for behaviour, saying that philosophers such as Searle, "just can't imagine how understanding could be a property that emerges from lots of distributed quasi-understanding in a large system" (p.&amp;nbsp;439).

'''Namantar Andolan''' (English: '''Name Change Movement''') was a [[Dalit]] movement to change the name of Marathwada University in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]], India to ''Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar University''. It achieved a measure of success in 1994 when the compromise name of ''[[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University]]'' was accepted. The movement was notable for the violence against Dalits.

==Background==
''Namantar'' means name change&lt;ref name="Jaoul2008" /&gt; and ''andolan'' means [[social movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chauhan |first=B. S. |year=2008 |title=Natural Resources (Forest, water and Minerals) |publisher=Firewall Media Publishers |page=31 |isbn=9788131803288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Namantar Andolan was a 16-year-long Dalit campaign to rename Marathwada University in recognition of [[B. R. Ambedkar]], the [[jurist]], [[politician]] and [[Social reformers of India|social reformer]] who had proposed that [[untouchability]] should be made illegal.&lt;ref name="RAO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Osaka"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Joseph|title=B.

Non-Dalit student groups initially supported the demand to have the university renamed but did so less for reasons of dogma than for the pragmatic desire to bring the Dalit, mostly Mahar, students into the general fold. Dalit students traditionally showed no interest in supporting such causes as lower fees and cheaper textbooks, but they constituted around 26 percent of the student population and anticipated quid pro quo. A march involving Dalit and non-Dalit students was organised with the intent of petitioning the council of the university for the change. The procession met with another, headed by [[Gangadhar Gade]], a [[Dalit Panther]] leader,{{efn|The Dalit Panthers were a group of writers and poets.&lt;ref name=GUHA  /&gt;}} who launched a tirade of abuse at the non-Dalit contingent as he asserted the right of the Dalits to take all the credit for the change in name. This alienated the non-Dalit students and, according to Dipankar Gupta, "the division was caused not so much by caste Hindu prejudices and reticence to support the renaming of the University, but rather by the splittist and sectarian position taken by Gadhe", who might also be concerned that any alliance between Dalits and non-Dalits could affect the potency of the Panthers. Among left-wing organisations, only the [[Students' Federation of India]] and Yukrant continued to support the campaign.&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;

In 1977, the chief minister of Maharashtra, [[Vasantdada Patil]], promised that the renaming would occur, and in July 1978, the [[Maharashtra Legislature (disambiguation)|Maharashtra Legislature]] approved it. Uttara Shastree notes that the campaign at this time reflected the desire of neo-Buddhists for an improved image and position in society, as a significant part of which they called on the symbolic ideas of Ambedkar that had preceded his rise to prominence.&lt;ref name="Shastree1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shastree |first=Uttara |year=1996 |title=Religious Converts in India: Socio-political Study of Neo-Buddhists |publisher=Mittal Publications |pages=100–101 |isbn=9788170996293 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYInC70BSEgC&amp;pg=PA100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University Executive Body passed a resolution to rename the university and this series of decisions was the catalyst for rioting, which began on 27 July 1978 and lasted several weeks.&lt;ref name="Holocaust by Damle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damle|first=Y.

Commentators such as [[Gail Omvedt]] believe that the violence was a caste war based on hatred whilst others, such as Gupta, believe that the causes were more varied. Both Omvedt and Gupta noted that the violence was aimed at the Mahars and did not extend to other Dalit groups, while Gupta also notes that it was concentrated in the three districts of Marathwada&amp;nbsp;— [[Aurangabad district, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Nanded district|Nanded]] and [[Parbhani district|Parbhani]]&amp;nbsp;— where Dalit registrations in schools and colleges were particularly high, and economic competition was most fierce. In particular, the centres of the unrest were urban areas, where the impact of Mahar aspirations would most deeply affect the employment, social, and economic roles which Hindu castes considered to be their preserve. Troubles were largely absent from the other two districts of [[Beed district|Beed]] and [[Osmanabad district|Osmanabad]], and the spill of problems into rural areas generally was patchy.{{efn|In some rural villages, caste Hindus assisted in defending their Mahar neighbours against trouble-makers; in other instances where trouble arose, it might be on a selective basis, with some particularly aspirational Mahars being targeted but the remainder being tolerated.&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;}} These issues of geographic and [[demographic targeting]], according to Gupta, indicate that the real causes of the violence were more subtle than war between caste Hindu and Dalit. There were also instances of violent acts taking place under the pretext of the riots elsewhere but in fact to settle very local and personal scores unrelated to the broader causes.&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt; In contradiction to these views, Y. C. Damle maintains that the violence "specially affected the Scheduled Caste people in the villages although the agitation for renaming the Marathwada University after Dr. Ambedkar was spearheaded by Dalit Panthers and such leaders mainly in urban centres. In giving a call for agitation, hardly any effort was made to protect the villages or villagers."&lt;ref name="Holocaust by Damle" /&gt;

==Attacks==
{{Discrimination sidebar |General}}
Riots affected 1,200 villages in [[Marathwada]], impacting on 25,000 [[Marathi Buddhists]], Dalits and causing thousands of them to seek safety in jungles. The terrorised Dalits did not return to their villages despite of starvation. This violence was allegedly organised by members of the [[Maratha]] community and took many forms, including killings, molestation and rape of Dalit women, burning of houses and huts, pillaging of Dalit colonies, forcing Dalits out of villages, polluting drinking water wells, destruction of cattle and refusal to employ. This continued for 67 days. According to the ''Yukrant'' leader, attacks on Dalit were collective and pre-planned.&lt;ref name="Samiti" /&gt; In many villages, Dalit colonies were burned. The burning houses in Marathwada region affected 900 Dalit households.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGbp9MjhvKAC&amp;pg=PA73 |title=The Untouchables: Subordination, Poverty and the State in Modern India |first1=Oliver |last1=Mendelsohn |first2=Marika |last2=Vicziany |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=73–75, 91 |year=1998 |accessdate=10 May 2013 |isbn=9780521556712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upper caste rioters demolished essential household items that the Dalit possessed.

==Role of media, political parties and bureaucrats==

===Media===

The regional press played a biased role during the violence.&lt;ref name=Vakil4 /&gt; The Marathi Newspaper, ''Prajawani'' and ''Godatir Samachar'', opposed the Namantar "by giving wide publicity to the riots in the cities and suppressing news in the rural areas." According to ''Aurangabad daily'', ''Marathwada'' the Namantar was a cultural violation for Marathwada existence.&lt;ref name="Samiti"/&gt; The press did not publish about rural violence news.&lt;ref name=Vakil4&gt;{{cite book|last=Vakil|first=A.K.|title=Reservation policy and scheduled castes in India|year=1985|publisher=Asish Pub.

But the media intensified on allegations that the [[Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989|PCR Act]] was being misused.&lt;ref name=RAO /&gt; [[Bhalchandra Nemade]] commented "All Marathi newspapers are communal and they thrive on the so-called '[[freedom of press]]' to serve their own aims."&lt;ref name=Vakil4 /&gt; The chief minister of Maharashtra admitted the one-sided role of the press.&lt;ref name="Samiti" /&gt;

===Political parties===

[[Shiv Sena]], the [[Hindutva]] political party, initially declared itself opposed to the Namantar.&lt;ref name=SONAWANE&gt;{{cite news|last=Sonawane|first=Rakshit|title=Seat gone, Atahwale now plans to revive former militant outfit|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/seat-gone-athawale-now-plans-to-revive-former-militant-outfit/375320/|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shiv Sena: A Tiger with Many Faces? |first=Suhas |last=Palshikar |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=39 |issue=14/15 |date=3–16 April 2004 |pages=1497–1507 |jstor=4414867}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; During agitation the supporters of [[Bal Thackeray]] burnt homes of the Dalits.&lt;ref name=PUNWANI&gt;{{cite news|last=Punwani|first=Jyoti|title=Memorial to a dysfunctional state|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/memorial-to-a-dysfunctional-state/article4222627.ece|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People were physically harmed, including by attacks with swords. Interviewers explained that the attackers were from the Maratha community, who also burned Dalit properties in Nanded district. Supporters of the [[Peasants and Workers Party of India]] (PWP) and [[Indian National Congress]] were involved in these burnings. In the same area, there were allegations of two women raped and three children killed, but no legal action instigated. &lt;ref name="Vakil"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=6DCegd2xxF8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Reservation Policy and Scheduled Castes in India |first=A.

On the other hand, Congress leaders particularly from Latur, Aurangabad, Jalna and to some extent Beed districts identified with the Dalit cause and worked for the Dalit harmony in these districts to maintain political impression."&lt;ref name="Guru"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

But later in 2011, [[Bal Thackeray]] cleared that he never opposed the Namantar. He said in an interview that:

{{quote|"Let me make it clear once again. I never opposed the renaming of the university. I had suggested that the name Marathwada University be retained, and Ambedkar's name is added to it. RPI leader R. S. Gavai came to my residence and I suggested that Ambedkar's name is added to the existing name of the university. He liked the idea and phoned Sharad Pawar (the then chief minister) who also gave his approval. My stance was that while renaming the varsity, the pride of Marathwada region should remain intact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-i-never-opposed-giving-ambedkar-s-name-to-marathwada-university-bal-thackeray-1544871&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

===Bureaucrats===

Many Dalits were harassed by the police as they continued to campaign for the change. The police allegedly reacted by adopting tactics such as delay and suppression of evidence.&lt;ref name="Samiti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraham"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Importance of Renaming Marathwada University |first=Amrita |last=Abraham |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=14 |issue=29 |date=21 July 1979 |pages=1190–1191 |jstor=4367800}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few villages, Hindu police patils and [[Sarpanch|sarpanchs]] of all riot-affected villages teamed up with rich Hindu caste landowners to attack Dalit's poor peasants and agricultural labourers.&lt;ref name="Samiti"/&gt; Police joined the mob in a violent way.&lt;ref name=Vakil50&gt;{{cite book|last=Vakil|first=A.K.|title=Reservation policy and scheduled castes in India|year=1985|publisher=Asish Pub.

==Effects==
After the riots, many landlords refused to employ Dalits and even at public places such as hotels, discriminated against them.&lt;ref name="Samiti"/&gt; Rioters created a silent boycott.

Sooner after the atrocities, authorities brought around 3000 individuals into the police custody, but victims reported that very few went into the court, and the remaining cases weren't much faster. Even natives pressured to dismiss all cases. The parliamentary committee advised "an automatic judicial inquiry in all cases of large-scale arson and looting involved Dalits." But, the judicial inquiry was opposed by the Maharashtra government.&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt;

==Long March==

On 4 August 1978, [[Jogendra Kawade]] led a march from Deekshabhoomi to [[District collector|District magistrate]] office in Nagpur to rename the university. On the same day, there was a meeting in Aakashwani Chowk attended by a large student crowd. Following, the people were going back home zestfully. The provoked violence started when some anti-social elements pelted stones at transportation links. The police opened fire to overcome turbulence. After this incident, the Long march was declared.

The Long March began on a ''Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din'' from [[Deekshabhoomi]], [[Nagpur]], an area populated by many Buddhists, towards Aurangabad, blessed by [[Bhadant Anand Kausalyan]].&lt;ref name=KAWADE /&gt;&lt;ref name="नागपुर से उठी चिंगारी" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=ed. by B.V.

"This march was the world's third largest Long March."&lt;ref name="नागपुर से उठी चिंगारी" /&gt; According to ''Yukrant'' leader, around 3 ''[[Lakh|Lakhs]]'' of people were expected to join the Long March to rename the university after Ambedkar's name. A small percentage reached to Aurangabd, but minimum 3 lakhs organized the mass protest – ''[[satyagraha]]'', ''Jail Bharo Andolan'', March.  The protesters clashed with the police between 25 November to 6 December. Thousands of Long March activists walking from Nagpur, [[Udgir]] and [[Satara (city)|Satara]] were taken into custody at the boundaries of Marathwada. Thousands were arrested during ''staygraha'' struggle at their towns and cities. Protestors were ''lathi'' charged, police fired shots on them on 6 December, Ambedkar's death anniversary. On the same day, [[Vidarbha]] [[bandh]] was observed.&lt;ref name="Omvedt 1979" /&gt; On 27 November, police stopped the protestors at Khadakpurna River Bridge in the afternoon. Thousands of protestors started a [[sit-in]] at the Khadakpurna River Bridge. They were ''lathi'' charged after 12 AM in their sleep, during the course many ran away and hundreds were arrested.&lt;ref name="नागपुर से उठी चिंगारी" /&gt;

On 3 December, there was a protest by Dalit youths who burned buses, 4 of them died in clashes with the police at Nagpur.&lt;ref name="Omvedt 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Leaderless March|first=Gail |last=Omvedt |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=14 |issue=49 |date=8 December 1979 |pages=1190–1191 |jstor=4368200}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police arrested around 12000 demonstrators who planned to march towards the University from Kranti Chowk at Auragabad. Demonstrators of Dalit Panthers were arrested at [[Bhadkal Gate]] and at the university entrance. Leaders and activists arrested, physically harmed, [[lathi charge]]d, shot with [[tear gas]] and air firing to disperse the crowd. The intention of the state was to control and disperse demonstrators and keep them from anti Dalits,&lt;ref name="Omvedt 1979" /&gt; who formed ''Namantar Virodhi Group'' (a group opposing renaming).&lt;ref name="Shastree1996" /&gt; Most of them were freed from jails on the same evening but few refused to leave Jails to continue ''satyagraha''. The main agenda of this Long March was to battle against caste oppression.&lt;ref name="Omvedt 1979"/&gt;

The movement became a part of [[Dalit literature]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Images of women in Maharashtrian literature and religion |editor-first=Anne |editor-last=Feldhaus |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1996 |isbn=9781438402499 |pages=80–83 |chapter=Stri Dalit Sahitya: The New Voice of Women Poets |first=Eleanor |last=Zelliot}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Omvedt "the upsurge, turmoil's and frustration of the long march campaign brought the movement to a new turning point. The readiness for action shown by Dalit masses provided a demonstration of their powerful urge for revolutionary change".&lt;ref name="Omvedt 1979" /&gt; During the Long March, men sung songs of [[martyr]]s, women even joined children to boost this revolution.&lt;ref name="Omvedt1993" /&gt; The andolan gradually turned out in [[Agra]], Delhi, [[Banglore]], [[Hydrabad|Hyderabad]] where people protested marching. For 16 years, many meetings were held, people protested marching and was arrested many times.&lt;ref name="नागपुर से उठी चिंगारी" /&gt;

==Namvistar Din==
[[Govindbhai Shroff]] was against renaming the university but he requested people to accept the new name with non-violence. Concurrently, he pressed a requirement to withdraw the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act cases against non-Dalits, specifically the ''malafide'' ones. Tight security was deployed on the eve of the announcement with a few incidents reported in [[Parbhani]] and [[Amravati]].&lt;ref name="Damle"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-nVDBvv_OqAC&amp;pg=PA140 |title=Beyond Economic Development: A Case Study of Marathwada |first=Jasmine Y. |last=Damle |publisher=Mittal |year=2001 |pages=140–146 |accessdate=10 May 2013 |isbn=9788170997962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police imposed a curfew at Tuljapur and shots fired by the police were reported in Beed.&lt;ref name="Damle" /&gt; After renaming the university, at least four Dalits were stabbed, Dalit property was set on fire and statues of Ambedkar dishonoured at Parbhani and Osmanabad.&lt;ref name=RAO /&gt; However, in Osmanabad district, at Kathi Savargaon, the renaming decision was welcomed with celebration by Maratha sarpanch in village. A similar case was reported in Lohara.&lt;ref name="Guru" /&gt;

Marathwda region has a diverse cultural and historical background, so many names were suggested.

The chosen form&amp;nbsp;— Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University&amp;nbsp;— represents an expansion of the existing name (a ''Namvistar'') rather than complete change (''Namanatar''). Sharad Pawar also announced that it would be a policy to encourage higher education for everyone, irrespective of caste, class, religion, and ethnicity. Moreover, the newly named university was developed with improved facilities in some departments to conceptualize the dream of Ambedkar which was one of the important parameters for the University.&lt;ref name="Damle" /&gt; At the same time, the university adopted the Ajanta arch with elephants as its primary logo, reflecting the Buddhist cultural significance of the [[Ajanta caves]].&lt;ref name="BAMU" /&gt;

Every 14 January, the followers of Ambedkar throng the university. The political parties and organizations based on Ambedkar's thinking celebrate this day.

In [[statistical process control|statistical quality control]], the '''np-chart''' is a type of [[control chart]] used to monitor the number of [[Nonconformity (quality)|nonconforming units]] in a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]].  It is an adaptation of the [[p-chart]] and used in situations where personnel find it easier to interpret process performance in terms of concrete numbers of units rather than the somewhat more abstract proportion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Montgomery | first = Douglas | title = Introduction to Statistical Quality Control | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. | year = 2005 | location = [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | pages = 279 | url = http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | isbn = 978-0-471-65631-9 | oclc = 56729567 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620095346/http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | archivedate = 2008-06-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The np-chart differs from the p-chart in only the three following aspects:
#The control limits are &lt;math&gt;n\bar p \pm 3\sqrt{n\bar p(1-\bar p)}&lt;/math&gt;, where n is the sample size and &lt;math&gt;\bar p&lt;/math&gt; is the estimate of the long-term process mean established during control-chart setup.
#The number nonconforming (np), rather than the fraction nonconforming (p), is plotted against the control limits.
#The sample size, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is constant.

In [[politics]],  '''the line''' or '''the party line''' is an [[idiom]] for a [[political party]] or [[social movement]]'s [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] [[Political agenda|agenda]], as well as ideological elements specific to the organization's [[partisan (political)|partisanship]]. The common phrase [[toe the line|toeing the party line]] describes a person who speaks in a manner that conforms to his political party's agenda.  Likewise, a [[party-line vote]] is one in which most or all of the legislators from each political party voted in accordance with that party's policies. In several countries, a [[Whip (politics)|whip]] attempts to ensure this.

The [[Marxist-Leninist]] concept (see [[General line of the party]]) of [[democratic centralism]] involves strict adherence to, and defense of, a [[communist party]]'s positions in public.

According to American educator [[Herbert Kohl (educator)|Herbert Kohl]], writing about debates in New York in the late 1940s and early 1950s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Uncommon Differences: On Political Correctness, Core Curriculum and Democracy in Education|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v016/16.1.kohl.html|journal = The Lion and the Unicorn|date = 1992-01-01|issn = 1080-6563|pages = 1–16|volume = 16|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/uni.0.0216|first = Herbert|last = Kohl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The term "[[Political correctness|politically correct]]" was used disparagingly, to refer to someone whose loyalty to the CP line overrode compassion, and led to bad politics. It was used by Socialists against Communists, and was meant to separate out Socialists who believed in egalitarian moral ideas from dogmatic Communists who would advocate and defend party positions regardless of their moral substance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;On the other hand, in inner-party debate sessions, the line can be questioned, criticized, and changed if necessary.{{Request quotation|date=January 2016}}

Used loosely, the phrase "the party line" may also refer to the non-party organizations such as religious groups, business offices, or a social network that may have a semi-official organizational policy or position that is unrelated to any political party.

In 1671 an argument broke out in the French [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] in Paris about whether drawing or color was more important in painting. On one side stood the '''Poussinists''' (Fr. ''Poussinistes'') who were a group of French artists, named after the painter [[Nicolas Poussin]], who believed that drawing was the most important thing.&lt;ref name=BritP&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/473126/Poussinist Poussinist] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side were the '''Rubenists''' (Fr. ''Rubénistes''), named after [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who prioritize color.&lt;ref name=BritR&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/511893/Rubenist Rubenist] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a strong nationalistic flavour to the debate as Poussin was French but Rubens was [[Flemish]], though neither was alive at the time. After over forty years the final resolution of the matter in favor of the Rubenists was signalled when [[Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau's]] ''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'' was accepted as his [[reception piece]] by the French Academy in 1717.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt; By that time the French [[Rococo]] was in full swing.

==The argument==
The Poussinists believed in the [[Platonic realism|Platonic]] idea of the existence in the mind of ideal objects that could be reconstructed in concrete form by the selection, using reason, of elements from nature. For the Poussinists, therefore, color was a purely decorative addition to form and drawing (design or ''[[disegno]]''), the use of line to depict form, was the essential skill of painting. Their leader was [[Charles Lebrun]]&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 609. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; (died 1690), Director of the Academy, and their heroes were [[Raphael]], [[the Carracci]], and Poussin himself&lt;ref name=BritP/&gt; whose severe and stoical works exemplified their philosophy. Their touchstones were the forms of classical art.
[[Image:Peter Paul Rubens 083.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Hippopotamus and Crocodile Hunt|Hippopotamus Hunt]]'', Rubens, 1616.]]
They were opposed by the Rubenists who believed that colour, not drawing, was superior as it was more true to nature.&lt;ref name=Janson/&gt; Their models were the works of Rubens who had prioritised the accurate depiction of nature over the imitation of classical art. The Rubenists argued that the aim of painting was to deceive the eye by creating an imitation of nature.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt; Drawing, according to the Rubenists, although based on reason, appealed only to a few experts whereas colour could be enjoyed by everyone. The ideas of the Rubenists therefore had revolutionary political connotations as they elevated the position of the lay person and challenged the idea that had held sway since the [[Renaissance]] that painting, as a [[Liberal arts education|liberal art]], could only be appreciated by the educated mind.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 604. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1672, [[Charles Le Brun]], Chancellor of the French Academy, attempted to halt the argument by stating officially that "the function of colour is to satisfy the eyes, whereas drawing satisfies the mind."&lt;ref name=BritP/&gt; He failed, and the debate was continued in the pamphlets of [[Roger de Piles]], who favoured the colourists and set out the arguments in his 1673 ''Dialogue sur le Coloris'' (Dialogue on Colour), and his 1677 ''Conversations sur la Peinture'' (Conversations on Painting).

The argument was similar to the argument over the merits of ''disegno'' and ''colore'' in Italy in the fifteenth century but with a particularly French character as the importance of drawing was one of the key tenets of the French Academy and any attack on it was effectively an attack on everything the Academy stood for, including its political functions in support of the King.
 
To a certain extent, the debate was simply about whether it was acceptable to paint purely in order to give pleasure to the viewer without the nobler purposes typical of a "history" painting.&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;Levey, Michael. (1993) ''Painting and sculpture in France 1700-1789''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 1. {{ISBN|0300064942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
[[Image:L'Embarquement pour Cythere, by Antoine Watteau, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|Watteau's ''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'', 1717.]] 
A success for the Rubenists was achieved when Roger de Piles was elected a member (as an amateur) of the French Academy in 1699 and the final signal that the Rubenists had won came when [[Antoine Watteau]]'s ''The Embarkation for Cythera'' was accepted as his reception piece by the Academy in 1717.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt;

Watteau's acceptance was, however, perhaps not everything that he could have hoped for. When he applied to join the Academy, there was no suitable category for his ''[[fête galante]]'' works, so the academy simply created one rather than reject his application, describing him as a "peintre des festes galantes".&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred, S. (Ed.) (2011) ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A global history''.  Enhanced 13th edn. Boston: Wadsworth, p. 755. {{ISBN|978-0-495-79986-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, M. &amp; D. (2010) "fête galante" in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms''. oxfordreference.com, [[Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 8 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While this acknowledged Watteau as the originator of that genre, and was a significant mark of acceptance both of him and his style of painting, it also prevented him being recognised as a [[History painting|history painter]], the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, tellingly said: "The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Wine and Annie Scottez-De Wambrechies. "Watteau" in ''Grove Art Online''. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T090852pg1 oxfordartonline.com] Oxford University Press. Retrieved 8 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watteau is considered the greatest of the Rubenist artists. Other important Rubenists include [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]. [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] benefited from the new found interest in [[still-life]] and [[genre painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1995, p. 607.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The debate and the overlapping development of the Rococo in eighteenth century France have been seen as a form of revival. [[Michael Levey]] has pointed out that it was during the seventeenth century that the new categories of [[Genre art|genre]], [[Landscape art|landscape]] and still life had become established with their emphasis on the observation of nature, and therefore the arguments of the Rubenists amounted to a revival of existing traditions of naturalism and a call for a greater discipline in painting rather than representing an attitude of general licence or ''laissez faire'' as is sometimes assumed.&lt;ref name=Lev/&gt;

The argument also took place during the beginning of the [[Enlightenment Era|Enlightenment]] and the Rubenists found support in [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) which argued that all ideas derived from experience and that none were innate. [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] observed that what was comprehended through the mind paled compared to what was apprehended through the senses.&lt;ref name=HF/&gt;

The question "'''Why is there anything at all?'''", or, "'''Why is there something rather than nothing?'''" has been raised or commented on by philosophers including [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwor00leibuoft "Principles of Nature and Grace"], 1714, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalwor00leibuoft#page/212/mode/2up/search/209 Article 7].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] − who called it '''the fundamental question of [[metaphysics]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London (1959), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fundamental Question|url=https://www.hedweb.com/witherall/existence.htm|website=www.hedweb.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Manfred|title=Wittgenstein und Heidegger: Die letzten Philosophen|publisher=Rowohlt Verlag|isbn=9783644045118|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JUiFDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP166|page=166|language=de|date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; − and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

==Overview==
The question is general, rather than concerning the existence of anything specific such as the [[universe]] or [[multiverse]], the [[Big Bang]], [[mathematics|mathematical laws]], [[physical law]]s, [[time]], [[consciousness]] or [[God]]. It can be seen as an open [[metaphysical]] question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metaphysics special: Why is there something rather than nothing?|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130890-400-metaphysics-special-why-is-there-something-rather-than-nothing/|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sorensen|first1=Roy|title=Nothingness|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=26 April 2017|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dascal|first1=Marcelo|title=Leibniz: What Kind of Rationalist?|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402086687|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Da_oP3sJs1oC&amp;pg=PA452|page=452|language=en|date=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldschmidt|first1=Tyron|title=The Puzzle of Existence: Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136249228|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=3XDMAgAAQBAJ|language=en|date=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the question's adequacy==

Some argue that the question may be inherently illogical; if the universe had no beginning point then its non-existence might never have been an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Lynds|first1=Peter|title=Why there is something rather than nothing: The finite, infinite and eternal|eprint=1205.2720|date=10 January 2012|class=physics.gen-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study has suggested a model that eliminates the [[initial singularity]] and predicts that the Universe had no beginning but existed forever as a kind of quantum [[potential]] before 'collapsing' into the Big Bang's hot dense state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What if the universe had no beginning?|url=http://earthsky.org/space/what-if-the-universe-had-no-beginning|website=earthsky.org|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosmologie: Quantentrick schafft Urknall-Singularität ab|url=http://www.spektrum.de/news/quantentrick-schafft-urknall-singularitaet-ab/1332377|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ein Universum ohne Urknall, Dunkle Materie und Dunkle Energie|url=http://www.forschung-und-wissen.de/nachrichten/astronomie/ein-universum-ohne-urknall-dunkle-materie-und-dunkle-energie-13372141|website=Forschung und Wissen|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other research a possible consequence of "[[rainbow gravity]]" might be that the universe had no beginning with time stretching back infinitely without an initial singularity and Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Clara|title=In a "Rainbow" Universe Time May Have No Beginning|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rainbow-gravity-universe-beginning/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before the Big Bang, but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang?

Philosopher [[Stephen Law]] has said the question may not need answering, as it is attempting to answer a question that is outside a spatio-temporal setting, from within a spatio-temporal setting. He compares the question to asking "what is north of the North Pole?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Stephen Law - Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, including philosopher Bede Rundle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanterian|first1=Edward|title=Bede Rundle obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/31/bede-rundle|publisher=The Guardian|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned whether [[nothing]] can exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Bede Rundle - Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/achenblog/wp/2013/05/14/why-theres-something-rather-than-nothing/|title=Why there's something rather than nothing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.closertotruth.com/articles/levels-nothing-robert-lawrence-kuhn|title=Levels of Nothing by Robert Lawrence Kuhn - Closer to Truth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Bede Rundle - CloserToTruth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hedweb.com/nihilism/nihilfil.htm Why Does Anything Exist?]&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing might be a human concept that is only a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] and inappropriate for a description of a possible alternative reality, state, or absence of state.

==On causation==
Ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] argued that the notion of an [[uncaused cause]] was non-sensical, and that the [[Eternity of the world|universe was eternal]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[David Hume]] argued that, whilst we expect everything to have a cause because of our experience of the necessity of causes, a cause may not be necessary in the case of the formation of the universe, which is outside our experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gutting|first1=Gary|title=Talking God: Philosophers on Belief|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393352825|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=O96aCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55|language=en|date=2016-11-22}}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] said "I should say that the universe is just there, and that's all",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strangenotions.com/5-reasons-why-the-universe-cant-be-merely-a-brute-fact/|title=5 Reasons Why the Universe Can't Be Merely a Brute Fact : Strange Notions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "[[brute fact]]" position also taken by physicist [[Sean M.

Philosopher [[Brian Leftow]] has argued that the question cannot have a causal explanation (as any cause must itself have a cause) or a contingent explanation (as the factors giving the contingency must pre-exist), and that if there is an answer it must be something that exists necessarily (i.e. something that just exists, rather than is caused).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Brian Leftow - Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Problem solving''' consists of using generic or ''ad hoc'' methods in an orderly manner to find solutions to problems. Some of the problem-solving techniques developed and used in [[artificial intelligence]], [[computer science]], [[engineering]], [[mathematics]], or [[medicine]] are related to mental problem-solving techniques studied in [[psychology]].

== Definition ==
The term ''problem solving'' means slightly different things depending on the discipline. For instance, it is a mental process in [[psychology]] and a computerized process in [[computer science]]. There are two different types of problems, ill-defined and well-defined: different approaches are used for each. Well-defined problems have specific goals and clear expected solutions, while ill-defined problems do not. Well-defined problems allow for more initial planning than ill-defined problems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Schacter|Schacter, D.L.]] et al. (2009). Psychology, Second Edition. New York: Worth Publishers. pp. 376&lt;/ref&gt; Solving problems sometimes involves dealing with [[pragmatics]], the way that context contributes to meaning, and [[semantics]], the interpretation of the problem. The ability to understand what the goal of the problem is, and what rules could be applied, represents the key to solving the problem. Sometimes the problem requires [[abstract thinking]] or coming up with a creative solution.

=== Psychology ===
Problem solving in [[psychology]] refers to the process of finding solutions to problems encountered in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerrold R. Brandell|title=Theory and Practice in Clinical Social Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9Hm0UuFGJ0C&amp;pg=PA189|year=1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82765-0|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions to these problems are usually situation- or context-specific. The process starts with [[problem finding]] and [[problem shaping]], where the problem is discovered and simplified. The next step is to generate possible solutions and evaluate them. Finally a solution is selected to be implemented and verified. Problems have a ''goal'' to be reached and how you get there depends upon problem orientation (problem-solving coping style and skills) and systematic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;What is a problem? in S. Ian Robertson, Problem solving, Psychology Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health professionals study the human problem solving processes using methods such as [[introspection]], [[behaviorism]], [[simulation]], [[computer modeling]], and [[experiment]]. Social psychologists look into the person-environment relationship aspect of the problem and independent and interdependent problem-solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Watt | first2 = S. E. | last3 = Ramelli | first3 = M. | year = 2012 | title = Immigrants' social integration as a function of approach-avoidance orientation and problem-solving style | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 498–505 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problem solving has been defined as a higher-order [[cognitive]] process and [[intelligence|intellectual function]] that requires the modulation and control of more routine or fundamental skills.&lt;ref name="G&amp;L87"&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Goldstein | reference= Goldstein F.

London: Taylor &amp; Francis Group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem solving has two major domains: [[Mathematical problem|mathematical problem solving]] and personal problem solving. Both are seen in terms of some difficulty or barrier that is encountered.&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;Bernd Zimmermann, ''On mathematical problem solving processes and history of mathematics'', University of Jena.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research shows many different strategies and factors influence everyday problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vallacher |first1=Robin |last2=M.

Interpersonal everyday problem solving is dependent upon the individual personal motivational and contextual components. One such component is the [[Valence (psychology)|emotional valence]] of "real-world" problems and it can either impede or aid problem-solving performance. Researchers have focused on the role of emotions in problem solving ,&lt;ref name="DZurilla1971"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'Zurilla | first1 = T. J. | last2 = Goldfried | first2 = M.

=== Cognitive sciences ===
The early experimental work of the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestaltist]]s in [[Germany]] placed the beginning of problem solving study (e.g., [[Karl Duncker]] in 1935 with his book ''The psychology of productive thinking''&lt;ref name=Duncker&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Duncker| reference= Duncker, K. (1935). ''Zur Psychologie des produktiven Denkens'' [The psychology of productive thinking]. Berlin: Julius Springer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Later this experimental work continued through the 1960s and early 1970s with research conducted on relatively simple (but novel for participants) laboratory tasks of problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;For example Duncker's "X-ray" problem; Ewert &amp; Lambert's "disk" problem in 1932, later known as [[Tower of Hanoi]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Mayer| reference= Mayer, R. E. (1992). ''Thinking, problem solving, cognition''. Second edition. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of simple, novel tasks was due to the clearly defined [[optimal solution]]s and short time for solving, which made it possible for the researchers to trace participants' steps in problem-solving process. Researchers' underlying assumption was that simple tasks such as the [[Tower of Hanoi]] correspond to the main properties of "[[Reality|real world]]" problems and thus the characteristic [[cognitive process]]es within participants' attempts to solve simple problems are the same for "real world" problems too; simple problems were used for reasons of convenience and with the expectation that thought generalizations to more complex problems would become possible. Perhaps the best-known and most impressive example of this line of research is the work by [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]].&lt;ref name=Newell&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Newell| reference= Newell, A., &amp; Simon, H. A. (1972). ''Human problem solving''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=September 2018}} Other experts have shown that the principle of [[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]] improves the ability of the problem solver to make good judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/DecompositionPrinciple.pdf | title = The Use of the Decomposition Principle in Making Judgments | author = J.

=== Computer science ===

{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}

In [[computer science]] and in the part of [[artificial intelligence]] that deals with algorithms ("algorithmics"), problem solving includes techniques of  [[algorithm]]s, [[heuristic]]s and [[root cause analysis]]. In these disciplines, problem solving is part of a larger process that encompasses problem determination, [[Data deduplication|de-duplication]], analysis, diagnosis, repair, and other steps.

Other problem solving tools are linear and nonlinear programming, [[queuing systems]], and [[simulation]].&lt;ref name='MalakootiMCDM'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malakooti|first1=Behnam|title=Operations and Production Systems with Multiple Objectives|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-58537-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering ===
Problem solving is used when products or processes fail, so corrective action can be taken to prevent further [[failure]]s. It can also be applied to a product or process prior to an actual failure event&amp;mdash;when a potential problem can be predicted and analyzed, and mitigation applied so the problem never actually occurs. Techniques such as [[failure mode and effects analysis]] can be used to proactively reduce the likelihood of problems occurring.

[[Forensic engineering]] is an important technique of [[failure analysis]] that involves tracing product defects and flaws. Corrective action can then be taken to prevent further failures.

Reverse engineering attempts to discover the original problem-solving logic used in developing a product by taking it apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://litemind.com/problem-definition/|title=Einstein's Secret to Amazing Problem Solving (and 10 Specific Ways You Can Use It) - Litemind|website=litemind.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military science ===
In [[military science]], problem solving is linked to the concept of "end-states", the desired condition or situation that strategists wish to generate.&lt;ref name="USJFCOM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Commander's Handbook for Strategic Communication and Communication Strategy |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/jfcom/cc_handbook_sc_27oct2009.pdf |publisher=[[United States Joint Forces Command]], Joint Warfighting Center, Suffolk, VA |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xiii, E-2}} The ability to solve problems is important at any [[military rank]], but is highly critical at the [[command and control]] level, where it is strictly correlated to the deep understanding of qualitative and quantitative scenarios.{{clarify |date=September 2018 |reason=What scenarios?}} ''Effectiveness'' of problem solving is used to measure the result of problem solving, tied to accomplishing the goal.&lt;ref name="USJFCOM"/&gt;{{rp|IV-24}} ''Planning'' for problem-solving is the process of determining how to achieve the goal&lt;ref name="USJFCOM"/&gt;{{rp|IV-1}}

== Problem-solving strategies ==
{{See also|:Category:Problem solving skills}}
Problem-solving strategies are the steps that one would use to find the problems that are in the way to getting to one's own goal. Some refer to this as the "problem-solving cycle".&lt;ref name="Bransford1993"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bransford, J. D. |author2=Stein, B. S | year = 1993 | title = The ideal problem solver: A guide for improving thinking, learning, and creativity (2nd ed.). |location = New York | publisher = W.H. Freeman. |ref=Reference-Bransford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this cycle one will recognize the problem, define the problem, develop a strategy to fix the problem, organize the knowledge of the problem cycle, figure out the resources at the user's disposal, monitor one's progress, and evaluate the solution for accuracy. The reason it is called a cycle is that once one is completed with a problem another will usually pop up.

The first looking at those problems that only have one solution (like mathematical problems, or fact-based questions) which are grounded in psychometric intelligence. The other is socioemotional in nature and have answers that change constantly (like what's your favorite color or what you should get someone for Christmas).

==Common barriers{{anchor|Common_barriers_to_problem_solving}}==
Common barriers to problem solving are mental constructs that impede our ability to correctly solve problems. These barriers prevent people from solving problems in the most efficient manner possible. Five of the most common processes and factors that researchers have identified as barriers to problem solving are [[confirmation bias]], [[mental set]], [[functional fixedness]], unnecessary constraints, and irrelevant information.

===Confirmation bias===
{{Main|Confirmation bias}}
[[Confirmation bias]] is an unintentional bias caused by the collection and use of data in a way that favors a preconceived notion. The beliefs affected by confirmation bias do not need to have ''[[motivation]]'', the desire to defend or find substantiation for beliefs that are important to that person.&lt;ref name="Nickerson1998"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1998 |title=Confirmation bias: A ubiquitous phenomenon in many guises |url=|journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=2 |issue=2 |page=176 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175 |last1=Nickerson |first1=R. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found that professionals within scientific fields of study also experience confirmation bias. Andreas Hergovich, Reinhard Schott, and Christoph Burger's experiment conducted online, for instance, suggested that professionals within the field of psychological research are likely to view scientific studies that agree with their preconceived notions more favorably than studies that clash with their established beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Burger |year=2010 |title=Biased evaluation of abstracts depending on topic and conclusion: Further evidence of a confirmation bias within scientific psychology |journal=Current Psychology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=188–209 |doi=10.1007/s12144-010-9087-5 |last1=Hergovich |first1=Schott}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Raymond Nickerson, one can see the consequences of confirmation bias in real-life situations, which range in severity from inefficient government policies to genocide. Nickerson argued that those who killed people accused of [[Witch-hunt|witchcraft]] demonstrated confirmation bias with motivation. Researcher Michael Allen found evidence for confirmation bias with motivation in school children who worked to manipulate their science experiments in such a way that would produce favorable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Theory-led confirmation bias and experimental persona|url=|journal=Research in Science &amp; Technological Education|volume=29|issue=1|pages=107–127|doi=10.1080/02635143.2010.539973|last1=Allen|first1=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, confirmation bias does not necessarily require motivation. In 1960, [[Peter Cathcart Wason]] conducted an experiment in which participants first viewed three numbers and then created a hypothesis that proposed a rule that could have been used to create that triplet of numbers. When testing their hypotheses, participants tended to only create additional triplets of numbers that would confirm their hypotheses, and tended not to create triplets that would negate or disprove their hypotheses. Thus research also shows that people can and do work to confirm theories or ideas that do not support or engage personally significant beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1960|title=On the failure to eliminate hypotheses in a conceptual task|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=12|issue=3|pages=129–140|doi=10.1080/17470216008416717|last1=Wason|first1=P. C.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental set===
{{Main|Mental set}}
Mental set was first articulated by [[Abraham S. Luchins|Abraham Luchins]] in the 1940s and demonstrated in his well-known water jug experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Luchins, A. S. (1942). Mechanization in problem solving: The effect of Einstellung. Psychological Monographs, 54 (Whole No. 248).&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments, participants were asked to fill one jug with a specific amount of water using only other jugs (typically three) with different maximum capacities as tools. After Luchins gave his participants a set of water jug problems that could all be solved by employing a single technique, he would then give them a problem that could either be solved using that same technique or a novel and simpler method. Luchins discovered that his participants tended to use the same technique that they had become accustomed to despite the possibility of using a simpler alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Öllinger, Jones, &amp; Knoblich (2008). Investigating the effect of mental set on insight problem solving. ''Experimental Psychology',' 55(4), 269–270.''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus mental set describes one's inclination to attempt to solve problems in such a way that has proved successful in previous experiences. However, as Luchins' work revealed, such methods for finding a solution that have worked in the past may not be adequate or optimal for certain new but similar problems. Therefore, it is often necessary for people to move beyond their mental sets in order to find solutions. This was again demonstrated in [[Norman Maier]]'s 1931 experiment, which challenged participants to solve a problem by using a household object (pliers) in an unconventional manner. Maier observed that participants were often unable to view the object in a way that strayed from its typical use, a phenomenon regarded as a particular form of mental set (more specifically known as functional fixedness, which is the topic of the following section). When people cling rigidly to their mental sets, they are said to be experiencing ''fixation'', a seeming obsession or preoccupation with attempted strategies that are repeatedly unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Wiley1998"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=Expertise as mental set: The effects of domain knowledge in creative problem solving|url=|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|volume=24|issue=4|pages=716–730|doi=10.3758/bf03211392|last1=Wiley|first1=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, researcher Jennifer Wiley worked to reveal that expertise can work to create a mental set in people considered to be experts in their fields, and she gained evidence that the mental set created by expertise could lead to the development of fixation.&lt;ref name="Wiley1998" /&gt;

===Functional fixedness===
{{Main|Functional fixedness}}
Functional fixedness is a specific form of mental set and fixation, which was alluded to earlier in the Maier experiment, and furthermore it is another way in which cognitive bias can be seen throughout daily life. Tim German and Clark Barrett describe this barrier as the fixed design of an object hindering the individual's ability to see it serving other functions. In more technical terms, these researchers explained that "[s]ubjects become "fixed" on the design function of the objects, and problem solving suffers relative to control conditions in which the object's function is not demonstrated."&lt;ref&gt;German, Tim, P., and Barrett, Clark., H. Functional fixedness in a technologically sparse culture. University of California, Santa Barbara. American psychological society. 16 (1), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Functional fixedness is defined as only having that primary function of the object itself hinder the ability of it serving another purpose other than its original function. In research that highlighted the primary reasons that young children are immune to functional fixedness, it was stated that "functional fixedness...[is when]subjects are hindered in reaching the solution to a problem by their knowledge of an object's conventional function."&lt;ref&gt;German, Tim, P., Defeyter, Margaret A. [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03213010.pdf Immunity to functional fixedness in young children]. University of Essex, Colchester, England. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review. 7 (4), 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is important to note that functional fixedness can be easily expressed in commonplace situations. For instance, imagine the following situation: a man sees a bug on the floor that he wants to kill, but the only thing in his hand at the moment is a can of air freshener. If the man starts looking around for something in the house to kill the bug with instead of realizing that the can of air freshener could in fact be used not only as having its main function as to freshen the air, he is said to be experiencing functional fixedness. The man's knowledge of the can being served as purely an air freshener hindered his ability to realize that it too could have been used to serve another purpose, which in this instance was as an instrument to kill the bug. Functional fixedness can happen on multiple occasions and can cause us to have certain cognitive biases. If people only see an object as serving one primary focus than they fail to realize that the object can be used in various ways other than its intended purpose. This can in turn cause many issues with regards to problem solving. Common sense seems to be a plausible answer to functional fixedness. One could make this argument because it seems rather simple to consider possible alternative uses for an object. Perhaps using common sense to solve this issue could be the most accurate answer within this context. With the previous stated example, it seems as if it would make perfect sense to use the can of air freshener to kill the bug rather than to search for something else to serve that function but, as research shows, this is often not the case.

Functional fixedness limits the ability for people to solve problems accurately by causing one to have a very narrow way of thinking. Functional fixedness can be seen in other types of learning behaviors as well. For instance, research has discovered the presence of functional fixedness in many educational instances. Researchers Furio, Calatayud, Baracenas, and Padilla stated that "... functional fixedness may be found in learning concepts as well as in solving chemistry problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Calatayud|first2=M. L.|last3=Baracenas|first3=S|last4=Padilla|first4=O|year=2000|title=Functional fixedness and functional reduction as common sense reasonings in chemical equilibrium and in geometry and polarity of molecules. Valencia, Spain|url=|journal=Science Education|volume=84|issue=5|last1=Furio|first1=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was more emphasis on this function being seen in this type of subject and others.

There are several hypotheses in regards to how functional fixedness relates to problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1952|title=Functional fixedness as related to problem solving: A repetition of three experiments. Stanford University. California|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=44|issue=4|page=1952|doi=10.1037/h0062487|last1=Adamson|first1=Robert E}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many ways in which a person can run into problems while thinking of a particular object with having this function. If there is one way in which a person usually thinks of something rather than multiple ways then this can lead to a constraint in how the person thinks of that particular object. This can be seen as narrow minded thinking, which is defined as a way in which one is not able to see or accept certain ideas in a particular context. Functional fixedness is very closely related to this as previously mentioned. This can be done intentionally and or unintentionally, but for the most part it seems as if this process to problem solving is done in an unintentional way.

Functional fixedness can affect problem solvers in at least two particular ways. The first is with regards to time, as functional fixedness causes people to use more time than necessary to solve any given problem. Secondly, functional fixedness often causes solvers to make more attempts to solve a problem than they would have made if they were not experiencing this cognitive barrier. In the worst case, functional fixedness can completely prevent a person from realizing a solution to a problem. Functional fixedness is a commonplace occurrence, which affects the lives of many people.

===Unnecessary constraints===
Unnecessary constraints are another very common barrier that people face while attempting to problem-solve. This particular phenomenon occurs when the subject, trying to solve the problem subconsciously, places boundaries on the task at hand, which in turn forces him or her to strain to be more innovative in their thinking. The solver hits a barrier when they become fixated on only one way to solve their problem, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see anything but the method they have chosen. Typically, the solver experiences this when attempting to use a method they have already experienced success from, and they can not help but try to make it work in the present circumstances as well, even if they see that it is counterproductive.&lt;ref name="Kellogg, R. T. 2003"&gt;Kellogg, R. T. (2003). Cognitive psychology (2nd ed.). California: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Groupthink]], or taking on the mindset of the rest of the group members, can also act as an unnecessary constraint while trying to solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Cottam, Martha L., Dietz-Uhler, Beth, Mastors, Elena, &amp; Preston, &amp; Thomas. (2010). Introduction to Political Psychology (2nd ed.). New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that with everybody thinking the same thing, stopping on the same conclusions, and inhibiting themselves to think beyond this. This is very common, but the most well-known example of this barrier making itself present is in the famous example of the dot problem. In this example, there are nine dots lying on a grid three dots across and three dots running up and down. The solver is then asked to draw no more than four lines, without lifting their pen or pencil from the paper. This series of lines should connect all of the dots on the paper. Then, what typically happens is the subject creates an assumption in their mind that they must connect the dots without letting his or her pen or pencil go outside of the square of dots. Standardized procedures like this can often bring mentally invented constraints of this kind,&lt;ref&gt;Meloy, J. R. (1998). The Psychology of Stalking, Clinical and Forensic Perspectives (2nd ed.). London, England: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers have found a 0% correct solution rate in the time allotted for the task to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ormerod|first2=T.C.|last3=Chronicle|first3=E.P.|year=2001|title=Information-processing and insight: A process model of performance on the nine-dot and related problems|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|volume=27|issue=1|pages=176–201|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.27.1.176|last1=MacGregor|first1=J.N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imposed constraint inhibits the solver to think beyond the bounds of the dots. It is from this phenomenon that the expression "think outside the box" is derived.&lt;ref name="Weiten, Wayne 2011"&gt;Weiten, Wayne. (2011). Psychology: themes and variations (8th ed.). California: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem can be quickly solved with a dawning of realization, or ''insight''. A few minutes of struggling over a problem can bring these sudden insights, where the solver quickly sees the solution clearly. Problems such as this are most typically solved via insight and can be very difficult for the subject depending on either how they have structured the problem in their minds, how they draw on their past experiences, and how much they juggle this information in their working memories&lt;ref name="Weiten, Wayne 2011" /&gt; In the case of the nine-dot example, the solver has already been structured incorrectly in their minds because of the constraint that they have placed upon the solution. In addition to this, people experience struggles when they try to compare the problem to their prior knowledge, and they think they must keep their lines within the dots and not go beyond. They do this because trying to envision the dots connected outside of the basic square puts a strain on their working memory.&lt;ref name="Weiten, Wayne 2011" /&gt;

Luckily, the solution to the problem becomes obvious as insight occurs following incremental movements made toward the solution. These tiny movements happen without the solver knowing. Then when the insight is realized fully, the "aha" moment happens for the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Novick, L. R., &amp; Bassok, M. (2005). Problem solving. In K. J. Holyoak &amp; R. G. Morrison (Eds.), Cambridge handbook of thinking and reasoning (Ch. 14, pp. 321-349). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These moments of insight can take a long while to manifest or not so long at other times, but the way that the solution is arrived at after toiling over these barriers stays the same.

===Irrelevant information===
Irrelevant information is information presented within a problem that is unrelated or unimportant to the specific problem.&lt;ref name="Kellogg, R. T. 2003" /&gt; Within the specific context of the problem, irrelevant information would serve no purpose in helping solve that particular problem. Often ''irrelevant information'' is detrimental to the problem solving process. It is a common barrier that many people have trouble getting through, especially if they are not aware of it. ''Irrelevant information'' makes solving otherwise relatively simple problems much harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=From walls to windows: Using barriers as pathways to insightful solutions|url=|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|volume=44|issue=3|pages=143–167|doi=10.1002/j.2162-6057.2010.tb01331.x|last1=Walinga|first1=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: "Fifteen percent of the people in Topeka have unlisted telephone numbers. You select 200 names at random from the Topeka phone book. How many of these people have unlisted phone numbers?"&lt;ref&gt;Weiten, Wayne. (2011). Psychology: themes and variations (8th ed.) California: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The people that are not listed in the phone book would not be among the 200 names you selected. The individuals looking at this task would have naturally wanted to use the 15% given to them in the problem. They see that there is information present and they immediately think that it needs to be used. This of course is not true. These kinds of questions are often used to test students taking aptitude tests or cognitive evaluations.&lt;ref name="Walinga, Jennifer 2011"&gt;Walinga, Jennifer, Cunningham, J. Barton, &amp; MacGregor, James N. (2011). Training insight problem solving through focus on barriers and assumptions. The Journal of Creative Behavior.&lt;/ref&gt; They aren't meant to be difficult but they are meant to require thinking that is not necessarily common. ''Irrelevant Information'' is commonly represented in math problems, word problems specifically, where numerical information is put for the purpose of challenging the individual.

One reason irrelevant information is so effective at keeping a person off topic and away from the relevant information, is in how it is represented.&lt;ref name="Walinga, Jennifer 2011" /&gt; The way information is represented can make a vast difference in how difficult the problem is to be overcome. Whether a problem is represented visually, verbally, spatially, or mathematically, irrelevant information can have a profound effect on how long a problem takes to be solved; or if it's even possible. The Buddhist monk problem is a classic example of irrelevant information and how it can be represented in different ways:

::A Buddhist monk begins at dawn one day walking up a mountain, reaches the top at sunset, meditates at the top for several days until one dawn when he begins to walk back to the foot of the mountain, which he reaches at sunset. Making no assumptions about his starting or stopping or about his pace during the trips, prove that there is a place on the path which he occupies at the same hour of the day on the two separate journeys.

This problem is near impossible to solve because of how the information is represented. Because it is written out in a way that represents the information verbally, it causes us to try and create a mental image of the paragraph. This is often very difficult to do especially with all the ''irrelevant information'' involved in the question. This example is made much easier to understand when the paragraph is represented visually. Now if the same problem was asked, but it was also accompanied by a corresponding graph, it would be far easier to answer this question; ''irrelevant information'' no longer serves as a road block. By representing the problem visually, there are no difficult words to understand or scenarios to imagine. The visual representation of this problem has removed the difficulty of solving it.

These types of representations are often used to make difficult problems easier.&lt;ref&gt;Vlamings, Petra H. J. M., Hare, Brian, &amp; Call, Joseph. Reaching around barriers: The performance of great apes and 3-5-year-old children. ''Animal Cognition'', 13, 273-285. {{DOI|10.1007/s10071-009-0265-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used on tests as a strategy to remove ''Irrelevant Information,'' which is one of the most common forms of barriers when discussing the issues of problem solving.&lt;ref name="Kellogg, R. T. 2003" /&gt; Identifying crucial information presented in a problem and then being able to correctly identify its usefulness is essential. Being aware of ''irrelevant information'' is the first step in overcoming this common barrier.

=== Dreaming: problem-solving without waking consciousness ===

Problem solving can also occur without waking consciousness.  There are many reports of scientists and engineers who solved problems in their dreams.  [[Elias Howe]], inventor of the sewing machine, figured out the structure of the bobbin from a dream.&lt;ref&gt;Kaempffert, W. (1924) ''A Popular History of American Invention.'' New York: Scribners.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemist [[August Kekulé]] was considering how benzene arranged its six carbon and hydrogen atoms. Thinking about the problem, he dozed off, and dreamt of dancing atoms that fell into a snakelike pattern, which led him to discover the benzene ring. As Kekulé wrote in his diary, "One of the snakes seized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes.  As if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;Kekulé, A. (1890) Benzolfest-Rede. ''Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft'', 23: 1302-1311. Trans. Benfey, O., (1958) Kekulé and the birth of the structural theory of organic chemistry in 1858. ''Journal of Chemical Education'', 35: 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

There also are empirical studies of how people can think consciously about a problem before going to sleep, and then solve the problem with a dream image.  Dream researcher [[William C. Dement]] told his undergraduate class of 500 students that he wanted them to think about an infinite series, whose first elements were OTTFF, to see if they could deduce the principle behind it and to say what the next elements of the series would be.&lt;ref name="Dement 1972"&gt;Dement, W.C. (1972). ''Some Must Watch While Some Just Sleep''. New York: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;  He asked them to think about this problem every night for 15 minutes before going to sleep and to write down any dreams that they then had.  They were instructed to think about the problem again for 15 minutes when they awakened in the morning.

The sequence OTTFF is the first letters of the numbers: one, two, three, four, five. The next five elements of the series are SSENT (six, seven, eight, nine, ten). Some of the students solved the puzzle by reflecting on their dreams. One example was a student who reported the following dream:&lt;ref name="Dement 1972"/&gt;
 
{{quote|I was standing in an art gallery, looking at the paintings on the wall. As I walked down the hall, I began to count the paintings: one, two, three, four, five. As I came to the sixth and seventh, the paintings had been ripped from their frames. I stared at the empty frames with a peculiar feeling that some mystery was about to be solved. Suddenly I realized that the sixth and seventh spaces were the solution to the problem!}}

With more than 500 undergraduate students, 87 dreams were judged to be related to the problems students were assigned (53 directly related and 34 indirectly related). Yet of the people who had dreams that apparently solved the problem, only seven were actually able to consciously know the solution. The rest (46 out of 53) thought they did not know the solution.

Mark Blechner conducted this experiment and obtained results similar to Dement's.&lt;ref name="Blechner 2018"&gt;Blechner, M. J. (2018) ''The Mindbrain and Dreams: An Exploration of Dreaming, Thinking, and Artistic Creation''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that while trying to solve the problem, people had dreams in which the solution appeared to be obvious from the dream, but it was rare for the dreamers to realize how their dreams had solved the puzzle. Coaxing or hints did not get them to realize it, although once they heard the solution, they recognized how their dream had solved it. For example, one person dreamed:&lt;ref name="Blechner 2018"/&gt;

{{quote|There is a big clock. You can see the movement. The big hand of the clock was on the number six. You could see it move up, number by number, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. The dream focused on the small parts of the machinery. You could see the gears inside.}}

In the dream, the person counted out the next elements of the series{{snd}} six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve{{snd}} yet he did not realize that this was the solution of the problem. His sleeping mindbrain solved the problem, but his waking mindbrain was not aware how.

[[Albert Einstein]] believed that much problem solving goes on unconsciously, and the person must then figure out and formulate consciously what the mindbrain has already solved. He believed this was his process in formulating the theory of relativity: "The creator of the problem possesses the solution."&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erika O. (1998). Lost and found half a century later: Letters by Freud and Einstein. ''American Psychologist'', 53: 1195-1198.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein said that he did his problem-solving without words, mostly in images. "The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' reproduced and combined."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A. (1994) ''Ideas and Opinions''. New York: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive sciences: two schools ==
In [[cognitive sciences]], researchers' realization that problem-solving processes differ across knowledge domains and across levels of expertise (e.g. Sternberg, 1995) and that, consequently, findings obtained in the laboratory cannot necessarily generalize to problem-solving situations outside the laboratory, has led to an emphasis on real-world problem solving since the 1990s. This emphasis has been expressed quite differently in North America and Europe, however. Whereas North American research has typically concentrated on studying problem solving in separate, natural knowledge domains, much of the European research has focused on novel, complex problems, and has been performed with computerized scenarios (see Funke, 1991, for an overview).

=== Europe ===
In Europe, two main approaches have surfaced, one initiated by [[Donald Broadbent]] (1977; see [[#Reference-Berry|Berry &amp; Broadbent, 1995]]) in the United Kingdom and the other one by [[Dietrich Dörner]] (1975, 1985; see [[#Reference-Dörner1995|Dörner &amp; Wearing, 1995]]) in Germany. The two approaches share an emphasis on relatively complex, semantically rich, computerized laboratory tasks, constructed to resemble real-life problems. The approaches differ somewhat in their theoretical goals and methodology, however. The tradition initiated by Broadbent emphasizes the distinction between cognitive problem-solving processes that operate under awareness versus outside of awareness, and typically employs mathematically well-defined computerized systems. The tradition initiated by Dörner, on the other hand, has an interest in the interplay of the cognitive, motivational, and social components of problem solving, and utilizes very complex computerized scenarios that contain up to 2,000 highly interconnected variables (e.g., [[#Reference-Dörner1983|Dörner, Kreuzig, Reither &amp; Stäudel's 1983]] LOHHAUSEN project; [[#Reference-Ringelband|Ringelband, Misiak &amp; Kluwe, 1990]]). [[#Reference-Buchner1995|Buchner (1995)]] describes the two traditions in detail.

=== North America ===
In North America, initiated by the work of [[Herbert A. Simon]] on "learning by doing" in [[semantic]]ally rich domains,&lt;ref name="Anzai1979"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anzai, K. |author2=Simon, H. A. |title=The theory of learning by doing |journal=Psychological Review |volume=86 |pages=124–140 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.86.2.124 |year=1979 |pmid=493441 |issue=2 |ref=Reference-Anzai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhaskar1977"&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Bhaskar| reference= Bhaskar, R., &amp; Simon, H. A. (1977). Problem solving in semantically rich domains: An example from engineering thermodynamics. ''Cognitive Science'', 1, 193-215.}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers began to investigate problem solving separately in different natural [[knowledge domain]]s{{snd}} such as physics, writing, or [[chess]] playing{{snd}} thus relinquishing their attempts to extract a global theory of problem solving (e.g. Sternberg &amp; Frensch, 1991). Instead, these researchers have frequently focused on the development of problem solving within a certain domain, that is on the development of [[expertise]]; [[#Reference-Chase|Chase &amp; Simon, 1973]]; [[#Reference-Chi|Chi, Feltovich &amp; Glaser, 1981]]).&lt;ref name="Anderson1985"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson, J.

== Characteristics of complex problems ==

As elucidated by [[Dietrich Dörner]] and later expanded upon by [[:de:Joachim Funke|Joachim Funke]], complex problems have some typical characteristics that can be summarized as follows:{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

*[[Complexity]] (large numbers of items, interrelations and decisions)
**[[enumerability]]
**[[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]
**[[:wikt:connectivity|connectivity]] (hierarchy relation, communication relation, allocation relation)
*[[Dynamics (physics)|Dynamics]] (time considerations)
**temporal constraints
**temporal sensitivity
**phase effects
**dynamic [[unpredictability]]
*Intransparency (lack of clarity of the situation)
**commencement opacity
**continuation opacity
*[[Polytely]] (multiple goals)
**inexpressiveness
**opposition
**transience

==Collective problem solving==
{{See also|Crowdsolving|Collective action|Collaborative intelligence|Mass collaboration|Collective wisdom|The Wisdom of Crowds|Distributed knowledge|Online participation|Group decision-making}}
Problem solving is applied on many different levels − from the individual to the civilizational. Collective problem solving refers to problem solving performed collectively.

[[Social issue]]s and [[global issue]]s can typically only be solved collectively.

It has been noted that the complexity of contemporary problems has exceeded the cognitive capacity of any individual and requires different but complementary expertise and collective problem solving ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hung|first1=Woei|title=Team-based complex problem solving: a collective cognition perspective|journal=Educational Technology Research and Development|date=24 April 2013|volume=61|issue=3|pages=365–384|doi=10.1007/s11423-013-9296-3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-013-9296-3|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collective intelligence]] is shared or group intelligence that emerges from the [[collaboration]], collective efforts, and competition of many individuals.

In a 1962 research report, [[Douglas Engelbart]] linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a multiplier effect in group problem solving: "Three people working together in this augmented mode [would] seem to be more than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone".&lt;ref&gt;Engelbart, Douglas (1962) [http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b9 Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework] - section on Team Cooperation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Jenkins]], a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and [[participatory culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | last=Flew | first=Terry | year= 2008 | title=New Media: an introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating "whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities contributes to the development of such skills.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labweb.education.wisc.edu/curric606/readings/Jenkins2002.pdf|title=INTERACTIVE AUDIENCES? THE 'COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE' OF MEDIA FANS|last=Henry|first=Jenkins|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collective impact]] is the commitment of a group of actors from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem, using a structured form of collaboration.

After [[World War II]] the [[UN]], the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods organization]] and the [[WTO]] were created; collective problem solving on the international level crystallized around these three types of organizations from the 1980s onward. As these global institutions remain state-like or state-centric it has been called unsurprising that these continue state-like or state-centric approaches to collective problem-solving rather than alternative ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Park|first1=Jacob|last2=Conca|first2=Ken|last3=Conca|first3=Professor of International Relations Ken|last4=Finger|first4=Matthias|title=The Crisis of Global Environmental Governance: Towards a New Political Economy of Sustainability|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134059829|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrr3K50r144C&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=29 January 2017|language=en|date=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=CtXvBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189--&gt;

[[Crowdsourcing]] is a process of accumulating the ideas, thoughts or information from many independent participants, with aim to find the best solution for a given challenge. Modern [[information technologies]] allow for massive number of subjects to be involved as well as systems of managing these suggestions that provide good results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guazzini|first1=Andrea|last2=Vilone|first2=Daniele|last3=Donati|first3=Camillo|last4=Nardi|first4=Annalisa|last5=Levnajić|first5=Zoran|title=Modeling crowdsourcing as collective problem solving|journal=Scientific Reports|date=10 November 2015|volume=5|pages=16557|doi=10.1038/srep16557|pmid=26552943|pmc=4639727|accessdate=29 January 2017|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16557}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Internet]] a new capacity for collective, including planetary-scale, problem solving was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stefanovitch|first1=Nicolas|last2=Alshamsi|first2=Aamena|last3=Cebrian|first3=Manuel|last4=Rahwan|first4=Iyad|title=Error and attack tolerance of collective problem solving: The DARPA Shredder Challenge|journal=EPJ Data Science|date=30 September 2014|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angkor. |url=http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/M&amp;PI_15-MAI-91.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently developed further by [[Max Tegmark]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark, Max [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9709032/ The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Many Worlds or Many Words?], 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to distinguish between the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics and the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]] by means of a variation of the [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], from the cat's point of view. '''Quantum immortality''' refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide regardless of the odds.&lt;ref name="mit_edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html#immortality|title=Quantum immortality|last=Tegmark|first=Max|date=November 1998|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Lynch recalls that [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]] took great delight in paradoxes such as the [[unexpected hanging paradox|unexpected hanging]]. Everett did not mention quantum suicide or quantum immortality in writing, but his work was intended as a solution to the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Lynch said "Everett firmly believed that his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality: his consciousness, he argued, is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to death";&lt;ref&gt;See Eugene Shikhovtsev's Biography of Everett: [http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/everett.html#e23 Keith Lynch remembers 1979–1980]&lt;/ref&gt; Tegmark explains, however, that life and death situations do not normally hinge upon a sequence of binary quantum events like those in the thought experiment.&lt;ref name="mit_edu"/&gt;

==Thought experiment==
The quantum suicide thought experiment involves the same apparatus as [[Schrödinger's cat]] – a box which kills the occupant in a given time frame with probability one half due to [[quantum uncertainty]].&lt;ref&gt;The simplest example of this is a weapon triggered by a [[two level system]]. Schrödinger described his as a radioactive decay detector while Moravec's was a device measuring the [[spin (physics)|spin value]] of protons.&lt;/ref&gt; The only difference is to have the experimenter recording observations be the one inside the box. The significance of this is that someone whose life or death depends on a [[qubit]] can distinguish between [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]. By definition, fixed observers cannot.

At the start of the first iteration, under both interpretations, the probability of surviving the experiment is 50%, as given by the squared norm of the [[wave function]]. At the start of the second iteration, assuming the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is true, the [[Wave function collapse|wave function has already collapsed]]; thus, since the experimenter is already dead, there is a 0% chance of survival for any further iterations. However, if the [[many-worlds interpretation]] is true, a superposition of the live experimenter ''necessarily'' exists (as also does the one who dies). Now, barring the possibility of [[afterlife|life after death]], after every iteration only one of the two experimenter superpositions – the live one – is capable of having any sort of conscious experience. Putting aside the philosophical problems associated with [[Identity (philosophy)|individual identity and its persistence]], we may assert that, under the many-worlds interpretation, the experimenter, or at least a version of them, continues to exist through all of their superpositions where the outcome of the experiment is that they live. In other words, we may say that a version of the experimenter survives all iterations of the experiment, whichever its number. Since the superpositions where the experimenter lives occur by quantum necessity (again, under the many-worlds interpretation), it follows that their survival, after any realizable number of iterations, is physically necessary; hence, the notion of quantum ''immortality''.

A version of the experimenter surviving stands in stark contrast to the implications of the Copenhagen interpretation, according to which, although the survival outcome is possible in every iteration, its probability tends towards zero as the number of iterations increases. Due to the many-worlds interpretation, the above scenario has the opposite property: the probability of a version of the experimenter living is necessarily one for any number of iterations.

==Real-world feasibility==
In response to questions about "subjective immortality", [[Max Tegmark]] made some brief comments: He acknowledged the argument that "everyone will be immortal" may follow if a survivor outcome is possible for all life-threatening events. The flaw in that argument, he suggests, is that dying is rarely a binary event; it is a progressive process. The quantum suicide thought experiment attempts to isolate all possible outcomes for the duration of the thought experiment. That isolation delays [[decoherence]] in such a way that the subjective experience of the superposition is illustrated. It is only within the confines of such an abstract quantum scenario that an observer finds they defy all odds.

Physicist [[David Deutsch]], though a proponent of the MWI, states regarding quantum suicide that "that way of applying probabilities does not follow directly from quantum theory, as the usual one does. It requires an additional assumption, namely that when making decisions one should ignore the histories in which the decision-maker is absent....[M]y guess is that the assumption is false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=David |year=2011 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |publisher=Penguin Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tegmark also believes experimenters will only expect a normal probability of survival, not immortality. The experimenter's [[probability amplitude]] in the wavefunction decreases significantly, meaning they exist with a much lower measure than they had before. Per the [[anthropic principle]], a person is less likely to find themselves in a world where they are less likely to exist, that is, a world with a lower measure has a lower probability of being observed. Therefore, the experimenter will have a lower probability of observing a world in which they survive than the world in which they set up the experiment.&lt;ref name="Tegmark2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tegmark |first=Max |year=2014 |title=Our Mathematical Universe |publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same problem of reduced measure was pointed out by [[Lev Vaidman]] in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''race of the future''' is a theoretical composite [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] which will result from ongoing [[racial admixture]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Conniff, "[http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2012_05/feature_eugenics.html God and White Men at Yale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028042755/http://yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2012_05/feature_eugenics.html |date=28 October 2012 }}", ''Yale Alumni Magazine'', May/June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] in 1925 in ''Practical Idealism'' predicted: "The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]-[[Negroid]] race of the future will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;''Praktischer Idealismus'', Wien/Leipzig 1925, pages 20, 23, 50&lt;/ref&gt; The same scenario had been envisaged, with rather less enthusiasm, by [[Madison Grant]] in his 1916 ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', calling for a [[eugenics]] program to prevent this development, and in a similar ideological context in [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]'' in 1920.

==History==
[[Gottfried de Purucker]] was an author and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] who, when asked about [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] in 1930, said "In answering your question very briefly, I can say simply this, that the time has not come when I would willingly suggest intermarriage; but I am in honesty bound to qualify that by saying that the race of the future will be a composite, composed of the many different races on earth today. Let us also remember that all men are ultimately of one blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/dialogue/dial13.htm|title=KTMG Papers: Thirteen|work=The Dialogues of G. de Purucker|publisher=Theosophical University Press|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''miscegenation'' was used in an anonymous propaganda pamphlet printed in [[New York City]] in late 1863, entitled [[Miscegenation hoax|''Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro''.]] The pamphlet purported to be in favor of [[interbreeding]] of whites and [[Black people|blacks]] until the races were indistinguishably mixed as [[mulatto]]s, claiming that this was the goal of the [[United States Republican Party]]. The real authors were [[David Goodman Croly]], managing editor of the ''[[New York World]]'', a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] paper, and [[George Wakeman]], a ''World'' reporter. The pamphlet soon was exposed as an attempt to discredit the Republicans, the [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] administration, and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] by exploiting the fears and racial biases common among whites. Nonetheless, this pamphlet and variations on it were reprinted widely in communities on both sides of the [[American Civil War]] by opponents of Republicans.

The British colony of [[Maryland]] was the first to pass an anti-miscegenation law (1664).&lt;ref name="Pascoe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hnn.us/articles/4708.html|title=Why the Ugly Rhetoric Against Gay Marriage Is Familiar to this Historian of Miscegenation | last=Pascoe | first=Peggy | authorlink=Peggy Pascoe | date=2004-04-19 | work=History News Network | publisher=George Mason University | accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century, many American states passed [[anti-miscegenation laws]], often based on controversial interpretations of the [[Bible]], particularly the story of [[Phinehas, son of Eleazar|Phinehas]]. Typically a [[felony]], these laws prohibited the solemnization of weddings between persons of different races and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of [[adultery]] or [[fornication]] would be brought against them instead. Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii, and the federal District of Columbia did not pass anti-miscegenation laws. In 1883, the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws was upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=106&amp;invol=583 Pace v. Alabama]''.

In 1948, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] in ''[[Perez v. Sharp]]'' effectively repealed the California anti-miscegenation statutes, thereby making California the first state in the twentieth century to do so. In 1967, the remaining anti-miscegenation laws in 16 states were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.

In [[Brazil]], as much as 44% of the population classify themselves as [[Pardo Brazilians|Pardo]] (multiracial).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl.asp?c=262&amp;i=P&amp;nome=on&amp;notarodape=on&amp;tab=262&amp;unit=0&amp;pov=3&amp;opc1=1&amp;poc2=1&amp;OpcTipoNivt=1&amp;opn1=2&amp;nivt=0&amp;orc86=3&amp;poc1=1&amp;orp=6&amp;qtu3=27&amp;opv=1&amp;poc86=2&amp;sec1=0&amp;opc2=1&amp;pop=1&amp;opn2=0&amp;orv=2&amp;orc2=5&amp;qtu2=5&amp;sev=93&amp;sev=1000093&amp;opc86=1&amp;sec2=0&amp;opp=1&amp;opn3=0&amp;sec86=0&amp;sec86=2776&amp;sec86=2777&amp;sec86=2779&amp;sec86=2778&amp;sec86=2780&amp;sec86=2781&amp;ascendente=on&amp;sep=43344&amp;orn=1&amp;qtu7=9&amp;orc1=4&amp;qtu1=1&amp;cabec=on&amp;pon=1&amp;OpcCara=44&amp;proc=1&amp;opn7=0&amp;decm=99 "População residente, por cor ou raça, situação e sexo."] IBGE - PNAD.&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically a mix of White, Black and Native American.

===United States===
[[William Quan Judge]] was a 19th century theosophist who wrote in his book [http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/aechoes.htm Echoes from the Orient]; "We are preparing here in America a new race which will exhibit the perfection of the glories that I said were being slowly brought to the surface from the long forgotten past ... Here, and nowhere else, are to be found men and women of every race living together, being governed together, attacking nature and the problems of life together, and bringing forth children who combine, each one, two races. This process will go on until in the course of many generations there will be produced on the American continents an entirely new race; new bodies; new orders of intellect; new powers of the mind."

In the United States, the proportion of [[multiracial American]] children is growing. Interracial partnerships are rising, as are transracial [[adoption]]s. In 1990, about 14% of 18- and 19-year-olds, 12% of 20- and 21-year-olds, and 7% of 34- and 35-year-olds were involved in interracial [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]s (Joyner and Kao, 2005). &lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov05/interracial.couples.ssl.html|title=Interracial relationships are on the increase in U.S., but decline with age, Cornell study finds|last=Lang|first=Susan S.|date=2005-11-02|work=Chronicle Online|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 in the United States, 15% of new marriages were interracial, with 9% of whites, 17% of blacks, 26% of Hispanics and 28% of Asians married outside of their race. Of the 275,000 new interracial marriages in 2010, 43% were white-[[mestizo]], 14.4% were white-Asian, 11.9% were white-black and the rest were other combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204880404577226981780914906?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories|title=More Marriages Cross Race, Ethnicity Lines|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other views==
According to [[anthropologist]] [[Henry Harpending]], human populations are actually diverging from one another, as opposed to melding into a single population. Harpending stated "Human races are evolving away from each other ... Genes are evolving fast in Europe, Asia and Africa, but almost all of these are unique to their continent of origin. We are getting less alike, not merging into a single, mixed humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news116529402.html|title=Are humans evolving faster?

In [[physics]] and [[astronomy]], the '''Reissner&amp;ndash;Nordström metric''' is a [[Static spacetime|static solution]] to the [[Einstein–Maxwell equations|Einstein–Maxwell field equations]], which corresponds to the gravitational field of a charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass ''M''.

The metric was discovered by [[Hans Reissner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reissner | first=H. | date=1916 | title=''Über die Eigengravitation des elektrischen Feldes nach der Einsteinschen Theorie'' | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=50 | pages=106–120 | doi=10.1002/andp.19163550905 | bibcode=1916AnP...355..106R | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Weyl]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weyl | first=H. | date=1917 | title=''Zur Gravitationstheorie'' | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=54 | pages=117–145 | doi=10.1002/andp.19173591804  | language=German| bibcode=1917AnP...359..117W }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gunnar Nordström]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nordström | first=G. | date=1918 | title=''On the Energy of the Gravitational Field in Einstein's Theory'' | journal=Verhandl. Koninkl. Ned. Akad. Wetenschap., Afdel. Natuurk., Amsterdam | volume=26 | pages=1201–1208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Barker Jeffery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jeffery | first=G. B. | date=1921 | title=''The field of an electron on Einstein’s theory of gravitation'' | journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A | volume=99 | pages=123–134 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1921.0028 | bibcode=1921RSPSA..99..123J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The metric==
In [[spherical coordinates]] (''t'', ''r'', θ, φ), the [[line element]] for the Reissner&amp;ndash;Nordström metric is

:&lt;math&gt;
{\rm d}s^2 = 
\left( 1 - \frac{r_{\rm s}}{r} + \frac{r_{\rm Q}^2}{r^2} \right) c^2\, {\rm d}t^2 -\left( 1 - \frac{r_{\rm s}}{r} + \frac{r_{\rm Q}^2}{r^2} \right)^{-1} {\rm d}r^2 - r^2\, {\rm d}\Omega^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], ''t'' is the time coordinate (measured by a stationary clock at infinity), ''r'' is the radial coordinate, d''Ω''² is a 2-sphere defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
{\rm d}\Omega^2={\rm d}\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \ {\rm d}\phi^2
&lt;/math&gt;

''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the body given by
:&lt;math&gt;
r_{\rm s} = \frac{2GM}{c^2},
&lt;/math&gt;
and ''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a characteristic length scale given by
:&lt;math&gt;
r_{\rm Q}^{2} = \frac{Q^2 G}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} c^4}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Here 1/4πε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Coulomb's constant|Coulomb force constant]] ''K''.

The total mass of the central body and its irreducible mass are related by&lt;ref&gt;[[Thibault Damour]]: [http://lapth.cnrs.fr/pg-nomin/chardon/IRAP_PhD/BlackHolesNice2012.pdf#page=11 Black Holes: Energetics and Thermodynamics], S. 11 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quadir"&gt;Ashgar Quadir: ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983PhLA...99..419Q The Reissner Nordström Repulsion]''&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\rm irr}= \frac{c^2}{G} \sqrt{\frac{r_{+}^2}{2}} \ \to \ M=\frac{Q ^2 K}{4 G M_{\rm irr}}+M_{\rm irr}&lt;/math&gt;.

The difference between ''M'' and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the [[mass–energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]], which makes the [[Electric field#Energy in the electric field|electric field energy]] also contribute to the total mass.

In the limit that the charge ''Q'' (or equivalently, the length-scale ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;) goes to zero, one recovers the [[Schwarzschild metric]].  The classical Newtonian theory of gravity may then be recovered in the limit as the ratio ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''r'' goes to zero. In that limit that both ''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;''/''r'' and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''r'' go to zero, the metric becomes the [[Minkowski metric]] for [[special relativity]].

In practice, the ratio ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''r'' is often extremely small.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius of the [[Earth]] is roughly 9&amp;nbsp;[[millimeter|mm]] (3/8&amp;nbsp;[[inch]]), whereas a [[satellite]] in a [[geosynchronous orbit]] has a radius ''r'' that is roughly four billion times larger, at 42,164&amp;nbsp;[[kilometer|km]] (26,200&amp;nbsp;[[mile]]s).  Even at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The ratio only becomes large close to [[black hole]]s and other ultra-dense objects such as [[neutron star]]s.

==Charged black holes==
Although charged black holes with ''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≪ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; are similar to the [[Schwarzschild black hole]], they have two horizons: the [[event horizon]] and an internal [[Cauchy horizon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chandrasekhar |first=S. |authorlink=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar |title=The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes |date=1998 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19850370-9 |edition=Reprinted |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/Relativity/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198503705 |accessdate=13 May 2013 |page=205 |quote=And finally, the fact that the Reissner–Nordström solution has two horizons, an external event horizon and an internal 'Cauchy horizon,' provides a convenient bridge to the study of the Kerr solution in the subsequent chapters. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429125834/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/Relativity/?view=usa |archivedate=29 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the Schwarzschild metric, the event horizons for the spacetime are located where the metric component ''g&lt;sup&gt;rr&lt;/sup&gt;'' diverges; that is, where

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = \frac{1}{g^{rr}} = 1 - \frac{r_{\rm s}}{r} + \frac{r_{\rm Q}^2}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation has two solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;
r_\pm = \frac{1}{2}\left(r_{\rm s} \pm \sqrt{r_{\rm s}^2 - 4r_{\rm Q}^2}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

These concentric [[event horizon]]s become [[Degenerate energy level|degenerate]] for 2''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;= ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, which corresponds to an [[extremal black hole]]. Black holes with 2''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; can not exist in nature because if the charge is greater than the mass there can be no physical event horizon&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;Andrew Hamilton: ''[http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/rn.html The Reissner Nordström Geometry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707053358/http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/rn.html |date=2007-07-07 }}'' (Casa Colorado)&lt;/ref&gt; (the term under the square root becomes negative).  Objects with a charge greater than their mass can exist in nature, but they can not collapse down to a black hole, and if they could, they would display a [[naked singularity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Brandon Carter|Carter, Brandon]].  [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v174/i5/p1559_1 ''Global Structure of the Kerr Family of Gravitational Fields'',] ''Physical Review'', page 174&lt;/ref&gt; Theories with [[supersymmetry]] usually guarantee that such "superextremal" black holes cannot exist.

The [[electromagnetic potential]] is

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha} = \left(Q/r, 0, 0, 0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

If magnetic monopoles are included in the theory, then a generalization to include magnetic charge ''P'' is obtained by replacing ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the metric and including the term ''P''cos&amp;thinsp;θ&amp;nbsp;''dφ'' in the electromagnetic potential.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}

== Gravitational time dilation ==

The [[gravitational time dilation]] in the vicinity of the central body is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\varsigma = \sqrt{|g^{t t}|} = \sqrt{\frac{r^2}{Q^2+(r-2 M) r}}&lt;/math&gt;

which relates to the local radial escape-velocity of a neutral particle

:&lt;math&gt;v_{\rm esc}=\frac{\sqrt{\varsigma^2-1}}{\varsigma}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Christoffel symbols ==

The [[Christoffel symbols]]

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^i_{j k} = \sum_{s=0}^3 \ \frac{g^{is}}{2} \left(\frac{\partial g_{js}}{\partial x^k}+\frac{\partial g_{sk}}{\partial x^j}-\frac{\partial g_{jk}}{\partial x^s}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with the indicies

:&lt;math&gt;\{ 0, \ 1, \ 2, \ 3 \} \to \{ t, \ r, \ \theta, \ \phi \}&lt;/math&gt;

give the nonvanishing expressions

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^0_{1 0} = \frac{M r+Q^2}{r \left(r (r-2 M)-Q^2\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^1_{0 0} = \frac{\left(M r+Q^2\right) \left(r (2 M-r)+Q^2\right)}{r^5}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^1_{1 1} = \frac{M r+Q^2}{2 M r^2+Q^2 r-r^3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^1_{2 2} = 2 M-\frac{Q^2}{r}+r&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^1_{3 3} = \frac{\sin ^2 \theta \left(r (r-2 M)-Q^2\right)}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^2_{2 1} = r^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^2_{3 3} = - \sin \theta \cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^3_{3 1} = r^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^3_{3 2} = \cot \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Given the Christoffel symbols, one can compute the geodesics of a test-particle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Susskind]]: [http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/general-relativity/2012/fall/lecture-4 ''The Theoretical Minimum: Geodesics and Gravity''], (''General Relativity Lecture 4'', timestamp: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdnLcYNdTzE&amp;t=34m18s&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL9peWTxCcrBLLE89-Pwab3Qc1uoaKEH0e 34m18s])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eva Hackmann, Hongxiao Xu: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2142.pdf#page=4 ''Charged particle motion in Kerr–Newmann space-times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equations of motion ==

Because of the [[Spherically symmetric spacetime|spherical symmetry]] of the metric, the coordinate system can always be aligned in a way that the motion of a test-particle is confined to a plane, so for brevity and without restriction of generality we further use ''Ω'' instead of ''θ'' and ''φ''. In dimensionless natural units of ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 the motion of an electrically charged particle with the charge ''q'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot x^i = - \sum_{j=0}^3 \ \sum_{k=0}^3 \ \Gamma^i_{j k} \ {\dot x^j} \ {\dot x^k} + q \ {F^{i k}} \ {\dot x_k} &lt;/math&gt;

which gives

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot t = \frac{\dot{r} \ (q \ r \ Q +2 (Q^2-r) \dot{t})}{r ((r-2) r+Q ^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot r = \frac{((r-2) \ r+Q^2) (q \ r \ Q  \ \dot{t}+r^4 \dot{\Omega}^2+(Q^2-r) \ \dot{t}^2)}{r^5}+\frac{(r-Q^2) \dot{r}^2}{r \ ((r-2) \ r+Q^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \Omega = -\frac{2 \ \dot{\Omega} \ \dot{r}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

The total [[time dilation]] between the test-particle and an observer at infinity is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot t= \frac{q \  Q  \ r^3 + E \ r^4}{r^2 \ (r^2-2 r+Q^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

The first derivatives &lt;math&gt;\dot x^i&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] components of the local 3-velocity &lt;math&gt;v^i&lt;/math&gt; are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\dot x^i = \frac{v^i}{\sqrt{(1-v^2) \ |g_{i i}|}}.&lt;/math&gt;

which gives the initial conditions

:&lt;math&gt;\dot r = \frac{v_\parallel \sqrt{r \ (r-2 M)-Q^2}}{r \sqrt{(1-v^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot \Omega = \frac{v_{\perp}}{r \sqrt{(1-v^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[specific orbital energy]]

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{\sqrt{Q^2+(r-2) r}}{r \sqrt{1-v^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[specific relative angular momentum]]

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{v_\perp \ r}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

of the test-particle are conserved quantities of motion. &lt;math&gt;v_{\parallel}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt; are the radial and transverse components of the local velocity-vector. The local velocity is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{v_\perp^2+v_\parallel^2} = \sqrt{\frac{E^2 r^2-Q^2-r^2+2 r}{E^2 r^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative formulation of metric==
The metric can alternatively be expressed like this:
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + fk_{\mu}k_{\nu} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{G}{r^2}\left[2Mr - Q^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = ( k_{x} ,k_{y} ,k_{z} ) = \left( \frac{x}{r} , \frac{y}{r}, \frac{z}{r} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{0} = 1. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that '''k''' is a [[unit vector]].  Here ''M'' is the constant mass of the object, ''Q'' is the constant charge of the object, and ''η'' is the [[Minkowski space#Standard basis|Minkowski tensor]].

[[File:Cold meat salad.jpg|thumb|Various distinct components can combine to make a salad.]]

The '''salad bowl''' concept suggests that the integration of the many different cultures of [[United States]] residents combine like a [[salad]], as opposed to the more traditional notion of a cultural [[melting pot]]. New York City can be considered as being a "salad bowl". In [[Canada]] this concept is more commonly known as the [[cultural mosaic]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalman, Bobbie (2010). Canada: The Culture. Crabtree Pub. p. 4. {{ISBN|978-0-7787-9284-0}}. Retrieved 2012-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; In the salad bowl model, different American cultures are brought together &amp;mdash; like salad ingredients &amp;mdash; but do not form together into a single [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] culture. Each culture keeps its own distinct qualities. This idea proposes a society of many individual, "pure" cultures in addition to the mixed culture that is modern American culture, and the term has become more [[political correctness|politically correct]] than ''melting pot'' {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}, since the latter suggests that ethnic groups may be unable to preserve their cultures due to [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]...

Some {{Who|date=August 2013}} have compared the European concept of [[multiculturalism]] ([[multikulti]]) to a salad bowl approach, which prevents the full integration of immigrant groups into host societies, whereas the traditional American approach of the [[melting pot]] results in successful integration of successive immigrant waves into the larger American society.

The story of [[Pocahontas]] and [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] or the peaceful co-existence of Native Americans and new immigrants from England has been counted as a prototype of American multiculturalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, some scholars{{Who|date=August 2013}} blamed it as a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] concept of [[melting pot]] and suggested a new concept of salad bowl.

An example of the European version of a salad bowl can be seen in its policy regarding the EU programme ‘integration of non-European nationals’ which finances and promotes integration initiatives targeting those who are not members of the EU25. This project aims to encourage dialogue in civil society, develop integration models, and spread and highlight the best initiatives regarding integration.

The salad bowl idea in practice has its supporters and detractors. Supporters argue that being American does not inherently tie a person to a single culture, though rather to citizenship and loyalty to the United States. Thus, one does not need to abandon their cultural heritage in order to be considered "American".

In [[biology]], '''saltation''' (from [[Latin]], ''saltus'', "leap") is a sudden and large [[mutation]]al change from one generation to the next, potentially causing single-step [[speciation]]. This was historically offered as an [[alternative to Darwinism]]. Some forms of [[mutationism]] were effectively saltationist, implying large discontinuous jumps.

Speciation, such as by [[polyploidy]] in plants, can sometimes be achieved in a single and in evolutionary terms sudden step. Evidence is accumulating for various forms of saltation in a variety of organisms.

==History==
{{further|Alternatives to evolution by natural selection}}

Prior to [[Charles Darwin]] most evolutionary scientists had been saltationists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]. (1894). ''From the Greeks to Darwin: An outline of the development of the evolution idea''. New York, London, Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] was a gradualist but similar to other scientists of the period had written that saltational evolution was possible. [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that "monstrosities could become the founding fathers (or mothers) of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to the next."&lt;ref&gt;Benedikt Hallgrímsson, Brian K. Hall. (2011). ''Variation: A Central Concept in Biology''. Academic Press. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffroy wrote that environmental pressures could produce sudden transformations to establish new [[species]] instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler]]. (2003). ''Evolution: The History of an Idea''. University of California Press. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 [[Albert von Kölliker]] revived Geoffroy's theory that evolution proceeds by large steps, under the name of [[heterogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sewall Wright]]. (1984). ''Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations Volume 1''. University of Chicago Press. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 Charles Darwin had denied saltational evolution by writing that evolutionary transformation always proceeds gradually and never in jumps. Darwin insisted on slow accumulation of small steps in evolution and wrote "[[natural selection]] acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short steps". Darwin continued in this belief throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]]. (1859). ''On the Origin of Species''. p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1860 to 1880 saltation had a minority interest but by 1890 had become a major interest to scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Radick. (2008). ''The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate about Animal Language''. University Of Chicago Press. p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; In their paper on evolutionary theories in the 20th century (Levit ''et al''. 2008) wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The advocates of saltationism deny the Darwinian idea of slowly and gradually growing divergence of character as the only source of evolutionary progress. They would not necessarily completely deny gradual variation, but claim that cardinally new ‘body plans’ come into being as a result of saltations (sudden, discontinuous and crucial changes, for example, the series of macromutations). The latter are responsible for the sudden appearance of new higher taxa including classes and orders, while small variation is supposed to be responsible for the fine adaptations below the species level.&lt;ref&gt;Levit, G. S, Meister, K. Hoßfeld, U. (2008). ''Alternative Evolutionary Theories: A Historical Survey''. Journal of Bioeconomics 10.1. pp. 71–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 20th century a mechanism of saltation was proposed as large [[mutation]]s. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo de Vries]], who along with [[Carl Correns]] helped rediscover [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900, [[William Bateson]], a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. Some of these geneticists developed it into the [[mutation theory]] of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=265–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a debate over accounts of the [[evolution]] of [[mimicry]] and if they could be explained by gradualism or saltation. The geneticist [[Reginald Punnett]] supported a saltational theory in his book ''Mimicry in Butterflies'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Punnett]]. (1915). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003093162#page/n7/mode/2up ''Mimicry in Butterflies'']. Cornell University Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutation theory of evolution held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. This mutationist view of evolution was later replaced by the reconciliation of [[Mendelian genetics]] with natural selection into a gradualistic framework for the neo-Darwinian synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler]]. (2003). ''Evolution: The History of an Idea''. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the emergence of population thinking in evolution which forced many scientists to adopt [[gradualism]] in the early 20th century. According to [[Ernst Mayr]], it wasn't until the development of [[population genetics]] in the neo-Darwinian synthesis in the 1940s that demonstrated the explanatory power of natural selection that saltational views of evolution were largely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr]]. (2007). ''What Makes Biology Unique?: Considerations on the Autonomy of a Scientific Discipline''. Cambridge University Press; 1 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Saltation was originally denied by the "[[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]" school of neo-Darwinism which favoured gradual evolution but has since been accepted due to recent evidence in [[evolutionary biology]] (see the [[Saltation (biology)#Current status|current status]] section).&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, R. M. and DiMichele, W. A. (1994). ''Saltational evolution of form in vascular plants: a neoGoldschmidtian synthesis''. In ''Shape and Form in Plants and Fungi'' (eds D. S. Ingram and A. Hudson), Academic Press, London. pp. 61-100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, T. R. and Hebert, P. D. N. (1999).

''Evolution in Four Dimensions: Genetic, Epigenetic, Behavioral, and Symbolic Variation in the History of Life''.

[http://www.biologydirect.com/content/4/1/46 ''Evolution by leaps: gene duplication in bacteria'']. Biology Direct 4: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years there are some prominent proponents of saltation, including [[Carl Woese]]. Woese, and colleagues, suggested that the absence of RNA signature continuum between [[domain (biology)|domains]] of [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukarya]] constitutes a primary indication that the three primary organismal lineages materialized via one or more major evolutionary saltations from some universal ancestral state involving dramatic change in cellular organization that was significant early in the evolution of life, but in complex organisms gave way to the generally accepted Darwinian mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, E., A. Sethi, J. Montoya, C.R. Woese and Z. Luthey-Schulten. (2008). [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/37/13953.full?sid=f3651397-00e9-4a57-802b-f41c6ef6cf5a ''Molecular signatures of ribosomal evolution'']. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 105: 13953–13958.&lt;/ref&gt; The geneticist [[Barbara McClintock]] introduced the idea of "[[Transposable element|jumping genes]]", chromosome transpositions that can produce rapid changes in the [[genome]].&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, B. (1984). ''The significance of responses of the genome to challenge''. Science Vol. 226, pp. 792-801.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saltational [[speciation]], also known as abrupt speciation, is the discontinuity in a lineage that occurs through genetic mutations, [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal aberrations]] or other evolutionary mechanisms that cause reproductively isolated individuals to establish a new species population. [[Polyploid]]y, karyotypic fission, [[symbiogenesis]] and [[Horizontal gene transfer|lateral gene transfer]] are possible mechanisms for saltational speciation.&lt;ref&gt;Oladele Ogunseitan. (2004). ''Microbial Diversity: Form and Function in Prokaryotes''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 13. {{ISBN|978-0632047086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macromutation theory==
{{further|Mutationism}}

The botanist [[John Christopher Willis]] proposed an early saltationist theory of evolution. He held that species were formed by large mutations, not gradual evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Willis. (1923). ''The Origin of Species by Large, rather than by Gradual, Change, and by Guppy's Method of Differentiation''. Annals of Botany. Vol. 37, No. 148. pp. 605-628.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Beal. (1941). ''The Course of Evolution by J. C. Willis''. Botanical Gazette, Vol. 102, No. 3. p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German geneticist [[Richard Goldschmidt]] was the first scientist to use the term "hopeful monster". Goldschmidt thought that small gradual changes could not bridge the hypothetical divide between microevolution and macroevolution. In his book ''The Material Basis of Evolution'' (1940) he wrote "the change from species to species is not a change involving more and more additional atomistic changes, but a complete change of the primary pattern or reaction system into a new one, which afterwards may again produce intraspecific variation by micromutation." Goldschmidt believed the large changes in evolution were caused by macromutations (large mutations). His ideas about macromutations became known as the hopeful monster hypothesis which is considered a type of saltational evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Verne Grant. (1963). ''The Origin of Adaptations''. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldschmidt's thesis however was universally rejected and widely ridiculed within the biological community, which favored the [[neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] explanations of [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]], [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1982). "The uses of heresey; an introduction to Richard Goldschmidt's ''The Material Basis of Evolution''." [https://books.google.com/books?id=kAPLvAnp7KAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR13 pp. xiii-xlii]. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been a recent interest in the ideas of Goldschmidt in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] as some scientists are convinced he was not entirely wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Scott F. Gilbert. (2000). ''Developmental Biology'' Sinauer Associates; 6th edition. {{ISBN|0878932437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Schindewolf]], a German paleontologist, also supported macromutations as part of his evolutionary theory. He was known for presenting an alternative interpretation of the fossil record based on his ideas of [[orthogenesis]], saltational evolution and extraterrestrial impacts opposed to gradualism but abandoned the view of macromutations in later publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Schindewolf]]. (1969). ''Über den “Typus” in morphologischer und phylogenetischer Biologie''. Mainz: Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Søren Løvtrup]], a [[biochemist]] and [[embryologist]] from Denmark, advocated a similar hypothesis of macromutation to Goldschmidt's in 1974.&lt;ref name="Kathryn"&gt;Kathryn E. Hood, Carolyn Tucker Halpern and Gary Greenberg. (2010). ''Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Lovtrup believed that macromutations interfered with various [[epigenetic]] processes, that is, those which affect the causal processes in biological development. This is in contrast to the gradualistic theory of micromutations of [[Neo-Darwinism]], which claims that evolutionary innovations are generally the result of accumulation of numerous very slight modifications. Lovtrup also rejected the [[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]] of [[Stephen Jay Gould|Stephen Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]], claiming it was a form of gradualism and not a macromutation theory. Lovtrup defended many of Darwin's critics including Schindewolf, [[St. George Jackson Mivart|Mivart]], Goldschmidt, and Himmelfarb.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2O7iz2mGeSkC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=soren+lovtrup&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UcfRTZfoDMyVswbArJC4CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=soren%20lovtrup&amp;f=false Review of Lovtrup's book in the New Scientist, Oct 15, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mae Wan Ho]] described Lovtrup's theory as similar to the hopeful monster theory of [[Richard Goldschmidt]].&lt;ref name="Kathryn" /&gt;

Goldschmidt presented two mechanisms for how hopeful monsters might work. One mechanism, involved “systemic mutations”, rejected the classical [[gene]] concept and is no longer considered by modern science; however, his second mechanism involved “developmental macromutations” in “rate genes” or “controlling genes” that change early development and thus cause large effects in the adult phenotype. These kind of mutations are similar to the ones considered in contemporary [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Theissen. (2010). [http://www.palaeodiversity.org/pdf/03Suppl/Supplement_Theissen.pdf ''Homeosis of the angiosperm flower: Studies on three candidate cases of saltational evolution'']. Palaeodiversity 3, Supplement: 131-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of Goldschmidt [[Donald Prothero]] in his book ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters'' (2007) wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The past twenty years have vindicated Goldschmidt to some degree. With the discovery of the importance of regulatory genes, we realize that he was ahead of his time in focusing on the importance of a few genes controlling big changes in the organisms, not small-scales changes in the entire genome as neo-Darwinians thought. In addition, the hopeful monster problem is not so insurmountable after all. Embryology has shown that if you affect an entire population of developing embryos with a stress (such as a heat shock) it can cause many embryos to go through the same new pathway of embryonic development, and then they all become hopeful monsters when they reach reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Prothero]]. (2007). ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters''. Columbia University Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2008 evolutionary biologist [[Olivia Judson]] in her article ''The Monster Is Back, and It’s Hopeful'' listed some examples which may support the hopeful monster hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivia Judson]]. (2008). [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/the-monster-is-back-and-its-hopeful/ ''The Monster Is Back, and It’s Hopeful'']. The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; and an article published in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 2010 titled ''Evolution: Revenge of the Hopeful Monster'' reported that studies in stickleback populations in a British Columbia lake and [[bacteria]] populations in a Michigan lab have shown that large individual genetic changes can have vast effects on organisms "without dooming it to the evolutionary rubbish heap". According to the article "Single-gene changes that confer a large adaptive value do happen: they are not rare, they are not doomed and, when competing with small-effect mutations, they tend to win. But small-effect mutations still matter — a lot. They provide essential fine-tuning and sometimes pave the way for explosive evolution to follow."&lt;ref&gt;Tanguy Chouard. (2010). [http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100217/full/463864a.html ''Evolution: Revenge of the hopeful monster'']. Nature 463, 864-867.&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by (Page ''et al.'' 2010) have written that the Mexican [[axolotl]] (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') could be classified as a hopeful monster as it exhibits an adaptive and derived mode of development that has evolved rapidly and independently among tiger salamanders. According to the paper there has been an interest in aspects of the hopeful monster hypothesis in recent years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Goldschmidt proposed that [[mutation]]s occasionally yield individuals within populations that deviate radically from the norm and referred to such individuals as "hopeful monsters". If the novel phenotypes of hopeful monsters arise under the right environmental circumstances, they may become fixed, and the population will found a new species. While this idea was discounted during the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|Modern synthesis]], aspects of the hopeful monster hypothesis have been substantiated in recent years. For example, it is clear that dramatic changes in phenotype can occur from few mutations of key developmental genes and phenotypic differences among species often map to relatively few [[genetics|genetic]] factors. These findings are motivating renewed interest in the study of hopeful monsters and the perspectives they can provide about the evolution of development. In contrast to mutants that are created in the lab, hopeful monsters have been shaped by [[natural selection]] and are therefore more likely to reveal mechanisms of adaptive evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Page, Meredith A. Boley, Jeramiah J. Smith, Srikrishna Putta and Stephen R. Voss. (2010).

BMC Evolutionary Biology, 10:199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Günter Theißen]], a German professor of [[genetics]], has classified [[Homeosis|homeotic]] mutants as hopeful monsters and documented many examples of animal and plant lineages that may have originated as hopeful monsters.&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Theissen. (2006). [http://evolocus.com/Publications/Theissen2006.pdf ''The proper place of hopeful monsters in evolutionary biology'']. Theory in Biosciences, 124: 349–369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hintz, M.; Bartholmes, C.; Nutt, P.; Ziermann, J.; Hameister, S.; Neuffer, B.; Theissen, G. (2006).

Journal of Experimental Botany, 57: 3531-3542.&lt;/ref&gt; American biologist Michael Freeling has proposed "balanced gene drive" as a saltational mechanism in the mutationist tradition, which could explain trends involving morphological complexity in plant and animal [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Freeling M, Thomas BC. (2006). ''Gene-balanced duplications, like tetraploidy, provide predictable drive to increase morphological complexity''. Genome Res. 16: 805-814. Freeling M. (2009).

===Known mechanisms===

Examples of saltational evolution include cases of stabilized hybrids that can reproduce without crossing (such as [[allotetraploid]]s) and cases of [[symbiogenesis]]. Both [[gene duplication]] and [[Horizontal gene transfer|lateral gene transfer]] have the capacity to bring about relatively large changes that are saltational.&lt;ref&gt;Serres MH, Kerr AR, McCormack TJ, Riley M.

===Explanations===

Reviewing the history of macroevolutionary theories, the American evolutionary biologist [[Douglas J. Futuyma]] notes that since 1970, two very different alternatives to Darwinian gradualism have been proposed, both by [[Stephen Jay Gould]]: mutationism, and [[punctuated equilibria]].&lt;ref name=Futuyma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, S. J.]] (1980) Is a new and general theory of evolution emerging? Paleobiology 6:119–130&lt;/ref&gt; Gould's macromutation theory gave a nod to his predecessor with an envisaged "Goldschmidt break" between evolution within a species and speciation. His advocacy of Goldschmidt was attacked with "highly unflattering comments"&lt;ref name=Futuyma/&gt; by B. Charlesworth&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, B. (1982) "Hopeful monsters cannot fly". ''Paleobiology'' 8:469–474&lt;/ref&gt; and Templeton.&lt;ref&gt;Templeton, A. (1982) "Why read Goldschmidt?" ''Paleobiology'' 8:474–481&lt;/ref&gt; Futuyma concludes, following other biologists reviewing the field such as K.Sterelny&lt;ref&gt;Sterelny, K. (2000) "Development, evolution, and adaptation". ''Phil Sci (Proc)'' 67:S369–S387&lt;/ref&gt; and A. Minelli,&lt;ref&gt;Minelli, A. (2010) "Evolutionary developmental biology does not offer a significant challenge to the neo-Darwinian paradigm". In: Ayala FJ, Arp R (eds) ''Contemporary debates in philosophy of biology''. Wiley, Chichester, pp 213–226&lt;/ref&gt; that essentially all the claims of evolution driven by large mutations could be explained within the Darwinian evolutionary synthesis.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |last1=Futuyma |first1=Douglas J. |authorlink1=Douglas J.

Initiated by [[Humberto Maturana]] in 1978 with the publication of his [[Humberto_Maturana#Publications|Biology of Cognition]], his subsequent work in partnership with [[Francisco Varela]] in Santiago, Chile, eventually came to be called the '''Santiago theory of cognition.''' They and their work, their cohorts and like-minded intellectuals similarly came to be known as the Santiago School.&lt;ref&gt;Capra, Fritjof. "The Santiago Theory of Life and Cognition." la revista Be-Vision 9.1 (1986): 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory can be encapsulated in two sentences:&lt;blockquote&gt;Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Humberto R./Varela, Francisco J. (1980): Autopoiesis and Cognition. The Realization of the Living. Dordrecht: Reidel, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This theory contributes a perspective that cognition is a process present at other organic levels.

The Santiago theory of cognition is a direct theoretical consequence of the theory of [[autopoiesis]]. Cognition is considered as ''the ability of [[adaptation]] in a certain environment''. That definition is not as strange as it seems at first glance: for example, one is considered to have a good knowledge of Mathematics if they can understand and subsequently solve a Mathematical problem. That is, one can recognize the mathematical entities, their interrelations and the procedures used to view other aspects of the relevant phenomena; all these, are the domain of Mathematics. And one with knowledge of that domain, is one adapted to that domain, for they can tweak the problems, the entities and the procedures within the certain domain.

Cognition emerges as a consequence of continuous interaction between the system and its environment. The continuous interaction triggers bilateral [[Perturbation (biology)|perturbation]]s; perturbations are considered problems – therefore the system uses its functional differentiation procedures to come up with a [[solution]] (if it doesn't have one handy already through its memory). Gradually the system becomes "adapted" to its environment – that is it can confront the perturbations so as to survive. The resulting complexity of [[living system]]s is cognition produced by the history of bilateral perturbations within the system/environment schema.

This theory contributes to the philosophical discussion of [[awareness]], [[consciousness]], [[cognition]] and the [[philosophy of mind]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3432">'''Satitherapy''' is an integrative [[psychotherapy]], which uses [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] (sati) as the key principle within a [[person centered approach]] developed by [[Carl R. Rogers]]. In this approach, it is the client who defines the goals of therapy and attains them with therapist's ethically skillful help (kusala). Satitherapy is grounded on respecting all life ([[ahimsa]]) and takes as its base the bodily anchored experiencing that is beyond the words. For this, it integrates the techniques of [[psychodrama]] developed by [[Jacob L. Moreno]] and expressive media for therapeutic acting-out, as well as the procedures of Buddhist [[insight meditation]] (satipatthána-vipassaná) and satidrama for therapeutic acting-in.

The theoretical training of satitherapists uses both the conceptual frame of Western psychology of mindfulness (cf. Germer, Siegel, Fulton, 2005; Didonna, 2009) and the system of psychology and ethics elaborated in the ancient Asian teachings of [[Abhidhamma]] (Frýba 1989; Frýba, 1996). Most of the practical skills and techniques are derived from the Abhidhamma. Thus the format of satitherapy includes theoretical knowledge and therapeutic skills from both Western and Asian sources.

There are two things unique to satitherapy:

*the use of ethics as the explanatory principle of suffering and as the basic paradigm of skilful coping
*the practical principle of skilful setting or removing of conditions (vatta-pativatta) so as to enable the upheaval of reality (dhamma-uddhacca) against the pathogenic wrong views (ditthi).
These two paradigms of satitherapy are derived from Abhidhamma and they are not found in any other psychotherapy, which was developed within Western Euro-American culture.

'''Self-verification''' is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] theory that asserts people want to be known and understood by others according to their firmly held beliefs and feelings about themselves, that is ''self-views'' (including [[self-concept]]s and [[self-esteem]]). A competing theory to self-verification is ''[[self-enhancement]]'' or the drive for positive evaluations.

Because chronic self-concepts and self-esteem play an important role in understanding the world, providing a sense of coherence, and guiding action, people become motivated to maintain them through self-verification. Such strivings provide stability to people’s lives, making their experiences more coherent, orderly, and comprehensible than they would be otherwise. Self-verification processes are also adaptive for groups, groups of diverse backgrounds and the larger society, in that they make people predictable to one another thus serve to facilitate social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Swann | Milton | Polzer | 2000 | pp=79, 238–250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, people engage in a variety of activities that are designed to obtain self-verifying information.

Developed by [[William Swann]] (1981), the theory grew out of earlier writings which held that people form self-views so that they can understand and predict the responses of others and know how to act toward them.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, 1902; Mead, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between positive and negative self-views==
There are individual differences in people's views of themselves. Among people with ''positive self-views'', the desire for self-verification works together with another important motive, the desire for positive evaluations or "[[self enhancement]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; For example, those who view themselves as "insightful" will find that their motives for both self-verification and self-enhancement encourage them to seek evidence that other people recognize their insightfulness.

In contrast, people with ''negative self-views'' will find that the desire for self-verification and self-enhancement are competing. Consider people who see themselves as disorganized. Whereas their desire for self-enhancement will compel them to seek evidence that others perceive them as organized, their desire for self-verification will compel such individuals to seek evidence that others perceive them as disorganized. Self-verification strivings tend to prevail over self-enhancement strivings when people are certain of the self-concept&lt;ref&gt;Pelham &amp; Swann, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and when they have extremely depressive self-views.&lt;ref&gt;Giesler, Josephs, &amp; Swann, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-verification strivings may have undesirable consequences for people with negative self-views ([[Clinical depression|depressed]] people and those who suffer from low [[self-esteem]]). For example, self-verification strivings may cause people with negative self-views to [[interpersonal attraction|gravitate]] toward partners who mistreat them, undermine their feelings of [[self-worth]], or even abuse them. And if people with negative self-views seek [[Family therapy|therapy]], returning home to a self-verifying partner may undo the progress that was made there.&lt;ref&gt;Swann &amp; Predmore, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in the workplace, the feelings of worthlessness that plague people with low self-esteem may foster feelings of ambivalence about receiving fair treatment, feelings that may undercut their propensity to insist that they get what they deserve from their employers (see: [[workplace bullying]]).&lt;ref&gt;Weisenfeld, Swann, Brockner, &amp; Bartel, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings and related ones point to the importance of efforts to improve the self-views of those who suffer from low self-esteem and depression.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Chang-Schneider &amp; McClarty, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on behavior==
In one series of studies, researchers asked participants with positive and negative self-views whether they would prefer to interact with evaluators who had favorable or unfavorable impressions of them. The results showed that those with positive self-views preferred favorable partners and those with negative self-views preferred unfavorable partners. The latter finding revealed that self-verification strivings may sometimes trump positivity strivings.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson &amp; Smith-Lovin, 1992; Swann, Stein-Seroussi, Giesler, 1992; see Swann, Chang-Schneider, &amp; Angulo, in press, for a review&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-verification motives operate for different dimensions of the self-concept and in many different situations. Men and women are equally inclined to display this tendency, and it does not matter whether the self-views refer to characteristics that are relatively ''immutable'' (e.g., intelligence) or ''changeable'' (e.g., diligence), or whether the self-views happen to be ''highly specific'' (e.g., athletic) or ''global'' (e.g., low self-esteem, worthlessness). Furthermore, when people chose negative partners over positive ones, it is not merely in an effort to avoid interacting with positive evaluators (that is, out of a concern that they might disappoint such positive evaluators). Rather, people chose self-verifying, negative partners even when the alternative is participating in a different experiment.&lt;ref name="SwannWenzlaff"&gt;Swann, Wenzlaff, &amp; Tafarodi, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, recent work has shown that people work to verify self-views associated with group memberships.&lt;ref&gt;Lemay &amp; Ashmore, 2004; Chen, Chen, &amp; Shaw, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; For example, women seek evaluations that confirm their belief that they possess qualities associated with being a woman.

Self-verification theory suggests that people may begin to shape others' evaluations of them before they even begin interacting with them. They may, for example, display identity cues (see: [[impression management]]). The most effective identity cues enable people to signal who they are to potential interaction partners.

* Physical appearance, such as clothes, body posture, demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Pratt &amp; Rafaeli, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the low self-esteem person who evokes reactions that confirm her negative self-views by slumping her shoulders and keeping her eyes fixed on the ground.
* Other cues, such as the car someone buys, the house they live in, the way they decorate their living environment. For example, an [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] evokes reactions that confirm a person's positive self-view.

Self-verification strivings may also influence the social contexts that people enter into and remain in. People reject those who provide social feedback that does not confirm their self-views, such as married people with negative self-views who reject spouses who see them positively and vice versa. College roommates behave in a similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;Swann &amp; Pelham, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Swann, DeLaRonde, &amp; Hixon, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; People are more inclined to [[divorce]] partners who perceived them too favorably.&lt;ref&gt;Cast &amp; Burke, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these instances, people gravitated toward relationships that provided them with evaluations that confirmed their self-views and fled from those that did not.

When people fail to gain self-verifying reactions through the display of identity cue or through choosing self-verifying social environments, they may still acquire such evaluations by systematically evoking confirming reactions. For example, depressed people behave in negative ways toward their roommates, thus causing these roommates to reject them.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Wenzlaff, Krull, &amp; Pelham, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-verification theory predicts that when people interact with others, there is a general tendency for them to bring others to see them as they see themselves. This tendency is especially pronounced when they start out believing that the other person has misconstrued them, apparently because people compensate by working especially hard to bring others to confirm their self-views.&lt;ref name="Swann"&gt;Swann &amp; Read, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; People will even stop working on tasks to which they have been assigned if they sense that their performance is eliciting non-verifying feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Brockner, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of confirmation bias==
{{Main|Confirmation bias}}
Self-verification theory predicts that people’s self-views will cause them to see the world as more supportive of these self-views than it really is. That is, individuals process information in a [[bias]]ed manner. These biases may be conscious and deliberate, but are probably more commonly done effortlessly and non-consciously. Through the creative use of these processes, people may dramatically increase their chances of attaining self-verification. There are at least three relevant aspects of information processing in self-verification:

#[[Attention]]: People will attend to evaluations that are self-confirming while ignoring non-confirming evaluations.&lt;ref name="Swann" /&gt;
#[[Recollection|Memory retrieval]]: self-views bias memory recall to favor self-confirming material over non-confirming elements.&lt;ref&gt;Story, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
#Interpretation of information:  people tend to interpret information in ways that reinforce their self-views.&lt;ref&gt;Shrauger &amp; Lund, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

These distinct forms of self-verification may often be implemented sequentially. For example, in one scenario, people may first strive to locate partners who verify one or more self-views. If this fails, they may redouble their efforts to elicit verification for the self-view in question or strive to elicit verification for a different self-view. Failing this, they may strive to "see" more self-verification than actually exists. And, if this strategy is also ineffective, they may withdraw from the relationship, either psychologically or in actuality.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Related processes==

===Preference for novelty===
People seem to prefer modest levels of novelty; they want to experience phenomena that are unfamiliar enough to be interesting, but not so unfamiliar as to be frightening or too familiar as to be boring.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Berlyne, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of people's preference for novelty for [[interpersonal relationship|human relationships]] are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily from studies of people's reactions to [[art object]]s and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects are very different from people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's [[belief|belief systems]]. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., [[leisure|leisure activities]]), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Tension with self-enhancement===
People's self-verification strivings are apt to be most influential when the relevant [[identity (social science)|identities]] and behaviors matter to them. Thus, for example, the self-view should be firmly held, the relationship should be enduring, and the behavior itself should be consequential. When these conditions are not met, people will be relatively unconcerned with preserving their self-views and they will instead indulge their desire for self-enhancement. In addition, self-reported emotional reactions favor self-enhancement while more thoughtful processes favor self-verification.&lt;ref&gt;Kwang &amp; Swann, (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

But if people with firmly held negative self-views seek self-verification, this does not mean that they are masochistic or have no desire to be loved. In fact, even people with very low self-esteem want to be loved.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} What sets people with negative self-views apart is their ambivalence about the evaluations they receive. Just as positive evaluations foster joy and warmth initially, these feelings are later chilled by incredulity. And although negative evaluations may foster sadness that the "truth" could not be kinder, it will at least reassure them that they know themselves. Happily, people with negative self-views are the exception rather than the rule. That is, on the balance, most people tend to view themselves positively. Although this imbalance is adaptive for society at large, it poses a challenge to researchers interested in studying self-verification. That is, for theorists interested in determining if behavior is driven by self-verification or positivity strivings, participants with positive self-views will reveal nothing because both motives compel them to seek positive evaluations. If researchers want to learn if people prefer verification or positivity in a giving setting, they must study people with negative self-views.&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see Swann et al., in press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-concept change===
Although self-verification strivings tend to stabilize people's self-views, changes in self-views may still occur. Probably the most common source of change is set in motion when the [[social environment]] recognizes a significant change in a person's age (e.g., when adolescents become adults), [[social status|status]] (e.g., when students become teachers), or [[social role]] (e.g., when someone is convicted of a crime). Suddenly, the community may change the way that it treats the person.  Eventually the target of such treatment will bring his or her self-view into accord with the new treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D (July 10–11, 2010). The Age of Contentment. The Weekend Australian Magazine p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, people may themselves conclude that a given self-view is dysfunctional or obsolete and take steps to change it. Consider, for example, a woman who decides that her negative self-views have led her to tolerate abusive relationship partners. When she realizes that such partners are making her miserable, she may seek therapy. In the hands of a skilled therapist, she may develop more favorable self-views which, in turn, steer her toward more positive relationship partners with whom she may cultivate healthier relationships. Alternatively, when a woman who is uncertain about her negative self-concept enters a relationship with a partner who is certain that she deserves to view herself more positively, that woman will tend to improve the self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Swann &amp; Ely, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have argued that self-verification processes are relatively rare, manifesting themselves only among people with terribly negative self views. In support of this viewpoint, critics cite hundreds of studies indicating that people prefer, seek and value positive evaluations more than negative ones. Such skeptical assessments overlook three important points. First, because most people have relatively positive self-views,&lt;ref&gt;Swann, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; evidence of a preference for positive evaluations in unselected samples may in reality reflect a preference for evaluations that are self-verifying, because for such individuals self-verification and positivity strivings are indistinguishable. No number of studies of participants with positive self-views can determine whether self-verification or self-enhancement strivings are more common. Second, self-verification strivings are not limited to people with globally negative self-views; even people with high self-esteem seek negative evaluations about their flaws.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Pelham &amp; Krull, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, even people with positive self-views appear to be uncomfortable with overly positive evaluations. For example, people with moderately positive self-views withdraw from spouses who evaluate them in an exceptionally positive manner.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, De La Ronde, &amp; Hixon, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have suggested that when people with negative self-views seek unfavorable evaluations, they do so as a means of avoiding truly negative evaluations or for purposes of self-improvement, with the idea being that this will enable them to obtain positive evaluations down the road. Tests of this idea have failed to support it. For example, just as people with negative self-views choose self-verifying, negative evaluators even when the alternative is being in another experiment, they choose to be in another experiment rather than interact with someone who evaluates them positively.&lt;ref name="SwannWenzlaff" /&gt; Also, people with negative self-views are most intimate with spouses who evaluate them negatively, despite the fact that these spouses are relatively unlikely to enable them to improve themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Swann et al., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in a study of people's thought processes as they chose interaction partners,&lt;ref&gt;Swann, et al., 1992&lt;/ref&gt; people with negative self-views indicated that they chose negative evaluators because such partners seemed likely to confirm their self-views (an epistemic consideration) and interact smoothly with them (a pragmatic consideration); self-improvement was rarely mentioned.

'''Structured criticality''' is a property of [[complex systems]] in which small events may trigger larger events due to subtle interdependencies between elements. This often gives rise to a form of stratified [[chaos theory|chaos]] where the general behavior of the system can be modeled on one scale while smaller- and larger-scale behaviors remain unpredictable.

'''For example:'''

Consider a pile of sand. If you drop one grain of sand on top of this pile every second, the pile will continue to grow in the shape of a cone. The general shape, size, and growth of this cone is fairly easy to model as a function of the rate at which new sand grains are added, the size and shape of the grains, and the number of grains in the pile.

The pile retains its shape because occasionally a new grain of sand will trigger an avalanche which causes some number of grains to slide down the side of the cone into new positions. 

These avalanches are chaotic. It is nearly impossible to predict if the next grain of sand will cause an avalanche, where that avalanche will occur on the pile, how many grains of sand will be involved in the event, and so on. 

However, the aggregate behavior of avalanches can be modeled statistically with some accuracy. For example, you can reasonably predict the frequency of avalanche events of different sizes.

The avalanches are caused when the impact of a new grain of sand is sufficient to dislodge some group of sand grains. If that group is dislodged then its motion may be sufficient to cause a [[cascading failure|cascade failure]] in some neighboring groups, while other groups that are nearby may be strong enough to absorb the energy of the event without being disturbed.

Each group of sand grains can be thought of as a sub-system with its own state, and each sub-system can be made up of other sub-systems, and so on. In this way you can imagine the sand pile as a complex system made up of sub-systems ultimately made up of individual grains of sand (yet another sub-system). Each of these sub-systems are more or less likely to suffer a cascade failure. Those that are likely to fail and reorganize can be said to be in a '''critical''' state.

Put another way, the likelihood that any particular sub-system will fail (or experience a particular event) can be called its '''criticality'''. (See: [[Self-organized criticality]])

So then, the pile of sand can be viewed as a network of interconnected systems, each with its own criticality. The relationships between these groups impose a structure on this network which has a profound effect on the probability and scope of a cascade failure in response to some other event. In other words - '''structured criticality'''.

Structured criticality is found just about everywhere. Some other examples are:

* Landslides.
* Lightning strikes.
* Earthquakes.
* The knots that appear on a twisted rubber band in a model airplane as the propeller is wound up.
* Rouge Waves

In Christian theology, a '''supernatural gift''' is a gift of God that is conferred on man that is above all the powers of created nature.&lt;reF&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Supernatural Gift}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the gift of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] which enables man to attain salvation despite [[original sin]].

"'''To Be Young, Gifted and Black'''" is a song by [[Nina Simone]] with [[lyrics]] by [[Weldon Irvine]]. It was written in memory of Simone's late friend [[Lorraine Hansberry]], author of the play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', who had died in 1965 aged 34. The song was originally recorded and released by Simone in 1969, also featuring on her 1970 album ''[[Black Gold (Nina Simone album)|Black Gold]]'', and was a [[Civil Rights Movement]] anthem. Released as a [[Single (music)|single]], it peaked at number eight on the R&amp;B chart and number 76 on the [[Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable [[cover version]]s of the song were recorded by [[Donny Hathaway]] (on his 1970 album ''[[Everything Is Everything (Donny Hathaway album)|Everything Is Everything]]''), [[Aretha Franklin]] (on her 1972 album ''[[Young, Gifted and Black]]'') and [[Bob and Marcia]] (whose 1970 recording reached number 5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number 15 in Ireland).&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

[[Elton John]] recorded a version of "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" prior to his solo success. Intended to be released as a low-budget [[sound-alike]] version of the original, it was later reissued on the [[compilation album]] ''[[Chartbusters Go Pop! 20 Legendary Covers from 1969/70 as Sung by Elton John|Covers as Sung by Elton John]]''.

The song has also become a popular sample amongst various modern R&amp;B/hip-hop pieces, including [[Rah Digga]]'s 2003 unreleased record "On the Move", [[Faith Evans]]' 2014 single "[[I Deserve It]]", featuring [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Sharaya J]], and on the title track of Rapsody's 2017 album ''Laila's Wisdom''.

'''WorldWinner''' is a cross-platform, skill-based games community that operates competitive cash tournaments for web, mobile web, and mobile ([[iOS]]) platforms. Games include Solitaire Rush, Wheel of Fortune®, SCRABBLE Cubes, and Tetris® Burst. In 2018, WorldWinner launched Angry Birds Champions, the official cash tournament version of [[Rovio Entertainment]]'s Angry Birds.

WorldWinner is based in Boston, MA and operates under the [[Game Show Network]]’s GSN Games division.

== History ==
Worldwinner was founded in 1999 in Newton, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/WorldWinner.com+Launches+Online+Gaming+Site+that+Rewards+Skilled...-a064329455|title=WorldWinner.com Launches Online Gaming Site that Rewards Skilled Players with Cash Prizes; New Gaming Destination Brings the Thrill of Competition to Familiar Games. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Alex Bloom (formerly Saidakovsky), Alex Ganelis, and Daniil Utin, raising over $17 million from leading venture capital firms, including HarbourVest Partners and Benchmark Capital.

WorldWinner launched on August 17, 2000 as the first online gaming destination allowing participants to compete in skill-based tournaments for real-money winnings. The company established partnerships with leading casual games sites, including Yahoo!, EA, Pogo, iWon, PAX TV, WildTangent, and Shockwave. By 2002, WorldWinner was hosting more than two million tournaments per month, with more than $100,000 in daily cash winnings.

From 2000 to 2004, WorldWinner reported a revenue increase of 2,386 percent, earning the number six spot on the Technology Fast 50 for New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worldwinner-ranks-sixth-on-deloittes-technology-fast-50-list-55240512.html|title=WorldWinner Ranks Sixth on Deloitte's Technology Fast 50 List|last=Inc.|first=WorldWinner,|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, Saidakovsky, Ganelis, and Utin obtained a patent for their tournament technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pimg-faiw.uspto.gov/fdd/79/2002/53/005/0.pdf|title=Minimizing the effects of chance, US Patent|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, WorldWinner had over 14 million registered players worldwide, hosting more than four million tournaments and awarding millions of dollars in prizes every month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worldwinner-explodes-in-2004-with-record-revenues-54063537.html|title=WorldWinner Explodes in 2004 with Record Revenues|last=Inc.|first=WorldWinner,|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, WorldWinner was acquired by [[FUN Technologies]] and merged with SkillJam into WorldWinner, dropping the SkillJam brand.

In December 2007, [[Liberty Media]] acquired FUN Technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ir.libertymedia.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=576103|title=Liberty Media Corporation Completes Acquisition of FUN Technologies Inc.|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a transaction valuing the company at $484 million. As a result of the acquisition, WorldWinner integrated with the Liberty-owned Game Show Network, and FUN Technologies was discontinued as a brand. WorldWinner rebranded to GSN Cash Games in 2013. The company also launched its mobile web offering (GSN Cash Games Mobile) in 2014, allowing players to compete in cash tournaments on mobile devices.

In 2017, GSN Cash Games re-branded back to WorldWinner, simultaneously launching a cash tournament version of Solitaire TriPeaks, based on the Solitaire TriPeaks app by GSN Games.

In July 2017, WorldWinner launched its iOS app, followed by Android in May 2018.

As of June 2018, WorldWinner is no longer available in the [[European Union|EU]].

== Cash tournament model ==
WorldWinner hosts different types of cash tournaments with varying player pools, prize pools, entry fees, and difficulty level. Players are matched with other players of similar skill. Unlike gambling games that, from a legal standpoint, feature the elements of chance, prize, and consideration, WorldWinner games are modified so that player skill (as opposed to chance or luck) is the predominant factor in performance and winnings.

WorldWinner also offers free Warm-Up tournaments.

== Games ==
WorldWinner’s portfolio includes online and mobile games based on popular [[card game]]s, [[Puzzle Game|puzzle games]], [[word game]]s, [[board game]]s, [[Game show|TV game show games]], arcade games, and match-three games.

The '''Zanzibar leopard''' is an [[African leopard]] (''Panthera pardus pardus'') population on [[Unguja|Unguja Island]] in the [[Zanzibar]] archipelago, [[Tanzania]]. It is the island's largest terrestrial [[carnivore]] and [[apex predator]]. In 2008, it was considered [[extinct]] due to persecution by local hunters.&lt;ref name=WalshGoldman08&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Walsh, M.T.  |author2=Goldman, H.V. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008 |title=Updating the Inventory of Zanzibar Leopard Specimens |url=https://www.academia.edu/694088/Updating_the_inventory_of_Zanzibar_leopard_specimens/ |journal=Cat News |volume=49 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing conflict between people and leopards in the 20th century led to their demonization and determined attempts to exterminate them. Efforts to develop a leopard [[conservation biology|conservation]] program in the mid-1990s were shelved when wildlife researchers concluded that there was little prospect for the population's long-term survival.&lt;ref name=Stuart/&gt; However, camera trap footage revealed in 2018 of a similar-looking leopard has renewed hopes for the population's survival, though little information is known.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insideedition.com/zanzibar-leopard-captured-camera-despite-being-declared-extinct-43962|title=Zanzibar Leopard Captured on Camera, Despite Being Declared Extinct|work=Inside Edition|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Zanzibar leopard was described as a [[leopard]] [[subspecies]] by [[Reginald Innes Pocock]], who proposed the [[scientific name]] ''Panthera pardus adersi'' in 1932.&lt;ref name="Pocock1932"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pocock|first1=R.

== Evolutionary history ==
The [[evolution]]ary history of the Zanzibar leopard parallels that of other endemics on Unguja, including the [[Zanzibar servaline genet]] and the [[Zanzibar red colobus]]. It is thought to have evolved in isolation from the African leopard since at least the end of the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]], when the island was separated from mainland Tanzania by rising [[sea level]]s. The [[founder effect]] and [[adaptation]] to local conditions produced a smaller leopard than its continental relatives and one whose [[rosette (zoology)|rosettes]] have partially disintegrated into spots.&lt;ref name=Pakenham1984&gt;{{cite book | author = Pakenham, R.H.W. | year = 1984 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/14538645/The-Mammals-of-Zanzibar-and-Pemba/ | title = The Mammals of Zanzibar and Pemba Islands | location = Harpenden | publisher = privately printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kingdon1989&gt;{{cite book | author = Kingdon, J. | year = 1989 | title = Island Africa: The Evolution of Africa's Rare Animals and Plants | location = Princeton | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior and Ecology  ==
Very little is known about the Zanzibar leopard's [[behavior]] and ecology.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Walsh, M.T. |author2=Goldman, H.V. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/14568104/The-Zanzibar-Leopard-between-Science-and-Cryptozoology/ |title=The Zanzibar Leopard Between Science and Cryptozoology |journal=Nature East Africa |volume=33 |issue=1/2 |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has never been studied in the wild, and the last sighting of a live leopard happened in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=Swai1983&gt;Swai, I.S. (1983). ''Wildlife Conservation Status in Zanzibar''. Unpublished M.Sc. dissertation, [[University of Dar es Salaam]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Most [[zoology|zoologists]] have since presumed the Zanzibar leopard to be extinct or very nearly so.&lt;ref name=Stuart&gt;{{cite book |authors=Stuart, C. &amp; Stuart, T. |year=1997 |title=A Preliminary Faunal Survey of South-eastern Unguja (Zanzibar) with Special Emphasis on the Leopard ''Panthera pardus adersi'' |publisher=African-Arabian Wildlife Research Centre |location=Loxton, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only six skins have been located in museums, including the [[type (zoology)|type specimen]] in the [[Natural History Museum, London]], and a much-faded mounted specimen in the [[Zanzibar Museum]].&lt;ref name=WalshGoldman08/&gt;
However, Zanzibar government statistics indicate that leopards were still being killed by hunters in the mid-1990s, and islanders continue to report sightings and [[livestock]] [[predation]].&lt;ref name=Goldman2002&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Walsh, M.T.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2002 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13994714/Is-the-Zanzibar-Leopard-Panthera-pardus-adersi-Extinct/ | title = Is the Zanzibar Leopard (''Panthera pardus adersi'') Extinct? | journal = Journal of East African Natural History | volume = 91 | issue = 1/2 | pages = 15–25 | doi = 10.2982/0012-8317(2002)91[15:ITZLPP]2.0.CO;2 | issn = 0012-8317}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Extirpation ==
[[File:Zanzibar Leopard 8.JPG|thumb|Close up of head]] 
Rural Zanzibaris’ descriptions of the leopard and its habits are characterized by the widespread [[belief]] that a large number of these [[carnivore]]s are kept by [[witchcraft|witches]] and sent by them to harm or otherwise harass villagers. This belief comes together with an elaborate package of ideas about how leopards are bred, trained, exchanged and sent to do the evil bidding of their owners. For local farmers this supplies a neat explanation for [[predation]] by leopards, and more generally for their appearance "out of place" in the vicinity of farms and villages.&lt;ref name=Goldman1997&gt;{{cite web |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Walsh, M.T.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1997 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/17317225/A-Leopard-in-Jeopardy-An-Anthropological-Survey-of-Practices-and-Beliefs-which-Threaten-the-Survival-of-the-Zanzibar-Leopard-Panthera-pardus-adersi/ | title = A Leopard in Jeopardy: An Anthropological Survey of Practices and Beliefs which Threaten the Survival of the Zanzibar Leopard (''Panthera pardus adersi'') | work =  Zanzibar Forestry Technical Paper No. 63, Jozani-Chwaka Bay Conservation Project, Commission for Natural Resources, Zanzibar | accessdate = 2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of human [[population]] and [[agriculture]] in the 20th century was largely responsible for this state of affairs, as people encroached on leopard [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and prey species. Increasing conflict with leopards and the fear that this generated led to a series of campaigns to exterminate them. These were localized at first, but became island-wide after the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] of 1964, when a combined anti-[[witchcraft]] and leopard-killing campaign was launched under the leadership of a witch-finder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walsh| first1=M.T.|last2=Goldman| first2=H.V.|editor1-first=E.| editor1-last=Dounias |editor2-first=E.| editor2-last=Motte-Florac |editor3-first=M.| editor3-last=Dunham|title=Le symbolisme des animaux: L'animal, clef de voûte de la relation entre l'homme et la nature?

== Conservation==
Serious attention was not paid to the Zanzibar leopard's plight until the mid-1990s, by which time some authorities were already listing it as extinct.&lt;ref name=Nowell&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nowell, K.  |author2=Jackson, P.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1996 | url = http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/actionplans/wildcats.pdf/ | title = Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan | location = Gland, Switzerland | publisher = [[IUCN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leopard conservation program was drafted by the [[CARE (relief)|CARE]]-funded Jozani-Chwaka Bay Conservation Project, but abandoned in 1997 when wildlife researchers failed to find evidence for the leopard's continuing presence in and around [[Jozani forest]].&lt;ref name=Stuart/&gt;

Local wildlife officials, however, remained more optimistic about the leopard's survival, and some Zanzibaris have proposed approaching alleged leopard keepers in order to ask them to display their leopards to paying visitors. Villagers sometimes offer to take tourists or researchers to see "domesticated" leopards in return for cash, but so far none of these "kept leopard chases" has been known to end in a successful sighting.&lt;ref name=Swai1983/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall, S. (1994). ''The Status of the Zanzibar Leopard''. SIT Tanzania &amp; Commission for Natural Resources, Zanzibar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Selkow&gt;Selkow, B. (1995). ''A Survey of Villager Perceptions of the Zanzibar Leopard''. SIT Tanzania &amp; Commission for Natural Resources, Zanzibar.&lt;/ref&gt;

These conflicting perceptions of the Zanzibar leopard's status and the possibility of its conservation have yet to be reconciled, presenting a dilemma that has been highlighted by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Walsh, M.T.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2007 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13986864/HumanWildlife-Conflict-Unequal-Knowledge-and-the-Failure-to-Conserve-the-Zanzibar-Leopard-Panthera-pardus-adersi/ | title = Human-Wildlife Conflict, Unequal Knowledge and the Failure to Conserve the Zanzibar Leopard  (''Panthera pardus adersi'') | work = Poster presented to the Felid Biology and Conservation Conference, Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU), University of Oxford, 17–21 September 2007 | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Goldman, H.V. |author2=Walsh, M.T. |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2008 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13986833/When-Culture-Threatens-the-Conservation-of-Biological-Diversity-The-Tragic-Case-of-the-Zanzibar-Leopard-Panthera-pardus-adersi/ | title = When Culture Threatens the Conservation of Biological Diversity: The Tragic Case of the Zanzibar Leopard (''Panthera pardus adersi'') | work = Poster presented to Sustaining Cultural and Biological Diversity in a Rapidly Changing World: Lessons for Global Policy, Thirteenth Annual Symposium of the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation, American Museum of Natural History, New York, 2–5 April 2008 | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walsh | first1 = M.T. | last2 = Goldman | first2 = H.V. | year = 2012 | title = Chasing Imaginary Leopards: Science, Witchcraft and the Politics of Conservation in Zanzibar | journal = Journal of Eastern African Studies | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 727–746 | doi = 10.1080/17531055.2012.729778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=M.T.|last2=Goldman|first2=H.V.|date=|year=2017|title=Cryptids and credulity: The Zanzibar leopard and other imaginary beings|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781317180463/chapters/10.4324/9781315567297-11|journal=Anthropology and Cryptozoology: Exploring Encounters with Mysterious Creatures|language=en|publisher=Routledge|publication-place=London|volume=|pages=54–90|doi=10.4324/9781315567297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible survival==
In 2018, a camera trap, placed for an [[Animal Planet]] show called ''Extinct or Alive'', caught apparent footage of a leopard on Unguja Island. The leopard appeared smaller than leopards from the mainland, and seemed to have smaller, more solid spots than normally seen on African leopards. Further investigations are planned in order to confirm whether or not this is a Zanzibar leopard, and whether a viable population still exists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
