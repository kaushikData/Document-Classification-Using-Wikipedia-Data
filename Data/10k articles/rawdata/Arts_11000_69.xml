An '''animal painter''' is an artist who specialises in (or is known for their skill in) the portrayal of animals.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' dates the first express use of the term "animal painter" to the mid-18th century: by English [[physician]], [[Natural history|naturalist]] and writer [[John Berkenhout]] (1726-1791).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/animal-painting |title=Animal painting |publisher=''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 20th century, ''wildlife artist'' became a more usual term for contemporary animal painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlandtrust.org/gallery/exhibitions/wildlife-art-20th-century |title=Wildlife Art of the 20th Century |publisher=[[Woodland Trust]] |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Especially in the 17th century, animal painters would often collaborate with other artists, who would either paint the main subject in a [[history painting|historical]] or mythological piece, or the [[Landscape painting|landscape]] background in a decorative one. [[Frans Snyders]], a founder of the Baroque animal painting tradition, often provided the animals, and also still lifes of food, for [[Peter Paul Rubens]]; a different landscape specialist might provide the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frans-Snyders |title=Frans Snyders |publisher=''[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]]'' |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dutch Golden Age]] such specialists tended to produce smaller genre paintings concentrating on their specialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gnrn/hd_gnrn.htm |title=Frans Snyders |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal painters came lower down in the [[hierarchy of genres]], but the best painters could make a very good living; many royal and aristocratic patrons were more interested in their subject matter than that of the more prestigious genres. Mainly in England, there were still more specialised painters from the 18th century who produced portraits of racehorses and prize specimens of livestock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10429771/Why-the-George-Stubbs-paintings-were-worth-saving.html |title=Why the George Stubbs paintings were worth saving |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in France animal subjects continued to be decorative [[Capriccio (painting)|capriccios]] often set around garden statuary.

In 2014 ''[[The Guardian]]'' nominated ''[[The Goldfinch (painting)|The Goldfinch]]'' (1654) by [[Carel Fabritius]] (1622-1654) as the finest animal portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/jun/27/top-10-animal-portraits-in-art |title=The top 10 animal portraits in art |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animalier==
[[Animalier]], as a collective plural noun, is a term used in [[antiques]] for small-scale sculptures of animals in particular (animalier bronzes), but also paintings of animals. Large numbers of these were produced - often mass-produced - in the 19th century in France and elsewhere. Many earlier examples can be found, but [[animalier]] sculpture became more popular, and reputable, in early 19th century Paris, with the works of [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] (1795-1875) - for whom the term was coined, decisively, by critics in 1831&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O110845/walking-lion-statuette-barye-antoine-louis/ |title=Walking lion |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and [[Christopher Fratin]] (1801-1864).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/collectables/30507/rise-of-the-animal-sculptures.html |title=Rise of the animal sculptures |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 19th-century, a taste for animal subjects was widespread among the middle-classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O171334/an-indian-panther-lying-down-statuette-barbedienne-ferdinand/ |title=An Indian panther lying down |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife conservation==
Many modern wildlife artists or art groups hold benefits to support [[wildlife conservation]], or participate in contests held by wildlife conservation organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the AFC |url=http://www.natureartists.com/ |publisher=Artists for Conservation |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arto Haapala''' (born 1959) is a Finnish philosopher, aesthetician and Professor of [[Aesthetics]] at the Department of Philosophy, History, Culture and Art Studies at [[Helsinki University]], [[Finland]]. Haapala received his PhD from [[Birkbeck, University of London]] in 1985. He is also active in the work of the [[Finnish Society for Aesthetics]] and the [[International Institute of Applied Aesthetics]] in [[Lahti]], Finland.

In addition to aesthetics,&lt;ref name="Gracyk2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gracyk|first=Theodore|title=Listening to Popular Music, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Led Zeppelin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deweKVG-ZAEC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=27 February 2011|year=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-06983-5|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haapala also specialises in hermeneutics, especially the philosophy of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3816">'''Baharestan''', (in Persian: ÿ®Ÿáÿßÿ±ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ), (pronounced as ''B«éhƒÅrestƒÅn'' or ''Bahaarestaan'') (meaning ''the land of spring'', ''the spring orchard'' or ''the spring garden''), is a [[Persian language|Persian]] book written by [[Jami]] that contains [[prose]]. It has stories, [[Narrative|tales]] and moral advice mainly in prose, but also in [[poetry]]. Baharestan is divided into eight [[chapter (books)|chapter]]s, an introduction, and a final part. Each of its chapters is called a ''rowzeh'' (from [[Arabic]] rawzah, meaning ''paradise'' or ''heaven''). Jami wrote this book in a year in the 9th century after [[Hegira|Muhammad's departure]] to Medina. In the introduction of Baharestan, Jami stated that he had written this book in the style of [[Saadi Shirazi]]'s [[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]] for his son who was ten years old at the time and was studying. Baharestan has content about [[Sufism]] and [[mysticism]]. There are 469 [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of poetry in this book; 16 verses being in Arabic and the rest in Persian. Baharestan has [[saj']] in its texts and the type of its prose is [[rhymed prose]]; i.e. it is rhythmic. Each chapter in Baharestan has a specific topic; for example, in the seventh chapter, the topic is the life and the biography of some poets.

'''Cambia''' is an [[Australia]]n-based global [[non-profit]]  [[social enterprise]] focusing on [[open science]], [[biology]], innovation system reform and [[intellectual property]]. Its projects include the [[Patent Lens]], its successor [http://www.lens.org The Lens],  and the [[Biological Innovation for Open Society]] Initiative.

Cambia derives its name from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[verb]] ''cambiar'', to change.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cambiar&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cambia was established in 1992 by [[Richard Anthony Jefferson]], a leading molecular biologist responsible for the invention of the [[GUS reporter system]], with substantial early participation by Steven G Hughes, [https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kate-wilson/27/41a/275 Kate J. Wilson], Andrzej Kilian, Chris A. Fields and Sujata Lakhani.  Jefferson describes his vision to found a non-profit organisation in ''Innovations'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/itgg.2006.1.4.13|title=Science as Social Enterprise: The CAMBIA BiOS Initiative|journal=Innovations|date=Fall 2006|first=Richard|last=Jefferson|volume=1|issue=4|pages=13‚Äì44|id= |url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/bios/3067/version/default/part/AttachmentData/data/INNOV0104_pp13-44_innovations-in-practice_jefferson.pdf|format=|accessdate=2010-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide more efficient and effective tools to solve the problems of agriculture and society.

In 1992, Cambia relocated to [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] from The Netherlands, to oversee and troubleshoot the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s [[rice]] biotechnology network in Asia. During this time, Jefferson, Wilson and the growing Cambia team visited hundreds of laboratories to help develop, improve, and apply biotechnology capabilities, particularly pertaining to rice. Cambia offered scientific courses and workshops, and increasing assistance in [[Intellectual Property]] management.   Cambia's ethic was influenced by Jefferson's early years in enabling technology invention and distribution, but greatly refined through increasing awareness of socially and scientifically complex systems and using new thinking about biological evolution (including the [[Hologenome theory of evolution|Hologenome Theory of Evolution]]) as models for institution building and collaboration.

Cambia became one of the first social enterprises to use a hybrid licensing model to fund its public good activities.  By selectively patenting important technologies, then creating tiered licensing models for their use, Cambia was able to ensure all parties fair access, but larger licensees would be required to pay more for their non-exclusive use, thus subsidising new developments and distribution and support to less wealthy users, including small enterprises and the public sector in the developing world.  This model - developed also by the social entrepreneur [[David Green (social entrepreneur)|David Green]] for universal access to eye care - is now becoming a pillar of social enterprise function.

Over time Cambia's focus moved away from biotechnology and towards innovation systems and Intellectual Property.   The Patent Lens and its successor The Lens are now the primary focus of Cambia. Cambia's goal has always been to enable and democratise innovation and their move towards free and open tools that help people understand intellectual property landscapes is a continuation of those values. In this way they have changed from a wet-science research institute into a strategic system-changing social enterprise.

==Projects==
Cambia's work to freely distribute scientific tools and techniques gave rise to the [[Biological Innovation for Open Society|Biological Open Source (BiOS)]] Initiative in 2005. Through an open-source biotechnology license and [[Material Transfer Agreement]] (MTA) developed in 2005-2007, BiOS sought to establish [[freedom to operate]] for innovators by providing and exemplifying legal instruments by which innovators could collaboratively use intellectual property protection as a means to share and jointly improve technology for wider utility. BiOS was built on the back of Jefferson's invention of the GUS-based reporter system and the creation of TransBacter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentlens.net/daisy/bioforge_transbacter/3187.html |title=TransBacter Project |accessdate=2010-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a work-around for the creation of transgenic plants bypassing the highly patented [[Agrobacterium]] genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gene transfer to plants by diverse species of bacteria|journal=Nature|date=2005-02-10|first=Wim|last=Broothaerts|author2=Heidi J. Mitchell |author3=Brian Weir |author4=Sarah Kaines |author5=Leon M.A. Smith |author6=Wei Jang |author7=Jorge E. Mayer |author8=Carolina Roa-Rodriguez |author9=Richard A.

Another of Cambia's projects was the development in 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Jaccoud D, Peng K, Feinstein D, Kilian A (February 2001). "Diversity arrays: a solid state technology for sequence information independent genotyping". Nucleic Acids Res. 29 (4): E25. {{doi|10.1093/nar/29.4.e25}}. {{PMC|29632}}. {{PMID|11160945}}&lt;/ref&gt; by then Chief Scientist Andrzej Kilian of [[Diversity Arrays Technology]], a solid state sequence agnostic genotyping technology that was spun off into a company, DArT, Pty Ltd to perform agricultural genotyping services to the plant breeding community.

A principal current project of Cambia is the free full-text online patent search and exploration facility and knowledge resource, The Lens (previously the Patent Lens). Launched in 2000 with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation as a US agricultural patent search facility, and substantially expanded in 2005-2007 to encompass patent documents from multiple jurisdictions and all domains, and information on the linkages between patent applications and the status of granted patents, the Patent Lens allowed free searching of almost 10 million full-text patent documents.  It was distinguished as being the only not-for-profit facility of its kind, with international coverage and integrated links to non-patent literature. The Lens was launched in 2013 as the successor to the [[Patent Lens]], making strides in the visual presentation of patent analysis and workspace management; it is the only global patent site with fully open, shareable, annotatable and re-usable data collections.

It also features an open [[biological patent]] facility, PatSeq, led by Professor [[Osmat Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;Osmat A Jefferson, Deniz K√∂llhofer, Thomas H Ehrich &amp; Richard A Jefferson, Transparency tools in gene patenting for informing policy and practice.  Nature Biotechnology 31, 1086‚Äì1093 (2013) {{doi|10.1038/nbt.2755}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with many advanced tools for searching and analysing biological sequences found in patents, to render gene patenting more transparent.  The facility has mapped sequences disclosed in gene patents onto the genomes of humans, mice, maize, rice, soybean and others.

"'''Cambodia'''" is the fourth single by British singer [[Kim Wilde]].  It was released at the end of 1981; a year in which Wilde had already scored three highly successful hit singles and a best-selling debut album.

The single was another international success, topping the charts in Sweden and Switzerland and hitting the top ten in several other nations. It was released on the 7" format but also as a 12" single in Germany, although not in a remixed or extended version.  The B-side of both releases was an exclusive non-album track called "Watching for Shapes".

"Cambodia" was later included on Wilde's second album, ''[[Select (album)|Select]]'', which was released six months after the single in May 1982. The album version of "Cambodia" runs for 7:13 minutes, as it is teamed with a more uptempo instrumental version of the song, called "Reprise".

Musically and lyrically, "Cambodia" showed a change in direction for Wilde from the [[new wave music|new wave]] feel of her debut album. The song was mainly synth-driven, with oriental-sounding percussion.

The lyrics were inspired by the [[Operation Menu]] bombing campaign of Cambodia by the United States during the [[Vietnam War]].

It has sold 1,080,000 copies in France.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infodisc.fr/Ventes_Chansons_Tout_Temps.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
{{Listen|pos=left|filename=Kim Wilde - Cambodia sample.ogg|title="Cambodia"|description=A 21-second sample of "Cambodia".|format =[[Ogg]]}}
"Cambodia" was written by [[Marty Wilde]] and [[Ricki Wilde]] and has a length of seven minutes and thirteen seconds. ''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Chris Mugan found the song reminiscent of a ''[[film noir]]''.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; Stewart Mason of [[AllMusic]] noted that the song lacks the [[bubblegum pop]] influence present on Wilde's [[Kim Wilde (album)|self-titled debut album]], and is instead more synthesizer-driven.&lt;ref name=all/&gt; Matt James of ''[[PopMatters]]'' felt that the song was an attempt by Kim Wilde to prove that she could tackle serious issues, in the vein of [[The Human League]]'s "[[The Lebanon (song)|The Lebanon]]" (1984) and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s "[[Russians (song)|Russians]]" (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.popmatters.com/164907-parallels-xii-2495801812.html | title = Parallels: XII| date = 2012-11-12 | accessdate = 2018-03-16 | last = James | first = Matt | work = [[PopMatters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
According to [[Yahoo!]], songs like "Cambodia", "[[View from a Bridge]]" (1982) and Wilde's version of "[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]" (1986) brought her "very close to [the] hearts" of [[Australians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://au.news.yahoo.com/sunrise/a/33101959/kim-wilde-howard-jones-return-to-australia/ | title =

Stewart Mason of [[AllMusic]] noted that "Kim Wilde's second album didn't score any hits on the level of the debut's 'Kids in America,' although the dramatic 'Cambodia' was a sort of cult favorite in some circles."&lt;ref name=all&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/select-r2300522/review | title = Kim Wilde Select review | accessdate = 2012-05-10 | last = Mason | first = Stewart | work = [[AllMusic]] | publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the same website, John Bush called the track a "fan favorite" and an "odd, chilling attempt to record a dirge for Southeastern Asia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-kim-wilde-mw0000397732 | title =

In his review of ''[[The Singles Collection 1981‚Äì1993]]'' in ''All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'', Mike DeGagne wrote that "Only the unbecoming 'Cambodia' and the hollowed out '[[Child Come Away]]' should be avoided on this collection, as both lack the spirit that Wilde usually packs."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3087">'''Design controls''' designates the application of a formal [[Design management|methodology]] to the conduct of [[new product development|product development]] activities.
It is often mandatory (by regulation) to implement such practice when designing and developing products within regulated industries (e.g. [[medical devices]]).

== Medical devices ==

Since 1990, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has required that [[medical device]] manufacturers that want to market certain categories of medical devices in the USA follow Design Control requirements (21 CFR 820.30). At a high level, this regulation requires:
* [[Design and development planning]]
* [[Design input]], including intended use and [[Voice of the customer|user needs]] (also known as customer attributes)
* [[Design output]], including evaluation of conformance to design input requirements through:
** Design verification confirming that the design output meets the design input requirements ("did we design the device right?")
** Design validation ensuring that the devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses ("did we design the right device?")
* [[Design review]]
* [[Design transfer]] ensuring that the device design is correctly translated into production specifications
* [[Design change|Design changes]]
* [[Design history file]], a demonstration that the design was developed according to the approved design plan and 21 CFR 820.30.

The [[Medical Devices Directive]] (MDD 93/42/EEC) similarly lists several requirements regarding the design of a medical device.
'''[[ISO 13485]]''' is a voluntary standard that contains section 7.3 Design and Development recommending which procedures should be put in place by manufacturers in order to have a quality system that will comply with MDD 93/42/EEC.

The objective of Design Controls, in this context, is to require that manufacturers follow a methodologically-sound process to develop a medical device, with the intent of improving the probability that the device will reach an acceptable level of [[efficacy]] and safety.

'''El C√≥ndor Pasa''' ({{IPA-es|el Ààkondo…æ pasa|pron}}, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "The [[Andean condor|Condor]] Passes") is an [[orchestra]]l [[musical composition|musical piece]] from the [[zarzuela]] ''[[El C√≥ndor Pasa (play)|El C√≥ndor Pasa]]'' by the [[Peru]]vian composer [[Daniel Alom√≠a Robles]], written in 1913 and based on traditional [[Andean music]], specifically [[folk music]] from [[music of Peru|Peru]].

Since then, it has been estimated that around the world, more than 4000 versions of the melody have been produced, along with 300 sets of lyrics. In 2004, Peru declared this song as part of the national cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinoamerica-online.info/cult04/musica06.04.html |title=musica musique musica |website=Latinoamerica-online.info |date=2004-04-13 |accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This song is now considered the second national anthem of Peru.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

It is the best-known Peruvian song in the English-speaking world due to a 1970 cover by [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] on their ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' album. Their version is called "'''El C√≥ndor Pasa (If I Could)'''".

==Original zarzuela version==
In 1913, Peruvian songwriter [[Daniel Alom√≠a Robles]] composed "El C√≥ndor Pasa", and the song was first performed publicly at the Teatro Mazzi in [[Lima]].&lt;ref name=PCOLRepublica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acuarela.se/ElCondorPasa.htm |title="El C√≥ndor Pasa" patrimonio cultural de la naci√≥n |website=Acuarela.se |accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was originally a musical piece in the Peruvian zarzuela (musical play), ''[[El c√≥ndor pasa (zarzuela)|El c√≥ndor pasa]]''.

Its music was composed by Daniel Alom√≠a Robles in 1913 and its script was written by Julio de La Paz (pseudonym of the Limenian dramatist Julio Baudouin). The piano arrangement of this play's most famous melody was legally registered on May 3, 1933 by The Edward B. Marks Music Corp. in the [[Library of Congress]], under the number 9643. The zarzuela is written in prose and consists of one musical play and two acts.

In July 2013, the Colectivo Cultural Centenario El C√≥ndor Pasa cultural association re-edited the original script which had been lost for a period of time, and published it together with a CD containing the recorded dialogues and seven musical pieces. The music from the original score was reconstructed by musicologist Luis Salazar Mej√≠a with the collaboration of musicians Daniel Dorival and Claude Ferrier and the support of cultural promoter Mario Cerr√≥n Fetta, and re-released on November 14, 15, and 16, 2013 at the Teatro UNI in Lima to celebrate its first centenary. The zarzuela included the famous homonymous melody, without lyrics, based on the traditional Andean music of Peru, where it was declared a National Cultural Heritage in 2004.

In 1965, the American musician [[Paul Simon]] heard for the first time a version of the melody by the band [[Los Incas]] in a performance at the ''Th√©√¢tre de l'Est parisien'' in Paris in which both were participating. Simon became friendly with [[Los Incas]] band, later even touring with them and producing their first US-American album. He asked the band for permission to use the song in his production. The band's director and founding member [[Jorge Milchberg]], who was collecting royalties for the song as co-author and arranger, responded erroneously that it was a traditional Peruvian composition. Milchberg told Simon he was registered as the arrangement's co-author and collected royalties.

In 1970, the [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] duo covered the Los Incas version, adding some English lyrics which in turn added Paul Simon to the author credits under the song name "El C√≥ndor Pasa (If I Could)". The instrumental version by Los Incas was used as the base track. They included the song on the 1970 album ''[[Bridge Over Troubled Water]]''. Simon &amp; Garfunkel released their version as a single in the U.S., which reached #18 on the [[Billboard Pop Singles]] chart and #6 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary|Easy Listening]] chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961‚Äì2001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fall 1970. This cover achieved major international success and fame.

In regard to the Simon &amp; Garfunkel version, [[Daniel Alom√≠a Robles]], Jorge Milchberg, and Paul Simon are now all listed as songwriters, with Simon listed alone as the author of the English lyrics. However, Daniel Alom√≠a Robles was not originally listed as the composer because Jorge Milchberg had told Simon that the song was considered an Andean folk melody. He further stated that he was the registered co-author and arranger of the composition.

===Copyright lawsuit===
In late 1970, Daniel Alom√≠a Robles' son [[Armando Robles Godoy]], a Peruvian filmmaker, filed a successful copyright lawsuit against Paul Simon. The grounds for the lawsuit extended that the song had been composed by his father, who had copyrighted the song in the United States in 1933.&lt;ref name=PCOLRepublica/&gt; Armando Robles Godoy said that he held no ill will towards Paul Simon for what he considered a "misunderstanding" and an "honest mistake".&lt;ref name=PCOLElcine&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.diariolaprimeraperu.com/online/semana/images/ediciones/pdf/6/6-4.pdf |title=El cine, los libros, la muerte (an interview with Armando Robles Godoy) |language=Spanish |journal=Diario La Primera |author=Juan Carlos Bondy |date=July 6, 2008 |accessdate=2011-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710123034/http://www.diariolaprimeraperu.com/online/semana/images/ediciones/pdf/6/6-4.pdf |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was an almost friendly court case because Paul Simon was very respectful of other cultures. It was not carelessness on his part," said Armando Robles Godoy.&lt;ref name=PCOLElcine/&gt; "He happened to hear the song in Paris from a vernacular group Los Incas. He liked it, he went to ask the band for permission and they gave him the wrong information. Jorge Milchberg told him it was a traditional folk song from the 18th century and not my father's composition. It was a court case without further complications."&lt;ref name=PCOLElcine/&gt;

Later that year, [[Perry Como]] released a cover of Paul Simon's English version on his album ''[[It's Impossible (album)|It's Impossible]]'', while [[Julie Felix]] had a UK Top 20 hit with it, taking advantage of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's decision not to release their version as a UK single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kokomo.ca/cd_review/cd_finder/el_condor_pasa_cd_finder.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126073452/http://kokomo.ca/cd_review/cd_finder/el_condor_pasa_cd_finder.htm |archivedate=November 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armando Robles Godoy subsequently wrote new Spanish lyrics for the song, taking Paul Simon's version as a reference.

[[File:Reliquary True Cross c800 Byzantine.jpg|thumb|Fieschi Morgan Stauroth√®que - early 9th century]]

The '''Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke''' is a small [[reliquary]] designed to hold a relic of the [[True Cross|true cross]], it is 1 1/16 x 4 1/16 x 2 13/16 inches (2.7 x 10.3 x 7.1&amp;nbsp;cm) overall with lid. It is an example of [[Byzantine enamel]]ing. The box is dated to 843 (some scholars speculate an earlier date of 815).&lt;ref name="Cormack 114"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Robin|title=Byzantine Art|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192842110|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both dates hover around the second wave of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] from 814‚Äì842, allowing this piece to become a lens into the post iconoclastic art. These reliquaries doubled as an [[icon]] in style and purpose. The physical material of icons and the content within the reliquary were believed to contained a spirit or energy. It was believed that reliquaries contained great power, thus explains its preservation throughout the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitzinger|first1=Ernst|title=Christian Imagery: Growth and Impact|date=1980|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous theories of where this piece was created and its movement. It's currently on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum]].

==Physical description==
The [[wikt:staurotheke|staurotheke]] is made from [[gilded silver]], gold, [[Byzantine enamel|enamel]] worked in [[cloisonn√©]], and [[niello]]. The front lid depicts Christ on the cross wearing a [[colobium]] (sleeveless tunic) flanked by Mary and Saint John the Theologian. On either side of Christ head there is a sun and moon and Greek text which says "Here is your son...Here is your Mother" and each figure is called out by name; Mother of God, Jesus, and John. Christ eyes are open and appears to be alive which is an important dating factor, as 9th century crucifixion scenes often detailed Christ's eyes closed, a crown of thorns, bleeding hands and feet, and the skull of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilensky|first1=S.F.|title=Pre-Iconoclastic Byzantine Art and the Fieschi-Oppenheim-Morgan Reliquary of the True Cross|date=1981|publisher=Empire State College|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bordering the Crucifixion scene are 14 saints who are depicted subtly different from one another, starting from the top left going counter clockwise they are: Saint Demetrios, [[Saint Eustathios]], [[Saint Lawrence]], [[Saint Luke|Luke]], [[Saint Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], Saint Damiano, Saint Kosmas, [[Saint Gregory I|Saint Gregory the Miracle-Worker]], [[Bartholomew]], [[Matthew Gospel|Matthew]], [[Jude the Apostle|Jude]], and [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]]. 

Underneath the lid the surface is divided into four parts and created using niello, the top left, the [[Annunciation]]; top right, the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] and bathing of Jesus; bottom left, the [[Crucifixion]] (which mimics the front lid); and the bottom right, the Anastasis (Christ descent into Hell) scene pulling Adam and Eve out of Hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilensky|first1=S.F|title=Pre-Iconoclastic Byzantine Art and the Fieschi-Oppenheim-Morgan Reliquary of the True Cross|date=1981|publisher=Empire State College|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek text within the scenes translates to, "Hail, full of grace!" and "Here is your son...Here is your mother."&lt;ref name=Met&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/472562|website=Met Museum|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lid was only removed by intimate viewers, so these scenes might have been more privileged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitzinger|first1=Ernst|title=Christian Imagery: Growth and Impact|date=1981|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The interior of the box is divided by a [[Patriarchal cross|Patriarchal]] (double cross) walls which create 5 sections. It is believed to have contained a wooden cross relic that would have fit perfectly within the main section, the 4 surrounding compartments would have contained other Holy relics, such as bones, hair, cloth, etc. 

Along the sides of the box are 13 saints with halos and a golden latch; [[Saint Anastasios]], [[Saint Nicholas]], [[Saint Platon]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]], Saint Prokopios, [[Saint George]], Saint Merkourios, Saint Eustrastios, [[Saint Panteleimon]], [[Saint Andrew]], [[John the Evangelist|Saint John]], [[Saint Paul]], [[Saint Peter]].&lt;ref name=Met/&gt; The saints along the sides are represented with great variance, despite the approximately one square inch space, making distinguishes between color of eyes, hair style, and facial hair. The base of the container is gold stamped with a dot pattern into a shape of a Latin cross, with circular or disc shaped ends. 

Overall, the box is small in size and packs in many narratives and figures. Its cloisonne is considered crude and lettering is botched for Byzantine standards.&lt;ref name="Cormack 114"/&gt; Other scholars have called it naive and stiff compared to other cloisonn√© and enamel pieces of that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilensky|first1=S.F|title=Pre-Iconoclastic Byzantine Art and the Fieschi-Oppenheim-Morgan Reliquary of the True Cross|date=1981|publisher=Empire State College|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary colors of the reliquary enamel are emerald green, blue, maroon, gold, and white.

==Creation and movement==
Artisans were persecuted, like the story of [[Lazarus Zographos|Lazarus]] whose hands were burnt after defying to destroy and renounce his craft. The Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke is an object that offers one perspective of art created after the decline in religious crafts. The trade of skilled artisans needed to be outsourced beyond the Byzantine empire and outside the purge of figurative art. Rome continued to create and explore art techniques and played a role reeducating Byzantine artists. Rome is a source for enamel art as the colors used in the Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke were in production there and the city was a place of refuge for [[wikt:iconophile|iconophiles]].&lt;ref name="Cormack 114"/&gt; It is most popularly believed that this was created in the shadows from iconoclasm or just after iconoclasm in Constantinople.

[[File:True Cross Relic Dimensions.png|thumbnail|Reliquary and True Cross Dimensions]]
The reliquary could have arrived in Italy by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in 1204, as many precious art pieces entered western Europe.&lt;ref name="Williamson 66"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williamson|first1=G.C|title=The Oppenheim Reliquary and its Contents|date=1913|page=66|url=http://scans.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/1/16/burlingtonmagazi23londuoft/burlingtonmagazi23londuoft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also common that monks traveling west would give gifts to the monasteries.&lt;ref name="Wilensky 46"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilensky|first1=S.F|title=Pre-Iconoclastic Byzantine Art and the Fieschi-Oppenheim-Morgan Reliquary of the True Cross|date=1981|publisher=Empire State College|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theory of the relic being separated from the reliquary was due to its poor craftsmanship or creation by an immature student and was not worthy to house the true cross relic.&lt;ref name="Williamson 66"/&gt; The relic was taken out and worn on a necklace by Pope Innocent IV. Pope Innocent IV presented the relic to his new basilica, San Salvatore di Lavagna, in 1245 (where it still resides) and the box became an heirloom of the Fieschi Family. 
The relic and reliquary have never been put together. Based on the dimensions presented of the reliquary&lt;ref name=Met/&gt; and cross relic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalton|first1=O.M.|title=Byzantine Enamels in Mr. Pierpont Morgan's Collection.|date=1912|publisher=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 21|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; here is a diagram that shows that the relic could fit within the reliquary.

Another theory is that the reliquary was never brought to the west but was created in the west. Evidence of enamel coloring and the art practice being revived in Rome supports this theory. In addition, Saint Lawrence, depicted on the reliquary was a popular saint in the west beginning in the 5th century but not in the east until the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Wilensky 46"/&gt;

In April 1887 the box was purchased at an auction by Freiherr Albert Von Oppenheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalton|first1=O.M.|title=Byzantine Enamels in Mr. Pierpont Morgan's Collection.|date=1912|publisher=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 21|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 it was purchased by [[J. Pierpont Morgan]] in London and given to the Met Museum in 1913.

The series was considered [[Cultural icon|iconic]] in [[Asia]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, since it came at a time when the public was being exposed to [[video games]] for the first time.

==Story==
The story is about a young boy named Arashi Ishino who is obsessed with video games. He would spend all his time trying to beat the games and conquer the local [[Arcade game|arcades]]. He would meet competitors like Satoru Daimonji and Ishii, who would try to out match him with higher scores. At a certain point in each episode, he would display his special skill of unleashing a [[top]] which will spin so fast that both the top and his hands would catch on fire. On release, the spin would land on or near the [[Arcade cabinet|cabinet]] panels, turning the ordinary button into a [[turbo button]] thus giving him a major advantage. His appearance is known for being bucktoothed, and he always wears a hat labeled "Arashi" with a picture of a [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprited]] alien.

''Game Center Arashi'' was the first animation with a [[gamer]] as the lead character and have the plot revolve around life with competitive gaming. Some of the games featured in the show include [[Space Invaders]], [[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]], [[Galaxian]], though they were not explicitly named. Some of Arashi's gaming techniques even have special names like "Blazed Top", "Vacuum Hurricane Shot", "Fish Stance".&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Jonathan. McCarthy Helen. [2006] (2006).

==Additional versions and appearances==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
In 1999, the series spawned a [[PlayStation]] [[novel]] called [[Game Center Arashi R]]. In 2004 [[Microsoft]] [[Tokyo]] used the character of Arashi as a mascot to boost [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] sales and image.

While the 2002 manga [[Arcade Gamer Fubuki]] reused the concept of a powerful gamer in the arcades, and also spawned a TV series of the same name, that show used entirely different characters and plots, modernizing while separating itself from the 1982 counterpart.

In 2006 the Let's TV Play Classic series of Plug and Plays used Arashi as a mascot.

'''''Interzone''''' is a collection of unpublished short stories and other early works by [[William S. Burroughs]] from 1953 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/william-s-burroughs/interzone/|title=INTERZONE by William S. Burroughs {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was first published by [[Viking Press|Viking Penguin]] in 1989, although several of the stories had already been printed elsewhere, including an earlier publication titled ''Early Routines''. The title was inspired by the [[Tangier International Zone|International Zone]] in [[Tangiers]], Morocco, where Burroughs lived for a time and by which he was greatly influenced.

A notable inclusion is "Twilight's Last Gleamings", written in 1938 in collaboration with childhood friend Kells Elvins, and widely thought to be Burroughs' first attempt at fiction. The villain of the piece, Doctor Benway, was to play a pivotal role in ''[[Naked Lunch]]''. (This story differs from another Burroughs piece titled "Twilight's Last Gleamings," which was published in the 1970s collection, ''[[Exterminator!]]''.)

''Interzone'' features many characters and concepts that would manifest themselves in ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', ''[[Nova Express]]'' and others. At one point, Interzone was considered as a title for ''[[Naked Lunch]]''. Moreover, the concluding section entitled "WORD" was part of the original ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' manuscript but was cut during the editing process (according to the introduction by editor [[James Grauerholz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257582.Interzone|title=Interzone|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the short pieces were adapted into other media. Burroughs recorded the stories "[[The Junky's Christmas]]" and "Spare Ass Annie," which were set to music and released on the album ''[[Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales]]''. "[[The Junky's Christmas]]" was also adapted as an animated film in the 1990s.

== Contents ==
The book is divided into three sections:

=== Part 1: Stories ===
# Twilight's Last Gleamings (a different piece from the one in the earlier collection, ''[[Exterminator!]]'')

# Driving Lesson
#[[The Junky's Christmas]]

== Name ==
A small church built into the defensive tower was consecrated in the memory of [[:ru:–ò–æ–∞–Ω–Ω –ö—É—â–Ω–∏–∫|St. John Kushchnik]], who lived in 5th century in [[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]] and was considered a saint patron of [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Samoylovych]].&lt;ref name="pamyatky"&gt;[http://pamyatky.kiev.ua/streets/lavra/verhnya-teritoriya-lavri-1120-st/svyato-uspenska-kiyevo-pecherska-lavra-muri-oboronni-verhnoyi-teritoriyi-1698-1701-19-stolittya/svyato-uspenska-kiyevo-pecherska-lavra-vezha-ioanna-kushchnika-1696-1701 An account of historic and cultural monuments, Kyiv] ({{lang-uk|–ó–≤—ñ—Ç –ø–∞–º'—è—Ç–æ–∫ —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó —Ç–∞ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∏, –ö–∏—ó–≤.}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The tower is irregular-octagonal in plan, elongated in east-west direction. It is built from brick, covered in white plaster and decorated with profiled [[cornice]]. The tower has three stories covered with tinned [[cupola]] and gilded cross on top. Ceilings of the ground and the first floors were originally wooden, but were later replaced by stone, thus increasing tower fire resistance. The tower height from the ground to the tip of the cross is 25 meters, its other dimensions decrease with height being 9,0 x 7,3 meters at the ground level and 8,5&amp;nbsp;x 7,0 meters on the first floor level.&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt; Octagonal walls have windows for [[shotgun]]s and small cannons. The tower had a gallery on the monastery side, supported by wooden consoles connected to the general system of defensive walls. The upper tier of the tower has a semicircular window openings. The structure is built in a Kiev style of [[Ukrainian Baroque]].&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt;

== History ==
The tower was built between 1696 and 1701. It was heavily damaged by the great Lavra fire of 1718.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CY%5CKyivanCaveMonastery.htm Kyivan Cave Monastery] at [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/ the Encyclopedia of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt; Historic documents state that three towers with churches, among them St. John Kushchik, were set to be renovated in 1721, along other restorations of Lavra, but the plan was not realized until 1797. However, there was some maintenance before that ‚Äì in 1785 the tower received a tin roof.&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt;

In 1918 the tower was damaged again ‚Äì this time from the explosion at Zvirinets, then repaired the same year. Major renovations in 20th century were done in 1953&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt; and in 1972. The last one was carried out under supervision of art historian V. Pidgora and architect A. Kulagin. During that renovation the lower walls and vaults of the tower were strengthened, the windows of the top floor and tier under cupola were reopened, and the cross re-gilded.&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt;

'''Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe''' (born UK 1945, US resident since 1968) is a painter, art critic, theorist, and educator.  His work is in the permanent collections of the Albright-Knox Gallery of Art, Buffalo, NY; The Getty Study Center, Los Angeles; the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami; the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation in Los Angeles and Minneapolis; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and other public, corporate and private collections.

==Painting==
 
Gilbert-Rolfe has shown in New York fairly regularly since 1970, and sporadically elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5362f455e4b0609f727f6d57/t/56735e5c69492e0c12769451/1450401372705/JGR+CV+%282015%29+pdf.pd Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe curriculum vitae]&lt;/ref&gt;  
Regarding the general consensus that describes his work as ‚ÄòGeometric Abstraction,‚Äô Gilbert-Rolfe says he wishes people would think about what he does with the category rather than how his work fits into it. He says he went to an exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London in 1963 to see the Pop art that was in it but what caught his attention instead, causing him to decide he needed to go to America, were the paintings of the New York School and especially and specifically Barnett Newman‚Äôs Vir Heroicus Sublimis (1951.)  The space in it felt as active as the space in Howard Hawkes‚Äô Red River, which had entered his imagination when he was a child and stayed there.  Rachel Kushner discusses his indebtedness to Newman and Hawkes, and much else in the work and practice, going on to say that she made an ‚Äúautomatic and instinctive‚Äù association of his painting Hottest Part of the Day (2001) with a poem of Sappho‚Äôs, and that it is her ‚Äúsense that Gilbert-Rolfe has some uncanny mesh with feminine sensibilities‚Ä¶ (His) electric verdure pulses‚Äîseductive, then bewildering, then seductive.  Boucher, then radiator coolant, then Boucher.‚Äù&lt;ref name=Kushner&gt;{{cite book|contributor=Rachel Kushner|contribution=Warfare and Pleasure:  Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe‚Äôs Paintings|editor=Rex Butler|title=Art after Deconstruction: Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe|location=Brisbane|publisher=Editions 3|date=2011|page=136|isbn= 9780646552972|author=Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Flattered by Kushner‚Äôs suggestion, he is however inclined to resist her further suggestion that ‚ÄúA line is a kind of violence, cutting the canvas as though it‚Äôs cutting a body.  But color is violence as well, if of a soft, smothering sort.  A smothering of reason.‚Äù&lt;ref name=Kushner/&gt;  Aside from wondering whether a drawn line doesn‚Äôt only divide but also connect, he is unwilling to accept the smothering of reason part.  He says ‚Äúhis paintings are about complexity and as such have come to be about logic as much as anything else.  Not logic as in philosophy, logic as in music, where one talks of it making sense but does not mean it provides a riddle and its answer.  I want the work to interact with the viewer, to take place in the space around itself and between itself and the person looking at it, and to hold the attention for some time.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, ‚ÄúStatement‚Äù http://www.jeremygilbert-rolfe.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also said that seriousness is generally identified with terror, ‚Äúbut I want to identify it with questions of the formless‚Ä¶ Art has to put you in touch with something that‚Äôs not manageable‚Ä¶. (but) it‚Äôs time to get rid of ‚Ä¶ tough-guy rhetoric about the sublime.  Among other things, it would permit us to get closer to the sublime or sublimes that tough guys are too scared to touch.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Clearwater, ‚ÄúInterview with Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe‚Äù Butler (ed) p.104&lt;/ref&gt;  As Kushner puts it, ‚ÄúGilbert-Rolfe ‚Ä¶ lays out his ante, but never knows where a painting will go.‚Äù&lt;ref name=Kushner/&gt;  
In 2010 he and Rebecca Norton began to work together as the collaboration Awkward x 2, making paintings together and also writing occasional blogs.  Awkward has shown in Brooklyn, Chicago and Louisville to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lecture for Chicago|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=October 2012|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2012/10/artseen/lecture-for-chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Criticism and Theory==
Gilbert-Rolfe writes about art and related topics, including poetry, fiction, fashion, with particular regard to its interaction with photography, technology, and the general state of things in art and how the present situation seems to have emerged.  His publications include two anthologies of his essays,&lt;ref&gt;Immanence and Contradiction: Recent Essays on the Artistic Device (New York: Out of
London Press, 1986).
Beyond Piety: Critical Essays on the Visual Arts, 1986-1993 (Cambridge and New York:
Cambridge University Press, 1995).
&lt;/ref&gt; a book about Frank Gehry‚Äôs architecture co-authored with the architect,&lt;ref&gt;With Frank Gehry, Frank Gehry, The City and Music (London and New York: Routledge, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime''''',&lt;ref&gt;Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime (New York: Allworth Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; '''and other essays and reviews.'''  
''Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime'' reformulates the traditional definition of the differential relationship between beauty and the sublime, in which beauty is a sign of the passive and feminine and the sublime of the active and male‚Äîheroic or terrifying depending on one‚Äôs perspective, or of course both.  In Gilbert-Rolfe‚Äôs version Winckelmann‚Äôs masculine active becomes instead androgynous transitivity, while intransitivity replaces passivity as a still entirely feminine characteristic, the feminine as intransitivity being a sign or force that stands for, or embodies, power as a kind of powerlessness.  As well as redefining the differential, ''Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime''‚Äôs argument also relocates the sublime from nature to technology, and with it subjectivity, from wherever it imagined itself to be to within techno-capitalism.  Here and elsewhere Gilbert-Rolfe suggests that techno-capitalism and the subjectivity that accompanies it are largely made out of all that Heidegger warns against and denounces in his post-war essays on technology, for example the telephone‚Äôs capacity to sever the mutual dependence of space and time.   He has returned to some aspects of this argument in two essays in particular.&lt;ref&gt;‚ÄúAttractiveness and the Uncontrollable, an Update‚Äù in Rex Butler, editor, contributions by Rex Butler, Bonnie Clearwater, Penny Florence, and Rachel Kushner Art After Deconstruction: Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, (Brisbane: Editions 3, 2012)

‚ÄúUncertainty Prone to Vulgarity‚Äù in Temenuga Trifonova, editor, Contemporary Visual Culture and the Sublime (Routledge Advances in Art and Visual Studies) (London and New York: Routledge, 2018)
&lt;/ref&gt;  
Starting out in Artforum, in 1973, he has written something at least once for most of the art magazines over the years, and more often for Critical Inquiry and Bomb.  A founding editor of October, with Rosalind Krauss, Annette Michelson and Lucio Pozzi (who withdrew before the first issue was published,)  Gilbert-Rolfe resigned from the journal after the third issue.

==Honors==
For painting, Gilbert-Rolfe has been honored by two National Endowment for the Arts fellowships (1979, 1989,) a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship (1997,) the Francis Greenberger Award (2001,) and a Pollock-Krasner Fellowship (2017.)  He was awarded an NEA fellowship in criticism in 1974 and was the 1998 recipient of the College Art Association‚Äôs Frank Jewett Mather Award for Art and Architectural Criticism.

==Teaching==
Gilbert-Rolfe retired from teaching at Art Center College of Design in 2015 receiving the title Professor/Chair Emeritus.  He had worked there since 1986, when he was hired to develop an MFA program for the school; before that he taught at Princeton and Cal Arts.

==Other info==
Gilbert-Rolfe has been married twice and has two children, Cyrus, from his first marriage to Jennifer, and Cedric from the second to Annie.  Between them his sons have generated three grandchildren, Harley, Leiah, and Vincent (formerly Maisie.)  Having lived in New York and Los Angeles for forty years, he and Annie now live in Gainesville, Florida.  They have a large garden.

==Career==
===Xscape===
Prior to joining [[Xscape (band)|Xscape]], LaTocha 
Scott had been performing with a group called Precise. While attending Tri-Cities performing arts high school in East Point, Georgia, Scott's sister Tamika met Kandi Burruss. The three began singing together and recruited a fourth member, Tamera Coggins, though her time with the group was short-lived. Soon [[Tameka Cottle|Tameka "Tiny" Cottle]] was asked to audition for the girls, and Xscape was officially formed. After the group's major debut performance at BET's Teen Summit in 1992, the girls were introduced to record executive Ian Burke, who later became the group‚Äôs manager. Xscape soon caught the attention of [[Jermaine Dupri]], who later signed the group to his recording label So So Def Recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous Women of Atlanta|url=http://photos.essence.com/galleries/famousatlantawomen#63932|publisher=Essence.com|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xscape|url=http://search.bet.com/topics/x/xscape.html|publisher=BET.com|accessdate=June 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130117194415/http://search.bet.com/topics/x/xscape.html|archivedate=January 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p143662 |title=Xscape |publisher=AllMusic.com |date= |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group released their debut album, ''[[Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha]]'', on October 12, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=xscape|chart=all}} |title=Xscape: ''Hummin' Comin' At 'Cha'' |publisher=billboard.com |accessdate=2008-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111095622/http://www.billboard.com/artist/431553/xscape/chart |archivedate=November 11, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album peaked at number seventeen the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number three on the [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top R&amp;B Albums]] chart. It was a critical and commercial success, certified platinum within a year, and launched two top ten singles.

After their debut albums success, Xscape released their second studio album, ''[[Off the Hook (Xscape album)|Off the Hook]]'', in 1995. The lead single, "[[Feels So Good (Xscape song)|Feels So Good]]", reached the top forty of the US Hot 100, while "[[Who Can I Run To]]" peaked at number eight. The album eventually went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]].
Their third and final studio album ''[[Traces of My Lipstick]]'' debuted at twenty-eight on the Billboard 200 and at six on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop album chart; over a million copies were sold in the U.S. The album featured the top ten hit "[[The Arms of the One Who Loves You]]", which reached number seven on the Hot 100 chart, and "[[My Little Secret]]",  which reached nine. After ''Traces of My Lipstick'', LaTocha Scott initially left the group to pursue a solo career. The ladies soon regrouped and made appearances on the ''[[Big Momma's House]]'' and ''[[Hardball (film)|Hardball]]'' soundtracks, before going on another hiatus until 2005.

In 2017, [[TV One (U.S. TV network)|TV One]] had planned to produce an unauthorized movie&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-xscape-biopic-drama-20170501-story.html|title=Xscape calls TV One biopic 'disrespectful,' producing its own project|last=Kennedy|first=Gerrick D.|work=latimes.com|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]] which Kandi Burruss did not want to happen against her and the group's legacy. She called other band members to discuss starting a show of their own. The show was named Xscape: Still Kickin‚Äô It, and it was set as a 4-episode [[miniseries]]. The show was launched on November 5, 2017 and is aired on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|BravoTV]]. Before Kandi could rejoin the group, she wanted an apology from band member Tamika Scott claiming in a 2007 interview that Burruss broke up the group by sleeping with their label head [[Jermaine Dupri]] and his father, [[Michael Mauldin (producer)|Michael Mauldin]]. Kandi wanted an apology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/music/real-housewife-kandi-burruss-xscape-reunion/|title=Real Housewife Kandi Burruss Says Getting Back with Her Band Xscape Wasn't Part of Her Plan|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the false statement that Scott told, but did confirm that she and Dupri had been involved (though Burruss claims that wasn't the reason why the group broke up). Kandi got an apology from Tamika.

===Solo work and production===
After the disbanding of [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]], Burruss focused on [[Music production|production]] and songwriting. In 1999, Burruss teamed with groupmate [[Tameka Cottle|Tameka "Tiny" Cottle]] to score the international number one hit "[[No Scrubs]]" for [[TLC (group)|TLC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leffler|first=Samantha|title=Kandi Burruss Poses With Tiny and Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes in Throwback Photo|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/kandi-burruss/articles/2014-01-03-tiny-lisa-left-eye-lopes-photo|work=Wet Paint Entertainment|accessdate=March 15, 2014|date=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Burruss wrote another song, "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]" for [[Destiny's Child]].&lt;ref name=information2&gt;{{cite web|title=OK!

The album did not do as well on the chart as the single did, scoring #72 on the US Billboard 200.

Burruss rewrote and executive produced the song "[[Tardy for the Party]]" for her ''Real Housewives of Atlanta'' co-star [[Kim Zolciak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eggenberger|first=Nicole|title=Kandi Burruss on Kim Zolciak "Tardy for the Party" Lawsuit: "She Really Didn't Win"|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kandi-burruss-on-kim-zolciak-tardy-for-the-party-lawsuit-she-really-didnt-win-20131610|work=Us Weekly|accessdate=March 15, 2015|date=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2013, Kandi Burruss, and her collaborating songwriter/producer, [[Don Vito (producer)|Rodney "Don Vito" Richard]], filed suit against Zolciak for profits earned from "Tardy for the Party". In the documents filed, Burruss' attorney, ''RHOA'' castmate [[The Real Housewives of Atlanta#Cast|Phaedra Parks]], alleges her clients wrote the song for Zolciak and that Zolciak released and sold the single "without [the] plaintiffs' authorization, license or consent." Burruss was also seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent future sales of the song and the "destruction of all copies of the infringing single and any other product of defendant's that infringe plaintiffs' copyrights", punitive damages, attorney's fees, and a jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Us Weekly|title=Celebrity News: Kandi Burruss Sues Kim Zolciak for 'Tardy for the Party' Profits|date=March 14, 2013|accessdate=June 3, 2015|first=Zach |last= Johnson|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kandi-burruss-sues-kim-zolciak-for-tardy-for-the-party-profits-2013143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Ed Sheeran]] released his hugely successful single [[Shape of You]].

==Characters==
*'''Louis "Louie" Anderson''' (voiced by Louie Anderson) Based on Anderson's younger self. Louie is an eight-year-old child, living in the fictional town of Cedar Knoll, [[Wisconsin]]. He is a very sensitive, impressionable, and intelligent young boy. He often uses his gifted sense of humor to deal with difficult situations. He always stands up for his own rights and principles, but also for those of others. His most notable catchphrase used in the series is, "All right!"
*'''Jeannie Harper''' (voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]]) - Louie's best friend. She often defends Louie from local bullies. Louie has a crush on her.
*'''Michael "Mike" Grunewald''' (voiced by [[Justin Shenkarow]]) - Louie's friend with a sarcastic sense of humor. He has a somewhat chill attitude and comes from a rather wealthy family, much to Louie's jealousy.
*'''Toddler Tobolinski''' - Louie's other friend. He is somewhat shorter than the others, about the same height as Louie, and loves activities like recess.
*'''Scott Jensen''' - One of Louie's friends. He appears quite often in the 1st and 3rd seasons. But he is rarely seen in the 2nd season.
*'''Andrew "Andy" Mortimer Anderson''' (voiced by Louie Anderson) - Louie's difficult, but caring father. He is a veteran of [[World War II]] and likes to tell his family stories about his experience at the front in Europe. Much of the humor regarding Andy, involved his comic superiority complex and equally comical unawareness of his own limitations. Though he often appeared out of touch with reality, Andy was secretly a very gifted chess player, a skill Louie briefly displayed possessing, but he hid his gift during the latter half of his life because of the way he was supposedly mistreated for it in his youth (he even went so far as to disguise himself at chess tournaments so he would not be recognized). He is a proud owner of a [[Rambler Six and V8|Rambler]] sedan&lt;ref name="RamblerMan"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229993/ |title=Life with Louie, Season 1, Episode 12, "Born a Rambler Man" |publisher=www.imdb.com |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (most probably a 1959 Rambler Six), that appears on the show in various episodes. His catchphrases: "For crying out loud!" and "I heard that." Despite his appearance, he is a very caring and loving person.
*'''Ora Anderson''' (voiced by [[Edie McClurg]]) - Louie's kind, loving and sweet natured mother. She usually acts as the voice of reason for Louie and Andy.
*'''Thomas "Tommy" Anderson''' (voiced by [[Miko Hughes]]) -  Louie's youngest brother. Louie teases him a lot in the beginning.
*'''Glen Glenn''' (voiced by Justin Shenkarow) - The local bully of Louie‚Äôs school who teases Louie and other children. His mother '''Jen Glenn''' has a huge temper and loud voice which the other citizens don't like.
*'''Craig Eric, Paul George''' - Glen Glenn's friends.
*'''The Melvins''' - A group of chess nerds. One of them is actually named Franklin but is still called Melvin.
*'''Henrietta Shermann''' - Louie's grandmother, mother of Ora. She dies in one of the episodes.
*'''Pepper''' - Louie's obese pet goldfish.
*'''Sid Anderson, John Anderson, Danny Anderson, Peter Anderson''' - Louie's older brothers.
*'''Mr. Jensen, Earl Grunewald, Gus Williams, Mrs. Stillman''' - Louie's neighbors
*''' Laura Anderson, Carol Anderson, Charlie Anderson,  Julie Anderson''' - Louie's older sisters.

==Intro and theme song==
The show's intro involved the main character running toward a TV set, turning one of the set's dials, and showing a live-action video of Louie Anderson as an adult saying, "Let me tell you about my family." Then after that showing clips of the show from Andy Anderson being pulled by sled dogs, Louie sticking chopsticks in his nose, to Louie jumping off a diving board at a swimming pool nearly wasting all the water and getting most of the other participants wet due to the fact of him being overweight, then the show's logo (in Pink) appears on the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, while the main character (wearing sunglasses) eats a dot while sitting on a raft while watching TV on a tire. The intro was used from season 2 to the last season. Season 1 episodes used a live-action intro by Louie Anderson talking to the audience about his childhood, then dissolving into the show.

==Home videos and merchandise==
Based on the popularity of the show, various merchandise was released including apparel, videos of various episodes, a "Lake Winnibigoshish" [[CD-ROM]] [[comic book]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NJDX2U |title=Life with Louie ~ Lake Winnibigoshish |work=Amazon.com |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book series for children. The book series was based on the various episodes of the show and contained six books in total. [[Kids' meal]] toys were also produced for several [[fast-food restaurant]] chains including [[Taco Bell]] (1996), [[Hardee's]] (1997), [[Jack in the Box]] (1997), and [[Dairy Queen]] (1999).

For a time, Life with Louie-branded Spaghetti-O's, in character shapes, were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsVJ4aXYeOo |title=Life with Louie (S01E04) - Behind Every Good Coach Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-08-31 |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2006, TVShowsOnDVD.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=4808 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205010447/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=4808 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2013 |title=Life with Louie - Louie says Louie is coming |date=1 January 2006 |work=tvshowsondvd.com |last=Lacey |first=Gord |accessdate=2 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; posted a news story that ''Life with Louie'' was going to be released on DVD in the US.  The information came from Louie Anderson himself who mentioned this news on a radio program he was a guest on, [[KQRS-FM]]. There has been no other news since then and it is now unknown if this series will ever be released on DVD in the United States. However, three 2-episode sets were released in the United Kingdom in summer 2007 as ''Life with Louie: Volume 1'', ''2'', and ''3''. The sets were released through Boulevard Entertainment as part of the Jetix programming brand.

This is a list of all the characters that have appeared in the animated American-Canadian [[science fiction|science-fiction]]/[[situation comedy]] series ''[[Clone High]]'' (2002‚Äì2003). The series was created by the duo [[Phil Lord and Chris Miller]]. It still occasionally airs reruns on [[Teletoon]] and was briefly aired by [[MTV]] and [[MTV2]] in 2003.

==Development==
According to co-creator Miller the reason for putting historical figures in a school setting was that "We chose these characters because they're sort of mythic figures, even people with a very limited knowledge of history have some preconceived ideas about them, which is part of the fun." Lord adds, "The point of the whole show is that these people are not living up to their genetic forebears."&lt;ref name="Freshman animators"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/17/entertainment/et-solomon17|title=Freshman animators|publisher=articles.latimes.com|date=2003-02-27|accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord and Miller also explained that the development of the character of Gandhi as a " party animal" was because they researched that the young Gandhi was "immature" and "into partying" before witnessing the suffering in [[South Africa]]. Another was the reason why they introduced Ponce De Le√≥n so late in the show, as a parody of how ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' would bring in characters that were never seen before and then kill them off in a melodramatic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlhFghZ1gM |title=Clone High NEW Behind the Scenes Discussion |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cloneparents.jpg|500px|left|thumb|List of main characters and their cloneparents, left to right: Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra and Gandhi]] --&gt;

===Abe Lincoln===
'''Abe Lincoln''' is the clone of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the 16th [[President of the United States]]. He is the main protagonist of the series, and most of the episodes are seen through his [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]]. Abe is an average, awkward, naive, shy, clumsy yet kind teenager who feels he is struggling to live up to the legacy of Abraham Lincoln.

He has been friends with Gandhi since they were babies and also good friends with Joan. Throughout season one Abe desperately pursued Cleopatra, his love interest; at first she used him but he had eventually won her love and becomes her boyfriend starting at the end of the episode ''Sleep of Faith'' in which she agreed to go out with him after he won a drag race (despite the fact Cleo ditched him to be with JFK), they did not start a real relationship until the episode ''Plane Crazy''.

Abe is very skinny and physically weak to complement his weak-willed and indecisive nature and he is claimed to weigh only 104 pounds despite being one of the tallest students in the school. He is often seen to fall into [[peer pressure]] despite his moral values. Though intelligent, he is very unaware when it comes to other people's feelings, as he regularly insulted his friend Joan without even realizing it. He has a bitter rivalry with JFK, mostly involving his attempts to win over Cleopatra and a possible joke to one president being Republican and the other Democrat. Another reason for their rivalry is because JFK is secretly angry over how Abe treats Joan on a daily basis in his attempt to win Cleopatra over.

He is unaware that his best friend Joan of Arc is in love with him, and even when she makes advances upon him or professes her love, he seems obstinately stuck in viewing her as his "girl friend, not his girlfriend", even to the point of improbably re-interpreting some of her statements and actions as gestures of friendship or humor(something of which JFK is angry about). In the series finale, Abe realizes his feelings for Joan are more than platonic. However, this was only after Cleopatra had given her an involuntary make-over for the prom and the anger he feels when he finds Joan with JFK. Before, Abe was oblivious to the fact that Cleo is attempting to drive a wedge between him and Joan and Gandhi, who she views as being detrimental to her image. When alone with Cleo, he found himself thinking about Joan more. Eventually, Abe realizes her true nature in driving away his friends and sees Cleo for the shallow person she is inside. After ending his relationship with Cleo, he rushes to Joan's house to tell her the truth of his feelings for her. By the time he got there to tell her, Abe discovers to his dismay that Joan has moved on and is in a relationship with JFK.

He is 16 years old. He drives a white 1960s-esque [[Lincoln Continental]]. He is captain of the basketball team because he is the tallest guy at school and on the cross country team though it is clear he lacks athleticism, and he is the president of the anti-drug club. His famous catchphrase is "[[Home run|Dinger]]!" often said out of great excitement or frustration.

Abe is usually seen wearing a white T-shirt with a blue collar and blue sleeves, long, baggy cargo jeans and sneakers. He is very tall, skinny and gangly. He has messy brown hair and a scruffy black chin-strap beard (without a mustache) and a mole on his left cheek

Voice by [[Will Forte]]. ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' references Clone High by casting Forte as the voice of Lego Abe Lincoln.

===Joan of Arc===
'''Joan of Arc''' is the clone of [[Joan of Arc|Jeanne d'Arc]], the devout 15th century [[France|French]] militant. She is Abe's closest friend and is obviously in love with him (everyone knows it except Abe himself), though his constant ignorance of this causes her a lot of frustration.

In the episode ''ADD: The Last D Stands for Disorder'' Joan admits to being a "[[goth fashion|goth]]" and has a very moody, cynical, aloof, sarcastic and angst-ridden personality. She has a tendency to erupt melodramatically into tears, usually when Abe ignores her advances or scores with Cleopatra. She hates Cleopatra considering her to be a [[bimbo]] and a snob but develops a special hatred when Cleo starts dating Abe and when she is forced to live with Cleo because her house burnt down. Joan prefers to confide in various characters such as Mr. Butlertron, Gandhi, and Jesus Cristo when she needs emotional support, though she also frequently allows Abe to obliviously confide in her regarding his infatuation with Cleo and their amorous affairs together, much to her emotional detriment.

Joan is also very intelligent, well-read, witty and highly ethical and will speak up for what she believes in, though she is always ignored by the others as they see her as being too "outspoken". She serves as an environmentalist, a vegetarian and activist. mated to be attractive, though she does not recognize or emphasize this and dutifully wears an [[orthodontic retainer]]. Joan has proven to appeal to the other male characters, notably JFK whom frequently harasses her. Despite this, he is secretly attracted to Joan not only because she is immune to his charms, but also he is the only one who sees more to her as a person than Abe. In the Series Finale after realizing that Abe will never see her more than a friend, JFK comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with him. It's there that she realizes her feelings for JFK and sees more to him than the arrogant jock he usually displays in front of others. When Abe came over to her house to finally tell her the truth that he is in love with her, Joan has moved on and begins a relationship with JFK. 

She is 16 years old. She is an [[agnostic]] (she rejects religion but is not disinclined to accepting the existence of God), which puts her at odds with the real Jeanne d'Arc who was a devout Christian (this was once explained by feeling unable to live up to the real Jeanne d'Arc). Joan makes home-movies to express herself artistically. In the episode ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover'', Abe prints flyers of her in order to get her a date for the prom and the flyer describes her as ''[[Janeane Garofalo]]esque''.

Joan's appearance consists of a tight black long-sleeved shirt and tight green cargo pants with black boots. She has pale skin, [[shades of red|dark red hair]], wears black eye liner, purple lipstick and a black choker around her neck. When Cleo gave her a makeover, she wore a different hairstyle, purple eyeshadow and eyeliner, red lipstick a tight black sleeveless leather [[minidress]] with a black and red, lacey pushup bra being revealed, [[fishnet stockings]] and higheels to highlight her shapely physique. In her original design, she had black hair.

Voice by [[Nicole Sullivan]].

===Mahatma Gandhi===
'''Gandhi''' is the clone of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], the [[India]]n activist of the [[Indian Revolution]]. Gandhi is a hyperactive, funny, talkative, immature and rather mischievous teenager who wants to be accepted by those around him.

The reason for his often-ridiculous behavior and underachieving in academics is because he thinks he cannot live up to the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi. Though he has a somewhat likable and friendly personality, his outrageous behavior tends to offend and annoy others. He is a close friend of Abe and at times a confidant to Joan when he is not annoying her. Gandhi knows Joan likes Abe but does not say anything for Joan's privacy.

Gandhi believes he is a friend of the popular students and he especially wants to be best friends with JFK in order to be popular by association. He and JFK had three episodes in which they interacted, JFK admitted that he liked Gandhi as a friend in the episode ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover''. Gandhi also erroneously believes himself to be a ladies man though no females are attracted to him except for Marie Curie but he did gain the attraction of several ladies when he briefly got a makeover as "GFK". In the series finale, Gandhi realizes his feelings for Marie and they begin a platonic relationship.

It is revealed that he used to be Cleo's foster brother for 10 years until she told her parents that he was hurting her image so he was disowned and later placed in the care of new foster parents, a stereotypical Jewish couple (despite the fact that Gandhi donated his kidney to Cleo when she was in terrible pain, something she seems to ignore). He is 16 years old. He is also very short for his age much to his own dismay (even having to use a [[booster seat]] when riding in a car). His favorite movie is ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' and according to the 2003 MTV website, he is the associate editor of the school newspaper ''The Tatler'' in which he reviews movies.&lt;ref name="[[Indian Express]]"&gt;{{cite news | last= O'Brien | first= Irene | title = Now MTV clones Gandhi, chips away at Mahatma | date=2003-01-29 |publisher=Indian Express | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/17449/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi is called by various nicknames notably "[[G-spot]]" and "[[G-force]]". He also is school's mascot DNA Dan and the treasurer for the Solid Gandhi Dancers.

Gandhi appearance consist of a gray short-sleeved shirt with a red stripe, blue jeans and white and red sneakers. He stands very short, is very skinny (almost to the point of looking [[emaciated]]) and has dark, swarthy skin. He is bald, wears glasses and has a black mustache and beard. He also wears a gold earring on his right ear.

His portrayal as a party animal enraged many in [[India]], including prominent members of [[Parliament of India|India's parliament]].&lt;ref name="Grossberg"&gt;{{cite news|first=Josh |last=Grossberg |title=MTV Apologizes for Gandhi Goofing |date=2003-01-31 |publisher=E!

Voice by actor [[Michael McDonald (actor)|Michael McDonald]].

===Cleopatra Smith===
'''Cleopatra Smith''' is the clone of [[Cleopatra VII]], the last [[Pharaoh]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Cleopatra or "Cleo" is a beautiful, intelligent and popular student who is more commonly known as Abe's initial love interest.

She is a very selfish, [[snobbery|snobby]], cynical, vain, manipulative, pretentious and [[materialistic]] stereotypical [[school diva]] who cares only about her social image, beauty and popularity. She shows very little consideration for other people's feelings and believes she deserves to be treated like a queen among her peers. She is also an overachiever who frequently covets success in order to fit into her "[[queen bee (subculture)|queen bee]]" status. It is shown that she acts the way she does out of intense insecurity, and because she has an abusive foster mother who openly harbors contempt towards Cleo. She used to date JFK, but only because she thought he was good for her image.

She became Abe's girlfriend since the episode ''Plane Crazy''. Cleo is portrayed as [[seductive]], hedonistic and libidinous, as result she is sexually [[promiscuous]] and hates it when people make of fun of it, especially when Joan does it to spite her. Cleo has always been aware that Joan harbors strong feelings for Abe, and will often warn Joan to stay away from him after she and Abe began dating. When she discovered JFK's feelings for Joan, Cleo encouraged him to pursue her. In the Series Finale, when Abe was about to have sex with Cleo after prom, he begins to realize his feelings for Joan. After seeing how Cleo had been mistreating both her and Gandhi, Abe ends his relationship to her and leaves.

Despite her arrogance and mean-spirited nature she shows a limited ability of compassion as she willingly gave Joan a makeover to help boost her confidence, she gave up some of her vanity to date the obviously unpopular student Abe Lincoln and consoled JFK when he was sad about Poncey's death.

She is 16 years old. She is captain of the cheerleading team and is the Campus Life editor for ''The Tatler'' in which she interviews students and guest stars. Her physical appearance is derived from the wall paintings of Ancient Egyptian women. She is portrayed as being a tan [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] girl which contradicts with the fact the real Cleopatra was of [[Macedonian people|Macedonian]] descent.

Cleo wears a blue (sometimes red or orange depending on her outfit) headband, a white tank top which shows her large cleavage and a tight black miniskirt to show her volumptuous figure and wears pumps. At night she sleeps in sexy purple [[lingerie]] and is sometimes seen in her cheerleading uniform at school. At the prom she wore a tight, revealing and seductive red dress and a black minidress at Poncey's funeral.

Voice by actress [[Christa Miller]], the wife of Clone High producer [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]].

===John F. Kennedy (JFK)===

'''JFK''' is the clone of [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]], the 35th President of the United States. JFK is the stereotypical popular high school [[jock (athlete)|jock]]. He is arrogant, competitive, lecherous, vain and at times dimwitted. He initially antagonized Abe and Gandhi but he later befriends them by the end of the series. However, JFK and Abe maintained a bitter rivalry, mainly due to them wanting to win over Cleopatra over in the early episodes. This later changed when JFK realizes that he is in love with Joan and despises the way Abe callously treats her by ignoring her feelings for him.

It is shown in episodes ''Episode Two: Election Blue-galoo'' and in ''Raisin the Stakes'', that JFK is a very [[charisma|good speaker]]. He speaks with a thick, stereotypical, non-rhotic [[New England English|New England]] dialect and a [[Boston accent]] (a parody of the Kennedy accent) that is exaggerated and monotone for a comical effect (he usually switches "-er" suffix with "-ah" and also uses "er" and "uh" as [[filler (linguistics)|filler]] which occur during mid-sentence). Despite his apparent [[machismo|macho]] exterior he is very sensitive, emotional and easily offended. JFK is known for his [[narcissism]] and his [[libido]]. He also has a penchant for using [[toilet humor|dirty jokes]] and [[innuendo]]. Despite this, JFK has been known to be very compassionate towards others.

Despite being accident-prone, a target of physical harm and losing his best friend Poncey to a freak accident: he does not believe in the [[Kennedy curse]] - "Nothing bad ever happens to the [[Kennedys]]" and "I'm a Kennedy, I'm not accustomed to tragedy". His plan of living up to John F. Kennedy is simply by being a womanizer and he is shown to be attractive to women, he seems not to know much about his clonefather besides that he [[Apollo program|conquered the moon]]. It is shown that he likes Joan, which is possibly because she is one of the few girls that is immune to his charm. Another reason why JFK likes her is because she is more compassionate and has always seen more to her than Abe did. In the Series Finale, he comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with his other prom dates. However, they leave him when they realize JFK and Joan are in love with each other. It is at prom and later at Joan's home that they begin a relationship, much to Abe's detest.

He is 16 years old. He mainly drives a yellow van but in the episode ''Sleep of Faith'' drove a 1950s-esque [[Chevrolet Corvette|corvette]] which was destroyed. He also seems to have a fear of sudden movements and friendly "hand gun" gestures as he constantly ducks, probably as a cruel joke about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]]. He questioned his sexuality when he became attracted to "John Dark" (Joan in [[crossdressing|drag]]). He is the captain of the football team and soccer team. When he gets hit by Joan, he yells out "Bobby!", a reference to [[Robert F. Kennedy]].

JFK is seen wearing a red sweater with a white stripe in the center and on his sleeves, over a white shirt and tight khaki pants with brown [[loafers]]. He has tall, full brown hair and has a fit and muscular [[physical attractiveness|physique]]. His eyes are usually half-open but will get bigger whenever he is shocked, angered or upset. He appears as very healthy even though the real John F. Kennedy suffered a variety of sicknesses from birth (including [[Addison's disease]]).

Voice by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Christopher Miller.]] Miller had to study the speeches of John F. Kennedy in order to perfect the voice and the accent.

===Principal Scudworth===

'''Principal Cinnamon J. Scudworth, Ph.D.''' is a deluded, self-aggrandizing megalomaniac of a scientist who always wears rubber dish-gloves and if absolutely horrible at being a principal, he is always trying to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and use the clones for his own convoluted schemes, his favorite being a clone themed [[amusement park]].

He is shown to have very little control over his emotions and is prone to violent outbursts. It's possible he is an atheist because he once said "so, religion is for fools?...fools and liberals". As seen in the opening theme, there is a photo of him and Mr. Butlertron salvaging the remains of Abraham Lincoln, which implies that he was the one along with Mr. B who had dug the corpses of the people in the mid-1980s who would later be used in the cloning experiment.

Scudworth apparently had a son named "Brian Parker Scudworth" who he bet in a basketball game against the principal of GESH and lost, as a result Brian ended up getting eaten.&lt;ref name="The Tatler"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tatler Issue #6 |date=2003-08-13 |publisher=CloneHighUSA.com |url=http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%206/tatler_issue_six_scud.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223090525/http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%206/tatler_issue_six_scud.html |archivedate=December 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is seen wearing glasses, a long white lab coat, yellow rubber gloves (which he never takes off), underneath his coat are black pants and shoes. He has brown hair with a bald spot and a small [[soul patch]] under his lower lip.

Voice by Phil Lord.

===Mr. Lynn Butlertron===
'''Mr. Lynn Butlertron''' is the loyal robot servant and best friend/roommate to Scudworth who is programmed with a highly sensitive compassion protocol (a parody of [[Mr. Belvedere]]). Also known as Mr. B. He calls everyone "Wesley", a reference to the youngest son on Mr. Belvedere, Wesley Owens. Strangely, even though he is a robot, Mr. Butlertron is shown without his mustache in a photograph taken in the 80s in the opening to the show and he also has chest hair and armpit hair as shown when he took off his red cardigan sweater vest. Though he is usually polite and laid-back, he does have a temper which came out when had a fight with Scangrade and when he showed jealousy towards Ecybo Pooch.

Mr. Butlertron is very human-like being programmed to be highly [[sentient]] (though its unknown on how he can feel [[physical sensations]]) and possesses [[artificial intelligence]] that which enables him to show human emotions, have [[free will]] and have facial expressions. He genuinely cares for Scudworth and the students.

Voice by Christopher Miller.

===The Shadowy Figure===
'''The Secret Board of Shadowy Figures''' is a ruthless and secretive government organization who employs Principal Scudworth and is sponsored by [[Puma AG|Puma]]. They appear as a parody of the [[CIA]], [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], [[NSA]] and [[Area 51]]. They were responsible for the creation of the clones in the mid-80's. Their ultimate aim is to use the clones for a super army. The organization consists primarily of aged [[white people|white]] male agents.

Its chief director is referred to as '''The Shadowy Figure''' (voiced by [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]]). He is aware of Scudworth's craziness and incompetence in running Clone High. Though for the most part, he has shown amnesty as he gave Scudworth numerous times to redeem himself. He finally decides to kill Scudworth and takes the clones away for experimentation after discovering his video tape of his plot to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and create "Cloney Island". He also secretly hired many celebrities to spy on the clones and Scudworth. He may be [[lactose intolerant]].

They all wear blue [[paramilitary]] uniforms complete with ribbon bars and in the ''Episode Two'' they are seen wearing [[Puma AG|Pumas]] sneakers.

==Supporting characters==

===Clone High students===

* '''[[Julius Caesar]]''': Caesar is a good friend of JFK. He is shown to be one of the popular students at Clone High and is very friendly.

He is also a fan of [[Laurence Olivier]]. He always wears a [[laurel wreath]] on his head. He appears to have an indifferent personality as shown in ''Litter Kills Literally'' as he nonchalantly ate popcorn at Poncey's funeral and did not appear to mourn about his death like the other characters nor did he get shocked after JFK had a mental breakdown at the funeral, instead he appeared to be entertained. His catchphraise was originally to be "[[veni, vidi, vici|Veni, vidi, booyah]]!". He is voiced by [[Neil Flynn]].
* '''[[Catherine the Great]]''': a blonde classmate who speaks with a [[Valley girl]] dialect. She is best friends with Cleopatra and is one of the popular students.

* '''[[Nostradamus]]''': He is an overweight, pimply nerd who falsely believes that he can predict anything, he is known for saying he knew something was going to happen after it already did happen. Because of that he is often seen as a nuisance. He is a lover of science fiction and fantasy. He was also seen hanging with [[Marilyn Monroe]] at the Grassy Knoll.
* '''The [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] Twins''': one twin is fit and healthy which represents the younger Elvis during his prime in the 1950s and the other twin is overweight and gluttonous with an addiction to [[tranquilizers]] to represent Elvis during his downfall in the 1970s.

* '''[[Buddy Holly]]''': He plays in a band called ''[[flight recorder|Black Box]]'' along with [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Ritchie Valens]] (who along with the real Holly, also died in plane crashes). He was originally supposed to a recurring character but only appeared in ''Plane Crazy'' in which he offers to let Abe ride in a poorly constructed [[biplane]] held together by duct tape along with Vaughan, Valens and half of ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]''. He is voiced by Neil Flynn.
* '''[[Sigmund Freud]]''': He seems able to read people's subconsciences. He appears in ''Film Fest'' in which he is the only one who is able to see Joan's love for Abe in her film entry albeit he mocks her for it. According to an article JFK wrote for the school newspaper ''The Tatler'', he tells JFK that he was repressed because he had two father figures and no mother to subconsciously lust after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatler issue #3 |url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%203/tatler_issue_three_jfk1.html |publisher=CloneHighUSA.com |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528053308/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%203/tatler_issue_three_jfk1.html |archivedate=May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He only appears in the episode ''Litter Kills Literally'' alive but makes a cameo in the series finale as a ghost. He was JFK's best friend until they got into an argument. He was violently killed by a freak accident involving litter, where a juice box stabs him in the throat and a plastic bag gets caught on his head, causing him to drown in his own blood. (The juice box may be an allusion to the real Ponce de Le√≥n's death, who died of a [[poison dart]].) He was very popular and well liked by the other students and he also appeared as optimistic and philosophical which JFK mocked about him. He makes another appearance in that episode as ghost but was likely that was only a hallucination conceived by the grief-stricken JFK. He was voiced by [[Luke Perry]].

===Clone High staff===

* '''[[Eleanor Roosevelt]]''': The school's gym teacher. She appears as grotesque and aggressive. She also implies she is a lesbian as she ogled at Joan in the episode ''Escape from Beer Mountain''.
* '''Mr. Sheepman''': A kindly history teacher at Clone High, home room teacher for the clones, and the first mostly human clone with a little sheep DNA mixed into his genetic composition (a parody of [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the Sheep]]). His mannerisms are a parody of [[Don Knotts]]. Voice by [[Andy Dick]].

===Family===

* '''Abe's Foster Dad''' and '''Abe's Foster Mom''': They represent a typical conservative suburban couple. They are seen in ''Raisin the Stakes'' where they reprimand Abe for smoking raisins and Abe's father is seen in the episode ''Changes'' which he encourages Abe to have sex with Cleopatra. Abe's father resembles Harold Weir from the TV series [[Freaks and Geeks]]. Abe's Foster Dad is voiced by [[Joe Flaherty]] and Abe's Foster Mom is voiced by Will Forte.
* '''Toots''': Joan's adoptive grandfather. He is a blind, elderly, likely senile African-American [[jazz]] musician who resembles [[Ray Charles]]. He is seen with a [[clarinet]] most of the time. He has a very down-to-earth personality. He is loving and patient towards his foster granddaughter and gives her advice all the time but he fails to understand why she is so upset. He possible is a devout Christian as he has a golden [[Jesus Fish]] on the trunk of his car. He is in a relationship with Cleo's alcoholic mother. He is voiced by [[Donald Faison]].
* '''Wally and Carl''': JFK's adoptive fathers who he refers to as "Gay Foster Dads". They are a flamboyant, gay, interracial couple who are loving and understanding towards their adopted son despite his mild [[homophobia]]. JFK shows low tolerance for them and stresses himself to act as masculine and promiscuous as possible to compensate for their homosexuality. Wally is the African-American effeminate partner and Carl is the Caucasian [[butch and femme|butch]] partner. They are voiced by [[Donald Faison]] and [[Neil Flynn]] respectively.
* '''Cleo's drunk foster mom''': Cleo's (and formerly Gandhi's) unnamed adoptive mother. She is a lazy, slurring [[alcoholic]] being unemployed and lives off disability checks. She tends to be abusive towards her daughter both physically and verbally. She once threw make-up at Cleo when she ran out of [[liquor]]. Her hostility towards Cleo is stemmed from her own jealously as Cleo is everything she is not, being young, popular and attractive. She is in a relationship with Toots and the two are into [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] as it is seen in ''A Room For One's Clone''. It is likely her last name is Smith as that is Cleo's surname and it is said by Gandhi that she was married at one point because he said Cleo convinced her parents to disown him. She will proposition Abe at one point whenever he tries to visit or contact Cleo. She is voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]].
* '''Gandhi's parents''': Gandhi's adopted mother and father are a [[Jewish stereotypes|stereotypical]] [[Jewish]] couple. They want Gandhi to excel in school. Gandhi's Stereotypical Jewish Foster Dad is voiced by Neil Flynn.

* '''Scangrade ("The Magnificent")''': an egotistical and boastful robot who is Mr. Butlertron's hated nemesis. He is a giant dated computer grading machine but with arms and legs and a face. Unlike Mr. Butlertron, Scangrade is very primitive as he was manufactured in the 1950s (he has to be plugged into the wall just to operate). He appears in ''Sleep of Faith'' and though Mr. Butlertron destroyed him at the end of that episode, Scangrade appears in ''Changes'' in which he is covered with tape as a repair. He is powered by the PXJTs. He refers to everyone as "infidels". He is voiced by [[Judah Miller]].
* '''President Dog''': A cute, little stray [[puppy]] who is the student body president of Clone High. He randomly appears at the end of the ''Episode Two'' in the heat of the class election between Abe Lincoln and JFK, all the students immediately but unintentionally voted him as their class president because of his cuteness and Cleopatra even tried to [[bestiality|seduce him]]. Cleo somewhat takes ownership of him and she constantly dotes on him. He was one of the reasons why JFK and Cleo broke up as JFK was annoyed by Cleo putting herself and the dog before him.
* '''Cop''': a police officer who makes random appearances in the series notably in episodes ''Escape from Beer Mountain'', ''Sleep of Faith'', ''Film Fest'' and ''Litter Kills Literally''. He is voiced by [[Andy Dick]].
* '''Peanie''': an anthropomorphic peanut with a monocle, eyes, arms and legs. He was created by George Washington Carver. He is kept in a jar and has a fear of being turned into peanut butter. He has appeared in episodes: ''Escape from Beer Mountain'' and ''Film Fest''. He is a parody of [[Mr. Peanut]].
* '''Geshy''': a strange, colorful and [[carnivorous]] creature that was introduced in the episode ''Shot in the D'arc''. He is the mascot for GESH (Genetically Engineered Superhuman High) and is kidnapped by Gandhi and Genghis to gain revenge on GESH. It is revealed that he is a real creature and he and Gandhi form a friendship similar to [[E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial|Elliot and E.T.]]. After Gandhi gives him up it is shown he has an insatiable appetite for flesh and begins eating wild animals and bit off the referee's arm. He makes a cameo appearance in ''Litter Kills Literally'' hidden among a group of animals that JFK calls to clean up litter.
* '''Glenn the Janitor''': Is the janitor who works at Clone High. He is also the adopted father of Ponce de Le√≥n. His appearance is based on the [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]] from the TV series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (which is also produced by Bill Lawrence). In connection to ''Clone High'', in a [[Scrubs (season 8)|season 8]] episode of ''Scrubs'' it was revealed that the Janitor's real name was ''Glenn Matthews''. He is voiced by Neil Flynn, who was famous for playing the Janitor on ''Scrubs''.

==Reception==
''Clone High'' is praised for its high character development and strong voice acting. Charles Soloman of the [[LA Times]] wrote that, "Will Forte's ingenuous Abraham Lincoln and Nicole Sullivan's resigned Joan of Arc steal the show."&lt;ref name="Freshman animators"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4805">'''Macedonian art''' is the art of the [[Macedonian Renaissance]] in [[Byzantine art]].  The period followed the end of the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] and lasted until the fall of the [[Macedonian dynasty]], which ruled the [[Byzantine Empire]] from 867 to 1056, having originated in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] in the [[Balkans]].  It coincided with the [[Ottonian Renaissance]] in [[Western Europe]].  In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Byzantine Empire's military situation improved, and art and architecture revived. 
[[File:Byzantinischer Maler um 920 002.jpg|thumb|Scenes from the [[Paris Psalter]]]]

==Painting and mosaic==
New churches were again commissioned, and the Byzantine church mosaic style became standardised. The best preserved examples are at the [[Hosios Lukas]] Monastery in mainland [[Greece]] and the [[Nea Moni of Chios|Nea Moni]] [[Katholikon]] in the island of [[Chios]].  The very freely painted [[fresco]]s at [[Castelseprio]] in Italy are linked by many art historians to the art of Constantinople of the period also.  

There was a revival of interest in classical Greco-Roman styles and subjects, of which the [[Paris Psalter]] is an important testimony, and more sophisticated techniques were used to depict human figures. There was also a naturalistic style and more complex techniques from ancient Greek and Roman art mixed with Christian themes used in art.

==Sculpture==
Although monumental sculpture is extremely rare in Byzantine art, the Macedonian period saw the unprecedented flourishing of the art of [[ivory]] sculpture. Many ornate ivory [[triptych]]s and [[diptych]]s survive, with the central panel often representing either [[deesis]] (as in the [[Harbaville Triptych]]) or the [[Theotokos]] (as in a triptych at [[Luton Hoo]], dating from the reign of [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]]). On the other hand, ivory [[casket]]s (notably the Veroli Casket from [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) often feature secular motifs true to the Hellenistic tradition, thus testifying to an undercurrent of classical taste in Byzantine art.

There are few important surviving buildings from the period. It is presumed that [[Basil I]]'s votive church of the [[Theotokos of the Pharos]] (no longer extant) served as a model for most [[cross-in-square]] sanctuaries of the period, including the monastery church of [[Hosios Lukas]] in Greece (ca. 1000), the [[Nea Moni of Chios]] (a pet project of [[Constantine IX]]), and the [[Daphni Monastery]] near [[Athens]] (ca. 1050).

[[File:Virgin with Chancellor Rolin Luber.jpg|thumb|480px|''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'', [[Oil painting|Oil]] on panel, c. 1435. 66cm x 62cm. [[Mus√©e du Louvre]], Paris]]
The '''''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], dating from around 1435.  It is kept in the [[Mus√©e du Louvre]], Paris, and was commissioned by [[Nicolas Rolin]], aged 60,&lt;ref&gt;Friedl√§nder, 60&lt;/ref&gt; chancellor of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], whose [[votive portrait]] takes up the left side of the picture, for his parish church, ''Notre-Dame-du-Chastel'' in [[Autun]], where it remained until the church burnt down in 1793. After a period in [[Autun Cathedral]], it was moved to the Louvre in 1805.

==Description==
The scene depicts the [[Virgin Mary]] crowned by a hovering [[Angel]] while she presents the Infant [[Jesus]] to Rolin. It is set within a spacious [[loggia]] with a rich decoration of columns and bas-reliefs. In the background is a landscape with a city on a river, probably intended to be [[Autun]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Rolin's hometown. A wide range of well detailed palaces, churches, an island, a towered bridge, hills and fields is portrayed, subject to a uniform light. Perhaps some of the Chancellor's many landholdings around Autun are included in the vista.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 100‚Äì118&lt;/ref&gt;  A haze covers a mountain range in the far distance.  As in many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s, the steepness of the hills and mountains is shown as much greater than that found locally, for dramatic effect.

[[File:Jan van Eyck 072.jpg|left|thumb|Detail of the angel.]]
The small garden with many flowers identifiable (including lilies, irises, paeonies and roses), visible just outside the columns, symbolizes Mary's virtues.  Beyond, two male figures wearing [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperons]] are looking through the [[crenellation]]s of what looks to be a fortified balcony or bridge.  There has been speculation that they may represent van Eyck and an assistant, after the pattern of his [[Arnolfini Portrait]].  The figure on the right wears a similar red chaperon to the probable van Eyck self-portrait in the [[National Gallery, London]].  Near to them are two peacocks, symbols both of immortality and of pride, to which even a powerful man as Rolin might succumb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/dossiers/detail_oal.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;CURRENT_LLV_OAL%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;bmUID=1182710990695&amp;bmLocale=en Louvre page, section "The garden"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713015628/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/dossiers/detail_oal.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;CURRENT_LLV_OAL%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;bmUID=1182710990695&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The interior has complex light sources, typical of van Eyck, with light coming both from the central portico and the side windows. The chancellor, whose strong character is well rendered by the artist, is wearing a fur-lined, elegant garment; the Virgin, the same size as Rolin (rather a novelty in comparison to the Gothic painting tradition), is instead covered by a red mantle. The Infant Jesus holds a cross in his left hand. The perfectionist rendering of details and textures, such as the capitals, the checquered pavement, the goldwork of the angel's crown or the garments is characteristic of Jan van Eyck's work, of which this is one of the finest examples.

As in other van Eycks, the depiction of the space is not as straightforward as it first appears.  Comparison of the floor-tiles with other elements shows that the figures are only about six feet from the columned loggia screen, and that Rolin might have to squeeze himself through the opening to get out that way.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  Many van Eycks show an interior space that is actually very small, but the depiction is subtly managed to retain a sense of intimacy, but without feeling constricted.

==Alterations==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 074.jpg|thumb|right|The carvings above Rolin.]]

[[Infrared]] reflectograms have disclosed a number of changes from the [[underdrawing]].  Rolin had a large purse hanging from his belt; since he had grown very rich in public office he probably felt that would be inappropriate.  The infant Christ was originally pointing at the floor.  Old descriptions from Autun tell us that the painting originally had a wooden frame painted illusionistically with inscriptions seemingly carved, like van Eyck's two portraits in London (''[[L√©al Souvenir]]'' and ''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'').

==Iconography==
[[File:Madonna of Chancellor Rolin (detail).jpg|thumb|left|520px|Detail showing the church over Rolin's hands, and the cathedral over Christ, the flowers in the garden and the squashed rabbits of Lust.]] 
The Virgin sits with the infant Christ "on her knee" (i.e. on her thighs), which make a platform for the infant.  This very traditional motif is known as the ''[[Seat of Wisdom|Throne of Wisdom]]'', and was often used by Jan van Eyck, who elaborated the meaning in complex allusions.  The Virgin's body was often compared to an altar, on which Christ was present as he was believed to be during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].  This painting may have originally hung to the left of Rolin's place at the front of his chapel in his parish church, between him and the altar.  To Rolin, or a viewer of the real and painted Rolins together, the Virgin is painted in the position of the altar in the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[illuminated manuscript]] in front of Rolin is open to a page with a large initial D, which probably indicates "Domine, labia mea aperies" ("Lord, open my lips"), the opening of [[Matins]]; this is therefore a [[Book of Hours]].  

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden St Luke Some Chick MFA Boston.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Rogier van der Weyden]], as [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]], makes a drawing for his painting of the Virgin. The setting is clearly derived from the Rolin Madonna. ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'', Boston, c. 1440.]]

The architecture of the loggia, as in so many of van Eyck's paintings, is in a rich and delicate Romanesque style far from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic styles]] of his own day.  The setting probably represents at the same time an imaginary building in Autun, and the "Heavenly city of Jerusalem"; two personages from two worlds are shown, and their surrounding combines the world of each.

The painting might be connected with the appointment in 1436 of [[Jean Rolin (cardinal)|Rolin's son Jean]] as [[Bishop of Autun]]; there is a magnificent [[cathedral]] on the Virgin's side of the river.  Also, just above Rolin's hands there is a smaller church, perhaps intended to represent a new church dedicated to the Virgin, or his own parish church, ''Notre-Dame-du-Chastel'' which he greatly enriched.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

There appears to be a series of illustrations of the [[Seven deadly sins]] distributed among the details of the painting. The [[relief]]s just over Rolin's head show (from left) ''the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise'' ([[Pride]]), the ''Killing of Abel by Cain'' ([[Envy]]) and the ''Drunkenness of Noah'' ([[Gluttony]]).  Then the lion-heads on the capitals behind Rolin may stand for [[Anger]], and the tiny squashed rabbits between column and base in the loggia screen for [[Lust]] (which they were considered to exemplify in the Middle Ages).  All these details are on Rolin's side of the painting; no equivalents are visible on the other, divine, side.  However this leaves [[Avarice]] and [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] unaccounted for, unless perhaps the human figures of Rolin himself (with his underdrawn purse), and the idlers out on the terrace (perhaps including, as stated above, van Eyck himself) represent the last two vices.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Aesthetic''' is a term, coined by [[James Bridle]], used to refer to the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology and the Internet in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical. The phenomenon has been around for a long time but James Bridle articulated the notion through a series of talks and observations. The term gained wider attention following a panel at the [[SXSW]] conference in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://booktwo.org/notebook/sxaesthetic/|title=#sxaesthetic report|author=James Bridle|date= 15 March 2012|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Developing from a series of collections of digital objects that have become located in the physical, the movement circulates around a blog named "The New Aesthetic" and which has defined the broad contours of the movement without a manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Bridle, J. (2011a) Waving at the Machines, Web Directions, accessed 05/04/2012, http://www.webdirections.org/resources/james-bridle-waving-at-the-machines&lt;/ref&gt; The New Aesthetic as a concept was introduced at South By South West (SXSW) on March 12, 2012, at a panel organised by James Bridle and included Aaron Cope, [[Ben Terrett]], [[Joanne McNeil]] and Russell Davies.&lt;ref name="imperica"&gt;Berry, D. M. (2012) Computationality and the New Aesthetic, Imperica, http://www.imperica.com/viewsreviews/david-m-berry-computationality-and-the-new-aesthetic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridle, J. (2012b) #sxaesthetic, accessed 06/04/2012, http://booktwo.org/notebook/sxaesthetic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridle, J. (2011b) Regarding the library with envious eyes, Booktwo.org, accessed 05/04/2012, http://booktwo.org/notebook/books-computational-value&lt;/ref&gt;

An article by Bruce Sterling in Wired Magazine propelled the ideas around the New Aesthetic into critical and public consciousness. Sterling's article described the concept's main outlines but also proposed some key critical areas for development.&lt;ref name="Wired Essay"&gt;Sterling, B. (2012) [https://www.wired.com/2012/04/an-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic/ "An Essay on the New Aesthetic"], Wired blog, April 2, 2012. Accessed 05/04/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent response from across the web was rapid and engaged with a number of significant contemporaneous contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Battles, M. (2012) But it moves: the New Aesthetic &amp; emergent virtual taste, Metalab, accessed 08/04/2012, http://metalab.harvard.edu/2012/04/but-it-moves-the-new-aesthetic-emergent-virtual-taste/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogost, I. (2012) The New Aesthetic Needs to Get Weirder, The Atlantic, https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/the-new-aesthetic-needs-to-get-weirder/255838&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borenstein, G. (2012) What Its Like To Be a 21C Thing?, Creators Project, accessed 07/04/2012, http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/in-response-to-bruce-sterlings-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[Bruce Sterling]] has said of the New Aesthetic:

:The ‚ÄúNew Aesthetic‚Äù is a native product of modern network culture. It‚Äôs from London, but it was born digital, on the Internet. The New Aesthetic is a ‚Äútheory object‚Äù and a ‚Äúshareable concept.‚Äù
:The New Aesthetic is ‚Äúcollectively intelligent.‚Äù It‚Äôs diffuse, crowdsourcey, and made of many small pieces loosely joined. It is rhizomatic, as the people at Rhizome would likely tell you. It‚Äôs open-sourced, and triumph-of-amateurs. It‚Äôs like its logo, a bright cluster of balloons tied to some huge, dark and lethal weight.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/04/an-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic/|title=An Essay on the New Aesthetic|publisher=Wired|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Battles, a contributor to Metalab, a project of the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]], gives a definition that makes reference to purported paradigmatic examples:

:New Aesthetic is a collaborative attempt to draw a circle around several species of aesthetic activity‚Äîincluding but not limited to drone photography, ubiquitous surveillance, glitch imagery, Streetview photography, 8-bit net nostalgia. Central to the New Aesthetic is a sense that we‚Äôre learning to ‚Äúwave at machines‚Äù‚Äîand that perhaps in their glitchy, buzzy, algorithmic ways, they‚Äôre beginning to wave back in earnest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metalab.harvard.edu/2012/04/but-it-moves-the-new-aesthetic-emergent-virtual-taste/|title=But it moves: the New Aesthetic &amp; emergent virtual taste|author=Matthew Battles|publisher=Metalab|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more substantive contributions to the notion of the New Aesthetic has been through a development of, and linking to, the way in which the digital and the everyday are increasingly interpenetrating each other. Here, the notion of the unrepresentability of computation, as both an infrastructure and an ecology, are significant in understanding the common New Aesthetic tendency towards pixelated graphics and a retro 8-bit form.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, D. M., Dartel, M. v., Dieter, M., Kasprzak, M. Muller, N., O'Reilly, R., and Vicente, J. L (2012) New Aesthetic, New Anxieties, Amsterdam: V2, accessed 27/06/2012, http://www.v2.nl/publishing/new-aesthetic-new-anxieties&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the idea of an [[episteme]] (or [[ontotheology]]) identified with relation to computation and computational ways of seeing and doing: ''computationality''.

[[Michael Betancourt]] has discussed the New Aesthetic in relation to digital automation. The ‚Äònew aesthetic‚Äô provides a reference point for the examination of [[Karl Marx]]'s discussion of machines in ‚ÄòThe Fragment on Machines.‚Äô
:The 'new aesthetic' documents is the shift from earlier considerations of machine labor as an amplifier and extension of human action -- as an augmentation of human labor -- to its replacement by models where the machine does not augment but supplant, in the process apparently removing the human intermediary that is the labor that historically lies between the work of human designer-engineers and fabrication following their plans.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Michael. ''Automated Labor: The 'New Aesthetic' and Immaterial Physicality,'' CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc048, http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=717&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Betancourt, the New Aesthetic documents a shift in production that is different than that described by Marx. Where the machines Marx described were dependent on human control, those identified with the New Aesthetic work to supplant the human element, replacing it with digital automation, effectively removing living labor from the production process.

One movement that draws parallels to "New Aesthetic" is "[[Seapunk]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lunavega.net/2011/10/seapunk-the-new-web-and-the-evolution-of-the-visual-music-genre/|title=Seapunk: The New Web and the Evolution of the Visual Music Genre|author=Luna Vega|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Noureddin, Son of Iran''''' ({{lang-fa|ŸÜŸàÿ±ÿßŸÑÿØ€åŸÜ Ÿæÿ≥ÿ± ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ}}) is the memoirs of [[Sayyid]] Noureddin Afi from the 80 months of his participation in the [[Iran‚ÄìIraq war]]. ''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' led to Afi's reputation in Iran after it was published by Sureye Mehr Publication in 2011. In 1994, Mousa Ghayour recorded the memoirs of Noureddin Afi in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and it was presented as a written book by Masoume Sepehri years later.

==Narrative==
[[Sayyid]] Noureddin wants to participate the Iran‚ÄìIraq war, but he is not allowed at first because he is still young. He tries repeatedly and finally they let him go to war. He attends a military training course in the fall of 1980, and heads toward the western zones of Iran to serve in the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Sepah]] of the [[Mehabad]]. He moves to the southern war zones along with his brother, Sadegh. Nourreddin loses his brother in an Iraqi [[airstrike]]. With shrapnel in his body they make him go under surgery in the hospitals of [[Mashhad]] and [[Kermanshah]] many times. But he does not recover well because he is severely damaged in the face, eyes and stomach. Due to the severe injuries on his face, his countenance changes when he is only 18. In 1984, he marries a 16-year-old girl named Masoume and their child is born 4 years later. The war finishes but he is still suffering the injuries and he misses his lovely friends, especially Amir Maralbash who was killed in the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manvaketab.ir/145079-ŸÜŸàÿ±ÿßŸÑÿØ€åŸÜ-Ÿæÿ≥ÿ±-ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ/bz=fs Book introduction, Nourreddin, Son of Iran (Persian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why it was written==
In the last page of his memoir, Afi expresses his motivation for recounting his war memories as such:
{{quote|I never thought that, telling the memories is important nowadays. However, war memories and interviews were not discussed and I was involved with the side effects my injuries. In 1994, I dreamed that Mr [[Khamenei]] was reading some papers and crying. I was there, Some one said that these papers were the memories of a %70 [[veteran]] who had participated in war for 80 months and still said he had nothing for the war...My mind was busy with this dream and I felt my duty would finish by telling these memories. So, I  recounted the eight years of living in the war context to make those unique times survive for ever. (P632)&lt;ref name="Mashregh"/&gt;}}

[[Image:Kosuth OneAndThreeChairs.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Kosuth]], ''One and Three Chairs'' (1965)]]

'''''One and Three Chairs''''', 1965, is a work by [[Joseph Kosuth]]. An example of [[conceptual art]], the piece consists of a [[chair]], a photograph of the chair, and an enlarged dictionary definition of the word "chair". The photograph depicts the chair as it is actually installed in the room, and thus the work changes each time it is installed in a new venue.

Two elements of the work remain constant: a copy of a dictionary definition of the word "chair" and a diagram with instructions for installation. Both bear Kosuth's signature. Under the instructions, the installer is to choose a chair, place it before a wall, and take a photograph of the chair. This photo is to be enlarged to the size of the actual chair and placed on the wall to the left of the chair. Finally, a blow-up of the copy of the dictionary definition is to be hung to the right of the chair, its upper edge aligned with that of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Dickel, Hans u.a.: Die Sammlung Paul Maenz. Neues Museum Weimar. Edition Cantz, Ostfildern-Ruit 1998, p. 82s.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early conceptual art==

"Event cards" of [[Fluxus]]-artists like [[George Brecht]], [[Dick Higgins]] and [[Yoko Ono]] prefigured Kosuth's concern with the difference between a concept and its mode of presentation. These artists also tackled the problem of presenting "concepts" to an art audience. ''One and Three Chairs'' is, perhaps, a step towards a resolution of this problem. Rather than present the viewer with the bare written instructions for the work, or make a live event of the realization of the concept (in the manner of the Fluxus artists), Kosuth instead unifies concept and realization. ''One and Three Chairs'' demonstrates how an artwork can embody an idea that remains constant despite changes to its elements. 

Kosuth stresses the difference between concept and presentation in his writings (e.g., "Art after Philosophy", 1969&lt;ref name="Kosuth1"&gt;Kosuth J., (1969), [http://www.ubu.com/papers/kosuth_philosophy.html ''Art after Philosophy, part 1'']&lt;/ref&gt;
) and interviews (see the quotation below). He tries to intimately bind the conceptual nature of his work with the nature of art itself, thus raising his instructions for the presentation of an artwork to the level of a discourse on art. In 1963 [[Henry Flynt]] articulated these problems in the article "Concept Art".&lt;ref&gt;Flynt, Henry: [http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html ''Concept Art'']. In: Mac Low, Jackson/Young: LaMonte (ed.): An Anthology. New York 1963, unpaginated.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a forerunner to Kosuth's thematization of "Concept Art" in "Art after Philosophy", the text that made ''One and Three Chairs'' famous.&lt;ref&gt;Kosuth, Joseph: Art after Philosophy, Part III. In: Studio International, November 1969, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

The work ''One and Three Chairs'' can be seen to highlight the relation between language, picture and referent. It problematizes relations between object, visual and verbal references ([[denotation (semiotics)|denotations]]) plus semantic fields of the term chosen for the verbal reference. The term of the dictionary includes [[connotation (semiotics)|connotations]] and possible denotations which are  relevant in the context of the presentation of ''One and Three Chairs''. The meanings of the three elements are congruent in certain semantic fields and incongruent in other semantic fields: A semantic congruity ("One") and a threefold incongruity ("One and Three").  Ironically,  ''One and Three Chairs'' can be looked upon as simple but rather complex model, of the science of signs. A viewer may ask "what's real here?" and answer that "the definition is real"; Without a definition, one would never know what an actual chair is.

There exist different interpretations of these semantic and ontological aspects. Some refer to [[Plato]]¬¥s ''Republic'' (Book X);&lt;ref&gt;Gerwen, Rob van: Introducing My Philosophical Directions: [http://www.phil.uu.nl/~rob/directions/cave.shtml Plato¬¥s Cave]. Universiteit Utrecht 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; others refer to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]¬¥s ''Tractatus''&lt;ref&gt;Inboden, Gudrun: Introduction: Joseph Kosuth - Artist and Critic of Modernism. In: Joseph Kosuth: The Making of Meaning. Selected Writings and Documentation of Investigations on Art Since 1965. Cat. of exhib. Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. Stuttgart 1981, p. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s triad icon-index-symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Tragatschnig, Ulrich: Konzeptuelle Kunst. Interpretationsparadigmen: Ein Prop√§deutikum. Reimer, Berlin 1998, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Dreher discusses the semantic problems of ''One and Three Chairs'' as inclusions of circles which represent semantic fields.&lt;ref&gt;Dreher, Thomas: Konzeptuelle Kunst in Amerika und England zwischen 1963 und 1976. Thesis Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t/Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main 1992, p. 70-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work tends to defy formal analysis because one chair can be substituted for another chair, rendering the photograph and the chair photographed elusive to description. Nevertheless the particular chair and its accompanying photograph lend themselves to formal analysis. There are many chairs in the world; thus only those actually used can be described. Those chairs not used would not be analyzed. The enlarged dictionary definition of the word chair is also open to formal analysis, as is the diagram containing instructions of the work.

==The concept and the theory of art==
Kosuth's thematization of semantic congruities and incongruities can be seen as a reflection of the problems which the relations between concept and presentation pose. Kosuth uses the related questions, "how meanings of signs are constituted" and "how signs refer to extra-lingual phenomena" as a fundament to discuss the relation between concept and presentation. Kosuth tries to identify or equate these philosophical problems with the theory of art. Kosuth changes the art practice from hand-made originals to notations with substitutable realizations, and tries to exemplify the relevance of this change for the theory of art. 

In "Art after Philosophy," Kosuth provoked a confrontation with the formal criticism of [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried]]. Both exposed the concept of the art work as a non-substitutable instance realized by an artist who follows no other criteria than visual ones. They defined this concept as the core of modernism. In the sixties, Greenberg's and Fried's modernist doctrine dominated the American discussions on art; meanwhile, the artists [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Dick Higgins]], Henry Flynt, [[Mel Bochner]], [[Robert Smithson]] and Joseph Kosuth wrote articles on art exemplifying a pluralistic anti- and post-modernist tendency which gained more influence at the end of the sixties. In 1968, Greenberg tried to disqualify the new tendencies as "'novelty' art": "The different mediums are exploding...when everybody is a revolutionary the revolution is over."&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Clement: [http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/avantgarde.html Avant Garde Attitudes], 1968. The Jon Power Lecture in Contemporary Art, 17 Mai 1968. First published in: In Memory of John Joseph Wardell Power. Power Institute of Fine Arts, University of Sydney, 1969. Republished in: Greenberg, Clement: The Collected Essays and Criticism. volume 4: Modernism with a Vengeance, 1957-1969. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 1993, p. 292, 299.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Hunter]] offered a more positive view in 1972: "The situation of open possibilities which confronted artists in the first years of the seventies allowed a variety of means and many fertile idea systems to coexist, reconciling through the poetic imagination apparent contradictions." &lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Sam: American Art of the 20th Century. New York 1972, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotation==
Joseph Kosuth, WBAI, April 7, 1970:

:"I used common, functional objects - such as a chair - and to the left of the object would be a full-scale photograph of it and to the right of the object would be a photostat of a definition of the object from the dictionary. Everything you saw when you looked at the object had to be the same that you saw in the photograph, so each time the work was exhibited the new installation necessitated a new photograph. I liked that the work itself was something other than simply what you saw. By changing the location, the object, the photograph and still having it remain the same work was ''very'' interesting. It meant you could have an art work which was that ''idea'' of an art work, and its formal components weren't important." &lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Jeanne: Artwords. Discourse on the 60s and 20s. UMI Research Press, Ann Arbour/Michigan 1985; second edition Da Capo Press, New York 1992, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Opie Gets Laid''''', originally titled '''''Sunnyvale''''' for its film festival submissions, is a 2005 American independent romantic comedy film written and directed by [[James Ricardo]] and starring James Ricardo, [[April Wade]], Ute Werner and Jesselynn Desmond.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"/&gt;

==Plot==
At 30 years old, Opie (James Ricardo) is a virgin whose existence is made up of watching [[pornography]] and eating [[junk food]].  One day a drug dealer named Thai (April Wade) mistakenly comes to his door.  She decides to help Opie by finding him a good woman, initially (and unsuccessfully) by online personal ads.  Thai and Opie end up sleeping together while high on [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and then end up seeing each other regularly.  Opie starts having sex with other women, including Thai's lesbian lover Dakota (Ute Werner) and a "gun-toting" nymphomaniac named Rain (Jesselynn Desmond).

* Samantha Turk as Randi
* [[Heidemarie Fuentes]] as Jackie

==Background==
The film was shot at the [[Higgins Building]] in Los Angeles, in a [[New York City]]-style loft, and is partly autobiographical. According to writer/director James Ricardo, it was [originally] called Sunnyvale because he "''didn't know what else to call it''", and expanding, "''Much like movie titles like [[Eraserhead]]. Sunnyvale is a comedic sounding title. It's a city that could only be in California.''"&lt;ref name="metroactive"/&gt;  Under its new title it is distributed by [[Vivendi Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="homemediamagazine"/&gt;

==Recognition==
The film was titled ''Sunnyvale'' during its [[film festival]] run and was the winner of the [[William Shatner]] Golden Groundhog Award for 'Best Underground Movie' of 2005.&lt;ref name="metroactive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="canmag"/&gt; The award has been described by critic Joshua Taylor as "maybe... just a veiled promotional tool for William Shatner's new DVD of the month club".&lt;ref name="cinemablend"/&gt;

===Critcial response===
[[Gothamist|SFist]] wrote that "...writer/director James Ricardo also starred in the movie and he was definitely the weakest of the actors. So it was hard to tell if it was just wooden acting that make Ricardo, the character, so passive or if he was intended to be. Talking to other filmgoers about it afterwards, we all seemed confused. No one really disliked it but everyone seemed unsure if they liked it really, or if they just wanted to like it."&lt;ref name="SFist"/&gt;

[[DVD Talk]] offered that the film is "a lowbrow talking head comedy with a wittier than average script", and for "a first time director, Ricardo could have done much worse. His script is good, and he gets good performances from his three lead actresses."  In making comparisons between Ricardo and directors such as [[Woody Allen]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] who have acted in films they were also directing, they made note that Ricardo's own lead performance as a deadpan Opie was serviceable, but had a stiffness that a director not himself in front of the camera might have caught. They summarized by stating the film "is a quirky romantic comedy about sex that has no sex and stars a cast of unknowns. But if you can get past that, you should be entertained."&lt;ref name="dvdtalk"/&gt;

[[DVD Verdict]] noted that the title and packaging led to expectations of a cheapo sex comedy featuring "clich√©d plot developments and plenty of gratuitous nudity", but that the film "feels more like a stage adaptation than anything else", with sexual content only being alluded to by dialogue scenes serving "as the 'before' and 'after' for dozens of brief but apparently successful sexual encounters"  They commented that the "editing is tight, the dialogue is occasionally quite amusing, and the film rarely becomes terribly boring", noting there were "many individual attributes of merit here, so it's a little disappointing that the film as a whole doesn't quite gel."  They commented that the character of Opie as written by Ricardo had lots of potential, but that as played by the director just was not interesting. They noted a paradox in that "Ricardo's performance suggests that he knows his writing is good", in that he "delivers the dialogue with a sort of smug assurance that feels more like a tell than like a natural extension of the character's personality". They concluded that the film "wins points for breaking some genre conventions", and that Ricardo and some of the other cast have potential for future films.&lt;ref name="dvdverdict"/&gt;

[[File:1800 Wilkinson Map of the 4 Eastern Churches rectified.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient Orient of the [[Roman Empire]] and its ecclesiastical order after the [[Council of Chalcedon]], 451]]
The '''Orient''' is a historical term for the ''East'', traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the [[Eastern world]], in relation to [[Europe]]. In [[English language|English]], it is largely a [[metonym]] for, and coterminous with, the [[continent]] of [[Asia]], loosely classified into the [[Near East]], [[Middle East]] and [[Far East]]: the directional regions now known today as western Asia, southern Asia, eastern Asia, and southeast Asia (Note that traditionally directional regions of a continent do not use an upper-case letter). Originally, the term ''Orient'' was used to designate the Near East, and later its meaning evolved and expanded, designating also the Middle East or the Far East.  
 
The term '''Oriental''' is often used to describe objects from the Orient. However, given its [[Eurocentric]] connotations and shifting, inaccurate definition through the ages, it is generally considered offensive as a label for people from Asia.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oriental|title=Definition of ORIENTAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/oriental|title=oriental - Definition of oriental in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/oriental|title=Oriental definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weareresonate.com/2016/07/oriental-racist-term/|title=FEATURE: Why is 'Oriental' a racist term? - Resonate|date=13 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mike-francesa-oriental_us_59495b61e4b07d3e35d8b58f|title=New York Sports Talk Show Host Doesn't Get Why 'Oriental' Is Offensive|date=20 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tronc.com/gdpr/latimes.com/|title=Los Angeles Times - We are currently unavailable in your region|website=www.tronc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/avoid-these-five-racial-terms-2834959|title=Why You Should Avoid These Racial Terms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/outdated-term-oriental-has-no-place-at-city-hall-prof-1.711485|title=Outdated term 'Oriental' has no place at city hall: prof - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/bill-remove-oriental-federal-law-passes-senate-heads-obama-n571506|title=Bill to Remove 'Oriental' from Federal Law Passes Senate, Heads to Obama|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation ==
[[File:Roman Empire with dioceses in 300 AD.png|thumb|330px|right|Administrative Dioceses of the Roman Empire, c. 300, including the original [[Diocese of the Orient]]]]
The term "Orient" derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''oriens'' meaning "east" (lit. "rising" &lt; ''orior'' " rise"). The use of the word for "rising" to refer to the east (where the sun rises) has analogs from many languages: compare the terms "[[Levant]]" (&lt; French ''levant'' "rising"), "Vostok" {{lang-ru|–í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫}} (&lt; Russian ''voskhod'' {{lang-ru|–≤–æ—Å—Ö–æ–¥}} "sunrise"), "[[Anatolia]]" (&lt; Greek ''anatole''), "[[mizrahi]]" in [[Hebrew]] ("zriha" meaning sunrise), "sharq" {{lang-ar|ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇ}} (&lt; Arabic ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yashriq}}'' {{lang|ar|Ÿäÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇ}} "rise", ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shur≈´q}}'' {{lang-ar|ÿ¥ÿ±ŸàŸÇ}} "rising"), "shygys" {{lang-kz|—à—ã“ì—ã—Å}} (&lt; Kazakh ''shygu'' {{lang-kz|—à—ã“ì—É}} "come out"), {{lang-tr|doƒüu}} (&lt; Turkish ''doƒümak'' to be born; to rise), {{zh|Êù±}} ({{zh|hp=d≈çng}}, a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Harbaugh | first1 = Rick | title = Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary | chapter = Êù± | publisher = Han Lu Book &amp; Pub.

Also, many ancient temples, including pagan temples and the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, were built with their main entrances facing the East.  This tradition was  [[Orientation of churches|carried on in Christian churches]]. To situate them in such a manner was to "orient" them in the proper direction.  When something was facing the correct direction, it was said to be in the proper ''orientation''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Another explanation of the term stems from [[Rome]] during the [[Roman Empire]], specifically the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], or the "Roman Orient", during the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Although the original East-West (or Orient-Occident) line was the [[Italian Peninsula]]'s East Coast, around 600 AD this would shift to the [[City of Rome]]. Any area below the City of Rome was considered the Orient, as well as the ethnicities inhabiting the land, such as [[Dalmatian Italian]]s, (modern [[Naples|Neapolitans]] along with [[Sicily|Sicilians]], [[Libyan people|Libyans]], [[Moroccan people|Moroccans]], [[Greeks]], etc.), as well as everything East of Southern Italy, hence the Italian name "Italia nord-orientale" (in English [[Northeast Italy]]) for Le [[Tre Venezie]] (the 3 Venices) located above the Roman latitude line separating it from modern [[Abruzzo]]; the beginning of the Orient in the East, while [[Lazio]] is its beginning in the West of the [[Italian Peninsula]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The opposite term "[[Western world|Occident]]" derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''occidens'', meaning ''west'' (lit. ''setting'' &lt; ''occido'' ''fall/set''). This term meant the west (where the sun sets) but has fallen into disuse in English, in favor of "[[Western world]]".

== History of the term ==
{{Further|Orientalism}}
[[File:Dioecesis Orientis 400 AD.png|thumb|270px|right|Late Roman [[Diocese of the Orient]], c. 400]]
Territorialization of the Roman term ''Orient'' occurred during the reign of emperor [[Diocletian]] (284-305), when the [[Diocese of the Orient]] ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Dioecesis Orientis'') was formed. Later in the 4th century, the [[Praetorian prefecture of the Orient]] ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Praefectura Praetorio Orientis'') was also formed, including most of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], from the [[Diocese of Thrace|Thrace]] eastwards; its easternmost part was the original ''Diocese of the Orient'', corresponding roughly to the [[region of Syria]]. 

Over time, the common understanding of "the Orient" has continually shifted eastwards, as European people traveled farther into Asia. It finally reached the Pacific Ocean, in what Westerners came to call "the [[Far East]]". These shifts in time and identification sometimes confuse the scope (historical and geographic) of Oriental Studies. Yet there remain contexts where "the Orient" and "Oriental" have kept their older meanings (e.g., "Oriental spices" typically are from the regions extending from the Middle East to sub-continental India to Indo-China). Travelers may again take the [[Orient Express]] train from [[Paris]] to its terminus in the European part of [[Istanbul]], a route established in the early 20th century.

In European [[historiography]], the meaning of "the Orient" changed in scope several times. Originally, the term referred to [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], and adjoining areas.&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Martin W.|last2=Wigen|first2=K√§ren|title=The myth of continents: a critique of metageography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2as0sWxFBAC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=8 November 2011|year=1997|publisher=University √π Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; as far west as [[Morocco]]. During the 1800s, India, and to a lesser extent China, began to displace the Levant as the primary subject of Orientalist research. By the mid-20th century, Western scholars generally considered "the Orient" as just [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and eastern [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"/&gt; As recently as the early 20th century, the term "Orient" often continued to be used in ways that included North Africa. Today, the term primarily evokes images of [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Mongolia]], and peninsular Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"/&gt; Throughout the history of the changing sense of the term, "the Orient" was never equivalent to Asia as a whole. "The Orient" being largely a cultural term, large parts of Asia‚Äî[[Siberia]] most notably‚Äîwere excluded from the scholarly notion of "the Orient".&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"/&gt;

Equally valid terms for the Orient still exist in the English language in such collocations as [[Oriental studies]] (now Asian Studies in some countries).

The adjectival term Oriental has been used by [[Western world|the West]] to mean cultures, peoples, countries, Asian rugs, and goods from the Orient. "Oriental" means generally "[[east]]ern". It is a traditional designation (especially when capitalized) for anything belonging to the [[Eastern world|Orient]] or "East" (for [[Asia]]), and especially of its [[Eastern culture]]. It indicated the eastern direction in historical astronomy, often abbreviated "Ori".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hooke|Hooke, Robert]]. 1666. [[:File:Saturn Robert Hooke 1666.jpg|Drawing of Saturn]] in Philosophical Transactions (Royal Society publication) Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- and look at old world maps and celestial for sources., and so on --&gt; In contemporary American English, ''Oriental'' usually refers to things from the parts of [[East Asia]] traditionally occupied by [[East Asian]]s and most [[Central Asians]] and [[Southeast Asians]] racially categorized as "[[Mongoloid]]". This excludes [[Jewish diaspora|Jews]], [[India]]ns, [[Arabs]], and most other South or West Asian peoples. Because of historical discrimination against Chinese, Korean and Japanese, in some parts of the United States, some people consider the term derogatory. For example, [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] prohibits the word "Oriental" in legislation and government documents, preferring the word "Asian" instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5954.PL.pdf Senate bill (pdf file)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305151322/http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5954.PL.pdf |date=5 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more local uses, "oriental" is also used for eastern parts of countries, for example [[Oriental (Morocco)|Morocco's Oriental Region]]. Oriental is also used as an adjective akin to "eastern", especially in the Spanish-speaking world. For example, the [[Philippines|Philippine]] islands of [[Mindoro Island|Mindoro]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]] are each divided into two provinces whose titles include the words "oriental" and "occidental" respectively. The official name of [[Uruguay]] is the Rep√∫blica Oriental del Uruguay or Oriental Republic of Uruguay because it is east of the [[Uruguay River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uy.html#Govt|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, "orientalist" has been the traditional term for a scholar of [[Oriental studies]]; however, the use in [[English language|English]] of "Orientalism" to describe academic "Oriental studies" is rare: the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites only one such usage, by [[Lord Byron]] in 1812. [[Orientalism]] is more widely used to refer to the works of the many 19th-century artists who specialized in "Oriental" subjects, often drawing on their travels to [[North Africa]] and [[Western Asia]]. Artists as well as scholars were already described as "Orientalists" in the 19th century. In 1978, Palestinian-American scholar [[Edward Said]] published his influential and controversial book, ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]''; he used the term to describe a pervasive Western tradition, both academic and artistic, of prejudiced outsider interpretations of the [[Arab world|Arab]] and [[Muslim world]]s, shaped by the attitudes of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Nosal, K R.

=== British and Irish English ===
In [[British English]], the term ''Oriental'' is sometimes used to refer to people from East and Southeast Asia (such as those from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Viet Nam|Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Laos]]). "Asian" in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] generally refers to people that come from [[South Asia]] (in particular [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Maldives]]) since [[British Asians]] make up approximately 6.9% of the population within the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="2011census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-the-united-kingdom---part-1/rft-ks201uk.xls|title=2011 Census: Ethnic group, local authorities in the United Kingdom|publisher=Office for National Statistics|date=11 October 2013|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Orientals" refers exclusively to people of East and Southeast Asian origin, who comprise 0.7% of the UK population as a whole, and 5.3% of the non-European population.

Distinct within American culture, some [[American English]] speakers consider the term "Oriental" to be a pejorative and disparaging term when used to describe a person&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;. John Kuo Wei Tchen, director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute at [[New York University]], said the basic critique of the term developed in the U.S. in the 1970s. Tchen has said: "With the U.S.A. anti-war movement in the '60s and early '70s, many Asian Americans identified the term 'Oriental' with a Western process of racializing Asians as forever opposite 'others'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/livewire/archived/oriental_rugs_or_people/|title=Oriental: Rugs or People?|work=nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 American press release related to legislation aimed at removing the term "oriental" from official documents of the State of [[New York (state)|New York]], Governor [[David Paterson]] said: "The word 'oriental' does not describe ethnic origin, background or even race; in fact, it has deep and demeaning historical roots".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackradionetwork.com/ny_law_ends_use_of_oriental_in_documents official 2009 press release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212084814/http://www.blackradionetwork.com/ny_law_ends_use_of_oriental_in_documents |date=12 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian English ===
In [[Australian English]], the term "Asian" generally refers to people of [[East Asia]]n or [[Southeast Asia]]n descent, such as those of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, or Filipino descent. Persons of  Pakistani, Sri Lankan, and most other [[South Asian]] descent are referred to by their respective [[demonym]], but without explicit knowledge, those people are indeterminately inferred as "Indian".

=== German ===
In [[German language|German]], ''Orient'' is usually used synonymously with the area between the [[Near East]] and [[India]], including [[Israel]], the [[Arab world]], and [[Greater Persia]].

The term ''Asiaten'' (English: Asians) means the people of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Another word for Orient in German is ''Morgenland'' (now mainly poetic), which literally translates as "morning land". The antonym "Abendland" (rarely: "Okzident") is also mainly poetic, and refers to (Western) Europe.

[[Image:Zeitschriften.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Consumer]] [[magazine]] sponsored [[advertisement]]s and covers rely heavily on professional page layout skills to compete for visual attention.]]
'''Page layout''' is the part of [[graphic design]] that deals in the arrangement of visual elements on a [[Page (paper)|page]]. It generally involves organizational principles of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] to achieve specific communication objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Z|title=Elements and principles of design: Tools for digital imagery, art and design|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-level page layout involves deciding on the overall arrangement of text and images, and possibly on the size or shape of the medium.  It requires intelligence, sentience, and creativity, and is informed by culture, psychology, and what the document authors and editors wish to communicate and emphasize.  Low-level [[pagination]] and [[typesetting]] are more mechanical processes.  Given certain parameters - boundaries of text areas, the typeface, font size, and justification preference can be done in a straightforward way.  Until desktop publishing became dominant, these processes were still done by people, but in modern publishing they are almost always [[automation|automated]].  The result might be published as-is (as for a residential [[telephone directory|phone book]] interior) or might be tweaked by a graphic designer (as for a highly polished, expensive publication) it is very important as it allows you to read a [[Magazine]].

Beginning from early [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] pages in hand-copied books of the [[Middle Ages]] and proceeding down to intricate modern magazine and catalog layouts, proper page design has long been a consideration in printed material. With print media, elements usually consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].

== History and layout technologies ==

==={{anchor|Direct physical layout|Page setting}}Direct physical page setting===

With [[manuscript]]s, all of the elements are added by hand, so the creator can determine the layout directly as they create the work, perhaps with an advance sketch as a guide.

With ancient [[woodblock printing]], all elements of the page were carved directly into wood, though later layout decisions might need to be made if the printing was transferred onto a larger work, such as a large piece of fabric, potentially with multiple block impressions.

With the Renaissance invention of [[letterpress printing]] and cold-metal [[moveable type]], [[typesetting]] was accomplished by physically assembling characters using a [[composing stick]] into a galley‚Äîa long tray.  Any images would be created by [[engraving]].

The original document would be a hand-written manuscript; if the typesetting was performed by someone other than the layout artist, [[markup language|markup]] would be added to the manuscript with instructions as to typeface, font size, and so on. (Even after authors began to use typewriters in the 1860s, originals were still called "manuscripts" and the markup process was the same.)

After the first round of typesetting, a [[galley proof]] might be printed in order for [[proofreading]] to be performed, either to correct errors in the original, or to make sure that the typesetter had copied the manuscript properly, and correctly interpreted the markup.  The final layout would be constructed in a "form" or "forme" using pieces of wood or metal ("[[Furniture (typesetting)|furniture]]") to space out the text and images as desired, a frame known as a [[Chase (typesetting)|chase]], and objects which lock down the frame known as [[quoins]].  This process is called [[imposition]], and potentially includes arranging multiple pages to be printed on the same sheet of paper which will later be folded and possibly trimmed.  An "imposition proof" (essentially a short run of the press) might be created to check the final placement.

The invention of [[hot metal typesetting]] in 1884 sped up the typesetting process by allowing workers to produce [[Slug (typesetting)|slugs]]‚Äîentire lines of text‚Äîusing a keyboard.  The slugs were the result of molten metal being poured into molds temporarily assembled by the typesetting machine.  The layout process remained the same as with cold metal type, however: assembly into physical galleys.

===Paste-up era===
[[File:Editorial_office_of_Bild_newspaper,_West_Berlin,_1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Editor#Print media|Editors]] work on producing an issue of ''[[Bild]],'' 1977 in [[West Berlin]]. Previous front pages are affixed to the wall behind them. ]]
[[Offset lithography]] allows the bright and dark areas of an image (at first captured on film) to control ink placement on the printing press.  This means that if a single copy of the page can be created on paper and photographed, then any number of copies could be printed.  Type could be set with a [[typewriter]], or to achieve professional results comparable to letterpress, a specialized typesetting machine.  The [[IBM Selectric Composer]], for example, could produce type of different size, different fonts (including [[proportional font]]s), and with [[text justification]].  With [[photoengraving]] and [[halftone]], physical photographs could be transferred into print directly, rather than relying on hand-made engravings.

The layout process then became the task of creating the [[paste up]], so named because [[rubber cement]] or other adhesive would be used to physically paste images and columns of text onto a rigid sheet of paper.  Completed pages become known as [[camera-ready]], "mechanical" or "mechanical art".

[[Phototypesetting]] was invented in 1945; after keyboard input, characters were shot one-by-one onto a photographic negative, which could then be sent to the print shop directly, or shot onto photographic paper for paste-up.  These machines became increasingly sophisticated, with computer-driven models able to store text on magnetic tape.

=== Computer-aided publishing ===

As the graphics capabilities of computers matured, they began to be used to render characters, columns, pages, and even multi-page [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|signatures]] directly, rather than simply summoning a photographic template from a pre-supplied set.  In addition to being used as display devices for computer operators, [[cathode ray tube]]s were used to render text for phototypesetting. The curved nature of the CRT display however, led to distortions of text and art on the screen towards the outer edges of the screens. The advent of "flat screen" monitors (LCD, LED, and more recently OLED) in early 2010 eliminated the distortion problems caused by older CRT displays. As of 2016 flat panel displays have almost completely replaced CRT displays.&lt;ref&gt;[[Flat panel display]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}

[[Printer (computing)|Printers]] attached directly to computers allowed them to print documents directly, in multiple copies or as an original which could be copied on a [[ditto machine]] or [[photocopier]]. [[WYSIWYG]] [[word processor]]s made it possible for general office users and consumers to make more sophisticated page layouts, use text justification, and use more fonts than were possible with typewriters.  Early [[dot matrix printing]] was sufficient for office documents, but was of too low a quality for professional typesetting. [[Inkjet printing]] and [[laser printing]] did produce sufficient quality type, and so computers with these types of printers quickly replaced phototypesetting machines.

With modern [[desktop publishing]] software such as flagship software [[Adobe Indesign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html|title=Buy Adobe InDesign CC - Desktop publishing software and online publisher|author=|date=|website=www.adobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cloud-based [[Lucidpress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lucidpress.com/pages/tour/free-page-layout-software|title=Free Page Layout Software|author=|date=26 May 2015|website=lucidpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the layout process can occur entirely on-screen.  (Similar layout options that would be available to a professional print shop making a paste-up are supported by desktop publishing software; in contrast, "word processing" software usually has a much more limited set of layout and typography choices available, trading off flexibility for ease of use for more common applications.)  A finished document can be directly printed as the camera-ready version, with no physical assembly required (given a big enough printer).  Greyscale images must be either half toned digitally if being sent to an offset press, or sent separately for the print shop to insert into marked areas.  Completed works can also be transmitted digitally to the print shop, who may print it themselves, shoot it directly to film, or use [[computer to plate]] technology to skip the physical original entirely. [[PostScript]] and [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) have become standard file formats for digital transmission.

===Digital media (non-paper)===

Since the advent of [[personal computing]], page layout skills have expanded to [[electronic media]] as well as print media. [[E-book]]s, PDF documents, and static [[web page]]s mirror paper documents relatively closely, but computers can also add [[multimedia]] animation, and interactivity.  Page layout for [[interactive media]] overlaps with [[interface design]] and [[user experience]] design; an interactive "page" is better known as a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).

Modern web pages are typically produced using [[HTML]] for content and general structure, [[cascading style sheet]]s to control presentation details such as typography and spacing, and [[JavaScript]] for interactivity.  Since these languages are all text-based, this work can be done in a [[text editor]], or a special [[HTML editor]] which may have WYSIWYG features or other aids.  Additional technologies such as [[Macromedia Flash]] may be used for multimedia content. [[Web developer]]s are responsible for actually creating a finished document using these technologies, but a separate [[web designer]] may be responsible for establishing the layout.  A given web designer might be a fluent web developer as well, or may merely be familiar with the general capabilities of the technologies and merely visualize the desired result for the development team.

===Projected pages===

Projected slides used in presentations or entertainment often have similar layout considerations to printed pages.

The [[magic lantern]] and [[opaque projector]] were used during lectures in the 1800s, using printed, typed, photographed, or hand-drawn originals. Two sets of [[photographic film]] (one negative and one positive) or one [[reversal film]] can be used to create positive images that can be projected with light passing through. [[Intertitle]]s were used extensively in the earliest [[motion picture]]s when sound was not available; they are still used occasionally in addition to the ubiquitous [[vanity card]]s and [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]].

It became popular to use transparent film for presentations (with opaque text and images) using [[overhead projector]]s in the 1940s, and [[slide projector]]s in the 1950s. [[Transparency (projection)|Transparencies]] for overhead projectors could be printed by some photocopiers.  Computer [[presentation program]]s became available in the 1980s, making it possible to lay out a presentation digitally.  Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected directly using [[LCD]] overhead projectors.  Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a [[video projector]], [[computer monitor]], or [[Large-screen television technology|large-screen television]].

Laying out a [[presentation]] presents slightly different challenges than a print document, especially because a person will typically be speaking and referring to the projected pages.  Consideration might be given to:
* Sizing text and graphics so they can be seen from the back of the room, which limits the amount of information that can be presented on a single slide
* Using headers, footers, or repeated elements to make all pages similar so they feel cohesive, or indicate progress
* Using titles to introduce new topics or segments
* Pacing, so slides are changed at comfortable intervals, fit the length of the talk, and content order matches the speaker's expectation
* Providing a way for the speaker to refer to specific items on the page, such as with color, verbal labels, or a [[laser pointer]]
* Editing the information presented so it either repeats what the speaker is saying (so the audience can pay attention to either) or only presents information that cannot be conveyed verbally (to avoid dividing audience attention or simply reading slides directly)
* Use of animation to add emphasis, introduce information slowly, or be entertaining
* Making the slides useful for later reference if printed as handouts or posted online

== Grids versus templates ==
[[Grid (page layout)|Grid]]s and templates are page layout design patterns used in [[advertising campaign]]s and multiple-page publications, including [[website]]s.

A '''grid''' is a set of guidelines, able to be seen in the design process and invisible to the end-user/audience, for aligning and repeating elements on a page. A page layout may or may not stay within those guidelines, depending on how much repetition or variety the design style in the series calls for. Grids are meant to be flexible. Using a grid to lay out elements on the page may require just as much or more graphic design skill than that which was required to design the grid.

In contrast, a '''template''' is more rigid.  A template involves repeated elements mostly visible to the end-user/audience. Using a template to lay out elements usually involves less graphic design skill than that which was required to design the template. Templates are used for minimal modification of background elements and frequent modification (or swapping) of foreground content.

Most desktop publishing software allows for grids in the form of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart. Automatic margins and booklet spine (gutter) lines may be specified for global use throughout the document. Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page. Invisible to the end-user/audience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well. Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file, or with [[Desktop publishing#Terminology|master page]] features in a multiple-page document. Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements, automatic page numbering, and automatic table of contents features.

==Static versus dynamic layouts==
Static layouts allow for more control over the [[aesthetics]], and thorough optimization of space around and overlapping irregular-shaped content than dynamic layouts. In [[web design]], this is sometimes referred to as a fixed width layout; but the entire layout may be scalable in size while still maintaining the original proportions, static placement, and style of the content. All [[Image file formats#Raster formats|raster image formats]] are static layouts in effect; but a static layout may include searchable text by separating the text from the graphics.

In contrast, electronic pages allow for [[dynamic publishing|dynamic layouts]] with swapping content, [[personalization]] of styles, text scaling, [[image scaling]], or [[reflowable document|reflowable]] content with variable page sizes often referred to as fluid or liquid layout. Dynamic layouts are more likely to [[separation of presentation and content|separate presentation from content]], which comes with its own advantages. A dynamic layout lays out all text and images into rectangular areas of rows and columns. As these areas' widths and heights are defined to be percentages of the available screen, they are responsive to varying screen dimensions. They'll automatically ensure maximized use of available space while always staying adapted optimally both on screen resizes and hardware-given restrictions. Text may freely be resized to provide users' individual needs on legibility while never disturbing a given layout's proportions. The content's overall arrangement on screen this way may always remain as it was originally designed.

Static layout design may involve more graphic design and [[visual art]] skills, whereas dynamic layout design may involve more [[interactive design]] and [[content management]] skills to thoroughly anticipate content variation.

[[Motion graphics]] don't fit neatly into either category, but may involve layout skills or careful consideration of how the motion may affect the layout. In either case, the element of motion makes it a dynamic layout, but one that warrants [[motion graphic design]] more than static graphic design or interactive design.

Electronic pages may utilize both static and dynamic layout features by dividing the pages or by combining the effects. For example, a section of the page such as a [[web banner]] may contain static or motion graphics contained within a swapping content area. Dynamic or live text may be wrapped around irregular shaped images by using invisible spacers to push the text away from the edges. Some computer algorithms can detect the edges of an object that contain [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]] and flow content around contours.

==Front-end versus back-end==
With modern media content retrieval and output technology, there is much overlap between [[visual communication]]s ('''front-end''') and [[information technology]] ('''back-end'''). Large print publications (thick books, especially instructional in nature) and electronic pages (web pages) require [[meta data]] for automatic indexing, automatic reformatting, database publishing, dynamic page display and end-user interactivity. Much of the meta data ([[meta tags]]) must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process. This divides the task of page layout between artists and engineers, or tasks the artist/engineer to do both.

More complex projects may require two separate designs: page layout design as the [[front and back ends|front-end]], and function coding as the back-end. In this case, the front-end may be designed using an alternative page layout technology such as [[image editing software]] or on paper with hand rendering methods. Most image editing software includes features for converting a page layout for use in a "What You See Is What You Get" ([[WYSIWYG]]) editor or features to export graphics for desktop publishing software. WYSIWYG editors and desktop publishing software allow front-end design prior to back-end coding in most cases. Interface design and database publishing may involve more technical knowledge or collaboration with information technology engineering in the front-end. Sometimes, a function on the back-end is to automate the retrieval and arrangement of content on the front-end.

==Design elements and choices==

Page layout might be prescribed to a greater or lesser degree by a [[Style guide|house style]] which might be implemented in a specific desktop publishing template.  There might also be relatively little layout to do in comparison to the amount of pagination (as in novels and other books with no figures).

Typical page layout decisions include:
* Size of page [[Margin (typography)|margins]]
* Size and position of images and figures
* Deciding on the number and size of [[Column (typography)|columns]] and gutters (gaps between columns)
* Placement of intentional [[White space (visual arts)|whitespace]]
* Use of special effects like overlaying text on an image, [[Runaround (typography)|runaround]] and intrusions, or [[Bleed (printing)|bleeding]] an image over the page margin
* Use of [[color printing]] or [[spot color]] for emphasis

Specific elements to be laid out might include:
* Chapter or section titles, or [[headline]]s and [[subhead]]s
* [[Photo caption|Image captions]]
* [[Pull quote]]s and [[nut graph]]s which might be added out of course or to make a short story fit the layout
* [[Boxout]]s and [[Sidebar (publishing)|sidebars]], which present information as asides from the main text flow
* [[Page header]]s and [[page footer]]s, the contents of which are usually uniform across content pages and thus automatically duplicated by layout software.  The [[page number]] is usually included in the header or footer, and software automatically increments it for each page.
* [[Table of contents]]
* [[Note (typography)|Notes]] like footnotes and end notes; [[bibliography]], for example in academic journals or textbooks

In newspaper production, final selection and [[Cropping (image)|cropping]] of photographs accompanying stories might be left to the layout editor (since the choice of photo could affect the shape of the area needed, and thus the rest of the layout), or there might be a separate photo editor.  Likewise, [[headline]]s might be written by the layout editor, a [[copy editor]], or the original author.

To make stories fit the final layout, relatively inconsequential copy tweaks might be made (for example, rephrasing for brevity), or the layout editor might make slight adjustments to [[typography]] elements like [[font size]] or [[leading]].

===Floating block===
A floating block in [[writing]] and [[publishing]] is any graphic, text, table, or other representation that is unaligned from the main flow of text. Use of floating blocks to present pictures and [[table (information)|table]]s is a typical feature of [[academic writing]] and [[technical writing]], including scientific articles and books. Floating blocks are normally labeled with a caption or title that describes its contents and a number that is used to refer to the figure from the main text. A common system divides floating block into two separately numbered series, labeled ''figure'' (for pictures, diagrams, [[Plot (graphics)|plots]], etc.) and ''table''.  An alternative name for figure is '''image''' or '''graphic'''.

Floating blocks are said to be ''floating'' because they are not fixed in position on the page at the place, but rather drift to the side of the page.  By placing pictures or other large items on the sides of pages&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQcFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA2 ''New Perspectives on JavaScript and AJAX, Comprehensive'']. p. VS-B2.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than embedding them in the middle of the main flow of text, [[typesetting]] is more flexible and interruption to the flow of the narrative is avoided.

For example, an article on [[geography]] might have "Figure 1: Map of the world", "Figure 2: Map of Europe", "Table 1: Population of continents", "Table 2: Population of European countries", and so on. Some books will have a table of figures‚Äîin addition to the [[table of contents]]‚Äîthat lists centrally all the figures appearing in the work.

Other kinds of floating blocks may be differentiated as well, for example:

: Sidebar:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-I0_7Utu58C&amp;pg=PT406 ''Sams Teach Yourself Dreamweaver CS5 in 24 Hours'']. p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; For digressions from the main narrative. For example, a technical manual on usage of a product might include examples of how various people have employed the product in their work in sidebars. Also called an ''intermezzo''. See [[sidebar (publishing)]].
: Program: Articles and books on [[computer programming]] often place code and [[algorithms]] in a figure.
: Equation: Writing on [[mathematics]] may place large blocks of mathematical notation in numbered blocks set apart from the main text.

==Presenting layouts under development==

A [[mockup]] of a layout might be created to get early feedback, usually before all the content is actually ready.  Whether for paper or electronic media, the first draft of a layout might be simply a rough paper and pencil sketch.  A [[comprehensive layout]] for a new magazine might show placeholders for text and images, but demonstrate placement, typographic style, and other idioms intended to set the pattern for actual issues, or a particular unfinished issue.  A [[website wireframe]] is a low-cost way to show layout without doing all the work of creating the final HTML and CSS, and without writing the copy or creating any images.

[[Lorem ipsum]] text is often used to avoid the embarrassment any improvised sample copy might cause if accidentally published.  Likewise, placeholder images are often labelled "[[for position only]]".

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Polish postmodernism''' refers to the [[Polish culture|cultural]], artistic and [[Polish philosophy|philosophical]] development within the [[Poland|Polish society]] coinciding with the [[Revolutions of 1989|downfall of communism]] and the [[History of Poland (1989‚Äìpresent)#Round Table Agreement and democratic transition|democratic transitions]] leading to Poland's 2004 [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|accession into the European Union]].&lt;ref name="Bolecki"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pV6sFB-KuU8C&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=%22Two%20perspectives%20on%20the%201980s%20and%20after%22&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Two%20perspectives%20on%20the%201980s%20and%20after%22&amp;f=false | title=1989 in Poland: Continuity and Caesura | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing | work=History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe ''by Marcel Cornis-Pope and John Neubauer'' | year=2004 | accessdate=March 16, 2013 | author=Wlodzimierz Bolecki | pages=51‚Äì54 | isbn=9027234523 | format=Google book preview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The discourse on the philosophical concept and literary awareness of [[postmodernism]] appeared in Polish criticism long before the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, triggered by numerous publications of writers now characterized as postmodernist,&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Origins_of_Postmodernity.html?id=zvmhePXJJ5gC | title=Cristallization | publisher=Verso | work=The Origins of Postmodernity | year=1998 | accessdate=March 22, 2013 | author=Perry Anderson | format=Google book preview}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]], [[Kurt Vonnegut|Vonnegut]], [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]] as well as [[Raymond Federman|Federman]], [[John Hawkes (novelist)|Hawkes]] and [[Ihab Hassan|Hassan]] among others (separate anthologies).&lt;ref name="Janaszek-Ivaniƒçkov√°" /&gt; Already before the end of the 1970s [[Samuel Beckett]] was produced in Poland by over a dozen national theatres in seven metropolitan cities including primary TV broadcast in 1971. His ''[[En attendant Godot]]'' in translation premiered as far back as 1957 both in [[Warsaw]] (at ''Teatr Wsp√≥≈Çczesny'') and in [[Krak√≥w]] (''Teatr 38'').&lt;ref name="e-teatr.pl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.e-teatr.pl/pl/realizacje/423,sztuka.html | title=Author: Samuel Beckett | publisher=Instytut Teatralny im.

{{See also|Culture in post-communist Poland}}

In the Polish context, postmodernism has been categorized by [[literary criticism|literary critics]] as the framework of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] necessary for the success of European integration as far as post-national diversity and regional differences are concerned.&lt;ref name="crvp.org" /&gt;

The official welcome of postmodernism in post-communist Poland was somewhat late; it met with severe impediments not so much from the former communist establishment as from [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] itself and the Catholic Church, both of which promoted "collectivist" rather than "liberal" values.&lt;ref name="crvp.org" /&gt; However, beginning in the 1990s and throughout the early 21st century, postmodernism began to take a firm hold especially in the realms of poetics and art theory. Polish architects (Czes≈Çaw Bielecki, [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]; Marek Budzy≈Ñski) and selected filmmakers (i.e. [[Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski|Kie≈õlowski]], [[Juliusz Machulski|Machulski]], [[Agnieszka Holland]], [[:pl:Jan Komasa|Komasa]]: the ''[[Suicide Room]]'') contribute substantially to the Polish postmodernist {{nobreak|''anti-foundationalism''}} in popular culture.&lt;ref name="crvp.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crvp.org/book/Series04/IVA-34/chapter-7.htm | title=From ‚ÄòSocialist‚Äô to Postmodern Pluralism in Poland | publisher=The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy (RVP) | work=Chapter 7 | date=Feb 13, 2009 | accessdate=March 18, 2013 | author=Eugeniusz G√≥rski | format=[https://www.webcitation.org/6FDjBTl5h?url=http://www.crvp.org/book/Series04/IVA-34/chapter-7.htm WebCite query] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413225221/http://www.crvp.org/book/Series04/IVA-34/chapter-7.htm | archivedate=April 13, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beinek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiana.edu/~iuslavic/docs/P365_Spring2008_poster.pdf | title=Post-Communist Polish Culture (1989-Present) | publisher=Indiana University | work=Topics in Polish Literature and Culture (Slav-P365/565) | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Prof. Justyna Beinek | format=PDF file, direct download 66 KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic origins==
Although postmodernism was widely promoted in the so-called ''Drugi obieg'' (the Second circulation) by [[Polish underground press]], it has also been criticized as [[amorphous]] by both, Catholic philosophers, as well as "fallen Marxists",&lt;ref name="crvp.org" /&gt; credited with the emergence of  {{nobreak|'''''soc'''-postmodernism''}} in Poland&amp;nbsp;‚Äì based on ''extreme relativism'' and bitter sense of humor (see [[S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek|Mro≈ºek]]).&lt;ref name="Stephan"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Remembering Stalinism: S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek's Portrait and his Autobiographical Writings | publisher=The Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences | work=The Polish Review | date=1994| year=2013 | author=Halina Stephan  | jstor=25778784 | volume=39 | pages=131‚Äì148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuous dialog extending well-beyond the [[Martial law in Poland]], eventually led to destruction of the totalitarian ideology, and the inevitable acceptance of ''pluralism'' over ''foundationalism'' in art theory.&lt;ref name="Janaszek-Ivaniƒçkov√°" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crvp.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dascal"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aNwSImFZhUC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=%22extreme+relativism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CytOUc7AEvLSiAKLmICIBw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22extreme%20relativism%22&amp;f=false | title=Crossing Cultures | publisher=BRILL | work=Cultural Relativism and Philosophy | year=1991 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Marcelo Dascal | page=239 | format=Google book preview | isbn=9004094334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodernism entered Poland in the 1960s at the end of the [[Stalinism in Poland|Stalinist period]] (with [[Andrzej Wr√≥blewski|Wr√≥blewski]] having the greatest impact on postwar [[figurative painting]]).&lt;ref name="culture.pl-Wr√≥blewski "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culture.pl/web/english/resources-visual-arts-full-page/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/andrzej-wroblewski | title=Andrzej Wr√≥blewski | publisher=Adam Mickiewicz Institute ''Culture.pl'' | work=Resources: Visual Arts | date=December 2001 | accessdate=March 27, 2013 | author=Ma≈Çgorzata Kitowska-≈Åysiak, Institute of the Catholic University of Lublin }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was coupled with the advent of [[conceptualism]], [[Pop art]], as well as {{nobreak|[[neo-expressionism]]}}. These new movements&amp;nbsp;‚Äì beginning as unofficial political and artistic discourses&amp;nbsp;‚Äì challenged the vast matrix of Polish institutionalized culture defined before 1989 by the one-party system and the use of [[Socialist realism in Poland|politically charged realism]] as method of social control.&lt;ref name="Dziamski"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7oLWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=postmodernism | title=Postmodernizm | publisher=Instytut kultury, Warszawa | work=Encyklopedia kultury polskiej XX wieku, Od awangardy do postmodernizmu | year=1996 | accessdate=March 22, 2013 | author=Grzegorz Dziamski | isbn=838532321X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portrait of Ms Ruby May, Standing''''' is an [[oil on canvas]] painting made in 2012 by the British visual artist Leena McCall, portraying her friend Ruby May.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 7 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Luke|title=Painting Pulled From Exhibition Because of "Disgusting" Pubic Hair|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/art-culture/painting-pulled-gallery-disgusting-pubic-hair/|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=[[Vocativ]]|date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The painting depicts May, a tattooed black-haired woman, smoking a pipe. May is coolly scrutinizing the viewer, her other hand on her hip, with her trousers unbuttoned such that her [[pubic hair]] is visible. McCall's intention in painting May was to explore "how women choose to express their sexual identity beyond the [[male gaze]]".&lt;ref name="Independent 8 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|title=‚ÄòPornographic and disgusting‚Äô painting removed from top London exhibition ‚Äì because it features a woman‚Äôs pubic hair|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/pornographic-and-disgusting-painting-removed-from-top-london-exhibition--because-it-features-a-womans-pubic-hair-9592705.html|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The painting received public attention after the [[Mall Galleries]] removed it from the [[Society of Women Artists]]'s annual exhibition in 2014, after which it was replaced with another nude portrait. According to a statement by the Galleries, this was done because of "a number of complaints regarding the depiction of the subject and taking account of its location en route for children to our learning centre", and, according to McCall, because the painting had been deemed "disgusting" and "pornographic". Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Rowan Pelling]] interpreted this reaction as implying that "the minute a woman is alive and free to move, an active agent of her own sexuality, she is a menace to society", whereas Mall Galleries viewers appeared to feel more comfortable with a nude woman who is a "more passive and unthreatening recipient of the wandering viewer's gaze".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 7 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pelling|first1=Rowan|title=How is this painting 'pornographic' and 'disgusting'?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/07/painting-pornographic-pubic-hair-outrage|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the removal of the work, McCall started a [[Twitter]] campaign with the [[hashtag]] #eroticcensorship.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 7 July 2014" /&gt;

'''Ren√© Arthur Gagnon''' (March 7, 1925&amp;nbsp;‚Äì October 12, 1979) was a [[United States Marine Corps]] corporal who participated in the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] during [[World War II]]. He is best known for being one of the six flag-raisers who helped raise the second [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945 as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.

The [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] located in Arlington, Virginia, which was modeled after the flag-raising photograph, depicts bronze statues of each of the six Marine flag-raisers.

== Early years ==
Gagnon was born March 7, 1925 in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], the only child of [[French Canadian]] immigrants from [[Disraeli, Quebec (city)|Disraeli, Quebec]], Henri Gagnon and Ir√®ne Marcotte. He grew up without a father. His parents separated when he was an infant, though they never divorced. When he was old enough, he worked alongside his mother at a local shoe factory. He also worked as a [[bicycle messenger]] boy for the local Western Union.

== U.S. Marine Corps ==

=== World War II ===
Gagnon was drafted in 1943, and elected to join the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] on May 6. He was sent to the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]], [[South Carolina]]. On July 16, he was promoted to [[private first class]]. He was transferred to the Marine Guard Company at [[Charleston Naval Shipyard|Charleston Navy Yard]] in South Carolina and remained there for eight months. He then joined the [[Military police|Military Police]] Company of the [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton, California]]. On April 8, 1944, he was transferred to the [[2nd Battalion 28th Marines|2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]], [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine Division]]. In September, the 5th division left Camp Pendleton for further training at [[Camp Tarawa]], [[Hawaii]], for the assault on Iwo Jima by three Marine divisions of the [[V Amphibious Corps]] (code named "Operation Detachment").

==== Flag raisings on Iwo Jima ====
[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|right|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima]]

On February 19, 1945, Gagnon landed on the southeast side of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines on "Green Beach 1", which was the closest landing beach to [[Mount Suribachi]] on the southern end of the island. On February 23, Gagnon, a battalion runner (messenger) for Easy Company,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stripes.com/news/iwo-jima-battle-war-was-a-hell-for-both-sides-1.18470 Retrieved December 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; participated in what was most likely the most celebrated American flag raising in U.S. history.

On the morning of February 23, a 40-man combat patrol (mostly from Third Platoon, Easy Company) was sent to climb up Mount Suribach and siege and occupy the crest. First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]], E Company's executive officer, who volunteered to lead the patrol, was to raise an American flag on top to signal that the mountaintop was captured. Once Schrier and his men were on top they attached the flag to a Japanese iron water pipe. Then Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sgt. [[Ernest Ivy Thomas|Ernest Thomas]], and Sgt. [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]] raised the flag, planting the flagstaff into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living. CBS Radio interview by Dan Pryor with flag raiser Ernest "Boots" Thomas on February 25, 1945 aboard the [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)]]: "''Three of us actually raised the flag''"&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the raising of the [[National colours|national colors]] immediately caused loud cheers from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the south end beaches of Iwo Jima and from the men on the ships near the beach.

[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima (color).ogg|thumb|'''Gagnon''' is included in a  portion of the color film of the flag-raising taken by Sgt. [[Bill Genaust]], USMC, excerpted from the 1945 "Carriers Hit Tokyo" newsreel.]]
Some two hours after the first flag was raised on Mount Suribachi, the Marines decided that a larger flag should be flown on Mount Suribachi in order for the American flag to be seen more easily from the ships, beaches, and land off and around the north side of Mount Suribachi where most of the Japanese soldiers were located and heavy fighting would occur in the days ahead. Sgt. [[Michael Strank]] a squad leader of Second Platoon, E Company, was ordered to take three Marines from his squad up Mount Suribachi to raise the replacement flag. He selected Cpl. [[Harlon Block]], Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]], and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]]. Gagnon, a Second Battalion, 28th Marines runner (messenger) for E Company, was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag that was flying on top.

Once Gagnon and the four Marines were on top, a Japanese pipe was found by Hayes and Sousley and taken near the first flag position, After the replacement flag was attached to it, Lt. Schrier ordered the replacement flag to be raised and the first flag lowered at the same time. Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc. Gagnon, and Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]] raised the replacement flag (Navy corpsman [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] was incorrectly identified as a flag-raisers until June 23, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep the flagstaff in a vertical position, rocks were added around the base and a rope was tied to it and staked down in three spots. Associated Press combat photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]] took a black and white photograph of this flag raising which became world-famous. The flag raising was also filmed in color by Sgt. [[Bill Genaust]] who was killed in action a few days later.

[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|right|thumb|A diagram identifying the six men who raised the replacement flag on Mount Suribachi]]
On March 14, 1945, a third American flag was officially raised by two Marines at Kitano Point at the northern end of the island. The flag that Gagnon helped raise in the two unofficial flag-raisings on February 23, was lowered and taken to Marine headquarters. On March 27, Gagnon and the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines left Iwo Jima and both flags that were flown on Mount Suribachi were taken to Marine Headquarters in Washington, D.C. after the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines returned to Hawaii.

In 1991, former Marine Lt. George Greeley Wells, who was the 2nd battalion, 28th Marines, adjutant in charge of carrying the American flag(s) for the battalion, stated in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he was ordered by the battalion commander on February 23, 1945 to get a large replacement flag for the top of Mount Suribachi, and that he (Wells) ordered Gagnon, his E Company runner, to get a flag from a ship on shore&amp;nbsp;‚Äî possibly the {{USS|Duval County|LST-758}}.&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, Judy, USCG (story modified 11/17/2014) ''USCG Veteran Provided Stars and Stripes for U.S. Marines'' [http://www.uscg.mil/history/weboralhistory/Resnick_Iwo_Jima.asp] Retrieved January 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells stated that this flag was the one taken up Mount Suribachi by Gagnon to be given to Lt. Schrier of Company E, with a message for Schrier to raise this flag and return the other smaller flag raised earlier on Mount Suribachi back to Gagnon. Wells also stated, that he had handed the first flag to Schrier that Schrier took up Mount Suribachi, and when this flag was returned to him by Gagnon, he secured the flag until it was delivered to Marine Headquarters after the 2nd battalion returned to Hawaii from Iwo Jima.&lt;ref&gt;''The Man Who Carried the Flag on Iwo Jima'', by G. Greeley Wells. New York Times, October 17, 1991, p.

==== Government war bond tour ====
[[File:Seventh-War-Loan-Drive-Poster-1945.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Seventh-War-Loan-Drive-Poster (May 11‚ÄìJuly 4, 1945)]]
On March 27, 1945, when Gagnon and the 28th Marines left Iwo Jima for Hawaii, Gagnon was aboard the transport {{USS|Winged Arrow|AP-170}},&lt;ref&gt;http://navsource.org/archives/09/22/22170.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] ordered the six flag raisers in Rosenthal's flag raising photo to be sent to [[Washington, D.C.]]. Gagnon was the first to be identified, and as one of the three surviving flag raisers in the photo on April 7, followed by PhM2c. Bradley and Pfc. Hayes (Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, and Pfc. Franklin Soulsey were killed in action; Block was mistaken to be Sgt. Henry Hansen until a Marine investigation in 1946 revealed in 1947 it was Block). Once in Washington, D.C., the three were assigned to temporary duty with the Finance Division, [[United States Department of the Treasury]], for appearances and participation in connection with the Seventh War Loan drive (bond selling tour) from May 11 through July 4 (Hayes left the bond tour on May 25 for E Company in Hawaii). The tour was kicked off with a flag raising at the Nation's capitol on May 9 and went through 33 U.S cities raising billions of desperately needed dollars to help boost morale and win the war.&lt;ref&gt;The Mighty Seventh War Loan: {{cite web |url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406193329/http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |archivedate=2013-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three flag-raisers had the flag they had raised on Mount Suribachi with them during the bond tour.

In July 1945, Gagnon was ordered to San Diego for further transfer overseas. He married Pauline Georgette Harnois, of [[Hooksett, New Hampshire]], in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], on July 7, 1945.
By September, he was on his way overseas again, this time with the 80th Replacement Draft. On November 7, 1945, he arrived at [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]], [[China]], where he joined E Company, 2nd Battalion, [[29th Marine Regiment (United States)|29th Marines]], [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Division]]. He later served with the 3rd Battalion, 29th Marines. In March 1946, he had been on duty with the U.S. occupation forces in China for about five months before he boarded a ship at Tsingtao at the end of the month for San Diego. Gagnon arrived in San Diego on April 20, 1946. He was promoted to [[Corporal#United States|Corporal]] and was honorably discharged at Camp Pendleton, California, on April 27, 1946.

=== Return to Iwo Jima ===
On February 19, 1965, while working as an airline sales representative for [[Delta Air Lines]], Gagnon visited Mount Suribachi after visiting Tokyo with his wife and son.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stripes.com/news/flag-raisers-s-return-to-iwo-jima-it-all-seems-impossible-1.18468# Retrieved December 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stripes.com/news/after-iwo-life-was-hectic-for-surviing-flag-raisers-1.18467 Retrieved December 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Ren√© Gagnon, Jr. commented in 2014 that his father Ren√© Gagnon, Sr. opened a travel agency and did accounting work and was not a bitter alcoholic, and in his last job, he had worked as head of maintenance at an apartment complex in Manchester where he suffered a heart attack in the boiler room.&lt;ref&gt;Duckler, Ray (Concord Monitor, May 25, 2014) ''Ray Duckler: Son of Marine in iconic photo pay tribute to his father'' {{cite web |url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/12051030-95/ray-duckler-son-of-marine-in-iconic-photo-pays-tribute-to-his-father |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053619/http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/12051030-95/ray-duckler-son-of-marine-in-iconic-photo-pays-tribute-to-his-father |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} Retrieved January 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' (2000), in his latter years Gagnon only participated in events that were at his wife's urging, events praising the U.S. flag raising on Iwo Jima. She enjoyed the limelight, whereas he, by that time, no longer did. 
{{Pull quote|At the age of 53, he bitterly inventoried his lost "connections"&amp;nbsp;‚Äî the jobs promised him by government people when he had been at the height of his fame, jobs that never materialized.

=== Portrayal in films ===
Gagnon appeared in two films about the battle of Iwo Jima: ''[[To the Shores of Iwo Jima]]'' (a government documentary which simply showed the color footage of the U.S. flag raising) and ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'' (1949). He was also part of a [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] half-time show.

The '''Royal Palace of Mari''' was the royal residence of the rulers of the ancient kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in eastern [[Syria]]. Situated centrally amidst [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Babylon]], [[Levant]], and other Mesopotamian city-states, Mari acted as the ‚Äúmiddle-man‚Äù to these larger, powerful kingdoms.{{sfn|Malamat|1989|pp=2}} Both the size and grand nature of the palace demonstrate the importance of Mari during its long history, though the most intriguing feature of the palace is the nearly 25,000 tablets found within the palace rooms.{{sfn|Malamat|1989|pp=6}} The royal palace was discovered in 1935, excavated with the rest of the city throughout the 1930s, and is considered one of the most important finds made at Mari&lt;ref name="Kuhrt"&gt;Kuhrt, 1997, p.102.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andr√© Parrot]] led the excavations and was responsible for the discovery of the city and the palace. Thousands of clay tablets were discovered through the efforts of Andr√© Bianquis, which provided archaeologists the tools to learn about, and to understand, everyday life at the palace and in Mari.&lt;ref name="Parrot"&gt;Parrot, 1955, pg. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the tablets also aided in the labeling of various rooms in terms of their purpose and function.&lt;ref name="Burney"&gt;Burney, 1977, pg. 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Mari, Syria}}

The palace reached its grandest state with its last renovation under king [[Zimri-Lim]] in the 18th century BC; in addition to serving as the home of the royal family, the palace would have also housed royal guards, state workers, members of the military, and those responsible for the daily activities of the kingdom.{{sfn|Parrot|1955|pp=22-23}} The apartments of the king were well separated from the rest of the palace and relatively simple to identify when Parrot led the excavations.{{sfn|Parrot|1955|pp=23}} While most rooms in the palace were interconnected and allowed access to one another, the private quarters of the royal family were very isolated. Parrot emphasized the amount of privacy afforded the king and his family, as well as the maximum level of security that was maintained through the architecture of the building.{{sfn|Parrot|1955|pp=23}}

An entry gate was the only access point of the large palace complex, thus providing added security. The layout of the palace was also built with the security of the royal family in mind. A central court was surrounded by a series of smaller rooms. Entryways to courtyards were positioned in such a way as to make any attacks on those within the courtyard nearly impossible.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94}} Such architectural features did not allow any visitor to peer directly into one of the open courts, but forced a visitor to change direction and enter on the side of the court; anyone wishing to use a weapon would not have been able to directly access any room inside of the main gateway.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94}}

The royal palace at Mari was decorated with frescoes and statues. Decoration different depending on the function of the room.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94-95}} Religious and royal scenes were placed in public areas, where the message of kingship and religion could easily be viewed by visitors and residents of the palace.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94-95}} More private rooms, like the royal apartments, were decorated with patterns, shapes, and geometric designs.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94-95}} Designs in the royal apartments would have added to the luxurious accommodations befitting the royal family, while the representational frescoes would have demonstrated luxury, power, and authority.

==Archaeological finds==

===Statues===
Statues of gods and past rulers were the most common among statues unearthed at the Palace of Zimri-Lin. The title of [[Shakkanakku]] (military governor) was borne by all the princes of a dynasty who reigned at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the late third millennium and early second millennium BC. These kings were the descendents of the military governors appointed by the kings of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]].&lt;ref&gt;Louvre. "The Statuette of Iddi-Ilum," Department of Near Eastern Antiquities: Mesopotamia. Accessed December 1, 2014. http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/statuette-iddi-ilum&lt;/ref&gt; Statues and sculpture were used to decorate the exterior and interior of the palace. Zimri-Lin used these statues to connect his kingship to the gods and to the traditions of past rulers. Most notable of these statues are the statue of Iddi-Ilum, Ishtup-Ilum, the Statue of the Water Goddess, and Puzur-Ishtar.

====Puzur-Ishtar====
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Puzur Ishtar, governatore di Mari (fine 3o mill aC) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Puzur Ishtar, governatore di Mari (fine 3o mill aC) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006|The Statue of Puzur-Ishtar, Former Governor of Mari]]

The statue of Puzur-Ishtar once stood in one of the sanctuaries of the Palace of Zimri-Lim, but was discovered in the museum of [[Nebuchadrezzar]]‚Äôs palace at Babylon (604-562 B.C.E). The inscription on the hem of the statue‚Äôs skirt mentions Puzur-Ishtar, sakkanakku of Mari, and also mentions his brother the priest Milaga.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, Henriette-Marie. "The Palace of Zimri-Lim at Mari." ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' 47 (June.,1984): 70-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Horned caps are usually limited to divine representations in Mesopotamian art but they do not occur on depictions of kings during the Ur III period, therefore it is considered that perhaps the horns of divinity on Puzur-Ishtar‚Äôs cap qualified him (to the Babylonian soldiers) as a god to be carted home as the ultimate symbol of their victory over the people of Mari.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gates, "The Palace of Zimri-Lim at Mari," 70-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ishtup-Ilum====
The Statue of Ishtup-Ilum is made of [[basalt]] and was found in room 65 of the palace. The inscription on his shoulder identifies this man as a governor (sakkanakku) of Mari during the early second millennium B.C.E. Ishtup-Ilum was known for his lavish gifts to the [[Ishtar]] temple, the temple of the popular goddess of fertility, love, war, and sex. The height of the statue is 1.52 meters. The statue is now in the Aleppo Museum.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Iddi-Ilum====
[[File:Idi-ilum Louvre AO 19486 n01.jpg|thumb|Idi-ilum Louvre AO 19486 n01|The Statue of Iddi-Ilum]] 
[[Statue of Iddi-Ilum|Iddi-Ilum]] was a former sakkanakku of Mari. This statue portrays Iddi-Ilum as a religious ruler, for his hands are clasped in front of him in the typical Mesopotamian pose of prayer. His luxurious robe has a tasseled border and is wound around his body, contrary to Mesopotamian tradition. The statuette bears an inscription in Akkadian: ‚ÄúIddi-Ilum, shakkanakku of Mari, has dedicated his statue to [[Inanna]]. Whosoever erases this inscription will have his line wiped out by Inanna.‚Äù Connections can be made between this statuette and the statue of Puzur-Ishtar, also shakkanakku of Mari, by virtue of the trimmed beard and rich garments.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre. "Statuette of Iddi-Ilum," Department of Near Eastern Antiquities: Mesopotamia. Accessed December 1, 2014. http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/statuette-iddi-ilum&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statue of a Water Goddess====
[[File:Deesse au vase (Mari).jpg|thumb|Statue of a Water Goddess. Was originally a fountain, with water flowing out of the vase.]]
Depictions of water bearing goddesses were a common occurrence in Mesopotamia. The statue of a Goddess holding a vase was in fact a fountain, with water flowing out of the vase. This statue is nearly life size and most likely stood in the palace chapel. A channel connected to a water supply was drilled through the body of the statue and allowed water to flow from the goddess‚Äô vase.&lt;ref&gt;Wiess, Harvey. "From Ebla to Damascus: Art and Archaeology of Ancient Syria." ''Archaeology'' 38 (September/October 1985): 58-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tablets===

More than 20,000 tablets have been found in the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Robson, 2008, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets, according to [[Andr√© Parrot]], "brought about a complete revision of the historical dating of the ancient Near East and provided more than 500 new place names, enough to redraw or even draw up the geographical map of the ancient world"&lt;ref&gt;Sasson, Jack M. (October‚ÄìDec 1998). "The King and I a Mari King in Changing Perceptions". ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''118''' (4): pp. 453‚Äì470. doi:10.2307/604782..&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the recovered tablets have been identified as either the remains of the royal epistolary archive of Mari, other administrative documents, and the Kings letters to his wives which were found in the women's quarters. Some letters include direct quotes from King [[Hammurabi]] leading us to believe that they were contemporaneous with his rule.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Other letters shed light on divinity at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and in the [[ancient Near East]]. Letters from the epistolary archive include fascinating information about divination, gods, and even descriptions of ancient dreams. According to the tablets,  a prophetic dream was had, a letter would be sent to a diviner who would perform [[extispicy]] to confirm the revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang, p.209&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frescoes===
Figural frescoes were found in five rooms within the Palace of Mari. From those recovered, only four compositions were able to be restored,&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"&gt;Gates, Marie-Henriette . ‚ÄúThe Palace of Zimri-Lim at Mari.‚Äù The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 47, No. 2 (Jun., 1984), pp. 70-87.&lt;/ref&gt; due to the deterioration of the materials and damage done by [[Hammurabi]] of Babylon's sacking of Mari circa 2760 BCE. the date here is a misprint for ca. 1760 bce. (middle chronology) &lt;ref&gt;J. R. Krupper, "Mari," in Reallexikon der Assyriologie, vol. 7, p. 389. Hammurapi probably occupied Mari in the 32nd year of his reign&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="louvre.fr"&gt;Louvre. ‚ÄúMural Painting, Department of Near Eastern Antiquities: Mesopostamia.‚Äù Accessed November 28th, 2014.  http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mural-painting&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Investiture of Zimri-Lim====
[[File:Investiture of Zimri-Lim Louvre AO19826 n01.jpg|thumbnail|The Investiture of Zimri-lim]]
"[[Investiture of Zimri-Lim|The Investiture of Zimri-Lim]]," dating to the 18th century BCE and discovered during 1935‚Äì1936 excavations at Mari by French archaeologist [[Andr√© Parrot]], was the only painting found [[in situ]] in the palace. The painting is distinguished in part by its wide range of color, including green and blue. Painted on a thin layer of mud plaster applied directly to the palace's brick wall, the scene features a warrior goddess, likely [[Ishtar]], giving [[Zimri-Lim]] a ring and a staff, the symbols of kingship. The continuation of the red and blue painted border of the panel suggests that it was one of several adorning the walls of the room.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

Recent restoration efforts by the [[Louvre]] have revealed previously unseen details, such as scalloping on Zimri-Lim's robe, and unexpectedly vibrant colors, such as a brilliantly orange bull.&lt;ref name="louvre.fr"/&gt;

====Sacrifical procession scene====

Fragments of a sacrificial procession scene were found at the base of the eastern half of the same wall on which "The Investiture of Zimri-Lim" was recovered. The painting has multiple registers and depicts a life-size figure leading men who are in turn leading a procession of sacrificial animals. The colors utilized are black, brown, red, white, and gray.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

The application technique of this scene differs from the thin mud plaster used as a base for other frescoes in the palace. The sacrificial procession scene utilized layered mud, which was scored to aid attachment to a top layer of thick [[gypsum]] plaster. The presence of both frescoes in the same room and the better preservation of the "Investiture" scene could mean that "Investiture" was an earlier painting, and that the concealing of this fresco by the later procession scene is what saved it from suffering the same degree of damage as the palace's other frescoes.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

===="Audience chamber" frescoes====

A number of wall-painting fragments were also discovered in from the south-western end of narrow room that Parrot dubbed the "king's audience chamber." These fragments were restored to a size of 2.8 meters (nearly ten feet) in height and 3.35 meters (nearly eleven feet) in width.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

The paintings include two major registers, each depicting a scene in which offerings are made to deities. The scenes are framed by mythological creatures and bordered top and bottom by striding men carrying bundles on their backs. The figures are outlined with thick black line, with red, gray, brown, yellow, and white pigments utilized throughout the painting.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

====Other fragmentary images====

Painting fragments found in the same room as the "Investiture of Zimri-Lim" and the sacrificial procession scene include goats in heraldic pose flanking a tree, a life-size figure with a dagger in his belt, a figure in front of an architectural background, and a hand grasping hair in a manner very similar to the traditional [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] scene of a [[Narmer Palette#Smiting side|king smiting an enemy with a mace]].&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

Others rooms yielded very fragmentary wall paintings, which may have fallen and broken partly as a result of the collapse of an upper story. The fragments fall into two general stylistic groups: figures resembling the bundle-bearing men in the "audience chamber" frescoes, and life-size figures bearing similarity to the sacrificial procession scene.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

'''Shape Arts''' or '''Shape''' is a London-based arts charity, funded by [[Arts Council England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/shape-london |title=Browse: National portfolio organisations |publisher=Arts Council |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is committed to providing opportunities for disabled individuals wanting to work in the arts and cultural sector. It trains participants and runs arts and development programmes across all of the creative arts: visual arts, music, dance, writing and acting. Shape Arts partners with major cultural institutions to create positive change for disabled people by improving access, exposure and opportunities in contemporary art.

==History==
Shape was founded by Gina Levete MBE in 1976 with project funding from the [[Gulbenkian Foundation]].&lt;ref name="shapearts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/shape-at-a-glance |title=Shape at a glance |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current CEO is [[Tony Heaton]] OBE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Kim |date=2011-03-15 |title=Tony Heaton: joining the national network |url=http://www.culturalleadership.org.uk/375/ |publisher=Cultural Leadership Programme |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shape was informed by the political activism of the 60s. [[Disability arts]] grew out of the [[disability rights movement]], and the wider struggle by disabled people for equality and the right to participate in all aspects of society.&lt;ref name="shapearts1"/&gt;

==Activities==
Their mission is to provide skills, opportunities and support for disabled artists, individuals and cultural organisations; and help build a more inclusive cultural sector. It does this through four delivery aims:

*More disabled people employed in the creative industries
*More disabled people as audiences
*Disabled artists creating high quality creative work
*Disabled people participating in the arts

Shape Arts arranges exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=disabilityhorizons |url=http://disabilityhorizons.com/open-to-art |title=Calling all disabled artists &amp;#124; Disability and art |publisher=Disabilityhorizons.com |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; awards bursaries to promising disabled artists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org/?location_id=1781 |title=News: Shape Arts announces winner of the Adam Reynolds Bursary 2012 |publisher=disability arts online |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides training in media and marketing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communitydance.org.uk/DB/events-and-training-8/online-training-events-creative-steps-shape-arts.html |title=Foundation for Community Dance :: Online Training Events&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Creative Steps&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Shape Arts |publisher=Communitydance.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 2012 - Spring 2013, a [[pop-up retail|pop-up]] exhibition entitled 'Shape in the City' was presented in the centre of the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonpopups.com/2012/12/shape-arts-pop-up-gallery-in-city.html |title=Shape Arts Pop-up Gallery in The City |publisher=London Pop-ups |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shape recently had a temporary exhibition space for two years - a gallery at [[Westfield Stratford City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shapearts.org.uk/visit-shape-gallery |title=Visit Shape Gallery |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable artists==
*[[Yinka Shonibare]] is a disabled artist who worked as an arts development officer at Shape in the 90s. Shonibare acknowledges the role that Shape Arts played in his early career: "I worked for Shape three days a week, running workshops on singing, dancing or visual arts for disabled and older people in day centres and hospitals. The job meant I could afford to rent a studio and it gave me organisational and fundraising skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilitynow.org.uk/entertainment/arts/an-artist-with-a-lot-of-bottle |title=An artist with a lot of bottle ‚Äî Disability Now |publisher=Disabilitynow.org.uk |date=2012-01-14 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Shonibare was announced as patron of the annual Shape 'Open' exhibition where disabled and non-disabled artists are invited to submit work in response to a disability focused theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shape Open exhibition Patron Announced|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/news/shape-open-exhibition-patron-announced.aspx|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yinka Shonibare MBE Announces Winner of Shape Open 2013 |url=https://www.shapearts.org.uk/Blog/yinka-shonibare-mbe-announces-winner-of-shape-open-2013 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial Support==
Renowned British contemporary artists have donated artworks to Shape to raise money for the charity through an auction at [[Bonhams]]. Funds raised from the sale were matched by the Arts Council‚Äôs Catalyst Arts Fund and went towards supporting new arts activities and opportunities for disabled people. Works by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], [[Mat Collishaw]], [[Angela de la Cruz]], [[Tacita Dean]], Sir [[Antony Gormley]], [[Marc Quinn]] and [[David Shrigley]] were auctioned at Bonhams London on 4 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shapearts.org.uk/Blog/shapes-inaugural-contemporary-art-fundraiser |title=Blog &amp;#124; Shape's Inaugural Contemporary Art Fundraiser |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, an online auction at [[Paddle8]] included donations of twenty-five artworks from a range of internationally acclaimed artists including [[Jeremy Deller]], [[Julie Umerle]], [[Candida Hofer]], [[Ragnar Kjartansson (sculptor)|Ragnar Kjartansson]], [[Hito Steyerl]], [[Grayson Perry]] and [[Hans Op de Beeck]] in support of Shape Arts' 40th anniversary and the continued importance of the organisation's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shapearts.org.uk/Event/shape-art-auction |title=Shape Benefit Art Auction &amp; Exhibition |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack Hutchinson |url=https://www.a-n.co.uk/news/shape-arts-40th-anniversary-auction-raises-27k |title=Shape Arts 40th anniversary auction raises ¬£27,000 ¬´ a-n The Artists Information Company |publisher=A-n.co.uk |date=2016-04-26 |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sirenomelia2.jpg|thumb|upright|Sirenomelia]]
'''Sirenomelia''', also called '''mermaid syndrome''', is a rare [[congenital deformity]] in which the legs are fused together.

== Etymology ==
The word ''sirenomelia'' derives from the ancient Greek word ''seirƒìn,'' referring to the mythological [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]], who were sometimes depicted as mermaids, and ''melos'', meaning "limb".

== Description ==
Sirenomelia is mainly characterized by the fusion of both legs with rotation of the [[fibula]]. It often also includes [[single umbilical artery]], [[Anal atresia|anal and rectal atresia]], little to no development of the genitals, [[renal agenesis]], and [[Caudal regression syndrome|sacral agenesis]] or dysplasia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/751694637|title=Common malformations.|last=B.|first=Holmes, Lewis|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780199722785|location=Oxford|oclc=751694637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less severe cases involve a single poorly functioning kidney rather than full renal agenesis. In general, the more severe cases of limb fusion correlate with more severe dysplasia in the pelvis. Rather than the two iliac arteries present in fetuses with complete renal agenesis, fetuses with sirenomelia display no branching of the [[abdominal aorta]], which is always absent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Associated defects recorded in cases of sirenomelia include [[neural tube defect]]s ([[rachischisis]], [[anencephaly]], and [[spina bifida]]), [[holoprosencephaly]], [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]], other heart defects, [[esophageal atresia]], [[omphalocele]], [[intestinal malrotation]], [[persistent cloaca]], and other limb defects (most commonly absence of the radius).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Though obvious at birth, sirenomelia can be diagnosed as early as 14 weeks gestation on  [[Obstetric ultrasonography|prenatal ultrasound]]. When there is low amniotic fluid around the fetus ([[oligohydramnios]]), the diagnosis is more difficult.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Causes ==
The ultimate cause of sirenomelia is a subject of debate.The first hypothesis of its origin was developed in 1927 and proposed that a lack of blood supply to the lower limbs during their development is responsible for the defect. This "vascular steal" hypothesis was developed in response to the observed absence or severe underdevelopment of the aorta below the umbilical artery, which "steals" the blood supply from the lower limbs. Other hypotheses involve an insult to the embryo between 28‚Äì32 days affecting the [[Mesoderm|caudal mesoderm]], a [[teratogen]] exposure affecting the neural tube during [[neurulation]], and a defect in the twinning process that either stops the process of caudal differentiation or generates a second [[primitive streak]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Maternal [[diabetes mellitus]] has been associated with [[caudal regression syndrome]] and sirenomelia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965492903|title=Emery's elements of medical genetics|last=Peter D.|first=Turnpenny|publisher=Elsevier|others=Ellard, Sian,|year=2017|isbn=9780702066894|edition= Edition 15|location=[Philadelphia, Pa.]|pages=|oclc=965492903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qsQWI-v50MwC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=sirenomelia+%22maternal+diabetes%22+incidence|title=Rudolph's Fundamentals of Pediatrics|author1=Abraham M.

=== Genetics ===
In animal models, several genes have been found to cause or be associated with sirenomelia. The ''srn'' (''siren'') gene is observed to cause hindlimb fusion in homozygous mice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/20812|title=srn siren [ Mus musculus (house mouse) ]|last=|first=|date=|website=NCBI Gene|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mice with knockouts or mutations in both ''[[tsg1]]'' and ''[[Bone morphogenetic protein 7|bmp7]]'' will also have hindlimb fusion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65960|title=Twsg1 twisted gastrulation BMP signaling modulator 1 [ Mus musculus (house mouse) ]|last=|first=|date=|website=NCBI Gene|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:98421|title=srn MGI Mouse Gene Detail - MGI:98421 - siren|website=www.informatics.jax.org|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
[[File:Sirenomelia.svg|left|thumb|Classification of sirenomelia by the presence or absence of bones within the lower limb.&lt;br&gt;
I) all bones of thigh and lower leg present&lt;br&gt;
II) fused [[fibula]]&lt;br&gt;
III) fibula absent&lt;br&gt;
IV) partially fused femur, fused fibula&lt;br&gt;
V) partially fused femur&lt;br&gt;
VI) fused femur, fused [[tibia]]&lt;br&gt;
VII) fused femur, tibia absent]]Sirenomelia is classified by the skeletal structure of the lower limb, ranging from class I, where all bones are present and only the soft tissues are fused, to class VII where the only bone present is a fused [[femur]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It has also been classified as an expanded part of the [[VACTERL association]] and as a form of [[caudal regression syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onyeije|first1=Chukwuma|last2=Sherer|first2=David|last3=Handwerker|first3=Sara|last4=Shah|first4=Leena|year=2008|title=Prenatal Diagnosis of Sirenomelia with Bilateral Hydrocephalus: Report of a Previously Undocumented form of VACTERL-H Association|journal=American Journal of Perinatology|volume=15|issue=3|pages=193‚Äì7|doi=10.1055/s-2007-993925|pmid=9572377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828737906|title=Human embryology and developmental biology|last=M.|first=Carlson, Bruce|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|isbn=9781455727971|edition= 5th|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|oclc=828737906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Sirenomelia is usually fatal. Many pregnancies with a sirenomelic fetus spontaneously [[Miscarriage|miscarry]]. One-third to one-half of infants are [[Stillbirth|stillborn]], with all but a few dying in the [[neonatal period]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In cases of [[monoamniotic twins]] where one is affected, the twin with sirenomelia is protected from [[Potter sequence]] (particularly [[pulmonary hypoplasia]] and abnormal facies) by the normal twin's production of amniotic fluid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
This condition is found in approximately one out of every 100,000 live births; studies produce rates from 1 in 68,741 to 1 in 97,807.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kallen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jmg.29.1.30 |title=The cyclops and the mermaid: An epidemiological study of two types of rare malformation |year=1992 |last1=Kallen |first1=B |last2=Castilla |first2=E E |last3=Lancaster |first3=P A |last4=Mutchinick |first4=O |last5=Knudsen |first5=L B |last6=Martinez-Frias |first6=M L |last7=Mastroiacovo |first7=P |last8=Robert |first8=E |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=29 |pages=30‚Äì5 |pmid=1552541 |issue=1 |pmc=1015818}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is 100 to 150 times more likely in identical (monozygotic) twins than in singletons or fraternal twins.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/859526325|title=Creasy and Resnik's maternal-fetal medicine : principles and practice|others=Creasy, Robert K.,, Resnik, Robert,, Greene, Michael F.,, Iams, Jay D.,, Lockwood, Charles J.,|isbn=9780323186650|edition= Seventh|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=859526325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sirenomelia is not associated with any ethnic background, but fetuses with sirenomelia are more likely to have [[Testicle|testes]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;!-- This is phrased as "more likely to have testes" (or alternatively, gonadal males) specifically because the original studies only assessed presence of ovaries, testes, or neither in affected fetuses/neonates. These studies did not involve karyotyping, and fetuses with sirenomelia typically do not have genitals. --&gt;

==History==
Sirenomelia was first reported in 1542. In 1927, Otto Kampmeier discovered the association between sirenomelia and [[single umbilical artery]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Notable individuals ===
Only a few individuals who had some functioning kidney tissue have survived the neonatal period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She died on February 24, 2016 at the age of 27.

==== Shiloh Pepin ====

Shiloh Jade Pepin (August 4, 1999 ‚Äì October 23, 2009) was born in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]], [[United States]] with her lower extremities fused, no bladder, no [[uterus]], no rectum, only 6&amp;nbsp;inches of large [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], no [[vagina]], and with only one quarter of a [[kidney]] and one [[ovary]]. Her parents initially anticipated she could expect only a few months of life. At age 3, her natural kidney failed, and she began [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;TV program ''Body Shock'', 10‚Äì11 pm, 18 May 2010, [[Channel 4]]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] at age 2 lasted a number of years, and in 2007 a second kidney transplant was successful. She attended Consolidated [[Elementary School]]. She remained hopeful about her disease and joked often and lived her life happily, despite her challenges, as seen in her [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] documentary in "Extraordinary People: Mermaid Girl". Shiloh and her family were debating surgery because of the risks involved, even though it would improve her quality of life. Many people who have this condition receive surgery when they are young, but Shiloh was already 8 years old in the documentary and had not received surgery.  Shiloh was the only one of the three survivors of sirenomelia without surgery for separation of the conjoined legs.&lt;ref name="aolhealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aolhealth.com/health/mermaid-syndrome-sirenomelia|title=10-Year-Old Girl Born With Legs Fused Together|last=Sammons|first=Mary Beth|date=November 26, 2009|publisher=AOL|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126004109/http://www.aolhealth.com/health/mermaid-syndrome-sirenomelia|archivedate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She died of [[pneumonia]] on October 23, 2009, at [[Maine Medical Center]] in [[Portland, Maine]], at the age of 10;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Dolce |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20091023-NEWS-910239966 |title=Community saddened at 'Mermaid girl' Shiloh Pepin's passing |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; having appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show on September 22, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHILOH PEPIN|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/In-Memoriam-Remembering-Oprah-Show-Guests/10|work=The Oprah Show|publisher=oprah.com|accessdate=4 March 2014|date=May 16, 2011|quote=In Memoriam: The Oprah Show has hosted a number of unforgettable guests over the years.

==== Milagros Cerr√≥n ====

Milagros Cerr√≥n Arauco was born on April 27, 2004, in [[Huancayo]], [[Peru]]. Although most of Milagros‚Äô internal organs, including her heart and lungs, are in perfect condition, she was born with serious internal defects, including a deformed left [[kidney]] and a very small right one located very low in her body. In addition, her [[gastrointestinal tract|digestive]], [[urinary system|urinary tract]]s and [[sex organ|genitals]] share a single tube.
This birth defect occurs during the gastrulation week (week 3) of embryonic development. Gastrulation establishes the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. It seems that complications such as defects in the urogenital system as mentioned above can be possibly due to malformations in the intermediate mesoderm.

A four-hour operation to insert silicone bags between her legs to stretch the skin was successfully completed on February 8, 2005. A successful operation to separate her legs to just above the knee took place May 31, 2005, in a "Solidarity Hospital" in the district of [[Surquillo]] in [[Lima]]. The procedure, however, was so intensive that she became [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] to the degree of losing her ability to form proper speech patterns, leaving her nearly [[speech disorder|mute]]. It is not yet known if this is a [[physiological]] or [[psychological]] condition. However, at Milagros' second birthday, her mother reported that she knew more than 50 words. A second operation to complete the separation up to the groin took place on September 7, 2006.&lt;ref name="legssplit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5325082.stm|title="Mermaid" girl's legs separated|date=7 September 2006|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her doctor Luis Rubio said he was pleased with the progress Milagros had made, but cautioned that she still needed 10 to 15 years of rehabilitation and more operations before she could lead a normal life. Particularly, she will require reconstructive surgery to rebuild her rudimentary [[anus]], [[urethra]] and genitalia.

Milagros' parents are from a poor village in Peru's [[Andes|Andes Mountains]]; the Solidarity Hospital has given a job to her father Ricardo Cerr√≥n so that the family can remain in [[Lima]], while the City of Lima has pledged to pay for many of the operations.&lt;ref name="firststeps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5381616.stm|title="Mermaid" girl takes first steps|publisher=BBC News|date=28 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1965">In [[South Africa]], '''Swenkas''' are [[working-class]] [[Zulu people|Zulu]] men who participate in amateur competitions that are part [[fashion show]] and part [[choreography]], the purpose of which is to display one's [[Fashion|style]] and sense of attitude.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The practice, called "'''swenking'''", ultimately derives from the English word "[[:wikt:swank|swank]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Swenkas |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925881?refcatid=31 |last=Felperin |first=Leslie |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=Jan 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These well-dressed men are proud and considered to serve as an inspiration to others. Frequently, on Saturday nights they meet up to compete in a fashion show of sorts. The Swenkas are judged both on what they are wearing (typically, expensive designer suits with well-known European names on their labels) and their choreographed movements (their 'swank').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Swanky Swenkas: dressing sharp regardless of cost |url=https://www.vice.com/read/swank-v14n5 |last=Fleminger |first=David |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an entrance fee to compete in these swank-offs and the winner of the night goes home with a portion of the money collected from the competitors. The men follow certain set values of swanking, such as physical cleanliness, sobriety and above all self-respect. In 2004, [[Denmark|Danish]] filmmaker [[Jeppe R√∏nde]] created ''The Swenkas'', a documentary about the group.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{citation |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2005/11/09/movies/09swen.html |title=Saturday Night Peacocks in Squalid South Africa |last=Catsoulis |first=Jeanette |date= November 9, 2005 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''''' was published in 1965, the result of a collaboration between human rights activist [[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]] and journalist [[Alex Haley]]. Haley [[Collaborative writing|coauthored]] the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's 1965 assassination. The ''Autobiography'' is a [[Religious conversion|spiritual conversion narrative]] that outlines Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's philosophy of [[black pride]], [[black nationalism]], and [[pan-Africanism]]. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue.{{Cref|a}} He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's life.

While Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and scholars contemporary to the book's publication regarded Haley as the book's [[ghostwriter]], modern scholars tend to regard him as an essential collaborator. They say he intentionally muted his authorial voice to create the effect of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X speaking directly to readers. Haley influenced some of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's literary choices. For example, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X left the [[Nation of Islam]] during the period when he was working on the book with Haley. Rather than rewriting earlier chapters as a [[polemic]] against the Nation which Malcolm X had rejected, Haley persuaded him to favor a style of "suspense and drama". According to [[Manning Marable]], "Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's [[anti-Semitism]]" and he rewrote material to eliminate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/pdfs/Souls.Rediscovering_Malcolms_Life.pdf |first=Manning |last=Marable |title=Rediscovering Malcolm's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History |journal=Souls |volume=7 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/10999940590910023 |page=33 |year=2005 |accessdate=February 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''Autobiography'' was published, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer described it as a "brilliant, painful, important book". In 1967, historian [[John William Ward (professor)|John William Ward]] wrote that it would become a classic American autobiography. In 1998, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' as one of ten "required reading" nonfiction books. [[James Baldwin]] and [[Arnold Perl]] adapted the book as a film; their screenplay provided the source material for [[Spike Lee]]'s 1992 film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]]''.

==Summary==
Published posthumously, ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' is an account of the life of [[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]], born Malcolm Little (1925‚Äì1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book describes Malcolm's childhood in [[Michigan]], the death of his father under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her [[Involuntary commitment|commitment]] to a [[psychiatric hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=4‚Äì5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in [[organized crime]]. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946‚Äì1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carson|1995|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book addresses his ministry with [[Elijah Muhammad]] and the [[Nation of Islam]] (1952‚Äì1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his [[hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]], which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox [[Sunni Islam]], and his travels in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=6‚Äì13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was assassinated in New York's [[Audubon Ballroom]] in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist [[Alex Haley]], summarizes the last days of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s epilogue.&lt;ref&gt;Als, Hilton, "Philosopher or Dog?", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=91}}; [[John Edgar Wideman|Wideman, John Edgar]], "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: The Art of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=104‚Äì5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre==
The ''Autobiography'' is a [[Religious conversion|spiritual conversion narrative]] that outlines Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's philosophy of [[black pride]], [[black nationalism]], and [[pan-Africanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|pp= 250, 262‚Äì3}}; [[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D. G.]], "The Riddle of the Zoot: Malcolm Little and Black Cultural Politics During World War II", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic [[Arnold Rampersad]] and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X biographer [[Michael Eric Dyson]] agree that the narrative of the ''Autobiography'' resembles the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] approach to [[Confessional writing|confessional narrative]]. Augustine's ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' and ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' both relate the early [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lives of their subjects, document deep philosophical change for spiritual reasons, and describe later disillusionment with religious groups their subjects had once revered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Rampersad|Rampersad, Arnold]], "The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's ''Malcolm'' and Malcolm's Malcolm", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=122}}; {{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Haley and autobiographical scholar Albert E. Stone compare the narrative to the [[Icarus|Icarus myth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=271}}; {{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Paul John Eakin and writer Alex Gillespie suggest that part of the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s rhetorical power comes from "the vision of a man whose swiftly unfolding career had outstripped the possibilities of the traditional autobiography he had meant to write",&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, Paul John, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=152‚Äì61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; thus destroying "the illusion of the finished and unified personality".&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Alex, "Autobiography and Identity", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=34, 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to functioning as a spiritual conversion narrative, ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' also reflects generic elements from other distinctly American literary forms, from the Puritan conversion narrative of Jonathan Edwards and the secular self-analyses of Benjamin Franklin, to the African American slave narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature, Vol. 2|last = Gates, Jr.|first = Henry Louis|publisher = W.W. Norton and Co,|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-393-92370-4|location = New York|pages = 566|last2 = Smith|first2 = Valerie A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aesthetic decision on the part of Malcolm X and Haley also has profound implications for the thematic content of the work, as the progressive movement between forms that is evidenced in the text reflects the personal progression of its subject. Considering this, the editors of the ''Norton Anthology of African American Literature'' assert that, "Malcolm's ''Autobiography'' takes pains to interrogate the very models through which his persona achieves gradual self-understanding...his story's inner logic defines his life as a quest for an authentic mode of being, a quest that demands a constant openness to new ideas requiring fresh kinds of expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|last = Gates, Jr.|first = Henry Louis|publisher = W.W.

[[File:Malcolm-x.jpg|right|thumb|upright= .85 |Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X waiting for a press conference to begin on March 26, 1964]]
Haley [[Collaborative writing|coauthored]] ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', and also performed the basic functions of a [[ghostwriter]] and biographical [[amanuensis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|pp= 24, 233, 247, 262‚Äì264}}.&lt;/ref&gt; writing, compiling, and editing&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gallen|1995|pp=243‚Äì244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Autobiography'' based on more than 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103‚Äì110}}; Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=119, 127‚Äì128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote an article about the Nation of Islam for ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and again when Haley interviewed Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X for ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=391}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] publishing company asked Haley to write a book about the life of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. American writer and literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] writes, "When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ..."&lt;ref name="Bloom page 12"/&gt; Haley recalls, "It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain."&lt;ref name="Bloom page 12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloom|2008|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the ''Autobiography'', a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village.&lt;ref name="Bloom page 12"/&gt; Bloom writes, "Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military."&lt;ref name="Bloom page 12"/&gt;

When work on the ''Autobiography'' began in early 1963, Haley grew frustrated with Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's tendency to speak only about Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Haley reminded him that the book was supposed to be about Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, not Muhammad or the Nation of Islam, a comment which angered Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. Haley eventually shifted the focus of the interviews toward the life of his subject when he asked Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X about his mother:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=392}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, could you tell me something about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_201.html |title=The Time Has Come (1964‚Äì1966) |work=[[Eyes on the Prize|Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Movement 1954‚Äì1985]], [[American Experience]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=March 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423154235/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_201.html |archivedate=April 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the ''Autobiography'', modern scholars tend to treat him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure in the composition of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Leak, Jeffery B., "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and black masculinity in process", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=52‚Äì55}}; Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=104‚Äì110, 119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103‚Äì116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X biographer [[Manning Marable]] considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=299‚Äì316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marable argues that a critical analysis of the ''Autobiography'', or the full relationship between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.&lt;ref name="Marable 2009 310‚Äì311"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=310‚Äì311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley's contribution to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss how it should be characterized.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, Robert E., "Introduction" in, {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=3‚Äì4}}, Gillespie, "Autobiography and Identity", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp= 26‚Äì36}}; Norman, Brian, "Bringing Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X to Hollywood", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010| pp=43}}; Leak, "Malcolm X and black masculinity in process", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=52‚Äì55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, [[psychobiography|psychobiographical]] writer [[Eugene Victor Wolfenstein]] writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-[[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] psychiatrist and spiritual confessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfenstein|1993|pp= 37‚Äì39, 285, 289‚Äì294, 297, 369}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=156‚Äì159}}; {{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=52‚Äì55}}; {{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, "Autobiography and identity", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=34‚Äì37}}; {{Harvnb|Wolfenstein|1993|pp=289‚Äì294}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: The Art of Autobiography", writer and professor [[John Edgar Wideman]] examines in detail the narrative landscapes found in biography. Wideman suggests that as a writer, Haley was attempting to satisfy "multiple allegiances": to his subject, to his publisher, to his "editor's agenda", and to himself.&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103‚Äì105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Haley was an important contributor to the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s popular appeal, writes Wideman.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=104‚Äì105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wideman expounds upon the "inevitable compromise" of biographers,&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"/&gt; and argues that in order to allow readers to insert themselves into the broader socio-psychological narrative, neither coauthor's voice is as strong as it could have been.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=106‚Äì111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wideman details some of the specific pitfalls Haley encountered while coauthoring the ''Autobiography'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are serving many masters, and inevitably you are compromised. The man speaks and you listen but you do not take notes, the first compromise and perhaps betrayal. You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute for the reader your experience of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts‚Äîquotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech‚Äîvernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes&amp;nbsp;....&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the body of the ''Autobiography'', Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is seemingly absent: "Haley does so much with so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium".&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 104"/&gt; Wideman argues that Haley wrote the body of the ''Autobiography'' in a manner of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's choosing and the epilogue as an extension of the biography itself, his subject having given him [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] for the chapter. Haley's voice in the body of the book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X but seemingly written by no author.&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"/&gt; The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader to feel as though the voice of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: "Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told."&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103‚Äì105, 106‚Äì108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Two Create One: The Act of Collaboration in Recent Black Autobiography: Ossie Guffy, Nate Shaw, and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", Stone argues that Haley played an "essential role" in "recovering the historical identity" of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone also reminds the reader that collaboration is a cooperative endeavor, requiring more than Haley's prose alone can provide, "convincing and coherent" as it may be:&lt;ref name="Stone 1982 263"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Though a writer's skill and imagination have combined words and voice into a more or less convincing and coherent narrative, the actual writer [Haley] has no large fund of memories to draw upon: the subject's [Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X] memory and imagination are the original sources of the arranged story and have also come into play critically as the text takes final shape. Thus ''where'' material comes from, and ''what'' has been done to it are separable and of equal significance in collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Stone's estimation, supported by Wideman, the source of autobiographical material and the efforts made to shape them into a workable narrative are distinct, and of equal value in a critical assessment of the collaboration that produced the ''Autobiography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|pp=262‚Äì263}}; Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=101‚Äì116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Haley's skills as writer have significant influence on the narrative's shape, Stone writes, they require a "subject possessed of a powerful memory and imagination" to produce a workable narrative.&lt;ref name="Stone 1982 263"/&gt;

===Collaboration between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Haley===
The collaboration between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Haley took on many dimensions; editing, revising and composing the ''Autobiography'' was a power struggle between two men with sometimes competing ideas of the final shape for the book. Haley "took pains to show how Malcolm dominated their relationship and tried to control the composition of the book", writes Rampersad.&lt;ref name="WOOD119"/&gt; Rampersad also writes that Haley was aware that memory is selective and that autobiographies are "almost by definition projects in fiction", and that it was his responsibility as biographer to select material based on his authorial discretion.&lt;ref name="WOOD119"/&gt; The narrative shape crafted by Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X is the result of a life account "distorted and diminished" by the "process of selection",  Rampersad suggests, yet the narrative's shape may in actuality be more revealing than the narrative itself.&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 118‚Äì119"/&gt; In the epilogue Haley describes the process used to edit the manuscript, giving specific examples of how Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X controlled the language.&lt;ref name="X 1965 414"&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=414}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Haley ultimately deferred to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's specific choice of words when composing the manuscript,&lt;ref name="X 1965 414"/&gt; Wideman writes, "the nature of writing biography or autobiography ... means that Haley's promise to Malcolm, his intent to be a 'dispassionate chronicler', is a matter of disguising, not removing, his authorial presence."&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"/&gt; Haley played an important role in persuading Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X not to re-edit the book as a polemic against Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam at a time when Haley already had most of the material needed to complete the book, and asserted his authorial agency when the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s "fractured construction",&lt;ref&gt;Wood, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the New Blackness", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; caused by Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's rift with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, "overturned the design"&lt;ref name="Andrews 1992 152"/&gt; of the manuscript and created a narrative crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=156‚Äì158}}; Terrill, "Introduction", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|p=3}};{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s epilogue, Haley describes the incident:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I sent Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X some rough chapters to read. I was appalled when they were soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, I reminded him of his previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.&lt;ref name="X 1965 414"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Alex haley US coast guard.png|left|thumb|upright=0.44 |Haley in the United States Coast Guard, 1939]]

Haley's warning to avoid "telegraphing to readers" and his advice about "building suspense and drama" demonstrate his efforts to influence the narrative's content and assert his authorial agency while ultimately deferring final discretion to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref name="X 1965 414"/&gt; In the above passage Haley asserts his authorial presence, reminding his subject that as a writer he has concerns about narrative direction and focus, but presenting himself in such a way as to give no doubt that he deferred final approval to his subject.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=157‚Äì158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Eakin, "Because this complex vision of his existence is clearly not that of the early sections of the ''Autobiography'', Alex Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X were forced to confront the consequences of this discontinuity in perspective for the narrative, already a year old."&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, after giving the matter some thought, later accepted Haley's suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard, Angela D., "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and African American conservatism", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Marable argues that Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was his own best revisionist, he also points out that Haley's collaborative role in shaping the ''Autobiography'' was notable. Haley influenced the narrative's direction and tone while remaining faithful to his subject's syntax and diction. Marable writes that Haley worked "hundreds of sentences into paragraphs", and organized them into "subject areas".&lt;ref name="Marable 2009 310‚Äì311"/&gt; Author William L. Andrews writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he narrative evolved out of Haley's interviews with Malcolm, but Malcolm had read Haley's typescript, and had made interlineated notes and often stipulated substantive changes, at least in the earlier parts of the text. As the work progressed, however, according to Haley, Malcolm yielded more and more to the authority of his ghostwriter, partly because Haley never let Malcolm read the manuscript unless he was present to defend it, partly because in his last months Malcolm had less and less opportunity to reflect on the text of his life because he was so busy living it, and partly because Malcolm had eventually resigned himself to letting Haley's ideas about effective storytelling take precedence over his own desire to denounce straightaway those whom he had once revered.&lt;ref name="GREETHAM45"&gt;Andrews, William L., "Editing 'Minority' Texts", in {{Harvnb|Greetham|1997|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:MartinLutherKingMalcolmX-3.jpg|thumb|upright=.98 |right|Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X meeting before a press conference after the Senate debate on the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. This was the only time the two men ever met and their meeting lasted only one minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cone|1991|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Andrews suggests that Haley's role expanded because the book's subject became less available to micro-manage the manuscript, and "Malcolm had eventually resigned himself" to allowing "Haley's ideas about effective storytelling" to shape the narrative.&lt;ref name="GREETHAM45"/&gt;

Marable studied the ''Autobiography'' manuscript "raw materials" archived by Haley's biographer, Anne Romaine, and described a critical element of the collaboration, Haley's writing tactic to capture the voice of his subject accurately, a disjoint system of data mining that included notes on scrap paper, in-depth interviews, and long "free style" discussions. Marable writes, "Malcolm also had a habit of scribbling notes to himself as he spoke." Haley would secretly "pocket these sketchy notes" and reassemble them in a [[sub rosa]] attempt to integrate Malcolm X's "subconscious reflections" into the "workable narrative".&lt;ref name="Marable 2009 310‚Äì311"/&gt; This is an example of Haley asserting authorial agency during the writing of the ''Autobiography'', indicating that their relationship was fraught with minor power struggles. Wideman and Rampersad agree with Marable's description of Haley's book-writing process.&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 103‚Äì105, 119"/&gt;

The timing of the collaboration meant that Haley occupied an advantageous position to document the multiple conversion experiences of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and his challenge was to form them, however incongruent, into a cohesive workable narrative. Dyson suggests that "profound personal, intellectual, and ideological changes ... led him to order events of his life to support a mythology of metamorphosis and transformation".&lt;ref name="Dyson 1996 134"/&gt; Marable addresses the confounding factors of the publisher and Haley's authorial influence, passages that support the argument that while Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X may have considered Haley a ghostwriter, he acted in actuality as a coauthor, at times without Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's direct knowledge or expressed consent:&lt;ref name="MARABLE312"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|p=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X retained final approval of their hybrid text, he was not privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had begun well ''prior'' to his assassination.&lt;ref name="MARABLE312"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marable says the resulting text was stylistically and ideologically distinct from what Marable believes Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X would have written without Haley's influence, and it also differs from what may have actually been said in the interviews between Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref name="MARABLE312"/&gt;

===Myth-making===
In ''Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', Dyson criticizes historians and biographers of the time for re-purposing the ''Autobiography'' as a transcendent narrative by a "mythological" Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X without being critical enough of the underlying ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=3, 23, 29‚Äì31, 33‚Äì36, 46‚Äì50, 152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, because much of the available biographical studies of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X have been written by white authors, Dyson suggests their ability to "interpret black experience" is suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=59‚Äì61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', Dyson says, reflects both Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's goal of narrating his life story for public consumption and Haley's political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson writes, "''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' ... has been criticized for avoiding or distorting certain facts. Indeed, the autobiography is as much a testament to Haley's ingenuity in shaping the manuscript as it is a record of Malcolm's attempt to tell his story."&lt;ref name="Dyson 1996 134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malcolm X NYWTS 2a.jpg|left|thumb|upright= 0.77|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, March 12, 1964]]
Rampersad suggests that Haley understood autobiographies as "almost fiction".&lt;ref name="WOOD119"&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's ''Malcolm'' and Malcolm's Malcolm", Rampersad criticizes Perry's biography, ''Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America'', and makes the general point that the writing of the ''Autobiography'' is part of the narrative of blackness in the 20th century and consequently should "not be held utterly beyond inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornel West|West, Cornel]], "Malcolm X and Black Rage", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=48‚Äì58}}; Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To Rampersad, the ''Autobiography'' is about psychology, ideology, a conversion narrative, and the myth-making process.&lt;ref&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=117‚Äì133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Malcolm inscribed in it the terms of his understanding of the form even as the unstable, even treacherous form concealed and distorted particular aspects of his quest. But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' about him is impossible to know."&lt;ref&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rampersad suggests that since his 1965 assassination, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X has "become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them."&lt;ref&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Rampersad says, many admirers of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X perceive "accomplished and admirable" figures like [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[W. E. B. Du&amp;nbsp;Bois]] inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, "while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero‚Äîhis wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic".&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 118‚Äì119"&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=118‚Äì119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.

Author Joe Wood writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he autobiography iconizes Malcolm twice, not once. Its second Malcolm‚Äîthe El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz finale‚Äîis a mask with no distinct ideology, it is not particularly Islamic, not particularly nationalist, not particularly humanist. Like any well crafted icon or story, the mask is evidence of its subject's humanity, of Malcolm's strong human spirit. But both masks hide as much character as they show. The first mask served a nationalism Malcolm had rejected before the book was finished; the second is mostly empty and available.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Joe, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the New Blackness", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Eakin, a significant portion of the ''Autobiography'' involves Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X shaping the fiction of the completed self.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=151‚Äì162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone writes that Haley's description of the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s composition makes clear that this fiction is "especially misleading in the case of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X"; both Haley and the ''Autobiography'' itself are "out of phase" with its subject's "life and identity".&lt;ref name="Andrews 1992 152"&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson writes, "[[Louis Lomax|[Louis] Lomax]] says that Malcolm became a 'lukewarm [[Racial integration|integrationist]]'. [Peter] Goldman suggests that Malcolm was 'improvising', that he embraced and discarded ideological options as he went along. [[Albert Cleage|[Albert] Cleage]] and [Oba] T'Shaka hold that he remained a revolutionary black nationalist. And [[James Hal Cone|[James Hal] Cone]] asserts that he became an internationalist with a humanist bent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marable writes that Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was a "committed internationalist" and "black nationalist" at the end of his life, not an "integrationist", noting, "what I find in my own research is greater continuity than discontinuity".&lt;ref name="MMAG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/5/21/manning_marable_on_malcolm_x_a |title=Manning Marable on 'Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: A Life of Reinvention' |last=Goodman |first=Amy |authorlink=Amy Goodman |date=May 21, 2007 |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |accessdate= March 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marable, in "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History", critically analyzes the collaboration that produced the ''Autobiography''. Marable argues autobiographical "memoirs" are "inherently biased", representing the subject as he would appear with certain facts privileged, others deliberately omitted. Autobiographical narratives self-censor, reorder event chronology, and alter names. According to Marable, "nearly everyone writing about Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X" has failed to critically and objectively analyze and research the subject properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=305‚Äì310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marable suggests that most historians have assumed that the ''Autobiography'' is veritable truth, devoid of any ideological influence or stylistic embellishment by Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X or Haley. Further, Marable believes the "most talented revisionist of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, was Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|p=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who actively fashioned and reinvented his public image and verbiage so as to increase favor with diverse groups of people in various situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=259}}; {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=151‚Äì161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the literary impact of Malcolm X's ''Autobiography'', we may note the tremendous influence of the book, as well as its subject generally, on the development of the [[Black Arts Movement]]. Indeed, it was the day after Malcolm's assassination that the poet and playwright, [[Amiri Baraka]], established the Black Arts Repertory Theater, which would serve to catalyze the aesthetic progression of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://harvardpress.typepad.com/hup_publicity/2012/04/a-literary-history-of-the-autobiography-of-malcolm-x.html|title = A Literary History of The Autobiography of Malcolm X|date = 20 April 2012|accessdate = 2 November 2015|website = Harvard University Press Blog|publisher = Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers and thinkers associated with the Black Arts movement found in the ''Autobiography'' an aesthetic embodiment of his profoundly influential qualities, namely, "the vibrancy of his public voice, the clarity of his analyses of oppression's hidden history and inner logic, the fearlessness of his opposition to white supremacy, and the unconstrained ardor of his advocacy for revolution 'by any means necessary.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature, Vol. 2|last = Gates, Jr.|first = Henry Louis|publisher = W.W.

[[bell hooks]] writes "When I was a young college student in the early seventies, the book I read which revolutionized my thinking about race and politics was ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradley|1992|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bradley (novelist)|David Bradley]] adds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;She [hooks] is not alone. Ask any middle-aged socially conscious intellectual to list the books that influenced his or her youthful thinking, and he or she will most likely mention ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X''. Some will do more than mention it. Some will say that ... they picked it up‚Äîby accident, or maybe by assignment, or because a friend pressed it on them‚Äîand that they approached the reading of it without great expectations, but somehow that book ... took hold of them. Got ''inside'' them. Altered their vision, their outlook, their insight. Changed their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradley|1992|pp=34‚Äì35}}. Emphasis and second ellipsis in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Max Elbaum concurs, writing that "''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' was without question the single most widely read and influential book among young people of all racial backgrounds who went to their first demonstration sometime between 1965 and 1968."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elbaum |first=Max |title=Revolution in the Air:Sixties Radicals Turn to Lenin, Mao and Che |year=2002 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=1-84467-563-7 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, attorney Gregory Reed bought the original manuscripts of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' for $100,000 at the sale of the Haley Estate.&lt;ref name="MARABLE312"/&gt; The manuscripts included three "missing chapters", titled "The Negro", "The End of Christianity", and "Twenty Million Black Muslims", that were omitted from the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|p=315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegrio.com/2010/05/20/lost-malcolm-x-memoir-chapters-reveal-leaders-soft-side/ |title=Lost chapters from Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X memoirs revealed |first=Jennifer H. |last=Cunningham |date=May 20, 2010 |publisher=[[The Grio]] |accessdate=March 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1964 letter to his publisher, Haley had described these chapters as, "the most {{sic|impact}} material of the book, some of it rather lava-like".&lt;ref name="MARABLE312"/&gt; Marable writes that the missing chapters were "dictated and written" during Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's final months in the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref name="MARABLE312"/&gt; In them, Marable says, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X proposed the establishment of a union of African American civic and political organizations.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Wartime Law on Industrial Property''' (Kogyo Shoyuken Senji Ho) was a [[Japanese law|special law]] enacted by the Government of [[Japan]] in 1917, which declared that any patents owned by the nationals of countries in a state of war with Japan no longer had effect. The impact of this law was both immense and lasting, because a majority of drugs had been invented in [[Germany]] and this law meant that Japanese companies could produce them without worrying about [[patent infringement]].&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"&gt;{{cite book

[[Statistics]] show that the number of new drugs in 1914 was 658 of which 103, or 16 per cent were developed domestically. By 1928, the number increased 2.6 times to 1,705 and the proportion of domestic development increased to 46 per cent. Further, by 1936, the number of new drugs increased to 2,402 of which more than half, 57 per cent were developed domestically.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"/&gt;

The company was based in [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]], London, England and was a former operation of Central [[YMCA]].

== Y Touring Theatre Company history ==
Y Touring produced 54 regional, national and international tours of plays by professional playwrights including Judith Johnson, Judy Upton, Jonathan Hall, Nicola Baldwin and Rhiannon Tise, reportedly reaching over 2 million young people in [[schools]], youth clubs, community venues, studio theatres, prisons and young offenders centres.

Y Touring's first production was 'The Inner Circle' by Patricia Loughrey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsL/loughrey-patricia.html|title=Patricia Loughrey - Playwright|work=doollee.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally commissioned by The New Conservatory Theatre Centre in San Francisco, adapting it for British young people‚Äôs audiences. This play told the story of a group of four friends, one of whom had been infected by [[HIV]] and went on to develop [[AIDS]] and die.

== Theatre of Debate ==
Y Touring's projects generally followed a 'Theatre of Debate' model. Each project consists of a play aiming to engage its audience in an informed debate about a specific subject. The play is followed by a live debate between the actors (who remain in character) and the audience.
