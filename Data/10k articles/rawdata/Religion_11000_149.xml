==Early life==
Bābak was born into a [[Persian people|Persian]]&lt;ref name="Arthur Goldschmidt 2005 Pg 81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittow 1996 195, 203 &amp; 215-a"&gt;{{Citation | last =Whittow | first =

According to [[Wāqid ibn 'Amr Tamimi]], the oldest biographer on Babak, Bābak's father was a Persian cooking-oil vendor from [[Ctesiphon]], capital of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (modern [[al-Mada'in]], 35&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Baghdad]] in [[Iraq]]) who left for the Adharbayjani frontier zone and settled in the village of Balālābād in the [[Meymaz|Maymadh district]]. According to Fasīh, his mother – a native [[Persian people|Persian]] of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan region]] – was known as Mahru ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ماهرو) meaning the ''Moon-Face'' in [[Persian language]].&lt;ref name="Yusofi" /&gt;

After his father's death in his early teens, Babak was given the responsibility of his two brothers and mother during a Zoroastrian ceremony in a [[fire temple]]. By the age of 18, Bābak had established himself in the city of [[Tabriz]] and was engaged in the arms trade and industry. He also served a certain Muhammad ibn Rawwad Azdi. Later on, this engagement gave him the opportunity to travel to some regions and become familiar with regions like the [[Caucasus]], the Middle East, and the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp8/ot_korramis_20050628.html "Khorramis in Byzantium"] in ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' by Evangelos Venetis.

In 755, [[Abu Muslim]] was murdered. Although he had helped the [[Abbasid]]s to defeat the former Caliphs, the [[Umayyad]] dynasty, the ruling Caliph had given the order to kill him, probably because of his increasing popularity among Iranians and Non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="Yusofi"/&gt; Many Iranians, who had expected more freedom and more rights from the new rulers, could not believe that their hero was killed by the ruling Caliph whom they had considered a friend of Iran and Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;CAIS News, ''Restoration of Fortress of Babak Khorramdin to Continue'', May 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

This incident led to many revolts, mostly by angry [[Khurramiyyah]] (''Khorram-Dinān'') and some [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]]. This, in turn, forced the Caliphs to use more violence against the Iranian population in order to keep the eastern provinces under control. The constant revolts did not come to an end in the following decades, and the Iranian population of the Caliphate was constantly being oppressed.

Babak joined the [[Khurramiyyah]] (''Khorram-Dinān'').  The story of joining the Khorrami movement is being told in Waqed's account, in summary, as follows:
{{cquote|Two rich men named Jāvidān b. Shahrak (or Shahrak) and Abu 'Emran were then living in the highland around the mountain of Badd and contending for the leadership of the highland's Khorrami inhabitants. Jāvidān, when stuck in the snow on his way back from [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjān]] to Badd, had to seek shelter at Balalabad and happened to go into the house of Babak's mother. Being poor, she could only light a fire for him, while Babak looked after the guest's servants and horses and brought water for them. Jāvidān then sent Babak to buy food, wine, and fodder. When Babak came back and spoke to Jāvidān, he impressed Jāvidān with his shrewdness despite his lack of fluency of speech. Javidan therefore asked the woman for permission to take her son away to manage his farms and properties, and offered to send her fifty dirhams a month from Babak's salary. The woman accepted and let Babak go.&lt;ref name="Yusofi" /&gt;}}
Under the direction of his mentor [[Javidan Shahrak]], a leader of one of the sects of the [[Khurramites|Khorramdin]], Babak's knowledge of history, geography, and the latest battle tactics strengthened his position as a favorite candidate for commander during the early wars against the [[Arab]] occupiers.

Bābak was a highly spiritual person who respected his [[Zoroastrian]] heritage. He made every possible effort to bring Iranians together and also with leaders such as [[Maziar]] to form a united front against the [[Caliphate|Arab Caliph]].  According to the medieval historian, [[Ibn Esfandyar]], who composed the book ''[[Tarikh-e Tabaristan]]'' "History of [[Tabaristan]]", [[Maziar]] said:{{cquote|''I (Maziyar), [[Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin|Afshin Kheydar]] son of Kavus, and Babak had made an oath and allegiance that we re-take the government back from the Arabs and transfer the government and the country back to the family of Kasraviyan (Sassanids)"&lt;ref&gt;Said Nafisi, Babak Khorramdin Delawar-e-Azerbaijan (Babak Khorramdin, the braveheart of Azerbaijan), Tabesh Publishers, Tehran 1955, pg 57, actual quote from Ibn Esanfiyar: {{lang-fa|
من (مازیار) و افشين خيدر بن کاوس و بابک هر سه از دير باز عهد و بيعت کرده ايم و قرار داده بر آن که دولت از عرب بازستانيم و ملک و جهانداري با خاندان کسرويان نقل کنيم}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, one of the most dramatic periods in the history of [[Iran]] was set under Bābak's leadership between 816–837. During these most crucial years, they not only fought against the Caliphate, but also for the preservation of [[Persian language]] and culture.

After the death of Javidan, Babak married Javidan's wife and became the Khorramis' leader, sometime in the year 816-17 during [[al-Ma'mun]]'s reign. Babak incited his followers to rise in rebellion against the caliphal regime. The reports state that Babak called Persians to arms, seized castles and strong points, thereby barring roads to his enemies. Gradually a large multitude joined him.&lt;ref name="Yusofi" /&gt;

According to [[Vladimir Minorsky]], around the 9th–10th century:&lt;ref&gt;V. Minorsky, Studies in Caucasian History, Cambridge University Press, 1957, pg 112&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote
|"The original sedentary population of Azarbayjan consisted of a mass of peasants and at the time of the Arab conquest was compromised under the semi-contemptuous term of Uluj ("non-Arab") – somewhat similar to the raya (*ri’aya) of the Ottoman empire.  The only arms of this peaceful rustic population were slings, see Tabari, II, 1379–89.  They spoke a number of dialects (Adhari ([[Old Azeri language]]), Talishi) of which even now there remains some islets surviving amidst the Turkish speaking population.  It was this basic population on which Babak leaned in his revolt against the caliphate.}}
There had long been groups of Khorramis scattered in Isfahan, Adharbayjan, Ray, Hamadan, Armenia, Gorgan, and elsewhere in Iran,&lt;ref name="Yusofi" /&gt; and there had been some earlier Khorrami revolts, e.g., in Gorgan jointly with Red Banner (Sorkh-'alamān) Bātenis in the caliph [[Al-Mahdi]]'s reign in 778-79, when 'Amr b. 'Ala', the governor of [[Tabarestan|Tabarestān]], was ordered to repulse them, and at [[Isfahan]], Ray, [[Hamadan]], and elsewhere in [[Harun al-Rashid]]'s realm, when 'Abd-Allah b. Malek and Abu Dolaf 'Ejli put them down on caliph's behalf – but none had the scale and duration of Babak's revolt, which pinned down caliphal armies for twenty years. After Babak's emergence, the Khorrami movement was centered in Adharbayjan and reinforced with volunteers from elsewhere, probably including descendants of Abu Muslim's supporters and other Iranian enemies of the 'Abbasid caliphate. The figures given for the strength of Babak's Khorramdinan army, such as 100,000 men (Abu'l-Ma'ali), 200,000 ([[Ali al-Masudi|Mas'udi]]), or innumerable (Baghdadi) are doubtless highly exaggerated but at least indicate that it was large.&lt;ref name="Yusofi" /&gt;  At that time of Babak, there were Khorramis scattered in many regions of Iran, besides [[Adharbayjan]], reportedly in [[Tabaristan|Tabarestan]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Balkh]], [[Isfahan]], [[Kashan]], [[Qom]], Ray, [[Karaj]], [[Hamadan Province|Hamadan]], [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]], [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] as well as in [[Basra Governorate|Basra]], and [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="Yusofi" /&gt;

[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]] records that Babak claimed he possessed Javadan's spirit and that Babak became active in 816–817. In 819–820 [[Yahya ibn Mu'adh]] fought against Babak, but could not defeat him. Two years later Babak vanquished the forces of Isa ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Khalid. In 824–825 the caliphal general Ahmad ibn al Junayd was sent against Babak. Babak defeated and captured him.

In 827–828 Muhammad ibn Humayd Tusi was dispatched to fight Babak. He won a victory and sent some captured enemy, but not Babak, to al-Ma'mun. However, about two years later, on June 9, 829, Babak won a decisive victory over this general at Hashtadsar. Muhammad ibn Humayd lost his life. Many of his soldiers were killed. The survivors fled in disarray.

In 835–836 the caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] sent his outstanding general [[Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin|Afshin]] against Babak. Afshin rebuilt fortresses. He employed a relay system to protect supply caravans. Babak tried to capture the money being sent to pay Afshin's army, but was himself surprised, lost many men and barely escaped. He did succeed in capturing some supplies and inflicting some hardship on his enemies.  Amongst Babak's commander, various names have been mentioned including Azin, Rostam, Tarkhan, Mua’wiyah and Abdullah.&lt;ref&gt;Said Nafisi, Babak Khorramdin Delawar-e-Azerbaijan (Babak Khorramdin, the brave-heart of Azerbaijan), Tabesh Publishers, Tehran 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year Babak routed the forces of Afshin's subordinate, [[Bugha al-Kabir]]. In 837–838 [[al-Mu'tasim]] reinforced Afshin and provided him clear military instructions. Patiently following these enabled Afshin to capture Babak's stronghold of Badhdh. Babak escaped. Al-Mu'tasim sent a safety guarantee for Babak to Afshin. This was taken to Babak who was very displeased. He said:

"Better to live for just a single day as a ruler than to live for forty years as an abject slave."

He decided to leave the country for the [[Byzantine Empire]] and on his way Babak met [[Sahl Smbatean]] (Sahl ibn Sunbat in Arab sources), Prince of [[Khachen]], who was [[Armenians|Armenian]] due to the Armenian historiography and [[Caucasian Albania]]n due to the [[Adharbayjan]]i historiography. [[Sahl Smbatean|Sahl Smbatian]], however, handed Babak over to Afshin in return for a large reward. [[Al-Mu'tasim]] commanded his general to bring Babak to him. Afshin informed Babak of this and told him since Babak might never return, this was the time to take a last look around. At Babak's request, Afshin allowed his prisoner to go to Badhdh. There Babak walked through his ruined stronghold one night until dawn.

Eventually, Bābak, his wife, and his warriors were forced to leave ''Ghaleye Bābak'' after 23 years of constant campaigns.

==Death==
He was eventually betrayed by [[Afshin (Caliphate General)|Afshin]] and was handed over to the Abbasid Caliph. During Bābak's execution, the Caliph's henchmen first cut off his legs and hands in order to convey the most devastating message to his followers. The legend says that Bābak bravely rinsed his face with the drained blood pouring out of his cuts, thus depriving the Caliph and the rest of the Abbasid army from seeing his pale face, a result of the heavy loss of blood.&lt;ref name="Yusofi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CAIS News, ''Restoration of Fortress of Babak Khorramdin to Continue'', May 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was then [[gibbeting|gibbeted]] alive whilst sewn into a cow's skin with the horns at ear level to gradually crush his head as it dried out.&lt;ref&gt;''The golden age of Islam'' by Maurice Lombard, page 152, {{ISBN|1-55876-322-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55876-322-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Babak Khorramdin was not well known outside academia until the 20th century; however, due to Soviet nation building efforts and Babak's following of teaching of [[Mazdak]] with its pseudo-communist and socialist themes, Babak Khorramdin was proclaimed a national hero in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. For example, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] scholar [[Ziya Bunyadov]], claimed that "Babak was a national hero of Azerbaijani people" while the Russian ethnologist, historian and anthropologist [[Victor Schnirelmann]] dismisses Bunyadov's theory, criticizing Bunyadov for not mentioning that Babak spoke Persian, and ignoring the witness accounts of Babak's contemporaries who call him Persian.&lt;ref&gt;Shnirelman, V.A.(2001), 'The value of the Past: Myths, Identity and Politics in Transcaucasia', Osaka: National Museum of Ethnology.pp 123: "Having claimed that, Buniiatov failed to mention that Babek spoke Persian, and ignored the witnesses of contemporaries who called him the "Persian".&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, in the modern [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]], Babak is a cult figure and celebrated as a national hero.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JnZ1zOcjOPkC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=Babak+Hero+of+Azerbaijan&amp;ei=mJ3WS96cN5G2yASY9dCACQ&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Babak%20Hero%20of%20Azerbaijan&amp;f=false David Menashri. Central Asia Meets the Middle East. Portland Frank Cass, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Iran, due to the rise of nationalism in the 20th century, and renewed interest in [[Islam|pre-Islamic]] Iran, Babak Khorramdin was rediscovered during the reign of [[Reza Shah]], and is celebrated as a national hero.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;

==Early days==

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
From 1892 to 1977 the islands of Kiribatu were known as part of the [[British Empire]] and included the [[Gilbert Islands]]. `Abdu'l-Bahá, head of the religion from 1892 to 1921, mentioned the Gilbert Islands among the places Bahá'ís should take the religion to. `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The seventh of the tablets mentioned taking the Bahá'í Faith to the Gilbert Islands and was written on April 11, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. These tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Tablet 7) "A party speaking their languages, severed, holy, sanctified and filled with the love of God, must turn their faces to and travel through the three great island groups of the Pacific Ocean—[[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Melanesia]], and the islands attached to these groups, such as [[New Guinea]], [[Borneo]], [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Philippine Islands]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], [[New Hebrides]], [[Loyalty Islands]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Seram Island|Ceram]], [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], [[Friendly Islands]], [[Samoa Islands]], [[Society Islands]], [[Caroline Islands]], [[Low Archipelago]], [[Marquesas]], [[Hawaiian Islands]], Gilbert Islands, [[Moluccas]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Timor]] and the other islands. With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with tongues commemorating the mention of God, with eyes turned to the Kingdom of God, they must deliver the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts to all the people. Know ye of a certainty that whatever gathering ye enter, the waves of the Holy Spirit are surging over it, and the heavenly grace of the Blessed Beauty encompasseth that gathering."&lt;ref name="tab1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Beginnings===
The first Bahá'ís to Kiribati were Elena Marsella and Roy Fernie, who left their home in [[Bahá'í Faith in Panama|Panama]] and positions on the National Spiritual Assembly of Panama&lt;ref name="islandchurch"/&gt; to [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]]. They arrived on the island of [[Abaiang]] (aka Charlotte Island, of the [[Gilbert Islands]]), on March 4, 1954. For this service they were named [[Knights of Baha'u'llah]] by then head of the religion, [[Shoghi Effendi]].&lt;ref name="50th"/&gt;  About the first of June 1954,&lt;ref name="BN287"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = World Crusade; Gilbert Islands |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1955 | issue = 287 | pages = 2–3 | url =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; former catholic seminarian and mission teacher Peter Kanere Koru quickly became the first convert on the island. He attributed his conversion in part to his attraction to the racial equality practiced by the pioneers, and their desire to implement such equality in his society.&lt;ref name="hassal-pacific"/&gt;

====Incidents related to the first native Bahá'í====
When Koru became the first Bahá'í Shoghi Effendi urged him in a letter of welcome to be "very discreet in spreading this Message", explaining that the Bahá'ís did not wish to become a "source of discord, or arouse opposition".&lt;ref name="hassal-pacific"/&gt; However several issues came to the fore to animate hostility from the local Catholics. First, Roy was an amateur magician.&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; Roy was a confident figure who held a show along with a piano the first night they arrived. Records show that within weeks he attracted Sunday audiences perhaps dropping attendance at Sunday services.&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; In the judgement of researcher Graham Hassall, Roy was most likely unaware of the fact that sorcery and magic were practiced widely in Gilbertese culture, and were being actively suppressed by the Catholics ministers and now here was a new presence in the community giving shows including magic tricks.&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; Indeed, there are reports the Catholic minister's actions against the Bahá'ís helped spread knowledge of them.&lt;ref name="islandchurch"/&gt; Then there was the attempt of the Fernies to set up an English language school - and the fund-raising activities they organised in Tuarabu conflicted with the Tuarabu Catholics attempt to raise funds for their own purposes and embarrassingly unable to match donations with another nearby Catholic community.&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; Indeed, a quarter ton of text books were sent from the Bahá'ís of Panama to support the imminent school which was to be open to all natives irrespective of their religion.&lt;ref name="BN287"/&gt; Lastly the conversion of a seminarian and missionary teacher away from Catholicism - these are all issues mostly likely to lead to antagonism from the Catholics. Indeed, the Catholic mission worked to have the Fernies deported, and on several occasions used its journal to "warn" its members against examining this new religion.&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; Central to their initial complaint to authorities, however, was the fact that missionary activity required 100&lt;ref name="islandchurch"/&gt; or 200&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; individuals to sanction a group of religionists to allow for missionary work. However over two hundred Abaiang residents registered their wish to become Bahá'ís&lt;ref name="islandchurch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; after showing up at the home of the Fernies at 3am, and some 90 people came the next day to see Koru&lt;ref name="awake"&gt;{{cite magazine | title =Pacific Islands Awaken to Call of Baha'u'llah |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1956 | issue = 301 | pages = 6–7 | url = | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom Catholic opposition had forced into banishment to his home island of [[Tabiteuea]] later in June.&lt;ref name="BN345"&gt;{{cite magazine | title =Gilbert and Ellice Island Pioneers Establish Schools, Centers|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1959 | issue = 345 | pages = 11–12 | url = | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pregnant wife who went into labour had to be left behind in a hospital and she died a short time later.&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; On 24 September 1955 the government gave legal recognition to the first Bahá'í institution in the islands, the village of Tuarabu's Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] on the island of Abaiang.&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; Regardless, Roy Fernie was deported in November 1955 with the support of local land owners. Through correspondence Koru and Elena Marsella were working on translations of a collection of the [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í prayers]], [[Hidden Words]], and excerpts from the writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Asia; Enroll many believers in Pacific Islands |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1956 | issue = 306| page = 7 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; until later in 1956 when Marsella left. Before she left the Education Department had approved Elena and two native Bahá'ís as teachers in the new school.&lt;ref name="BN345"/&gt; The new Bahá'í community which had formed essentially in one year continued to function&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; and for a time Shoghi Effendi requested no further pioneers go to the Gilbert Islands.&lt;ref name="BN345"/&gt; Koru did not meet Bahá'ís again until four years later, but he remained steadfast in his beliefs. By the time Bahá'ís were eventually able to come to visit him, nine more people were active members of the religion on his island,&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; (apparently nearly fifty had been drawn to the religion there.)&lt;ref name="BN351"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Message to the Annual Baha'i Conventions From the Hands of the Faith in the Holy Land;Widespread Enrollment of Indigenes (section mentioning Gilbert Islands) |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1960 | issue = 351| page = 3 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of them was a Protestant minister then under disciplinary sanction by his church.&lt;ref name="islandchurch"/&gt;

====Continued early growth of the religion====
In 1956 four assemblies (including Tuarabu, Tebero, and Kuria)&lt;ref name="BN345"/&gt; were elected and five smaller groups of Bahá'ís.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = International News; Central America; Havana Convention termed Great Success |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1956 | issue = 306| page = 12 | url =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Koru, other early converts included Taukoriri Eritai, who became a Bahá'í at the time the Fernies were on Abainag,&lt;ref name="50th"/&gt; and Timeon Tamaroa who helped take the religion to the island of [[Beru Island|Beru]].&lt;ref name="islandchurch"/&gt; In earliest 1957 Shoghi Effendi allowed pioneers to consider the Gilbert Islands and Frances Heller from the United States was able to arrive on February 8, 1957.&lt;ref name="BN345"/&gt; She was able to remain despite failing health until June 1958 - having helped elect the spiritual assembly of Betio.&lt;ref name="BN345"/&gt; American Mabel Adelle Sneider was the next to arrive and she and Heller agreed the religion needed to be taken to the capital of the islands. So it was that Sneider established herself in the village of [[Bikenibeu]] on [[Tarawa]] in October 1958.&lt;ref name="BN345"/&gt; Sneider lived there for 15 years helping to transfer the center of Bahá'í activities from the relatively remote island of Abaiang to the civic capital on Tarawa&lt;ref name="islandchurch"/&gt; - eventually Snieder was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly often serving as secretary or treasurer at one time or another. She helped purchase the site for the National [[Haziratu'l-Quds]], or the seat, of the National Assembly.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book

==Growth across the country==
With a few pioneers and many local converts the community in the South Pacific was organized into a regional national spiritual assembly for the South Pacific Islands which was elected from 1957 to 1967 including Cook Island, Fiji, [[Bahá'í Faith in New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Samoa|Samoa]] and other islands.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; The delegates from the Gilbert and Ellice Islands were unable to attend the 1959 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = First National Assembly of Pacific Islands Elected |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1959 | issue = 341| pages = 4–8 | url =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1961 the religion had reached the [[Banaba Island|Ocean Island]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = International News Briefs |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1961 | issue = 363 | page = 18 | url =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now called Banada Island) and one of the delegates from the Gilbert Islands was able to attend the convention to elect the regional national spiritual assembly for the South Pacific Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = International News Briefs |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1961 | issue = 366 | page = 9 | url =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1963 there were a wide range of communities across the Gilbert Islands with 14 assemblies, 19 groups, and 7 additional isolated Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

The Bahá'ís established a number of schools by 1963 - Tuarabu Primary School, Abaiang Island, and several on [[Tabiteuea]] Island - Eita, Utiroa, Taku and Tababuea Primary Schools.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

===Forming a national community===
[[Yale University]] professor Charles Forman analyzed religious trends across the Pacific Islands and attributes the surprising growth of the Bahá'í Faith across [[Micronesia]] was partly due to a certain amount of response from some youths of wider experience and education as well as from some village folk among whom Bahá'ís settled &lt;ref name="hassal-pacific"/&gt; In October 1966 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Collis Featherstone]] attended the dedication of the main Bahá'í center of the islands inaugurated with a conference discussing the progress of the religion on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Teaching Conference representing six islands… |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1967 | issue = 433 | page = 10 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the assistance of the Hands of the Cause Collis Featherstone and [[Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir]] the Bahá'í communities in the area reorganized to form a regional National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the Gilbert and [[Ellice Islands]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="50th"/&gt; In 1970 the national assembly held three classes on methods Bahá'ís use for growth of the religion and began holding them in a building, the Bahá'í Institute, owned by the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Gilbert and Ellice Islands Teaching Institute |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1971 | issue = 483 | page = 21 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1971 an international conference on the progress of the religion across the south pacific as held in Suva, Fiji to which Gilbert Island Bahá'ís went.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Pearls of the Pacific - The Oceanic Conference |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1971 | issue = 485 | page = 12 | url =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that conference a national conference for the Gilbert Islands was held at the Bahá'í Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Gilbert and Ellice Islands Teaching Conferences |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1971 | issue = 488 | page = 14 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1972 the statistics of the national assembly counted 2700 members across Gilbert and Ellice Islands with 51 Assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Travel-Teaching In the Pacific; Tarawa, Gi1bert Islands-December 2–7, 1972 (section on Gilbert Islands) |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1973 | issue = 488 | pages = 9–10 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1973 the national assembly produced two five-minute radio programs for an observance of [[Human Rights Day]] that was broadcast on radio in two languages, Gilbertese and Ellice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Report of Human Rights Day Observances (section on Gilbert and Ellice Islands) |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1973 | issue = 505 | page = 15 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was on the equality of men and women, with passages from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá and a report on the advancement of women in the islands. In April 1973 twenty-three delegates from nine islands gathered in the National Teaching Institute and the Bahá'í [[Maneba]],&lt;ref&gt;Previously printed Naneaba.&lt;/ref&gt; a native meeting hall with no sides and a high thatched roof, for the national convention. Together the Institute and the Maneaba are part of the national headquarters [[Pao Penox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World - National Conventions; Gilbert &amp; Ellice Is.

While in Kiribati he addressed a reception held in his honor and attended by the governor, deputy governor, and government ministers and secretaries. A copy of ''The Bahá'í' World'', vol. XIV, was presented to the governor for the House of Assembly library and a 20-minute radio interview with Mr. and Mrs. Featherstone was broadcast over [[Radio Tarawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Gilbert Islands; Mr. Featherstone tours island communities|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1976 | issue = 540| pages = 18–19 | url =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the Bahá'ís took various roles about societal issues. First in several events across the islands they participated in and helped organize the occasions commemorating Japanese soldiers who died in the islands in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Gilbert Is./Tuvalu Baha'is in ceremonies|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1976 | issue = 565| page = 16 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second they helped during a cholera outbreak in September - the Baha'is relayed messages using the radio equipment on the Bahá'í-owned catamaran ''Erena-Roe'' which also ferried patients to the hospital and a Bahá'í served as secretary of the government's response committee created to manage the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Gilbert Is./Tuvalu Baha'is help in epidemic|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1978 | issue = 564 | page = 17 | url =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Erena-Roe'' was making a last run before the owner left the islands and came across a girl in the ocean who was returned to her native island alive though feared dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Kiribati |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1979 | issue = 585 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 14 | url =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979 the national assembly reported there were 80 local assemblies - 16 of which were officially registered with the government and 13 of which had their own centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title =  Victory Messages - The Baha'i world resounds with the glorious news of Five Year Plan victories; (section on Gilbert Islands/Tuvalu)|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1979 | issue = 581 |issn=0195-9212| page = 9 | url = | postscript =  .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Ellice Islands gained independence as [[Tuvalu]] and the Gilbert Islands and others formed Kiribati, the communities of Bahá'ís also reformed into separate institutions of National Spiritual Assemblies in 1981.&lt;ref name="sum"/&gt;

===Multiplying interests and activities of the community===
Following the growth of the institutions the sociological impact of the Bahá'ís became more well known starting in the 1980s.

'''[[Buddhism]]''' has a long [[History of Indonesia|history]] in Indonesia, and is recognized as one of six official religions in Indonesia, along with [[Islam]], Christianity ([[Protestantism]] and [[Catholicism]]), [[Hinduism]] and [[Confucianism]]. According to the 2000 national [[census]] roughly 0.8% of the total citizens of Indonesia were Buddhists, and numbered around 1.7 million.&lt;ref name="sp2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&amp;wid=0|title=Peringatan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Buddhists are concentrated in [[Jakarta]], [[Riau]], [[Riau Islands]], [[Bangka Belitung]], [[North Sumatra]], and [[West Kalimantan]]. These totals, however, are probably inflated, as practitioners of [[Taoism]] and Chinese folk religion, which are not considered official religions of Indonesia, likely declared themselves as Buddhists on the most recent census.&lt;ref name="bdea" /&gt; Today, the majority of Buddhists in Indonesia are [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], however small numbers of [[Native Indonesian|native]] (such as [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Sasak people|Sasak]]) Buddhists are also present.

== History ==

=== Antiquities ===
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|Buddhist expansion from northern India to the rest of Asia, [[Srivijaya]] once served as a center of Buddhist learning and expansion.]]
Buddhism is the second oldest religion in Indonesia after Hinduism, which arrived from India around the second century.&lt;ref name="bdea"&gt;{{cite web
 | last =

 | doi =
 | accessdate = 2006-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Buddhism in Indonesia is closely related to the history of Hinduism, as a number of empires influenced by [[Indian culture]] were established around the same period. The arrival of Buddhism in the Indonesian archipelago began with trading activity, from the early 1st century, by way of the maritime [[Silk Road]] between Indonesia and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flanagan |first=Anthony |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Buddhist Art: Indonesia |work= |publisher=About |year=2006 |url=http://buddhism.about.com/cs/art/a/ArtIndonesia.htm |doi= |accessdate=2006-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819220314/http://buddhism.about.com/cs/art/a/ArtIndonesia.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist archaeological site in Indonesia is arguably the [[Batujaya]] stupas complex in Karawang, West Java. The oldest relic in Batujaya was estimated to originate from the 2nd century, while the latest dated from the 12th century. Subsequently, significant numbers of Buddhist sites were found in [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Jambi]], [[Bukit Seguntang|Palembang]], and [[Muara Takus|Riau]] provinces in Sumatra, as well as in [[Borobudur|Central]] and [[Jabung|East Java]]. The Indonesian archipelago has, over the centuries, witnessed the rise and fall of powerful Buddhist empires, such as the [[Sailendra]] dynasty, the [[Medang Kingdom|Mataram]], and [[Srivijaya]] empires.

[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111359.jpg|thumb|[[Borobudur Temple Compounds]], located in Central Java, Indonesia]]

According to some Chinese source, a Chinese Buddhist monk [[I Ching (monk)|I-tsing]] on his pilgrim journey to India, witnessed the powerful maritime empire of [[Srivijaya]] based on [[Sumatra]] in the 7th century. The empire served as a Buddhist learning center in the region.  A notable Srivijayan revered Buddhist scholar is [[Dharmakirti]], a Srivijayan prince of the [[Sailendra]] dynasty, born around the turn of the 7th century in Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;P. 487 Buddhism: art, architecture, literature &amp; philosophy, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt; He became a revered scholar-monk in Srivijaya and moved to [[India]] to become a teacher at the famed [[Nalanda University]], as well as a poet. He built on and reinterpreted the work of [[Dignaga]], the pioneer of [[Buddhist Logic]], and was very influential among Brahman logicians as well as Buddhists. His theories became normative in [[Tibet]] and are studied to this day as a part of the basic monastic curriculum. Other Buddhist monks that visited Indonesia were [[Atisha]], [[Dharmapala of Nalanda|Dharmapala]], a professor of [[Nalanda]], and the South Indian Buddhist [[Vajrabodhi]]. Srivijaya was the largest Buddhist empire ever formed in Indonesian history.

A number of Buddhist [[Cultural heritage|historical heritages]] can be found in Indonesia, including the 8th century [[Borobudur]] [[mandala]] monument and [[Sewu]] temple in [[Central Java]], [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] in West Java, [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Bahal temple]] in Sumatra, and numerous of statues or inscriptions from the earlier history of Indonesian Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms. During the era of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], [[Singhasari]] and [[Majapahit]] empire, buddhism — identified as ''Dharma ri Kasogatan'' — was acknowledged as one of kingdom's official religions along with Hinduism. Although some of kings might favour Hinduism over another, nevertheless the harmony, toleration, and even syncretism were promoted as manifested in [[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]] national motto, coined from [[Kakawin Sutasoma]], written by Mpu Tantular to promotes tolerance between [[Hindu]]s (Shivaites) and [[Buddhist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depkumham.go.id/xdepkumhamweb/xPeraturan/xUUD Depkumham.go.id] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212100545/http://www.depkumham.go.id/xdepkumhamweb/xPeraturan/xUUD |date=2010-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical era of ancient Java also had produces some of the exquisite examples of [[Buddhist art]]s, such as the statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] and the statue of Buddha Vairochana and Boddhisttva Padmapani and Vajrapani in [[Mendut]] temple.

=== Decline and revival===
In the 13th century [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]] entered the archipelago, and began gaining foothold in coastal port towns. The fall of Hindu-Buddhist [[Majapahit]] empire in late 15th century marked the end of dharmic civilization dominance in Indonesia. By the end of the 16th century, Islam had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]]. After that for 450 years, there is no significant Buddhist adherence and practice in Indonesia. Many of Buddhist sites, stupas, temples, and manuscripts are lost or forgotten, as the region has become more predominantly Muslim. During this era of decline, there was only small numbers of people practicing Buddhism, most of them are [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese immigrants]] that settled in Indonesia with migration wave accelerated in the 17th century. Many of ''klenteng'' ([[Chinese temple]]s) in Indonesia are in fact a ''tridharma'' temple that houses three faiths, namely Buddhism, [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]].

In 1934, [[Narada Thera]], a missionary monk from [[Sri Lanka]], visited [[Dutch East Indies]] (today Indonesia) for the first time as part of his journey to spread the Dharma in Southeast Asia. This opportunity was used by a few local Buddhists to revive Buddhism in Indonesia. A Bodhi tree planting ceremony was held in Southeastern side of [[Borobudur]] on 10 March 1934 under the blessing of Narada Thera, and some Upasakas were ordained as monks.&lt;ref name ="Buddhanet"&gt;{{cite journal|title =Buddhism in Indonesia|publisher = Buddhanet|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/indo-txt.htm|accessdate =4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Indonesia ===
[[File:Borobudur on Vesak Day 2011.jpg|right|thumb|National vesak ceremony in Borobudur, Central Java.]]
Following the [[Overthrow of Sukarno|downfall of President Sukarno]] in the mid-1960s, [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] was reasserted as the official Indonesian policy on religion to only recognise [[monotheistic|monotheism]] .&lt;ref&gt;cf. Bunge (1983), chapter [http://countrystudies.us/indonesia/40.htm Buddhism].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, founder of Perbuddhi (Indonesian Buddhists Organisation), Bhikku Ashin Jinarakkhita, proposed that there was a single supreme deity, [[Sanghyang Adi Buddha]]. He was also backed up with the history behind the Indonesian version of Buddhism in ancient [[Javanese language|Javanese]] texts, and the shape of the Borobudur Temple.

During the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era,  the state ideology of Pancasila listed Buddhism among the five official religions of [[Indonesia]].  The national leader of the time, [[Suharto]], had considered Buddhism and  [[Hinduism]] as Indonesian classical religions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The first [[Theravada]] ordination of [[bhikkhuni]]s in Indonesia after more than a thousand years occurred in 2015 at Wisma Kusalayani in Lembang, Bandung.&lt;ref name="bhikkhuni1"&gt;http://www.bhikkhuni.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FirstTheravadaordinationofbhikkhunisinIndonesiaAfteraThousandYears.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Those ordained included Vajiradevi Sadhika Bhikkhuni from Indonesia, Medha Bhikkhuni from Sri Lanka, Anula Bhikkhuni from Japan, Santasukha Santamana Bhikkhuni from Vietnam, Sukhi Bhikkhuni and Sumangala Bhikkhuni from Malaysia, and Jenti Bhikkhuni from Australia.&lt;ref name="bhikkhuni1"/&gt;

Today, in reference to the principle of Pancasila, a Buddhist monk representing the Buddhist Sangha, along with priest, Brahmin, pastor or representative of other recognized religions, would participate in nearly all state-sponsored ceremonies. The ceremony would always include a prayer (led by a Muslim imam with representatives of other faiths standing in a row behind him). It is noteworthy that, although the majority of Indonesian Buddhists are of the Chinese Mahayana school, more often than not the representative of Buddhism as selected by the Government would happen to be a Theravada monk.

Once a year, thousands of Buddhists from Indonesia and neighboring countries flock to Borobudur to commemorate national [[Vesak]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Vesak Festival: A Truly Sacred Experience |publisher =Wonderful Indonesia |url =http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/233/borobudur/article/7/vesak-festival-a-truly-sacred-experience |accessdate =4 May 2015 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150504193814/http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/233/borobudur/article/7/vesak-festival-a-truly-sacred-experience |archivedate =4 May 2015 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
The oldest extant esoteric Buddhist Mantranaya (largely a synonym of Mantrayana, Vajrayana and Buddhist Tantra) literature in [[Old Javanese]], a language significantly influenced by [[Sanskrit]], is enshrined in the ''Sang Kyang Kamahayanan Mantranaya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shivabuddha.blogspot.com/search/label/lontar%20sang%20hyang%20kamahayanikan|title=SHIVA BUDDHA INDONESIA|author=SHIVA BUDDHA INDONESIA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lalitavistara Sutra]]'' was known to the [[Mantranaya]] stonemasons of [[Borobudur]], refer: [[The birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)]]. 'Mantranaya' is not a corruption or misspelling of 'mantrayana' even though it is largely synonymous. Mantranaya is the term for the esoteric tradition on [[mantra]], a particular lineage of [[Vajrayana]] and [[Tantra]], in [[Indonesia]]. The clearly Sanskrit sounding 'Mantranaya' is evident in [[Old Javanese]] tantric literature, particularly as documented in the oldest esoteric Buddhist tantric text in Old Javanese, the ''Sang Kyang Kamahayanan Mantranaya''  refer Kazuko Ishii (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Ishii, Kazuko (1992). "The Correlation of Verses of the 'Sang Kyang Kamahayanan Mantranaya' with Vajrabodhi's 'Japa-sutra'". ''Area and Culture Studies'' Vol. 44.

== Current practice ==

In Indonesia Buddhism is mainly followed by the [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese Indonesian people]] and some small indigenous groups of Indonesia, with 0.8% (including Taoism and Confucianism) of Indonesia's population being Buddhists.&lt;ref name="sp2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bdea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/nationprofiles/Indonesia/rbodies.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829053427/http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/nationprofiles/Indonesia/rbodies.html |date=August 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small minority of [[Sasak]]s called the "Bodha" (estimated population: 8000) are mainly found in the village of Bentek and on the slopes of [[Mount Rinjani|Gunung Rinjani]], [[Lombok]]. They are totally untouched by Islamic influence and worship animistic gods, incorporating some Hindu and Buddhist influences in their rituals and religious vocabulary. This group of Sasak, due in part to the name of their tribe, are recognized as [[Buddhist]]s by the Indonesian government.

Pockets of Javanese Buddhists also exist and are to be found mainly in villages and cities in Central and East Java. The regencies of Temanggung, Blitar and Jepara count about 30.000 Buddhists, mostly of Javanese ethnicity.

=== Schools ===
Today there are numerous Buddhist schools established in Indonesia. The earliest school that was established in Indonesia was [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], which developed from [[Mahayana Buddhism]], and which had some similarities with later Tibetan Buddhism. Various temples of ancient Java and Sumatra are Vajrayana. [[Chinese Buddhism]] (the main branch of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]) has gained followers from Chinese Indonesian populations that began to migrate into the archipelago during the 17th to 18th century. Other notable schools are [[Theravada]] Buddhism from Sri Lanka and Thailand.

Indonesia's most notable Buddhist organization is Perwakilan Umat Buddha Indonesia (Walubi) which serves as the vehicle of all Buddhist schools in Indonesia. Other Buddhist organizations include Majelis Buddhayana Indonesia, Sangha Agung Indonesia (SAGIN), Sangha Theravada Indonesia (STI), Sangha Mahayana Indonesia, and the Taiwan-originated [[Tzu-Chi]].

=== Religious events ===

{| style="float:right;"

The most important Buddhist religious event in Indonesia is [[Vesak]] ({{lang-id|Waisak}}). Once a year, during the [[full moon]] in May or June, Buddhists in Indonesia observe Vesak day commemorating the birth, death, and the time when [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]] attained the highest wisdom to become the Buddha Shakyamuni. Vesak is an official [[Public holidays in Indonesia|national holiday]] in Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://menkokesra.go.id/content/view/460/73/ |publisher=Coordinating Ministry for Public Welfare |title=Keputusan Bersama tentang Hari Libur Nasional dan Cuti Bersama tahun 2006 |language=Indonesian |accessdate=17 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307043042/http://www.menkokesra.go.id/content/view/460/73/ |archivedate=March 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ceremony is centered at the three Buddhist temples by walking from [[Mendut]] to [[Pawon]] and ending at Borobudur.&lt;ref name="walubi-The_Meaning_of_Procession"&gt;

Vesak also is often celebrated in Sewu temple and numerous Buddhist temples in Indonesia.

=== Protests ===
The [[Chinese Indonesian]] community in Tanjung Balai municipality in North Sumatra has protested against the administration’s plan to dismantle a statue of Buddha on top of the Tri Ratna Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/10/20/indonesianchinese-protest-removal-buddha-statue.html|title=Indonesian-Chinese protest removal of Buddha statue |author= Apriadi Gunawan |date= 2010-10-20 |work= |publisher= The Jakarta Post|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tionghoa.info/patung-buddha-di-vihara-tanjung-balai-pecinan-digusur-alasannya-karena-dianggap-menghina-agama-mayoritas/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam''' (abbreviated as BSV, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam) is the only Buddhist Sangha recognised by the [[Vietnamese government]] and is a member of the [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front]]. The BSV was founded after Vietnam's Buddhist Convention was held at [[Quan Su Temple]] on November 7, 1981. The BSV was founded to unify Buddhist activities of Vietnamese Buddhist monks, nuns and lay followers. The Head of the 6th term Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam (2007-2012) is Most Venerable [[Thich Pho Tue]].

{{Zen Buddhism}}
The '''lay Buddhist ordination''' ({{zh|t=受戒|p=shòu jiè}}, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{nihongo|''Jukai''|受戒}}, [[Korean language|Korean]]: ''sugye'' (수계) refers to the public [[ordination]] ceremony wherein a [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|lay follower]] of [[Zen Buddhism|Buddhism]] receives certain Buddhist precepts.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 55&lt;/ref&gt; The particulars of the ceremony differ widely by country and by school of Buddhism.

==Japan==
In Japan, the ritual is called ''jukai''.

===Sōtō school===
In the [[Sōtō]] school in the United States, lay initiates take refuge in the Three Jewels (or Three Refuges--Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), the Three Pure Precepts (to do no harm, to do only good, and to do good for others) and the Five Grave Precepts--Affirm life: do not kill; Be giving: do not take what is not freely given; Honor the body: do not engage in sexual misconduct; 
Manifest truth: do not speak falsely; and Proceed clearly: do not cloud the mind with intoxicants.&lt;ref&gt;''Lay Initiation Ceremony: Receiving Soto Zen Buddhist Precepts (Jukai), Atlanta Soto Zen Buddhist Center, American Soto Zen Buddhist Association''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rinzai school===
In the [[Rinzai]] school students take refuge in the Three Jewels (or Three Refuges) and, similarly to the Chinese and Korean practices derived from India, they receive the [[Buddhist precepts|five precepts]] for laypersons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.korinji.org/shoken-jukai |title=Shoken and Jukai |access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korea==
[[File:Korean Buddhist Card.jpg|thumb|Ordination card given those joining the [[Jogye Order]], bearing the ordained's new Buddhist name and signifying his/her commitment to keeping the [[Five precepts]].]]
In South Korea, the ritual, called ''sugye'' (수계), involves formally taking refuge in [[Three Jewels|The Three Jewels of Buddhism]]: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, and accepting the [[Buddhist precepts|five precepts]]. During the ritual, the initiate is touched with a burning incense stick. This is to leave a permanent mark which serves to remind the initiate of their promise to uphold the five precepts. During (or right after) the ceremony, the initiate is given a [[Dharma name|Buddhist name]].&lt;ref&gt;Hellmann, web&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
In China, the ritual, is called ''shòu-jiè'' (受戒). The character 受 means "receive," while 戒 means "precepts." Taken together, the characters translate as "initiated" or "ordained."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many people believe in Buddhism but do not go through any initiation ceremonies. Such Buddhists make up the overwhelming majority. Only a small part of Buddhists have gone through the ceremony which makes the recipient an [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|upasaka or upasika]] and accepted the five commandments. They are formal Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;Ling, 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lewis Hodus]], in his 1920 book ''Buddhism and Buddhists in China'' remarks on the Chinese ceremony as well, after recording an initiation ceremony for both those entering monastic life and the laity: "Less private was the initiation of the lay brethren and sisters, more lightly branded on the right wrist, while all about intoned 'Na-mah Pen-shih Shih-chia-mou-ni Fo.' (I put my trust in my Original Teacher, Säkyamuni-Buddha.)"&lt;ref&gt;Hodus, 13&lt;/ref&gt; In modern notation and Chinese, this would be written "Namo Benshi Shijiamouni-Fo" (南無本師釋迦牟尼佛).

==United States==
In the [[United States]], "jukai is a formal rite of passage that marks entrance into the Buddhist community. At that time, a student is given a [[Dharma name]]. He or she also makes a commitment to the precepts, which are interpreted a bit differently in various communities."&lt;ref name="seager"&gt;Seager, 109&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Diamond Sangha]], jukai is "commonly practiced" though some members never undergo the ceremony because they are members of another religion which prohibits such initiations. Therefore, some would say, they are not Buddhist by definition.&lt;ref name="spuler"&gt;Spuler, 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Rochester Zen Center]] and its affiliated centers, the jukai ceremony involves taking the same precepts as in the Soto and White Plum traditions; however, from school to school or lineage to lineage, interpretation and translation of precepts can vary.&lt;ref&gt;Chodron, 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[White Plum Asanga]] follows the same ritual as the Japanese Soto-school.

'''Chantal Anne Akerman''' ({{IPA-fr|akɛʁman|lang}}; 6 June 1950{{spaced ndash}}5 October 2015) was a Belgian [[film director]], [[screenwriter]], [[artist]], and [[Film studies|film professor]] at the [[City College of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/arts/chantal-akerman-belgian-filmmaker-dies-65.html|title=Chantal Akerman, Whose Films Examined Women's Inner Lives, Dies at 65|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is best known for her three hour [[magnum opus|''magnum opus'']] ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'' (1975), which was dubbed a "masterpiece" by ''[[The New York Times]]''. According to film scholar [[Gwendolyn Audrey Foster]], Akerman's influence on [[Feminism|feminist]] filmmaking and [[avant-garde]] cinema has been substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Foster |editor1-first=Gwendolyn Audrey |editor1-link=Gwendolyn Audrey Foster |date=2003 |title=Identity and Memory: The Films of Chantal Akerman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lULjtguX9HkC&amp;pg=PA204 |publisher=SIU Press |page=204 |isbn=978-0809325139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Akerman was born in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] to [[Holocaust]] survivors from [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; She was the older sister of Sylviane Akerman, her only sibling. Her mother Natalia (Nelly) had survived years at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where her own parents had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Chantal Akerman obituary|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/08/chantal-akerman|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-10|first = Jonathan|last = Romney}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age, Akerman and her mother were exceptionally close, and she encouraged her daughter to pursue a career rather than marry young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.thejc.com/arts/film/chantal-akerman-my-family-and-other-dark-materials| title = Chantal Akerman: My family and other dark materials| website = www.thejc.com| access-date = 2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At age 18, Akerman entered the [[INSAS (film school)|Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle et des Techniques de Diffusion]], a Belgian [[film school]].  Akerman dropped out during her first term to make the [[short film]] ''Saute ma ville''; she funded the film's costs by trading diamond shares on the [[Antwerp]] [[stock exchange]].&lt;ref name=criterion&gt;{{cite web |last1=Margulies |first1=Ivone |title=A Matter of Time: Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1215-a-matter-of-time-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles |website=The Criterion Collection |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Akerman had an extremely close relationship with her mother, captured in some of her films. In 1976 ''[[News From Home]]'', Akerman's mother's letters outlining mundane family activities serve as a soundtrack throughout the film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lebow|first1=Alisa|title=Identity Slips: The Autobiographical Register In The Work Of Chantal Akerman|journal=Film Quarterly|date=2016|volume=1|issue=70|pages=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 ''[[No Home Movie]]'' centers on mother-daughter relationships, largely situated in the kitchen, and is a response to her mother's death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=Jon|title=Every Home A Heartache: Chantal Akerman|journal=C: International Contemporary Art|date=2016|issue=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film explores issues of [[metempsychosis]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; the last shot of the film acting as a memento mori of the mother's apartment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Akerman acknowledged that her mother was at the center of her work and admitted to feeling directionless after her death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The maternal imagery can be found throughout all of Akerman's films, as an homage and an attempt to reconstitute the image and voice of the mother.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In ''Family In Brussels'', Akerman narrates the story, interchanging her own voice with her mother's.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Work==

===Early work and influences===
Akerman claimed that, at the age of 15, after viewing [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Pierrot le fou]]'' (1965), she decided, that same night, to become a filmmaker.  In 1971, Akerman's first short film, ''Saute ma ville'', premiered at the [[International Short Film Festival Oberhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Margulies |first=Ivone |date=1996 |title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's hyperrealist everyday |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |page=2 |isbn=0-8223-1723-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, she moved to [[New York City]], where she remained until 1972.

At [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York, Akerman was impressed with the work of [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Michael Snow]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], and [[Andy Warhol]].

===Critical recognition===
Her first feature film, [[Hotel Monterey (film)|''Hotel Monterey'']] (1972), and subsequent short films, ''La Chambre 1'' and ''La Chambre 2'', reveal the influence of structural filmmaking through these films' usage of long takes. These protracted shots serve to oscillate images between abstraction and figuration. Akerman's films from this period also signify the start of her collaboration with [[cinematographer]] [[Babette Mangolte]]. 

In 1973, Akerman returned to Belgium and, in 1974, she received critical recognition for her feature ''[[Je Tu Il Elle|Je, Tu, Il, Elle]] (I, You, He, She)''. Feminist and queer film scholar [[B. Ruby Rich]] noted that ''Je Tu Il Elle'' can be seen as a "cinematic Rosetta Stone of [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]]".

Akerman's most significant film, ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'', was released in 1975. Often considered one of the greatest examples of [[feminist]] filmmaking, the film makes a hypnotic, real-time study of a middle-aged widow's stifling routine of domestic chores and prostitution. Upon the film's release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called ''Jeanne Dielman'' the "first masterpiece of the feminine in the history of the cinema". Chantal Akerman scholar Ivone Margulies says the picture is a filmic paradigm for uniting feminism and anti-illusionism.&lt;ref name="criterion"/&gt; The film was named the 19th greatest film of the 20th century by [[J. Hoberman]] of the ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman, J. (2001) [4 January 2000]. "100 Best Films of the 20th Century: Village Voice Critics' Poll". The Village Voice (reprint ed.). Reprinted by AMC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===

Akerman has acknowledged that her cinematic approach can be explained, in part, through the writings of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Felix Guattari]].&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marguilles|first1=Ivonne|title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's Hyperrealist Everyday|date=1996|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=9780822317265|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] write about the concept of minor literature as being characterized by the following things:
*1. Minor literature is the literature that a [[minority group|minority]] makes in a major language; the language is effected by a strong co-efficient of [[deterritorialization]].
*2. Every individual matter is immediately plugged into political because minor literature exists in a narrow space.
*3. Everything has a collective value: what the solitary writer says already has collective value.&lt;ref name="What Is A Minor Literature"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deleuze|first1=Gilles|last2=Guattari|first2=Félix|last3=Brinkley|first3=Robert|title=What Is A Minor Literature?|journal=Mississippi Review|date=1983|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] claim that these characteristics describe the revolutionary conditions within the canon of literature.&lt;ref name="What Is A Minor Literature"/&gt; Akerman has referenced [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] on how, in minor literature, the characters assume an immediate, nonhierarchical relation between small individual matters and economic, commercial, juridical, and political ones.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; While the filmmaker has an interest in multiple [[deterritorialization]]s, she also considers the feminist demand for the exercise of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], where a borderline status may be an undesirable position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marguilles|first1=Ivonne|title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's Hyperrealist Everyday|date=1996|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=9780822317265|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===

Akerman has used the setting of a kitchen to explore the intersection between femininity and domesticity.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel|title=The Director's Director: Chantal Akerman|publisher=New York Times|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kitchens in Akerman's work provide intimate spaces for connection and conversation and serve the function of a backdrop to the dramas of daily life.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; The kitchens, alongside other domestic spaces, act as self-confining prisons under patriarchal conditions.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; In Akerman's work, the kitchen acts as a domestic theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=Sultan|first2=Terrie|title=Chantal Akerman: Moving Through Time and Space|date=2008|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers|location=Bluffer Gallery, Art Museum of the University of Houston|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Akerman is often grouped within feminist and queer thinking, the filmmaker has articulated her distance from an essentialist feminism.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; Akerman resists labels relating to her identity like "female", "Jewish" and "lesbian", choosing instead to immerse herself in the identity of being a daughter; Akerman has stated that she sees film as a "generative field of freedom from the boundaries of identity".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The filmmaker has advocated for multiplicity of expression, explaining that "when people say there is a feminist film language, it is like saying there is only one way for women to express themselves".&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; The filmmaker asserted that there are as many cinematic languages as there are individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 

Writer and scholar Ivone Marguiles notes that Akerman's resistance to be categorized is in response to the rigidity of cinema's earlier essentialist realism and "indicates an awareness of the project of a transhistorical and transcultural feminist aesthetics of the cinema".&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt;

Akerman works with the feminist motto of the personal being political, complicating it by an investigation of representational links between private and public.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; In Jeanne Dielman, Akerman's most well-known film, the main protagonist does not supply a transparent, accurate representation of a fixed social reality.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; Throughout the film, the housewife and prostitute Jeanne is revealed to be a construct, with multiple historical, social, and cinematic resonances.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; 

Akerman engages with realist representations, a form which is historically grounded to act as a feminist gesture and simultaneously as an "irritant" to fixed categories of "woman".&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt;

===Later career===
In 1991, Akerman was a member of the jury at the [[41st Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1991/04_jury_1991/04_Jury_1991.html |title=Berlinale: 1991 Juries |work=berlinale.de |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, she joined the full-time faculty of the MFA Program in Media Arts Production at the [[City College of New York]] as a distinguished lecturer and the first Michael &amp; Irene Ross Visiting Professor of Film/Video &amp; Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chantal Akerman feature is tapped for New York Film Festival {{!}} The City College of New York |url=https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/news/chantal-akerman-ny_film-fesrtival |website=www.ccny.cuny.edu |date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Important solo exhibitions of Akerman's work have been held at the Museum for Contemporary Art, Antwerp, Belgium (2012), MIT, Cambridge Massachusetts (2008), the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel (2006); [[Princeton University Art Museum]], Princeton, NJ (2006); and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris (2003). Akerman has participated in [[Documenta]] XI (2002) and the [[Venice Biennale]] (2001). 

In 2011, a film retrospective of Akerman's work was shown at the Austrian Film Museum.&lt;ref name=gallery&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/chantal-akerman/ |title=Chantal Akerman |website=Marian Goodman Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2015 Venice Biennale included an installation of interspersed parallel screens displaying the landscape-in-motion footage that would appear in "No Home Movie". 

In 2018, the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] presented her final video installation ''NOW'' (2015) in the exhibition ''Scenes from the Collection'', and acquired her work for the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/scenes-from-the-collection|title=Scenes from the Collection|website=The Jewish Museum|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinematography==

Akerman's cinematography is characterized by the dryness of language, the lack of metaphorical associations, the composition in a series of discontinuous blocks, the interest in putting a poor, withered syntax and reduced vocabulary at the service of a new intensity.&lt;ref name="What Is A Minor Literature"/&gt; Many directors have cited Akerman's films as an influence on their work.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; [[Kelly Reichardt]], [[Gus Van Sant]], and [[Sofia Coppola]] have noted their exploration of filming in real time as a tribute to Akerman.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

Terrie Sultan, art historian, claims that Akerman's "narrative is marked by an almost Proustian attention to detail and visual grace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=Sultan|first2=Terrie|title=Chantal Akerman: Moving Through Time and Space|date=2008|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers|location=Bluffer Gallery, Art Museum of the University of Houston|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Akerman's visual language resists easy categorization and summarization: the filmmaker creates narrative through filmic syntax instead of plot development.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=David|first2=Catherine|last3=Michael|first3=Tarantino|title=Bordering On Fiction: Chantal Akerman's D'Est|date=1995|publisher=New York: Distribured Art Publishers|location=Minneapolis, Walker Art Center|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akerman was influenced by European art cinema, as well as structuralist film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Structuralist film used formalist experimentation to propose a reciprocal relationship between image and viewer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Akerman cites [[Michael Snow]] as a structuralist inspiration, especially his film Wavelength, which is composed of a single shot of a photograph of a sea on a loft wall, with the camera slowly zooming in.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Akerman was drawn to the perceived dullness of structuralism because it rejected the dominant cinema's concern for plot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; As a teenager in Brussels, Akerman skipped school in order to see movies, including films from the experimental festival in Knokke-le-Zoute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Akerman addresses the voyeurism that is always present within cinematic discourse by often playing a character within her films, thus placing herself on both sides of the camera simultaneously.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The filmmaker used the boredom of structuralism in order to generate a bodily feeling in the viewer, accentuating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Akerman's filming style relies on capturing ordinary life. By encouraging viewers to have patience for a slower pace, her films emphasize the humanity of the everyday.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Kathy Halbreich states that the filmmaker "creates a cinema of waiting, of passages, of resolutions deferred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=David|first2=Catherine|last3=Michael|first3=Tarantino|title=Bordering On Fiction: Chantal Akerman's D'Est|date=1995|publisher=New York: Distribured Art Publishers|location=Minneapolis, Walker Art Center|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of Akerman's films portray the movement of people across distances or their absorption with claustrophobic spaces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Curator Jon Davies states that Akerman's domestic interiors "conceal gendered labour and violence, secrecy and shame, where traumas both large and small unfold with few, if any witnesses".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Death==
Akerman died on 5 October 2015 in Paris; ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that she committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=monde&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cinema/article/2015/10/06/la-cineaste-chantal-akerman-est-morte_4783566_3476.html|author=Isabelle Regnier|title=La cinéaste Chantal Akerman est morte|publisher=''Le Monde''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was 65.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel|last2=Buckley|first2=Clara|title=Chantal Akerman, Pioneering Belgian Filmmaker, Dies at 65|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/arts/chantal-akerman-belgian-filmmaker-dies-65.html?_r=0|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015|publisher=''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=liberation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://next.liberation.fr/culture-next/2015/10/06/mort-de-la-cineaste-chantal-akerman_1398190|author=Julien Gester|title=Mort de la cinéaste Chantal Akerman|publisher=''Libération''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/06/chantal-akerman-pioneering-belgium-film-director-and-theorist-dies-aged-65|author=Catherine Shoard|title=Chantal Akerman, pioneering Belgian film director and theorist, dies aged 65|publisher=''Guardian''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last film was the documentary ''[[No Home Movie]]'', a series of conversations with her mother shortly before her mother's death; of the film, she said, "I think if I knew I was going to do this, I wouldn't have dared to do it."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Citation | last =Rapold | first =Nicolas | title =Chantal Akerman Takes Emotional Path in Film About 'Maman' | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =5 August 2015 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/arts/international/chantal-akerman-takes-emotional-path-in-film-about-maman.html | accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Deus seja louvado"''' (In English, "God be praised") is an expression displayed in the left bottom part of all [[Brazilian real]] currency banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esamcuberlandia.com.br/revistaidea/index.php/idea/article/download/21/20 |title=O real significado: Análise semiótica das cédulas do Plano Real |language=Portuguese |trans-title= The Real Meaning: Semiotic analysis of Real Plan banknotes |last1=Rinaldi |first1=Renata |last2=Nery |first2=Vanda Cunha Albieri |year=2009 |publisher=Revista Idea |access-date=23 Mar 2011 |format=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It exists since the 1980 decade, when the then President of the Republic, [[José Sarney]], openly Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folhamaranhao.com/noticias/politica/sarney-critica-retirada-de-frase-da-cedula-do-real-24717.html |title=José Sarney não quer retirada de frase do real |language=Portuguese |trans-title=José Sarney does not want phrase removal from the real |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130425233914/http://folhamaranhao.com/noticias/politica/sarney-critica-retirada-de-frase-da-cedula-do-real-24717.html |archivedate=2013-04-25 |date=16 Nov 2012 |publisher=Folha Maranhão |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; asked the [[Central Bank of Brazil|Banco Central]] (Central Bank) to include the phrase in the [[Brazilian cruzado|cruzado]] coin. The Federal Government at the time got inspired by [[Theism|theist]] doctrines of other [[secular state]]s such as the [[United States|United States of America]] that were already using the motto "[[In God We Trust]]" in its [[United States dollar|dollar]] banknotes.

The first banknotes with the inscription were printed in February 24, 1986, when the executive order was presented to the Central Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crmariocovas.sp.gov.br/noticia.php?it=4188 |title=Deixem Deus em paz |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Leave God alone |last=Setti |first=Ricardo |date=18 Oct 2003 |publisher=CRE |access-date=28 Dec 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way, the expression remained throughout time, including real banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcb.gov.br/htms/museu-espacos/cedulas/real.asp?idpai=cedbrlista |title=Museu de Valores do Banco Central |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Museum of Values of the Central Bank |author=Banco Central |publisher=Banco Central |access-date=27 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite recent discussions and requests by secularist sectors of civil society for the phrase to be removed, it continues to be printed by the Central Bank, including new banknotes, printed since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oreporter.com/detalhes.php?id=16321 |title=Banco Central lança novas cédulas do real |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Central Bank launches new real banknotes |archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20120906081721/http://www.oreporter.com/Banco-Central-lanca-novas-cedulas-do-real,1632198970.htm |archivedate=2012-09-06 |last=Grinbaum |first=Victor |date=3 Feb 2010 |publisher=O Repórter |access-date=19 Mar 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with attempts to remove the phrase on the banknotes by the [[Public Prosecutor's Office (Brazil)|Public Ministry]], José Sarney stated: "''I feel sorry for the man who does not believe in God on the face of the earth''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2012/11/sarney-diz-que-polemica-sobre-mencao-a-deus-e-falta-do-que-fazer.html |title=Sarney diz que retirar menção a Deus de cédulas é 'falta do que fazer' |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Sarney says that removing mention of God from banknotes is 'lacking of anything else to do' |date=13 Nov 2012 |publisher=[[G1 (website)|Portal G1]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Criticism ===
[[File:Diversidade Religiosa no Brasil.jpg|thumb|220px|According to secularists, the [[Religion in Brazil|religious diversity in Brazil]] is not represented by a phrase which privileges only monotheistic religions. In the image, the ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Celso Amorim]], in a meeting with adherents of different religions of the country]]
The phrase "God be praised" creates arguments because, according to some, it would be contrary to the [[secular state]], which does not privilege any religion, although there is no consensus on the part of the religious communities, especially the Christian ones. To many people, the phrase would not take into account the existence of non-theistic communities such as [[agnostics]], [[Buddhists]] and [[atheists]], as well as adherents of other non-monotheistic religions, such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Afro-Brazilian religions]], but the population is in its vast majority adept of [[Christianity]], which does not imply popular dissatisfaction due to the phrase in the coin. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Attempts of removal ===
In December 2010, the [[Federal Public Ministry]] in São Paulo notified the Central Bank to offer an answer on behalf of an "offense to the secularism of the Federative Republic of Brazil", suing the Central Bank for keeping the term "God be praised" in real banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/radar-on-line/brasil/procurador-do-mpf-quer-retirar-o-termo-deus-seja-louvado-das-cedulas-de-real/ |title= Procurador do MPF quer retirar o termo "Deus seja louvado" das cédulas de Real |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Prosecutor of the Federal Public Ministry wants to remove the term "God be praised" from the real banknotes |last=Jardim |first=Lauro |year=2012 |publisher=[[Veja (magazine)|VEJA]] |access-date=11 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 2012, the Regional Attorney's Office for Citizens' Rights asked the [[Judiciary of Brazil#Federal courts|Federal Court]] to order the removal of the expression "God be praised" from the national currency banknotes, so as not to privilege any religion since the state is secular. The lawsuit was filed by Catholic prosecutor Jefferson Aparecido Dias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2012/11/mpf-em-sp-pede-retirada-da-frase-deus-seja-louvado-das-notas-de-reais.html |title=MPF em SP pede retirada da frase 'Deus seja louvado' das notas de reais |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Federal Public Ministry in São Paulo requests the removal of the phrase 'God be praised' from the reais banknotes |publisher=[[G1 (website)|Portal G1]] |access-date=12 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,mp-quer-real-sem-deus-seja-louvado,959568,0.htm |title=MP quer real sem 'Deus seja louvado' |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Public Ministry wants real without 'God be praised' |last=Rehder |first=Marcelo |date=13 Nov 2012 |access-date=16 Nov 2012 |publisher=[[Estadão]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/1184377-procuradoria-pede-retirada-do-termo-deus-seja-louvado-das-cedulas-de-real.shtml |title=Procuradoria pede retirada do termo 'Deus seja louvado' das cédulas de real |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Prosecutor requests the removal of the term 'God be praised' from real banknotes |publisher=[[Folha de S.Paulo]] |date=12 Nov 2012 |access-date=16 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dias, the measure "would not cause expenses to the public finances, since a period of 120 days would be given so that the Casa da Moeda (Brazilian mint) begins to print the new notes without the phrase". He also said that no law authorizes the inclusion of religious expressions in money. In addition, he said that the purpose of the lawsuit is to safeguard the right of religious freedom of all citizens.&lt;ref name="EXAME"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/procuradoria-quer-excluir-deus-seja-louvado-das-notas |title=Procuradoria quer excluir 'Deus seja louvado' das notas |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Prosecutor wants to exclude 'God be praised' from the banknotes |publisher=[[Exame]] |date=12 Nov 2012 |access-date=16 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Let's imagine the real note with the following expressions: ''Allah be praised, Buddha be praised, Save Oxossi, Save Lord Ganesha, God does not exist. ''There would certainly be agitation in Brazilian society because of the embarrassment suffered by citizens believers in God," says an excerpt from the Attorney's complaint.&lt;ref name="EXAME"/&gt;

Christian and political leaders came out with strong criticisms of the representation. Pastor [[Silas Malafaia]] said in a video posted on his website that the prosecutor is the same person who accepted and filed a homophobia complaint against him: "I'm suspicious that this prosecutor has nothing to do. I think the Attorney General has to get a job for this citizen".&lt;ref name="SILAS"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://noticias.gospelmais.com.br/silas-malafaia-marco-feliciano-polemica-notas-real-44870.html |title=Silas Malafaia, Marco Feliciano, Magno Malta e Sarney comentam polêmica com as notas de real: "Tenho pena de quem não acredita em Deus" |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Silas Malafaia, Marco Feliciano, Magno Malta and Sarney comment controversy with the real banknotes: "I pity those who do not believe in God" |last=Chagas |first=Tiago |publisher=Gospel+ |date=15 Nov 2012 |access-date=16 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SILAS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portaldt.com/silas-malafaia-e-sarney-comentam-retirada-do-deus-seja-louvado-do-real/ |title=Silas Malafaia e Sarney comentam retirada do "Deus seja louvado" do real |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Silas Malafaia and Sarney comment on removal of "God be praised" from the real |last=Ribeiro |first=Tadeu |publisher=Gospel Prime |date=14 Nov 2012 |access-date=16 Nov 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malafaia also recalled that the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution]] is presented as being elaborated "[[Constitution of Brazil#Preamble|under the protection of God]]", and that the prosecutor should also propose the change of the name of states such as [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] ("St. Catherine"), [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] ("St. Paul") and [[Espírito Santo]] ("Holy Ghost"), in addition to [[Public holidays in Brazil|national Catholic holidays]].&lt;ref name="SILAS"/&gt;

The secretary-general of the [[National Conference of Bishops of Brazil]] (CNBB), which is part of the Catholic Church hierarchy, Archbishop Leonardo Ulrich Steiner, said:&lt;ref name="CNBB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arquidiocesedefortaleza.org.br/atualidades/noticias/secretario-geral-comenta-pedido-de-retirada-da-expressao-deus-seja-louvado-das-cedulas-de-reais/ |title=Secretário Geral comenta pedido de retirada da expressão "Deus seja louvado" das cédulas de reais |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Secretary General comments on request for the removal of the expression "God be praised" from the reais banknotes |publisher=Arquidiocese de Fortaleza |date=14 Nov 2012 |access-date=26 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We should be concerned about much more essential things. Many people will only notice the phrase after this lawsuit. This type of lawsuit is not new! The phrase will now recall the presence of God in the life of the Brazilian people". For [[Don (honorific)|Dom]] Leonardo, the expression "does not embarrass, but it can annoy those who say they do not believe". "People who live their faith, in their various expressions, certainly do not feel embarrassed, for they live on the greatness of transcendence. It's that faith is not at first worshipping a god, but relationship. If the phrase reminds of a relationship, it could be remembered that money itself must be at the service of people, especially the poor, in sharing and in solidarity. If so, God be praised!" says the bishop.&lt;ref name="CNBB"/&gt;

=== Court's decision ===
On November 30, 2012, the Federal Court denied the Federal Public Prosecutor's request to enforce the Federal Government and the Central Bank to remove, in up to 120 days, the phrase of Brazilian real notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/app/noticia/economia/2012/11/30/internas_economia,410616/justica-federal-nega-pedido-para-retirar-deus-seja-louvado-das-notas.shtml |title=Justiça Federal nega pedido para retirar "Deus seja louvado" das notas |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Federal Court denies request to renive "God be praised" from the banknotes |publisher=[[Diário de Pernambuco]] |date=30 Nov 2012 |access-date=3 Dec 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20121231233407/http://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/app/noticia/economia/2012/11/30/internas_economia,410616/justica-federal-nega-pedido-para-retirar-deus-seja-louvado-das-notas.shtml |archivedate=2012-12-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In three pages of the decision, it is reported that the Public Ministry did not provide evidence that there was "opposition to the statements inscribed on the banknote within the social sphere". The judge pointed out that the Federal Public Ministry in São Paulo did not listen to secular or religious institutions of other denominations demonstrating opposition to the presence of the phrase in the banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.correiodoestado.com.br/noticias/justica-federal-nega-pedido-para-retirar-deus-seja-louvado-d_167723/ |title=Justiça Federal nega pedido para retirar "Deus seja louvado" das notas |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Federal Court denies request to remove "God be praised" from the banknotes |publisher=Correio do Estado |access-date=3 Dec 2012|date=1 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court decision said that "the citation of God in the notes does not seem to be a targeting of the state in the life of an individual that forces him to adopt or not a certain belief". The preliminary decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Brasil/noticia/2012/11/decisao-provisoria-da-justica-mantem-frase-deus-seja-louvado-nas-cedulas.html |title=Decisão provisória da Justiça mantém frase "Deus seja louvado" nas cédulas |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Provisional Court Decision maintains "God be praised" on the banknotes |date=30 Nov 2012 |publisher=[[Época (Brazilian magazine)|Época]] |access-date=8 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was subsequently sustained. In 2013 Federal Judge Diana Brunstein, of the Civil Court of São Paulo, denied the request made by the Federal Public Ministry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s.conjur.com.br/dl/deus-seja-louvado-justica-federal.pdf |title = Decisão da Justiça Federal |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Federal Court decision |date= Jul 2013 |access-date= 13 Jun 2015 |last=Brunstein |first=Diana |publisher=Justiça Federal}}&lt;/ref&gt; to remove the expression "God be praised" from the real banknotes. The same judge had already denied a preliminary injunction in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.conjur.com.br/2013-jul-25/justica-nao-excluir-expressao-religiosa-cedula-real-sentenca|title = Judiciário não pode excluir frase religiosa de cédulas |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Judiciary can not exclude religious phrase from banknotes |last=Rover |first=Tadeu |publisher=Consultor Jurídico (ConJur) |date= 25 Jul 2013 |access-date= 13 Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney General of Brazil|Union Attorney's office]] argued that the expression "God be praised" in real notes does not repel the secularism of the state. "(...) The Brazilian state does not disavows the faith.

}}{{Infobox religion|members=~ 650 (2007)|founded_date=1925|footnotes=based on 13th century Latvian paganism}}
'''Dievturība''' is a [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] [[religion|religious]] movement which claims to be a modern revival of the [[folk religion]] of the [[Latvian people|Latvians]] before [[Christianization]] in the 13th century. Adherents call themselves '''Dievturi''' (singular: '''Dievturis'''), literally "[[Dievs]]' keepers", "people who live in harmony with [[Dievs]]".

The Dievturi movement was founded in 1925 by [[Ernests Brastiņš]]. It was forcibly suppressed by Russian Communists in 1940, but later was revived. In 2007, approximately 650 persons were officially active members of Dievturi movement.&lt;ref&gt;Reliģisko lietu pārvaldes 2007. gada pārskats {{cite web |url=http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/documents/parskati/2007/RLP_gada_parskats_2007.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722161902/http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/documents/parskati/2007/RLP_gada_parskats_2007.doc |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dievturība started in 1925 and (as a [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructionistic]] movement) is primarily based on Latvian [[folklore]], old folk songs ([[dainas]]) and [[Latvian mythology|mythology]]. By necessity, modern Dievturība differs from the historical Latvian religion. For example, there is no evidence that the Latvian pagans recognized a trinity of deities; in Dievturība, [[Dievas|Dievs]], [[Māra (goddess)|Māra]] and [[Laima]] are a triune godhead.

[[File:Memorial for Dievturi (Latvian pagan) victims of Soviet rule 1942-1952, Forest Cemetery, Riga, Latvia.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone at the [[Forest Cemetery, Riga|Forest Cemetery]] (Meža kapi) of Riga to those Latvian pagans killed by the Soviets 1942-1952.]]

[[Ernests Brastiņš]] (1892–1942) was the primary force in the early development of Dievturība. He was an artist, an amateur historian, a folklorist and an archaeologist. He documented many ancient Latvian temples and castles, writing the ''Index of Mythological Notions of Latvian Dainas''. ''Dievturi Catechism'' is the main inspirational text of Dievturība.

In the 1920s and 1930s the movement attracted several public figures from the cultural sphere, such as the painter [[Jēkabs Bīne]], writers [[Voldemārs Dambergs]], [[Viktors Eglītis]] and [[Juris Kosa]], literature historian and critic [[Alfrēds Goba]], and the composers [[Jānis Norvilis]] and [[Artūrs Salaks]].&lt;ref&gt;Stasulane and Ozoliņš 2017: 238&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dievturība sanctuary, the [[Lokstenes dievturu svētnīca]], was inaugurated on 6 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://skaties.lv/zinas/latvija/sabiedriba/uz-salas-daugava-atklata-dievturu-svetnica/ Uz salas Daugavā atklāta dievturu svētnīca]. 11 May 2017. ''Skaties''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Dievturība is essentially a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] religion. Other deities are either aspects of Dievs (the universe itself, the ultimate reality), or other types of non-deified spirits. In Dievturi theology, several triumvirates of deities and concepts are recognized.
* Gods of fate, the primary triumvirate
**[[Dievs]] – the primary god who emanates the others gods as aspects of himself
**[[Laima]]
**[[Māra (goddess)|Māra]]
*Goddesses of water
**[[Jūras māte]]
**[[Udens mate|Ūdens māte]]
**[[Upes māte]]

==Soul complex==
*Human form
**''velis'' – astral body
**''miesa'' – physical form
**''dvēsele'' – soul

The difference between the ''dvēsele'' (soul) and ''velis'' (the astral body) is a fine one.  The ''dvēsele'' is eternal.  It comes from Dievs (god) and will return to him after the death of the ''miesa''.  The ''velis'' stays near the body, gradually melting and disappearing over time similar to the concept of a [[Ghosts in European culture|ghost]] or the Greek ''[[shade (mythology)|shade]]''. The end of autumn and the start of winter is accepted as the time of remembrance of dead ancestors. In the dark time of autumn people gave food for their dead relatives due to the "dying of nature" or as a thanks gesture for a good harvest during the summer.

'''Domthok Monastery''' is a Buddhist monastery in [[Yushu County]], Qinghai, China. It is 60&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Gyêgu on the western bank of the Dri Chu ([[Yangtze River]]) at 32.62924, 97.53449. A footbridge crosses the river here. The monastery is affiliated with [[Dzongsar Monastery]], south of [[Derge]], in [[Garze County]], [[Sichuan]].

There are two shops, a [[general store]] run by the monks and close by another selling Tibetan medicines. Petrol can be purchased in the yard adjacent to the newly built (2011) hostel. A small Tibetan village surrounds the [[monastery]].

'''Florinus of Remüs''' (died 856 AD), also known as ''Florin, Florian of Chur, Florinus of Matsch, and Florinus of Vinschgau'', is venerated as a [[saint]] in the [[Catholic Church]], particularly in the dioceses of [[diocese of Chur|Chur]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen|Bolzano-Brixen]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vaduz|Vaduz]], and in the [[Rhineland]].

Little is known of his life, as there is no early ''[[Hagiography|vita]]''.  Florinus may have been the son of an [[Anglo-Saxon]] man and [[Jewish]] woman, a convert to Christianity, who had settled at [[Matscher Tal|Matsch]] (Mazia) in the [[Vinschgau Valley]] on their way back from a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Mollen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/91109|author= Mollen, Thomas|title= Heiliger Florinus vom Vinschgau|date=November 2005|publisher=Kirchensite=|accessdate=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florinus received his education from a priest at [[Engadin|Unterengadin]], where he was also ordained.&lt;ref name="Mollen"/&gt;  He then worked as a priest at [[Ramosch|Remüs (Ramosch)]].&lt;ref name="Mollen"/&gt;

[[Miracles]] are attributed to him, including the turning of water into wine.&lt;ref name="Mollen"/&gt;  After his death, numerous miracles were said to have taken place at his tomb in the parish church of Remüs.&lt;ref name="Mollen"/&gt;

==Veneration==
He is called a [[confessor of the faith]] rather than a [[martyr]].  After his death, the popularity of his cult increased, and his relics were distributed to various places, including the ''Florinskirche'' at [[Koblenz]] (in 950 AD) and also [[Regensburg]].&lt;ref name="heiligen"/&gt;  [[Vaduz Cathedral]] and the parish church at Matsch (Mazia) are also dedicated to him.&lt;ref name="heiligen"/&gt; He is depicted in a stained-glass window in the cathedral at [[Chur]].&lt;ref name="heiligen"/&gt;

'''Foolishness for Christ''' ({{lang-el|διά Χριστόν σαλότητα}}, {{lang-cu|оуродъ, юродъ}}) refers to behavior such as giving up all one's worldly possessions upon joining a [[monastic order]], or to deliberate flouting of society's conventions to serve a religious purpose–particularly of Christianity. Such individuals have historically been known as both "holy fools" and "blessed fools". The term "fool" connotes what is perceived as [[feeblemindedness]], and "[[blessing|blessed]]" or "holy" refers to innocence in the eyes of God.&lt;ref name="Frith, Uta 1989"&gt;Frith, Uta. (1989) Autism: The Elegant Enigma. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''fools for Christ'' derives from the writings of [[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]]. [[Desert Fathers]] and other saints acted the part of Holy Fools, as have the ''yurodivy'' (or iurodstvo) of [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[asceticism]]. Fools for Christ often employ shocking and unconventional behavior to challenge accepted norms, deliver prophecies, or to mask their piety.&lt;ref name="Parry 1999, p. 233"&gt;Parry (1999), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallels for this type of behavior exist in non-Christian traditions as well. The [[Avadhuta]] (Sanskrit), for example, the Islamic tradition of [[Qalandariyya]] and [[Malamatiyya]] Sufism and other [[crazy wisdom|crazy-wise]] mystics display similar traits. [[Mullah Nasruddin|Nasreddin]], of the Sufis, is also an example.

== Old Testament ==
Certain [[prophet]]s of the [[Old Testament]] who exhibited signs of strange behaviour are considered by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;''Gorainoff I. Les Fols en Christ... Р. 15–16; Saward J. Dieu a la folie. P. 15''.&lt;/ref&gt; to be predecessors of "Fools for Christ".  The prophet [[Isaiah]] walked naked and barefoot for about three years, predicting a forthcoming captivity in Egypt {{bibleverse|Isaiah|20:2,3|KJV}}; the prophet [[Ezekiel]] lay before a stone, which symbolized beleaguered [[Jerusalem]], and though God instructed him to eat bread baked on human waste, ultimately he asked to use cow dung instead {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|4:9-15|KJV}}; [[Hosea]] married [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|a harlot]] to symbolize the infidelity of Israel before God {{bibleverse|Hosea|3|KJV}}.

By the opinion of certain scholars,&lt;ref name="jclc"&gt;''J.- C. Larchee. Healing of mental illnesses: The experience of first centuries in the christian East. Translated from French into Russian. Moscow. Publishing House of Sretensky Monastery, 2007. 224 pages.''&lt;/ref&gt; these prophets were not counted as fools by their contemporaries, as they just carried out separate actions to attract people's attention and to awake their [[repentance]].&lt;ref name="jclc"/&gt;

== New Testament ==
[[File:Boyaryna Morozova by V.Surikov - sketch 09.jpg|thumb|upright|''A God´s Fool Sitting On the Snow'', by [[Vasily Surikov]], 1885]]

According to Christian ideas, "foolishness" included consistent rejection of worldly cares and [[Imitation of Christ|imitating Christ]], who endured mockery and humiliation from the crowd. The spiritual meaning of "foolishness" from the [[Early Christianity|early ages of Christianity]] was close to unacceptance of common social rules of hypocrisy, brutality and thirst for power and gains.&lt;ref name="jclc"/&gt;

By the words of [[Anthony the Great]]: "Here comes the time, when people will behave like madmen, and if they see anybody who does not behave like that, they will rebel against him and say: 'You are mad', — because he is not like them."&lt;ref&gt;''Apophtegmy (Alphavitnoye sobranie). About Avva Anthony. 25 (in Russian: Memorable stories.) p. 427.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paul the Apostle===
Part of the [[Bible|Biblical]] basis for it can be seen in the words of the [[Apostle Paul]] in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|4:10|KJV}}, which famously says:

:"We are ''fools for Christ's sake'', but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised." ([[KJV]]).

And also:

:"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness." ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:19}})

:"For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|1:18}})

:"For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe." ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|1:21}})

== Western Christianity ==
[[File:Cavallucci - San Benedetto Giuseppe Labre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benedict Joseph Labre]]]]
The most famous example in the Western church is St. [[Francis of Assisi]], whose order was known for following the teachings of Christ and walking in his footsteps. Thus, upon joining the order, Franciscans gave away all possessions and focused on preaching in the streets to the common man.

[[Juniper (friar)|Saint Juniper]], an early follower of the Franciscan order, was known for taking the doctrine of the Franciscans to the extreme. Whenever anyone asked for any of his possessions, he freely gave them away, including his clothes. He once even cut off the bells from his altar-cloth and gave them to a poor woman.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, Uta. (1989) ''Autism: Explaining the Enigma''. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; His fellow Franciscans had to watch him closely, and strictly forbade him from giving away his clothes. While such behaviors were embarrassing to his brothers, he was also recognized as a pure example of the Franciscan order and thus esteemed.

"The Little Flowers of Saint Francis of Assisi",&lt;ref&gt;Hudleston, Dom R. (1953) ''The Little Flowers of Saint Francis of Assissi", 1st English translation, revised and amended. London: Burns &amp; Oates.&lt;/ref&gt; which documents the oral traditions of the Franciscans, told several stories of "Brother Juniper". The most famous of these is the story of how Brother Juniper cut off the foot of a pig to give it to a sick brother. Upon the sick brother's request for a pig's foot, Brother Juniper took a kitchen knife and ran into the forest, where he saw a herd of swine feeding. There, he quickly cut the foot off of one of the swine and carried it back to the brother, leaving the swine to die.

This angered the herdsman, who complained to Saint Francis. Saint Francis confronted Brother Juniper, who joyfully exclaimed, "It is true, sweet father, that I did cut off the swine's foot. I will tell thee the reason. I went out of charity to visit the brother who is sick." Brother Juniper likewise explained to the angry herdsman who, seeing the "charity, simplicity, and humility" (Hudleston, 1953) in Brother Juniper's heart, forgave him and delivered the rest of the pig to the brothers.

== &lt;span id="Holy fool"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Eastern Christianity ==
[[File:Misha-samuil-1.png|thumb|upright|{{ill|Misha Samuil|ru|Миша-Самуил}}]]

The Holy Fool or ''yuródivyy'' (юродивый) is the [[Russia]]n version of  foolishness for Christ, a peculiar form of [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[asceticism]]. The yurodivy is a Holy Fool, one who acts intentionally foolish in the eyes of men. The term implies behaviour "which is caused neither by mistake nor by feeble-mindedness, but is deliberate, irritating, even provocative."&lt;ref name="Ivanov, S. A. 2006"&gt;Ivanov, S. A. (2006) "Holy Fools in Byzantium and Beyond." Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Holy Fools in Byzantium and Beyond'', Ivanov described "holy fool" as a term for a person who "feigns insanity, pretends to be silly, or who provokes shock or outrage by his deliberate unruliness." &lt;ref name="Ivanov, S. A. 2006"/&gt; He explained that such conduct qualifies as holy foolery only if the audience believes that the individual is sane, moral, and pious. The Eastern Orthodox Church holds that holy fools voluntarily take up the guise of insanity in order to conceal their perfection from the world, and thus avoid praise.&lt;ref name="Ivanov, S. A. 2006"/&gt;

Some characteristics that were commonly seen in holy fools were going around half-naked, being [[homeless]], speaking in [[riddles]],  being believed to be [[clairvoyant]] and a [[prophet]], and occasionally being disruptive and challenging to the point of seeming [[immoral]] (though always to make a point).

Ivanov argued that, unlike in the past, modern yurodivy are generally aware that they look pathetic in others’ eyes. They strive to pre-empt this contempt through exaggerated self-humiliation, and following such displays they let it be known both that their behaviors were staged and that their purpose was to disguise their superiority over their audience.&lt;ref name="Ivanov, S. A. 2006"/&gt;

Fools for Christ are often given the title of [[Beatification|Blessed]] ([[wikt:блаженный|блаженный]]), which does not necessarily mean that the individual is less than a saint, but rather points to the blessings from God that they are believed to have acquired.
[[Image:NesterovMV NaRusi206x483GTG.jpg|thumb|''The Soul of the People''. Notice the old man in the background, with his arms stretched to heaven, painting by [[Mikhail Nesterov]]]]

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] records [[Saint Isidora|Isidora Barankis]] of Egypt (d. 369) among the first Holy Fools. However, the term was not popularized until the coming of [[Simeon the Holy Fool|Symeon of Emesa]], who is considered to be a [[patron saint]] of holy fools.&lt;ref name="Parry 1999, p. 233"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kopc"&gt;''Holy Foolishness, by the Rev. Frank Logue, King of Peace Episcopal Church, Kingsland, Georgia, February 2002''&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek, the term for Holy Fool is ''salos''.

The practice was recognised in the [[hagiography]] of fifth-century Byzantium, and it was extensively adopted in [[Muscovite Russia]], probably in the 14th century. The [[Insanity|madness]] of the  Holy Fool  was ambiguous, and could be real or simulated.  He (or she) was believed to have been divinely inspired, and was therefore able to say truths which others could not, normally in the form of indirect allusions or [[parable]]s.  He had a particular status in regard to the [[Tsar]]s, as a figure not subject to earthly control or judgement.

[[File:Nesterov SaintRussia.JPG|thumb|left|Holy Rus, by [[Mikhail Nesterov]] ]]
The first reported fool-for-Christ in Russia was [[Procopius of Ustyug|St. Procopius]] (Prokopiy), who came from the lands of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to [[Novgorod]], then moved to [[Ustyug]], pretending to be a fool and leading an ascetic way of life (slept naked on church-porches, prayed throughout the whole night, received food only from poor people). He was abused and beaten, but finally won respect and became venerated after his death.&lt;ref name="prm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/article_205.html |title=Foolishness-for-Christ, Article on Pravmir Portal |publisher=Pravmir.com |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] numbers 36 ''yurodivye'' among its [[saint]]s, starting from [[Procopius of Ustyug]], and most prominently [[Basil Fool for Christ]], who gives his name to [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in [[Moscow]]. One of the best-known modern examples in the Russian Church is perhaps [[Xenia of Saint Petersburg|St Xenia of Saint Petersburg]].

== Common phrases or epithets ==
[[Image:Pavel Svedomskiy 011.jpg|thumb|upright|''A God's Fool'', by [[Pavel Svedomsky]]]]

===Crazy for God ===
"Crazy for God" is an expression sometimes used in the United States and other English speaking countries to convey a similar idea to "Foolishness for Christ."  It has been especially connected to the [[Unification Church of the United States]].  In ''The Way of God's Will'', a collection of sayings popular among church members, Unification Church founder [[Sun Myung Moon]] is quoted as saying: "We leaders should leave the tradition that we have become crazy for God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unification.org/ucbooks/WofGW/wogw1-03.htm |title='&amp;#39;The Way of God's Will'&amp;#39; Chapter 3. Leaders |publisher=Unification.org |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Unification Church critic [[Christopher Edwards (author)|Christopher Edwards]] titled a memoir about his experiences in the six months he spent as a church member: ''Crazy for God: The nightmare of cult life.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/oct1979/v36-3-booknotes20.htm |title=Crazy for God |publisher=Theologytoday.ptsem.edu |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, author [[Frank Schaeffer]] titled his autobiography ''Crazy for God: How I Grew Up as One of the Elect, Helped Found the Religious Right, and Lived to Take All (or Almost All) of It Back''. It tells of his upbringing as the son of a well-known [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] minister and his later conversion to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/ink/schaeffer.html |title=Ink Q &amp; A Frank Schaeffer |publisher=Powells.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205145816/http://www.powells.com/ink/schaeffer.html |archivedate=2011-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year [[Stephen Prothero]], author and chairman of [[Boston University]]'s Department of Religion, wrote in the ''Harvard Divinity Bulletin'': "I am crazy for people who are crazy for God: people nearly as inscrutable to me as divinity, who leave wives and children to become forest-dwelling [[Buddhist monk|monks]] in [[Thailand]], who wander [[nude|naked]] across the belly of [[India]] in search of self-realization, who [[Glossolalia|speak in tongues]] and [[Snake handling|take up serpents]] in [[Appalachia]] because the Bible says they can."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/articles/prothero.html Belief Ubracketed: A Case for the Religion Scholar to Reveal More of Where He or She Is Coming From] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211224000/http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/articles/prothero.html |date=2009-02-11 }}, ''Harvard Divinity Bulletin'', November 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On fire for God ===
"On fire for God" is an expression often used in respect of persons who are engaged in serving God in such a way that their activities reflect a 'burning' desire to fulfil their calling.  This often manifests itself in what might be regarded as burning passion, such as evangelising (preaching) on the streets.

==Modern theology==
One of the more recent works in theology is ''Fools for Christ''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fools_for_Christ.html?id=qwtjGQAACAAJ |title=Fools for Christ - Jaroslav Pelikan - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jaroslav Pelikan]]. Through six essays dealing with various "fools," Pelikan explores the motif of fool-for-Christ in relationship to the problem of understanding the numinous:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Holy is too great and too terrible when encountered directly for men of normal sanity to be able to contemplate it comfortably. Only those who cannot care for the consequences run the risk of the direct confrontation of the Holy. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The yurodivy in art and literature ==
There are a number of references to the yurodivy in 19th century Russian literature. The holy fool Nikolka is a character in [[Pushkin]]'s play ''[[Boris Godunov (play)|Boris Godunov]]'' and [[Boris Godunov (opera)|Mussorgsky's opera]] based on the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shostakovich and Stalin: The Extraordinary Relationship Between the Great ...|first= Solomon |last=Volkov |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x__ntDIlYGYC&amp;pg=PT8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= St Petersburg: A Cultural History|first= Solomon |last=Volkov|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6JheQS-7drEC&amp;pg=PA86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pushkin's narrative poem ''[[The Bronze Horseman]]'', the character of Evgenii is based in the tradition of the holy fools in his confrontation with the animated statue of [[Peter the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenshiels|first1=Gary|title=Pushkin and the Genres of Madness: the Masterpieces of 1833|date=2003|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pushkin_and_the_Genres_of_Madness.html?id=H0z7egVzKZ8C&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The yurodivy appears several times in the novels of [[Dostoevsky]]. ''[[The Idiot]]'' explores the ramifications of placing a holy fool (the compassionate and insightful epileptic [[Prince Myshkin]]) in a secular world dominated by vanity and desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grayling|first1=A.C.|title=The Heart of Things: Applying Philosophy to the 21st century|date=2010|publisher=Hachette UK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjRTDxZ-xXYC&amp;pg=PT178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph Frank "though the gentlemanly and well-educated prince bears no external resemblance to these eccentric figures, he does possess their traditional gift of spiritual insight, which operates instinctively, below any level of conscious awareness or doctrinal commitment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank|first1=Joseph|title=Dostoevsky: A Writer in His Time|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=579}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Demons]]'', the madwoman Marya Lebyadkina displays many of the attributes of the holy fool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank|first1=Joseph|title=Dostoevsky: A Writer in His Time|date=2010|page=658}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do the characters of Sofya Marmeladova and Lizaveta in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimandnancyforest.com/2008/09/the-way-of-the-holy-fools/|title=The Way of the Holy Fools|date=22 September 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another fool-for-Christ is Grisha in [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy's]] ''Childhood. Boyhood. Youth''.&lt;ref name="prm"/&gt; Callis and Dewey described Grisha as follows:

:He was an awesome figure: emaciated, barefoot and in rags, with eyes that "looked right through you" and long, shaggy hair. He always wore chains around his neck...Neighborhood children would sometimes run after him, laughing and calling out his name. Older persons, as a rule, viewed Grisha with respect and a little fear, especially when he suffered one of his periodic seizures and began to shout and rant. At such times adult bystanders would crowd around and listen, for they believed that the Holy Spirit was working through him.&lt;ref name="Birukoff, Paul 1911"&gt;Birukoff, Paul &amp; Tolstoy, Leo. (1911) “Leo Tolstoy: His Life and Work.” New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grisha's abnormal social conduct, seizures, and rants were common behaviors amongst holy fools. The esteem expressed by adults was also common. In his autobiography, Tolstoy expressed such esteem in reaction to overhearing Grisha praying:

:“Oh Great Christian Grisha! Your faith was so strong that you felt the nearness of God; your love was so great that words flowed of their own will from your lips, and you did not verify them by reason. And what high praise you gave to the majesty of God, when, not finding any words, you prostrated yourself on the ground.”&lt;ref name="Birukoff, Paul 1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1584">'''Francisco de Avila''' (1573&amp;ndash;1647) was a [[South American]] [[priest]] and early student of native customs.

Avila was born in Cuzco.  He was [[curate]] or [[vicar]] in the [[Huarochirí Province|province of Huarochiri]] of [[Peru]], later curate at [[Huánuco]], and finally [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of the Church of La Plata (now [[Sucre]]), in [[Bolivia]]. He was one of the most active investigators of Indian rites and customs of his time.  He died in Lima.

==Works==
In 1608 he wrote a treatise of the "''Errors, False Gods, and Other Superstitions of the Indians of the Provinces of Huarochiri, Mama, and Chaclla''", of which only the first six chapters are known to exist and have been translated into English. It is a contribution to the knowledge of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Peruvian Indians]] and their lore.

In 1611 Avila wrote a report on the Indians of Huánuco in eastern Peru, of which [[Huarochirí Manuscript|the unpublished manuscript]] is extant. These works contain apologetics on the destruction of fetishes and other objects of worship, for example by [[Pablo José Arriaga]].

A '''haltija''' (haltia) is a [[spirit]], [[gnome]], or [[elf]]-like creature in [[Finnish mythology]] that guards, helps, or protects something or somebody. The word is possibly derived from the Gothic ''*haltijar'', which referred to the original settler of a homestead—although this is not the only possible etymology. It can also be derived from the Finnish verb ''hallita'', which means 'to rule', 'to command', 'to master'.

The word is also used in modern Finnish to mean, depending on the context, holder, occupant, lord, master, [[owner-occupier]], occupier, possessor, bearer, or owner.

There are many different kinds of haltijas. There are, for example water haltijas and forest haltijas. Even graveyards have their own haltijas (''kalman väki'', "death folk").

Human settlements also have haltijas. One type is the '''tonttu''' or '''maan haltija''' (land haltija). The tonttu is the Finnish version of the Swedish [[tomte]]. The Finnish tonttu and the Swedish tomte are related to the words ''tontti'' (Finnish) and ''tomt'' (Swedish), which both mean [[Lot (real estate)|building lot]] and [[building site]]. (Later, such local spirits are also referred to as a ''tomtegubbe'' ["old man of the homestead"] in Swedish). The kotihaltija (home elf, home gnome) is the tonttu who lives in every home. He takes care of the house, and it is important to treat him with respect. The saunatonttu lives in the [[sauna]] and protects it but also makes sure that people do not behave improperly in it. ''Joulutonttu'' is Finnish for Christmas elf. Unlike the Christmas elves in some countries, the Finnish joulutonttu doesn't have pointy ears.

There are even personal haltijas, which are protective spirits similar to angels in Christianity. One of them is called "luonto", which means "nature".

In [[Estonian mythology]] a similar being is called ''haldjas'', whereas the term used in Estonian for a holder, master, or owner-occupier is ''haldaja''.

Haltija is sometimes written as ''haltia''. Nowadays this more old-fashioned spelling often refers to the [[elves]] in [[Tolkien]]'s books or other fantasy literature.

==Folk and power==
Some haltijas are divided into races or folks, which are called '''väki'''. This word means either "strength/power" or "group/corps (of people)" (e.g.  ''väkiviina'' "strong liquor", ''sotaväki'' "the military"), of which the meaning of "power" is etymologically older; the meaning of ''väki'' meaning "folk" is the result of the anthropomorphication of abstract concepts like "kalman väki", ''the power of dead spirits''.  There are different kind of väkis of haltijas, like veden väki (water folk) or metsän väki (forest folk). However, väki should not be simply translated to mean folk or race, because it also has another meaning at the same time: it means folk, and it means (magical) powers. Sometimes väki is more like folk, in which case it refers to a group of individual haltijas. Sometimes väki is more like magical power, and then it means the qualities of certain environments and elements, or powers that can cause or cure diseases. Usually both meanings are true at the same time. Magical powers are caused by groups of haltijas. For example, if someone gets sick while swimming, this could be caused by väki of water that become attached to a person. In this sense väki is more like a magical power of water that can make people ill, but it can also mean that very small or invisible haltija-spirits are attached to a person. However, if someone goes fishing, (s)he can ask for väki of water to bring fish by calling individual haltijas belonging to that väki by their names. In the latter case väki is understood more as a folk, but it can be seen also as a (luck bringing) magical force.

Some väkis of haltijas:
*Väki of [[forest]] (metsän väki) means haltijas of forest. Their leader is Tapio, the king of  forest. It also means magical powers of the forest.
*Väki of [[water]] (veden väki) means haltijas of water. Their leader is Ahti, the king of the sea. Veden väki is also the magical power of water that can make people sick or heal them.
*Väki of woman (naisen väki) is usually understood as special magical powers of women.
*Väki of [[death]] (kalman väki) means ghosts and spirits, but also the magical power that can be found in a graveyard. This power can make people ill and it can also be used against other people.
*Väki of [[fire]]: (tulen väki) means spirits of fire, but also the destructive forces of fire and healing power of warm air, for example in a [[sauna]].
*Väki of mountain (vuoren väki) usually means the haltijas of hills and big stones.
*Väki of [[wood]] (puun väki) means the race of haltijas of trees, and also the power of wooden material, which can cause pain if you are hit by a wooden object.
*Väki of [[iron]] (raudan väki) means haltijas of iron. They can hurt people who are hit by bladed weapons. Väki of iron can also be commanded to heal the wounds they have given.

Haltija väkis of different environments and materials were thought to be in conflict with each other. For example, when wood is burned, it is an assault in which väki of fire is beating väki of wood. Väki of fire can be used to scare other väki away. For example, if you were made ill by väki of water, that attached to you while you were swimming, this väki and the illness could be removed in sauna, which had lots of väki of fire.

==Haltija in literature==
*One of the main characters in [[Sphere of Power]] by [[Shanon Mayer]] is a haltija.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Shanon|title=Sphere of Power|year=2011|publisher=BookLocker|location=Maine|isbn=978-1-61434-256-4|pages=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haneullim''' or '''Haneulnim''' (하늘님 "Heavenly King"), also spelled '''Hananim''' (하나님) or '''Hanunim''' (하느님), '''Hwanin''' (환인) or '''Hanin''' (한인), also called '''[[Shangdi|Sangje]]''' ("Highest Deity") or '''Sangjenim''' ("Kingly Highest Deity"), also known simply as '''Haneul''' ("Heaven") or '''[[Tian|Cheon]]''' (천 "Heaven", in Sino-Korean), or '''Cheonsin''' ("God of Heaven"),{{sfnb|Hong|2009|p=39}} is the concept of supreme [[God]] peculiar to [[Korean shamanism]],{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=18}} and religions rooted in Korean shamanism (including [[Cheondoism]] and [[Jeungsanism]]).{{sfnb|Hong|2009|p=39}} In some of these religions he is called '''Okhwang Sangje''' ("Highest Deity the [[Jade Emperor]]").

''Haneullim'' is etymologically explained as meaning "source [im, in] of all being [haneul, hwan]", indicating the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute principle]] of the universe, the supreme being, or the supreme mind.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=18}} According to scholars, the belief in this supreme God is at the heart of all religions in Korea, being deeply rooted in the mind of the Korean people.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=18}}

==Dangun myth==
[[File:Dangun Wanggeom.jpg|thumb|Image of Dangun.]]
{{Further|Dangun}}
Dangun is traditionally considered to be the son of ''Hwanin'', the "Heavenly King", and founder of the Korean nation.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=13}} This myth is reputed to be older than that of the mother goddess.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=13}} Myths similar to that of Dangun are found in [[Ainu people|Ainu]]{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=20}} and Siberian cultures.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=21}}

The myth starts with prince ''[[Hwanung]]'' ("Heavenly Prince"), son of ''Hwanin''. The prince asked his father to grant him governance over Korea.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} Hwanin accepted, and Hwanung was sent to Earth bearing three Heavenly Seals and accompanied by three thousand followers.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} The prince arrived under the [[tree of life|holy tree]] of [[sandalwood]] (''Sintansu'' 신단수, 神檀樹){{sfnb|Lee|2010s|pp=10–13}} on the holy mountain, where he founded his holy city.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}}

At the time of his reign, ''[[Ungnyeo]]'' or ''Ungnye'' (웅녀, 熊女){{sfnb|Lee|2010s|pp=10–13}}—who was a she-[[bear]]—and a [[tiger]] were living in a cave near the holy city, praying earnestly that their wish to become part of mankind might be fulfilled.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} ''Ungnyeo'' patiently endured weariness and hunger, and after twenty-one days she was transformed into a beautiful woman, while the tiger ran away for it could not tolerate the effort.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} The woman ''Ungnyeo'' was overjoyed, and visiting the sandalwood city she prayed that she might become the mother of a child.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}}

Ungnye's wish was fulfilled, so that she became the queen and gave birth to a prince who was given the royal name of ''Dangun'', the "Sandalwood King".{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}} Dangun reigned as the first human king of Korea, giving to his kingdom the name of [[Joseon]], "Land of the Morning Calm".{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=14}}

Dangun was the first shaman, intermediary between mankind and ''Haneullim'', to whom he worshipped and prayed on the behalf of his people.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=17}} The importance of the worship of ancestors and gods reside in their being the mean of communion with the supreme God, ''Haneullim''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=17}} According to some scholars, the name ''Dangun'' is related to the Siberian ''[[Tengri]]'' ("Heaven"),{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=17–18}} while the bear is a symbol of the [[Big Dipper]] (i.e. [[Ursa Major]]), itself a symbol of the supreme God in many Eurasian cultures, including [[Chinese theology|Chinese theological thought]].{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' but especially Vol. I, pp. 143, 154}} Later in the myth, Dangun becomes the ''[[Sansin]]'', the "Mountain God" (metaphorically of civilising growth, prosperity).{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=16–18}}

==Haneullim's threefoldness==
[[File:Korea-Samseonggung 11-07358.JPG|thumb|Grounds of the ''[[Samseonggung]]'', a shrine for the worship of Hwanin, [[Hwanung]], and [[Dangun]].]]
Korean theology has a [[triple deity|triune idea of God]] expressed in the myth of [[Dangun]], the third and fully incarnated form of ''Hwanin''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=18}} With Dangun as ''[[Sansin]]'' ("Mountain God"), the divine trinity of Korean religion represents the three stages of ''Haneullim''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s manifesation.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=18}} ''Hwanin'' represents the [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] source, with "''haneul''", "''hwan''" indicating "all being" or "Heaven", and "''im''", "''in''" the cause of it.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=18}} ''[[Hwanung]]'', the second hypostasis of ''Hwanin'', is the god of the middle realm, between Heaven and Earth.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=18}}

Dangun, the "Sandalwood King", is the god of the Earth.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=18}} In the role of ''Sansin'', he represents the [[axis mundi|axle of the world]] around which all things spin and which links up to Heaven.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=18–19}} In the place where Heaven incarnated, the "holy mountain" of civilisation was established, and the [[sandalwood]] became the "[[tree of life|holy tree]]". The symbols of the cosmic mountain and tree are common to all shamanic experiences, as highlighted by [[Mircea Eliade]] in his studies.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=19}}

In the Korean tradition, the threefold conception of divinity is also explained in terms of: God-the-Father, creator of the [[universe]] (''Hwanin''); God-the-Teacher, the order of nature (''Hwanung''); and God-the-King, the supreme God incarnated by the human king (''Dangun''), who governs his kingdom according to the laws of nature, granting well-being to his citizens.{{sfnb|Lee|2010s|pp=13–14}}

The '''history of the [[Jews]] in [[Tilburg]]''', [[Netherlands]], did not start until 1767, when a Jewish citizen of the town [[Oisterwijk]] was given permission to settle in Tilburg, despite objections from the city council. Several Jewish families also succeeded in settling in Tilburg soon afterwards in 1791.

Because of a growing industry more and more Jews started to settle in Tilburg. Most came from Oisterwijk, where the textile industry was going through a period of decline. In 1820, a synagogue was built. However, due to extensive growth of the community, a larger synagogue was eventually built in 1873-1874. In 1855, a cemetery was inaugurated for the Jewish community.

Many of the Tilburg Jews were active in the textile industry and trade. In contrast to other Jewish communities in the so-called "mediene" (the Jewish communities outside the major cities in the western part of the country, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[The Hague]]), the community did not decrease in numbers due to the favorable economic position of Tilburg.

The 1930s saw a growth of the Jewish community because of a small influx of German-Jewish refugees. After the Netherlands had been overrun by the Nazis, a separate Jewish school was established in 1941. A [[Jewish Council]] was established in the summer of 1942. Between August 1942 and April 1943, the majority of Tilburg Jews were deported and subsequently killed. A number of Jews managed to hide. The interior of the synagogue was completely destroyed. An estimated 130 Tilburg Jews were killed in the [[Holocaust]].

After the war the community was re-established. The synagogue was reinaugurated in 1949. It was given to the local government in 1976, after which it was given a social and cultural function. It was re-established as a synagogue for the Liberal Jewish community in 1998.

In 1981, the Liberal Jewish Community of Brabant "Aree Hanegev" was founded, serving Liberal Jews in the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Zeeland]] and parts of [[South Holland]], as well as Jews from the Belgian provinces of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]] and [[Flemish Brabant]].

Number of Jews in Tilburg:

* '''1809'''  -  26
* '''1840'''  -  126
* '''1869'''  -  112
* '''1899'''  -  142
* '''1930'''  -  171
* '''1938'''  -  259 (including 57 German Jews and 21 Eastern-European Jews)
* '''1951'''  -  120
* '''1971'''  -  45
* '''1998'''  -  13

The '''Iele''' are feminine [[mythical creatures]] in [[Romanian mythology]]. There are several differing descriptions of their characteristics. Often they are described as virgin fairies (''zâne'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]), with great seductive power over men, with magic skills and attributes similar to [[Nymphs]], [[Naiads]] and [[Dryads]] found in [[Greek mythology]]. They are also similar to the [[Samodiva (mythology)|Samodivas]] in [[Bulgaria]]

==Locations==
The Iele are said to live in the sky, in forests, in caves, on isolated mountain cliffs and in marshes, and reported to have been seen bathing in the springs or at crossroads. From this point of view, the Iele are similar to the Ancient Greek [[Hecate]], a three headed goddess of [[Thracian]] origin, who guards crossroads.

==Activities==
They mostly appear at night by moonlight, as dancing [[Hora (dance)|Hora]]s, in secluded areas such as glades, the tops of certain trees ([[maple]]s, [[walnut]] trees), ponds, river sides, crossroads or abandoned fireplaces, dancing naked, with their breasts almost covered by their disheveled hair, with bells on their ankles and carrying candles. In almost all of these instances, the Iele appear to be incorporeal. Rarely, they are dressed in [[chain mail|chain mail coat]]s. The effect of their specific dance, the [[Hora (dance)|Hora]] is similar to the dances of the [[Bacchantes]].

==Scorching==
The place where they had danced would after remain [[carbonization|carbonized]], with the grass incapable of growing on the trodden ground, and with the leaves of the surrounding trees scorched. Later, when grass would finally grow, it would have a red or dark-green color, the animals would not eat it, but instead mushrooms would thrive on it.

==Names==
[[Dimitrie Cantemir]] describes the Iele as ‘’Nymphs of the air, in love especially with young men".&lt;ref&gt;Cantemir, Dimitrie. ''[[:s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]]'' (1726)&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of these beliefs is unknown. Incidentally, the noun ''iele'' is phonetically close to the feminine plural form of the Romanian word for "they". Their real names are secret and inaccessible, and are commonly replaced with nicknames based on their characteristics. The names based on epithets are: Iele, Dânse, Drăgaice, [[Vâlvă|Vâlve]], Iezme, Izme, Irodiţe, Rusalii, Nagode, [[Vântoase]], Domniţe, Măiestre, Frumoase, Muşate, Fetele Codrului, Împărătesele Văzduhului, Zânioare, Sfinte de noapte, Şoimane, Mândre, Fecioare, Albe, Hale, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Kernbach, ''Dicţionar de mitologie generală'', Editura Albatros, Bucureşti, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; But there are also personal names which appear: Ana, Bugiana, Dumernica, Foiofia, Lacargia, Magdalina, Ruxanda, Tiranda, Trandafira, Rudeana, Ruja, Păscuţa, Cosânzeana, Orgisceana, Lemnica, Roşia, Todosia, Sandalina, Margalina, Savatina, Rujalina, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Kernbach, ibidem&lt;/ref&gt; These names must not be used randomly, as they may be the basis for dangerous enchantments. It is believed that every [[witch]] knows nine of these pseudonyms, from which she makes combinations, and which are the basis for spells.

==Character==
The Iele are said not to be  solitary creatures, but gather in groups in the air, where they can fly with or without wings; they can travel with incredible speeds, either on their own, or with chariots of fire. 
The Iele appear sometimes with bodies, at other times only as immaterial spirits. They are young and beautiful, voluptuous immortals, their frenzy causing delirium in onlookers, and with bad tempers, but not being necessarily evil. They come in groups of three or seven. This version is mostly found in [[Oltenia]], were three Iele are considered the daughters of [[Alexander the Great]], called Catrina, Zalina and Marina.

===Sometimes evil===
They are not generally considered evil genii: they resort to revenge only when they are provoked, offended, seen while they dance, when people step on the trodden ground left behind by their dance, sleep under a tree which the Iele consider as their property, drink from the springs or wells used by them. Terrible punishments are inflicted upon the ones who refuse their invitation to dance, or the ones who mimic their movements. The one who randomly hears their songs becomes instantly mute. A main characteristic is their beautiful voices which are used to enchant their listeners, just like the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s from ancient Greek mythology. Invisible to humans, there are however certain moments when they can be seen by mortals, such as when they dance at night. When this happens, they abduct the victim, punishing the "guilty" one with magical spells, after they previously caused him to fall into sleep with the sounds and the vertigo of the frenetic Hora, which they dance around their victim, who is abducted, to disappear forever without a trace. 
 
===Vengeance===
The Iele are also believed to be agents of revenge for [[God]] or of the [[Devil]], having the right to avenge in the name of their employers. When they are called upon to act, they hound their victims into the center of their dance, until they die in a furor of madness or torment. In this [[hypostasis (linguistics)|hypostasis]], the Iele are similar to the Ancient Greek [[Erinyes]] and the Roman [[Furies]].

==Appeasing the Iele==
To please the Iele, people dedicated festival days to them: the [[Rusalia Week|Rusaliile]], the Stratul, the Sfredelul or Bulciul Rusaliilor, the nine days after the [[Easter]], the Marina etc. Anyone not respecting these holidays was said to suffer the revenge of the Iele: men and women who work during these days would be lifted in spinning [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], people and cattle would suffer mysterious deaths or become paralyzed and crippled, hail would fall, rivers would flood, trees would wither, and houses would catch fire.

People also invented cures against the Iele, either preventive or [[exorcism|exorcistic]] in nature: [[garlic]] and [[mugwort]] worn around the waist, in the bosom, or hung from the hat; or hanging the skull of a horse on a pole in front of the house. The most important cure is the dance of [[Călușari]]. This custom was the subject of episode of the popular TV series, [[The X-Files]] (see [[The X-Files (season 2)]])

==Comparison with other mythologies==
The same common Indo-European mythological base is suggested by the close resemblance with the Nordic [[Elves]], youthful feminine humanoid spirits of great beauty living in forests and other natural places, underground, or in wells and springs; having as a sacred tree the same maple tree; and with magical powers, such as having the ability to cast spells with their circle dances. The elves also leave a kind of circle where they had danced, the ''älvdanser'' ("elf dances") or ''älvringar'' ("elf circles"). Typically, this circle also consisted of a [[fairy ring mushroom|ring of small mushrooms]]. Arguably, Iele are the Romanian equivalent of the [[Fairy|fairies]] of other cultures, like the [[nymphs]] of Greek and Roman mythology, the [[Slavic fairies|vili]] from Slavic mythology, and the Irish [[sídhe]].

==Modern sightings==
There is some discussion on the topic that an episode of "Destination Truth"; which had a follow up episode may have encountered Iele. The Romanian forest episode, in the episode they believed they were encountering ghosts or aliens. Some viewers went to the online boards for the show discussing that the events and behavior closely tied with the Iele.

'''Incarnation''' literally means ''embodied in flesh'' or ''taking on flesh''. It refers to the [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and birth of a [[Sentience|sentient]] being who is the material manifestation of an [[entity]], [[god]] or force whose original nature is immaterial. In its religious context the word is used to mean the descent from [[Heaven]] of a [[god]], [[Deity|deity]], or divine being in human/animal form on Earth.

{{further|God in the Bahá'í Faith}}

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], God is not seen to be incarnated into this world and is not seen to be part of creation as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures.&lt;ref name="saq"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1981 |title = Some Answered Questions |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-190-6 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-53.html.iso8859-1#gr5 | pages = 202–203 |origyear = 1904-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifestations of God are also not seen as an incarnation of God, but are instead understood to be like a perfect mirror reflecting the attributes of God onto this [[materialism|material world]].&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hatcher118"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | page = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{see also|Rebirth (Buddhism)}}

Buddhism is a non-theistic religion, it denies the concept of a creator god or any incarnation of a creator god. Buddhism, however, does teach the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] doctrine and asserts that living beings are reborn, endlessly, reincarnating as [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] (gods), demi-gods, human beings, animals, hungry ghosts or hellish beings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Trainor | first =Kevin | year =2004 | title =Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide | publisher =Oxford University Press | isbn =978-0-19-517398-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC|pages=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a cycle of ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'' that stops only for those who reach [[nirvana]] (nibbana).&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=32–33, 38–39, 46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], an enlightened spiritual teacher ([[lama]]) is believed to reincarnate, and is called a ''[[tulku]]''. According to Tulku Thondup,&lt;ref name="TThondup_Incarnation"&gt;Tulku Thondup (2011) Incarnation: The History and Mysticism of the Tulku Tradition of Tibet. Boston: Shambhala.&lt;/ref&gt; there are three main types of tulkus.  They are the emanations of buddhas, the manifestations of highly accomplished adepts, and rebirths of highly virtuous teachers or spiritual friends.  There are also authentic secondary types as well which include unrecognized tulkus, blessed tulkus, and tulkus fallen from the path.

==Christianity==
[[File:Meister von Daphni 002.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christ Pantocrator]], God incarnate in the [[Christianity|Christian faith]], shown in a mosaic from [[Daphni Monastery|Daphni]], [[Greece]], ca. 1080-1100.]]
{{main|Incarnation (Christianity)|}}

Logos-Sarx-Schema uses to explain incarnation of the [[Son of God]]. The incarnation of [[Christ]] is a central Christian doctrine that God became flesh, assumed a human nature, and became a man in the form of [[Jesus]], the [[Son of God]] and the second person of the [[Trinity]]. This foundational Christian position holds that the divine nature of the Son of God was perfectly united with human nature in one divine Person, [[Jesus]], making him both truly God and truly man. The theological term for this is [[hypostatic union]]: the Second Person of the Trinity, [[God the Son]], became flesh when he was miraculously conceived in the womb of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/284611/Incarnation|title=Incarnation|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical passages traditionally referenced in connection with the doctrine of the Incarnation include {{Bibleref2|John|3:1-21}}, {{bibleref||Colossians|2:9}}, and {{Bibleref2|Philippians|2:7-8}}.

[[File:Avatars.jpg|thumb|250px|Ten incarnations of [[Vishnu]] ([[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Vamana]], [[Krishna]], [[Kalki]], [[Buddha]], [[Parshurama]], [[Rama]] &amp; [[Narasimha]]). Painting from [[Jaipur]], now at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]]
In [[Hinduism]], incarnation refers to its rebirth doctrine, and in its theistic traditions to ''[[avatar]]''.&lt;ref name=kimctap192&gt;{{cite book|author=Sebastian C. H.

Neither the [[Vedas]] nor the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] ever mentions the word ''avatar'' as a noun.&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel E Bassuk |title=Incarnation in Hinduism and Christianity: The Myth of the God-Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3iwCwAAQBAJ |year=1987|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-08642-9 |pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verb roots and form, such as ''avatarana'', do appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as "action of descending", but not as an incarnated person (avatara).{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=415-417}} The related verb ''avatarana'' is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as "laying down the burden of man" suffering from the forces of evil.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=415-417}}

The term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar/&gt; The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to empower the good and fight against evil, uses other terms such as the word ''sambhavāmi'' in verse 4.6 and the word ''tanu'' in verse 9.11 of the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}} as well as other words such as ''akriti'' and ''rupa'' elsewhere.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=405-409}} It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=424, also 405-409, 414-417}} The incarnation idea proliferates thereafter, in the [[Purana|Puranic]] stories for many deities, and with ideas such as ''ansha-avatar'' or partial embodiments.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}}&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Avatar" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

While Avatars of other deities such as [[Ganesha]] and [[Shiva]] are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Shiva" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 635&lt;/ref&gt; The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=laiengavatar&gt;{{cite book|author=Lai Ah Eng |title=Religious Diversity in Singapore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9MmNaNebFD8C |year=2008|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore|isbn=978-981-230-754-5|pages=221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ryanjonesavatar&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D.

===Avatar versus incarnation===
The translation of avatar as "incarnation" has been questioned by Christian theologists, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=107-109}}&lt;ref name="Matchett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matchett|first=Freda|title=Krishna, Lord or Avatara?: the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu|publisher=9780700712816|year=2001|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1oqTYiPeAxMC&amp;pg=PA4 | isbn=978-0-7007-1281-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in [[Christology]], presents the Christian concept of incarnation. This, state Oduyoye and Vroom, is different from the Hindu concept of avatar because avatars in Hinduism are unreal and is similar to [[Docetism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mercy Amba Oduyoye, H. M. Vroom, ''One gospel&amp;nbsp;– many cultures: case studies and reflections on cross-cultural theology'', Rodopi, 2003, {{ISBN|978-90-420-0897-7}}, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=108}}{{Refn|group=note|Buddha, a real person, is included as an avatar of Vishnu in many Hindu texts.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}}}} Avatars are true embodiments of spiritual perfection, one driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as [[Vaishnavism]].{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=108}}

==Islam==
Mainstream [[Islam]] completely rejects the doctrine of the incarnation of God in any form, as the concept is defined as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''. In mainstream Islam God is one and "neither begets nor is begotten".&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, (112:1-4).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|God in Judaism}}
{{see also|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies}}
Mainstream [[Judaism]] totally rejects any doctrine of an incarnation of God and absolutely rejects any concept of an incarnation of God in any form.&lt;ref&gt;L. Jacobs 1973 ''A Jewish Theology'' p. 24.  N.Y.: Berman House&lt;/ref&gt; However, some [[Hasidism|Hasidim]] believe in a somewhat similar concept. [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], a prominent [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] leader, said that the ''[[Rebbe]]'' is God's essence itself put into a body of a ''[[tzadik]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Likkutei Sichos'', Vol. 2, pp. 510-511.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serer religion==
[[Serer religion]] rejects any notion of an incarnation or manifestation of ''[[Roog (Serer deity)|Roog]]'' (the supreme deity in [[Serer religion]]), called [[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]].

As all other [[National Spiritual Assembly|National Spiritual Assemblies]], the '''[[Iran]]ian Spiritual Assembly''' has its clergy formation defined by Baha'u'llah in the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'', and its minimum number of members is 9.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]] Item 30, also Notes 49 and 50 on page 139&lt;/ref&gt; The first official clerical assembly was held in Tehran in 1897 under the supervision of Abdu'l - Bahá and by Haji Akhund of Ayadyan Amrullah . Due to the persecution of the Baha'is of Iran, the congregation assumed both local and national responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moojan Momen]], “Haji Akhund,” {{cite web |url=http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/akhund.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507053240/http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/akhund.htm |archivedate=2006-05-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian Spiritual Assembly was declared illegal in 1983 by the Islamic Republic of Iran in the aftermath of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;(In [[English language|English]]: "Statement by Attorney General of the Revolution ..." Kayhan Air, 1362/6/30) «اظهارات دادستان کل انقلاب...» کیهان هوایی، ۱۳۶۲/۶/۳۰&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the assemblage of the Iranian companions replaced responsibility for the administration of the Baha'i community.

== After the revolution ==

=== The first spiritual gathering of Iran ===

From the beginning of the revolution to the middle of 1980, members of the National Spiritual Assembly were continually harassed. In March 1358, Dr. Hussein Naji, a member of the National Spiritual Assembly, sent a telegram to Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], President [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], the Revolutionary Court Attorney General, Ayatollah Ali Ghodousi, and the Central Organization of the Medical System, in which several attacks on his residential home were armed And described his wife's arrest. He asked for advice on how to stop these violations. The complaint was not much considered.&lt;ref&gt;Translation "Dr. Naji's letter, member of the National Spiritual Assembly (1359) (NSA)" (available in the IHRDC Archives).&lt;/ref&gt; Each nine members of the National Spiritual Assembly, along with two Continental Consultative assistants, were arrested at a meeting of the National Spiritual Assembly at a private home, arrested by [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] members on August 30, 1980, without legal due diligence.&lt;ref&gt;"Report of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities", Thirty-Fourth Session, September 6, 1981. According to the "eighteenth world price", Rack. Subtitle 113, p. 257, those who disappeared were: Ms. [[Abdul Hussein Taslimi]], Houshang Mahmoudi, Ebrahim Rahmani, Dr. Hossein Naji, Mnvhar Ghaem Maghami, Ataullah Mogharpay, Yousef, Mrs. Bahi Naderi and Dr. Kambiz Sadeghzadeh. Two of the Continental Consultative Vice Presidents, Dr. Youssef Abbassian and Dr. Heshmatullah Rouhani also disappeared.&lt;/ref&gt; The families of the disappeared have persistently pursued the case since the disappearance of these individuals by Bahman Bahman in 1359, during a meeting with the Attorney General, Ayatollah Ghodousi, the head of the judiciary, Ayatollah [[Mohammad Beheshti]] and the Speaker of the Majles, [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]]. In a meeting on September 19, 1980, Rafsanjani confirmed that he had ordered the arrest of eleven Baha'is, but said that members of the family of the prisoners could not meet with them to complete the interrogation process. However, on March 17, 1359, Rafsanjani changed his mind and argued that the government had not arrested any members of the clerical organization, and instead attributed the disappearance of the Baha'is as unacceptably to an independent group.

The fate of nine members of the National Spiritual Assembly and two undeclared continental council assistants remain. Although there are reports that these people have been detained in Evin Prison for a short time, no news of them has been obtained since September 7, 1980, and now all are considered deceased.

=== The Second Iranian Spiritual Meeting ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Shortly after the disappearance of the members of the first national clerical assembly, Bahá'ís gathered to elect new members of the National Spiritual Assembly. The members of the second National Spiritual Assembly were all aware that they might have the fate of their predecessors.

The authorities quickly put the new members of the circle at the center of attention. Amnesty International reported that on December 22, 1981, Iranian authorities arrested eight members of nine members of the National Spiritual Assembly at the house of the believer.

The arrested were: Mehdi Amin Amin, Jalal Azizi, Ezatollah Foroughi, Jinous Nemat Mahmoudi, Mahmoud Majzoub, Ghost Allah Rouhani, Cyrus Roshani and Kamran Samimi. Mr. Momen and Farideh Samimi, the wife of Kamran Samimi, the secretary of the circle, who helped with the reception, were also arrested. Amnesty International issued a memorandum of urgent response and demanded a protest by post and telegram directly to the Supreme Court Chief Justice, [[Abdul-Karim Mousavi Ardebili]], Deputy Prime Minister, [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] and the Attorney General, Mehdi Rabbani Ameshchi, and requested information about the whereabouts of the detainees. , Was. Amnesty International also called for protests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Interior Minister.

On December 6, 1981, eight of the nine members of the second Iranian national clerical assembly were executed without trial. After the initial denial of these executions, Ayatollah Ardabili, the new head of the judiciary, eventually announced that eight of Baha'is were executed for spying for foreign powers. Ardebili told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that no religious motive was the reason for the executions. Late that same month, Ayatollah Mohammadi Gilani, head of the Revolutionary Courts of the Center, justified the death of the members of the second national clerical assembly as saying that membership in the Baha'i community was synonymous with spying for colonial organizations.

Although the executions were not officially announced, the Baha'is succeeded in discovering the burial places of the bodies of the Kafrīn Khavaran cemetery. Some bodies were buried in mass. The daughter of Jonas Nemat Mahmoudi, reported that some families were forced to pay the first cost of bullets spent on executions in order to know where the bodies of their loved ones were.

=== Third Iranian Spiritual Meeting ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
On September 7, 1982, the Revolutionary Prosecutor General, Seyyed [[Hossein Mousavi Tabrizi]], banned all Baha'i community activities in Iran. It ordered the dissolution of the third national clerical assembly and about 400 local clerical congresses. Membership in any organization or activity that encourages religion for non-Baha'is was severely prohibited. The government justified the issuance of this order by claiming that the Baha'i militants and conspirators were involved in spying activities.

In an interview, the government affiliate, Mousavi Tabrizi, the Attorney General of the Revolution, said: "They spy on others for provoking and disrupting certain things ... These issues have prompted us to immediately announce that all activities Collective and organizational forms of Baha'is are prohibited in Iran and so far prohibited, and the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the constitution have not recognized these "

Before the National Spiritual Assembly accepted the ban, he wrote to Iranian leaders in rejecting the allegations against the government. This letter points to harassment of Baha'is in the Islamic Republic and called on the Iranian people, the Islamic government and God to recognize their human rights. This letter was the last act of the National Spiritual Assembly before their rights as Iranian citizens and as human beings of voluntary dissolution.

Despite the voluntary dissolution, authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran continued to harass and terrorize the former members of the national and local clerical and other administrative authorities throughout Iran, as well as those who signed the open letter in defense of the Baha'is. In mid-1362, more than 500 Baha'is, most of whom were former members of the congregation or associated with these members, were arrested without charge.

Over time, seven members of the 3rd National Spiritual Assembly were arrested and eventually executed by the government.

=== Fellowship of Iran ===

All Baha'i elected and appointed institutions in Iran were banned from 1983 (1362), and most members of the three clerics murdered the Baha'i Faith. In the absence of these circles, a temporary assembly called "Fellowship of Iran" was formed with full knowledge of the government to address the early affairs of the 300-member community of Baha'is in Iran.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/persian/iran/2015/10/151015_l93_documentary_revolutionary_justice Jailed Iranian Baha'i should be released, not put on trial], says [[BBC Persian Television]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1983, all government officials have been aware of the existence of this group. In fact, in all these years, government officials regularly, though often informally, have been in contact with members of the delegation. The Baha'i community claims that it is said that Iranian supporters are an illegal group.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

The last members of this group who have been responsible for managing the Baha'i community in Iran are:

* [[Bahá'í 7|Fariba Kamal Abadi]]
* Jamalodin Khanjani
* Afif Naeemi
* Saeed Rezaei
* Behrooz Tavakoli
* Vahid Tizfam

[[Islam]] is a major [[religion]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], being the religion of the majority of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian population]]. [[Muslim]]s comprise 80-85% of the population of the [[West Bank]], when including [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlers]],&lt;ref name="West Bank"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/we.html West Bank].

===Early Islamization===
{{main|Muslim conquest of the Levant}}
[[File:Mohammad adil rais-Caliph Umar's empire at its peak 644.PNG|thumb|[[Umar|ʿUmar ibn al-Khattāb]]'s empire at its peak, 644]]

Islam was brought to the [[Palestine (region)|region of Palestine]] during the [[Early Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, when armies of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] under the leadership of [[Umar|ʿUmar ibn al-Khattāb]] defeated the armies of Persia and the armies of the Byzantine Empire and conquered [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Shaam]],{{efn|''[[Ash-Shām]]'' ({{lang-ar|اَلـشَّـام}}) is a region that is bordered by the [[Taurus Mountains]] of [[Anatolia]] in the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west, the [[Arabian Desert]] in the south, and [[Mesopotamia]] in the east.&lt;ref name="KillebrewSteiner2014"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Killebrew, A.

From the classical perspective however Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Arabian desert]]s, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s, there was actually a [[Syria Palestina|province of Syria]], with its capital at [[Antioch]], which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise, down the centuries, Syria like [[Arabia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] was no more than a geographic expression. In [[Islam]]ic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as [[Suriyah]], to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the [[Orontes river]], in the vicinity of the towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in [[Byzantine]] and Western European usage, and also in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] literature of some of the [[Eastern Christian]] churches, from which it occasionally found its way into [[Christian]] Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the [[Christianity|Christian]] Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of [[Western Europe]]. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in [[Muslim]] Arabic usage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]], [[North Africa]] and [[Iberian Peninsula|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/islamhistory.htm A Concise History of Islam and the Arabs] MidEastWeb.org&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Muslim Arab army attacked Jerusalem, held by the Byzantine Romans, in November, 636. For four months the siege continued. Ultimately, the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Sophronius, agreed to surrender Jerusalem to Caliph Umar in person. Caliph Umar, then at Medina, agreed to these terms and traveled to Jerusalem to sign the capitulation in the spring of 637. Sophronius also negotiated a pact with Caliph Umar, known as the Umariyya Covenant or Covenant of Omar, allowing for religious freedom for Christians in exchange for ''[[jizya]]h'' ({{lang-ar|جِـزْيَـة}}), a tax to be paid by conquered non-Muslims, called "dhimmis." Under Muslim Rule, the Christian and Jewish population of Jerusalem in this period enjoyed the usual tolerance given to non-Muslim theists.&lt;ref name="Catholic Jerusalem"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm | year=1910 | title=Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having accepted the surrender, Caliph Umar then entered Jerusalem with Sophronius "and courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious antiquities". When the hour for his prayer came, Umar was in the Anastasis, but refused to pray there, lest in the future the Muslims should use that as an excuse to break the treaty and confiscate the church. The Mosque of Omar, opposite the doors of the Anastasis, with the tall minaret, is known as the place to which he retired for his prayer.

[[Jerusalem]] is Islam's third holiest city after [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1815?_hi=33&amp;_pos=1 From the article on Islam in Palestine and Israel in Oxford Islamic Studies Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Koran]] does not clarify from where exactly [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] [[Isra and Mi'raj|ascended to Heaven]], the ''[[Temple Mount|Haram al Sharif]]'' (Temple Mount) of Jerusalem is believed by Muslims to be the location. According to the tradition, during a single night around the year 621 [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was carried by his mythological steed "[[Buraq|al-Burāq]]" from [[Mecca]] to the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]]. According to the tradition, from there he ascended to heaven where he spoke with [[Allah]]. This widely accepted Islamic belief is a source of the religious and spiritual importance of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and the adjacent [[al-Aqsa Mosque]].&lt;ref name="Abu Sway 2011"&gt;{{citation |author=Mustafa Abu Sway |title=The Holy Land, Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Qur’an, Sunnah and other Islamic Literary Source |url=http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Abusway_0.pdf |publisher=[[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728001911/http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Abusway_0.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historian [[James William Parkes]], during the first century after the Arab conquest (640–740), the caliph and governors of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and the [[Holy Land]] ruled entirely over Christian and Jewish subjects. He further states that apart from the [[Bedouin]] in the earliest days, the only Arabs west of the Jordan were the garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;James William Parkes, ''Whose Land? A History of the Peoples of Palestine'' (Penguin books, 1970), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop Arculf, whose account of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the 7th century, De Locis Sanctis, written down by the monk Adamnan, described reasonably pleasant living conditions of Christians in Palestine in the first period of Muslim rule.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The caliphs of Damascus (661–750) were tolerant princes who were on generally good terms with their Christian subjects. Many Christians (e.g. [[St. John Damascene]]) held important offices at their court. The [[Abbasid caliphs]] at Baghdad (753–1242), as long as they ruled Syria, were also tolerant of the Christians. Harun Abu-Ja-'afar, (786–809) sent the keys of the Holy Sepulchre to Charlemagne, who built a hospice for Latin pilgrims near the shrine.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Islamization under Abbasids and Fatimids===
[[File:2010-08_Ramallah_14.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mosque]] in [[Ramallah]]]]

Islam became the majority religion in Palestine in the [[9th century]], with acculturation of the locals into [[Arab]] identity and when [[Arabic language|Arabic]] became the ''[[lingua franca]]''.&lt;ref name="Tessler"&gt;Mark A. Tessler, ''A History of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict'', Indiana University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-253-20873-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3kbU4BIAcrQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=iSLAM+pALESTINE&amp;ei=Vvm9SqGtKIjwkQSWl_GIDw#v=onepage&amp;q=iSLAM%20pALESTINE&amp;f=false, M1 Google Print, p. 70].&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle East and North Africa regions in general and the region of Palestine in particular, indigenous peoples in various regions who until then spoke mostly [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Aramaic]]-Syriac, [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Berber languages|Berber]], began adopting the Arabic language and the [[Arabic culture|culture]] associated with it.

Rival dynasties and revolutions led to the eventual disunion of the Muslim world. During the 9th century, Palestine was conquered by the [[Fatimid dynasty]], centered in Egypt. During that time the region of Palestine became again the center of violent disputes followed by wars, since enemies of the Fatimid dynasty attempted to conquer the region. At that time, the [[Byzantine Empire]] continued trying to recapture the territories they previously lost to the Muslims, including Jerusalem. The Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem, who expressed their support to the Byzantine Empire were killed by the Muslim authorities. Palestine once again became a battleground as the various enemies of the Fatimids attacked. At the same time, the Byzantine Romans continued to attempt to regain their lost territories, including Jerusalem. Christians in Jerusalem who sided with the Romans were put to death for high treason by the ruling Muslims. In 969, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, John VII, was put to death for treasonable correspondence with the Romans.

During the Fatimid era, the cities of Jerusalem and [[Hebron]] became prime destinations for Sufi wayfarers.&lt;ref name=sufism /&gt; The creation of locally rooted [[Sufism|Sufi]]-inspired communities and institutions between 1000 and 1250 were part and parcel of the conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name=sufism&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_Q84XRO5X4C&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=sharafat+village+palestinian&amp;lr=&amp;cd=11#v=onepage&amp;q=sharafat&amp;f=false|title=Spiritual wayfarers, leaders in piety: Sufis and the dissemination of Islam in medieval Palestine|first1=Daphna|last1=Ephrat|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Harvard CMES|year=2008|isbn= 9780674032019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth Fatimid caliph, [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Caliph Al-Hakim]] (996–1021), who was believed to be "God made manifest" by the [[Druze]], destroyed the Holy Sepulchre in 1009. This powerful provocation started the near 90-year preparation towards the [[First Crusade]].&lt;ref name="Mill's History"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Mills|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nbc2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA504#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Eclectic Review|issue=13|chapter=Mill's History of the Crusades|date=June 1820|accessdate=2014-08-12}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the majority of the era{{when|date=October 2017}} Muslim rule existed in the region of Palestine, except for the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (1099–1291). Due to the growing importance of Jerusalem in the Muslim world, the tolerance towards the other faiths began to fade. The Christians and the Jews in Palestine were persecuted and many Churches and Synagogues were destroyed.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;!-- My understanding from reading Jewish sources from this period, Jews were NOT persecuted by Arab Muslims. On the contrary, the Arab conquerors permitted Jews to pray near the Gates leading up to the Temple Mount, something that had been denied them during Byzantine rule. -From someone who doesn't understand...--&gt; This trend peaked in 1009 AD when Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al Hakim]] of the [[Fatimid dynasty]], destroyed also the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem. This provocation ignited enormous rage in the Christian world, which led to the Crusades from Europe to the Holy Land.

===Early Crusades===
In 1099, the Christian [[Crusaders]], under the support of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], launched the [[First Crusade]] campaign with the aims of regaining control of [[Jerusalem]] from the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Islamic Empire]], and helping the [[Byzantine Empire]] fight the [[Seljuk Turks]]. During the campaign, the Crusaders launched an assault on the city of Jerusalem, captured it in July 1099, massacring many of the city's Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, and established the first Christian [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. The Crusaders transformed the [[Dome of the Rock]] into the "Shrine of the Lord" ([[Templum Domini]]) and the [[Al-Aqsa mosque]] into the "Hall of Solomon" ([[Templum Solomonis]]). The local Muslim reaction was to try to find an accommodation with the Crusaders. During this era, the larger Muslim world looked upon the setbacks in Jerusalem with indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John L., ed.

===Ayyubid rule and Late Crusades===
[[File:Battle of Cresson.jpg|thumb|200px|Illustration of the [[Battle of Hattin]] in a medieval manuscript]]

In 1187, the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid Sultan]] [[Saladin|Salah ad-Din]] led his armies to win a great victory over the Crusaders in the [[Battle of Hattin]].&lt;ref name=Madden2000&gt;{{harvnb|Madden|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a direct result of the battle, Islamic forces once again became the dominant power in the region, re-conquering [[Jerusalem]] and several other Crusader-held cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/256944/Battle-of-Hattin "Battle of Ḥaṭṭīn."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 4 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1189, the first lodge for Sufi ascetics was established at the [[Al-Khanqah al-Salahiyya Mosque]] in Jerusalem, which had been a palace of the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarch]] prior to the reconquest of the city.&lt;ref name=sufism /&gt;

The Christian defeat led to a [[Third Crusade]] aimed to regain the lost territories in the Holy Land. [[Richard I of England]] (Richard the Lionheart) launched a siege upon the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], after which he conquered the city and killed 3,000 Muslims. After a second victory won in the [[Battle of Arsuf]], the Crusaders arrived to Jerusalem, but withdrew without trying to conquer the city. Following another military clash in Jaffa, which wasn't won by either side, [[Saladin]] and [[Richard the Lionheart]] signed the [[Treaty of Ramla]] in June 1192. Under the terms of the agreement, Jerusalem would remain under [[Muslim]] control but the city would be open to [[Christian]] pilgrims. The treaty reduced the Latin Kingdom to a strip along the coast from Tyre to [[Jaffa]].

===Mamluk domination===
In 1250, the Ayyubid Egyptian dynasty was overthrown by slave ("Mamluk") regiments, and a new dynasty - the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] - was born. On September 3, 1260, at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] held in the [[Jezreel Valley]], the Muslim Egyptian Mamluks under [[Baibars]] defeated the [[Mongols]] and stopped their advance. His successor [[Al-Ashraf Khalil]] completed the victory by sweeping the last of the Crusaders out of Palestine.

In 1291, the forces of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] Sultan of Egypt [[al-Ashraf Khalil]] forced a [[Siege of Acre (1291)|long siege upon the city of Acre]], which was the final [[Christian]] landhold in the Holy Land. The Mamluks captured the city on May 18, 1291, killing most of the Christian local inhabitants, thus ending the second [[Crusades|Crusader]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fromherz, Allan James]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JxO1KXy3ENoC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=mamluks+captured+acre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2GFi216tn2&amp;sig=wnu1ZKQzz6Yvf6AtGbNvUTOFr-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wA4QUYqrH6OpiQLp4ICQAw&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mamluks%20captured%20acre&amp;f=false ''Ibn Khaldun: Life and Times''.] Google Books. 4 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mamluks were to rule Palestine for the following two centuries (1291-1516). The Muslim population became the majority, and many Muslim shrines were built such as [[Tomb of Benjamin|Maqam al-Nabi Yamin]], [[Nabi Musa|Maqam al-Nabi Musa]], [[Nabi Rubin|Maqam al-Nabi Rubin]] and many more shrines that Muslims described as a burial sites of [[Prophets]], [[Sahaba]]s and even what they considered holy Muslim martyrs from Crusader and pre-Crusader times. Some historians{{who|date=August 2014}} say that the shrines were built to make a good strategic positions for Muslims (for example [[Nabi Musa]] was built on the road from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jericho]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The Mamluks, ruling from Damascus, brought some prosperity to the area, particularly to Jerusalem, with an extensive programme involving the building of schools, hospices for pilgrims, the construction of Islamic colleges and the renovation of mosques. [[Mujir al-Din]]'s extensive writing about 15th century Jerusalem documents the consolidation and expansion of Islamic sites in the Mamluk era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=604667|title=Mujīr al-Dīn al-'Ulaymī's Vision of Jerusalem in the Ninth/Fifteenth Century|first1=Donald P.|last1=Little|publisher=American Oriental Society|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|year=April–June 1995|pages=237–247|volume=115|issue=2|doi=10.2307/604667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ascendency of the [[Burji dynasty|Burji]] over the [[Bahri dynasty|Bahri Mamluks]], together with recurrent droughts, plagues and pestilence like the [[Black Death]] and taxation to cover the costs of wars against Crusaders and Mongols (the last of which was "[[Timur|Tamurlane]]'s horde") brought about both growing insecurity and economic decline. By the end of their reign, with the decay of internal control and massive population losses due to plagues, Bedouins moved in to take advantage of the decline in defenses, and farmers abandoned their lands. They sacked Ramla in 1481 and annihilated a Mamluk army that had been raised in Gaza to repel them.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Etheredge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8WX6BZAmtx4C&amp;pg=PA43 ''Historic Palestine, Israel, and the Emerging Palestinian Autonomous Areas,''] The Rosen Publishing Group 2011 p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Avi-Yonah, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AhasMr2F3i8C&amp;pg=PA279  ''A History of Israel and the Holy Land,''] A&amp;C Black, 2003 pp.279-282.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 15th century, Jerusalem's population amounted to approximately 10,000, mostly Muslims, with roughly 1,000 Christians and 400 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G.

===Rise of the Ottomans===
On August 24, 1516, at the [[Battle of Marj Dabiq]], the Ottoman Empire forces defeated the Mamluk sultanate forces and thus the Ottomans became the new rulers of the [[Levant]]. On October 28 they defeated the Mamluk forces once more in the [[Battle of Yaunis Khan]] and they annexed the region of Palestine. By December of that year the entire region of Palestine was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} As a result of the Ottoman advance during the reign of [[Selim I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/Turkpal.htm |title=Whose Land?: A History of the Peoples of Palestine|last=Parkes|first=James|authorlink=James Parkes (clergyman)|location=Harmondsworth|publisher=Penguin Books|origyear=1949|chapter=Turkish Territorial Divisions in 1914|year=1970|page=187|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Sunni [[Ottoman Turks]] occupied the historic region of Palestine. Their leadership reinforced and ensured the centrality and importance of Islam as the dominant religion in the region.

In 1834, [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine|a popular uprising]] erupted against the rule of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Wāli Muhammad Ali]]. The main cause of the uprising was indignation at being drafted by the Egyptian army. At first the rebels managed to take over many cities, including [[Nablus]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Hebron]]. In response, Egyptian military leader [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] commanded an army force of 40,000 people against the rebels and managed to put an end to the rebellion, conquering [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Ramleh]], [[Jaffa]], [[Haifa]], Jerusalem and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. Ibrahim Pasha's conquests had a significant demographic change as the region of Palestine had an influx of Muslim tribal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jcpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Egypt2.pdf |title= Egyptian emigres in the Levant of the 19th and 20th centuries |author1=Prof. Gideon M.Kresser |author2=Dr. Reuven Aharoni |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Pasha, in wresting control of Palestine from the Ottoman Empire, clashed with the regional ambitions of the European Great Powers and, in order to assuage their unease, he reversed Ottoman policy and opened the country up to both foreigners and non-Muslim populations. Despite the brevity of Egyptian overlordship, since the great powers restored the fortunes of the Ottomans and their sovereignty over Palestine, the long term effect was to lay the groundwork for the development of extensive European activities and interests in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Carmel 'A Note on the Christian Contribution to the Development of Palestine in the 19th century,' in David Kushner (ed.)

===Islam during British rule===
[[File:Palest against british.gif|thumb|Irregulars during the 1936–39 Arab revolt]]

In 1917, at the end of the [[First World War]], the [[British Empire]] conquered the region of Palestine from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[United Kingdom]] was granted control of Palestine by the [[Versailles Peace Conference]] which established the [[League of Nations]] in 1919 and appointed [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], a former [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British cabinet]], who was instrumental in drafting the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]], as its first [[High Commissioner]] in Palestine. The British occupation of the region brought an end to hundreds of years of successive Muslim rule in the region of Palestine.

The gradual increase in the number of Jews in Palestine led to the development of a proto-[[Palestinian nationalism|Arab-Palestinian national movement]], influenced and inspired by Muslim leader and Mufti of Jerusalem [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]]. [[Zionism]], the ideology advocating the creation of a [[Jewish state]] in Palestine, was increasingly identified as a threat by the Muslim-Arab population in Palestine. This [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] trend became linked to a fierce anti-British resistance (like in the [[1920 Palestine riots]] and during the 1936–39 [[Arab Revolt]]).

The [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|High Commissioner of Palestine]], [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], issued an order in December 1921 establishing a Supreme Muslim Council with authority over all the Muslim [[waqf]]s and [[sharia]] courts in Palestine. In addition, in 1922 the British authorities appointed [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] as the [[Mufti of Jerusalem]]. Until the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]] took place, the Council operated as the Governing body of the Arab community under the British Mandate, and co-operated with the British government in Palestine. All along its operation, the Supreme Muslim Council advocated an active resistance against the Jewish "[[Yishuv]]", supporting the Arab underground anti-British movements in the country.&lt;ref&gt;"al-Husseini, Hajj (Muhammad) Amin."

===1948–1967: Islam under Israeli, Jordanian and Egyptian rule===
[[File:Palestinian refugees.jpg|thumb|Palestinian refugees from Galilee in 1948]]
On May 14, 1948, one day before the end of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], the leaders of the [[Yishuv|Jewish community in Palestine]] led by prime minister [[David Ben-Gurion]], made a [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|declaration of independence]], and the [[state of Israel]] was established. Contingents of [[Egypt]]ian, [[Syria]]n, [[Jordan]]ian, and [[Iraq]]i armies invaded Israel, thus starting the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The nascent [[Israeli Defense Force]] repulsed the Arab nations from part of the occupied territories, thus extending its borders beyond the original UNSCOP partition.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Charles D. ''Palestine and the Arab Israeli Conflict: A History With Documents''. Bedford/St. Martin’s: Boston. (2004). Pg. 198&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1948, Israel controlled most of the portion of Mandate Palestine west of the [[Jordan River]]. The remainder of the Mandate consisted of Jordan, the area that came to be called the [[West Bank]] (occupied by Jordan), and the [[Gaza Strip]] (occupied by Egypt). Prior to and during this conflict, 700,000&lt;ref&gt;GENERAL PROGRESS REPORT AND SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONCILIATION COMMISSION FOR PALESTINE, Covering the period from 11 December 1949 to 23 October 1950, GA A/1367/Rev.1 23 October 1950&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinians Arabs fled their original lands to become [[Palestinian refugees]], in part, due to a [[Causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus#Outline of the historical debate|promise]] from Arab leaders that they would be able to return when the war is won.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Benny. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4283141 "Yosef Weitz and the Transfer Committees 1948–49"] ''JSTOR: Middle Eastern Studies'' vol. 22, no. 4 (Oct., 1986), p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British transferred the symbolic Islamic governance of the land to the [[Hashemite]]s based in [[Jordan]], and not to the [[House of Saud]]. The Hashemites thus became the official guardians of the Islamic holy places of Jerusalem and the areas around it. Following the Jordanian occupation of the West Bank during the war, King [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] removed Amin al-Husayni as Grand Mufti and appointed Sheikh [[Hussam ad-Din Jarallah]] as the new [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] on 20 December 1948. The [[Supreme Muslim Council]] was eventually disbanded in 1951 by the Jordanian authorities.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} On July 20, 1951 king Abdullah of Jordan was assassinated while visiting the Al Aqsa Mosque. The assassination was carried out by a Palestinian from the [[Al-Husayni|Husseini]] clan. The Palestinian gunman, motivated by fears that king Abdullah would make a separate peace with Israel, fired three fatal bullets into the King's head and chest.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

After the conquest of the [[Temple Mount]] during the [[Six-Day War]], the Chief Israeli Rabbinate announced that Jewish people are forbidden of entering the Temple Mount. Since 1967, Israel controls the security on the Temple Mount, but the [[Waqf|Muslim Waqf]] controls administrative matters, taking responsibility for the conduct of Islamic affairs just as it did during the Jordanian occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Sela.

==Demographics==

===Sunni Islam===
Today Islam is a prominent religion in both Gaza and the West Bank. Most of the population in the [[State of Palestine]] are Muslims (80% in the West Bank and 99% in the Gaza Strip).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/we.html "The World Factbook."] ''CIA''.  19 December 2015.  West Bank&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gz.html "The World Factbook."] ''CIA''.  19 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian Muslims primarily practice [[Shafi'i|Shafi'i Islam]], which is a branch of Sunni Islam.

===Shia Islam===
{{main|Shia villages in Palestine}}
From 1923 to 1948, there were seven villages in [[Mandatory Palestine]] for which the population was predominantly [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] (also known as ''Metawali'').  They were [[Tarbikha]], [[Saliha]], [[Al-Malkiyya|Malkiyeh]], [[Al-Nabi Yusha'|Nabi Yusha]], [[Qadas]], [[Hunin]], and [[Abil al-Qamh]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman (2006). The 1922 census also listed the Muslim minority in [[al-Bassa]] as Shia, but Kaufman determined they were actually Sunni.&lt;/ref&gt;  These villages were transferred from the French to the British sphere as a result of the border agreement of 1923. All of them were depopulated during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] and their former locations are now in northern [[Israel]]. The 1931 census counted 4,100 ''Metawalis'' in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Census of Palestine 1931; Palestine Part I, Report | volume = Volume 1 | place = Alexandria  | year = 1933|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1979, due to Iran's influence, some Palestinian Sunnis converted to Shia Islam. Israeli [[Haaretz]] reported in 2012 that [[Hamas]]' fear of growing Iranian influence in Gaza caused the organization to crackdown on Shiite organizations, including charities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.5166342&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, becoming Shiite is a growing trend in the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of Sunnis, both [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] activists and ordinary people, are known to have converted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.5166342&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sabireen Movement]] was created in 2014 by some Shi’ites that left the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]].&lt;ref&gt;https://raseef22.com/en/politics/2018/02/08/al-sabireen-iran-backed-palestinian-movement-style-hezbollah/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/harakat-al-sabireen&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadiyya Islam===
{{main|Ahmadiyya in Palestine}}
[[Ahmadiyya]] is a small sect of Islam in Palestine. The community, which is not recognized as genuine Islamic by mainstream Muslims, faces persecution and experiences matrimonial restrictions imposed by local [[Sharia]] courts. Although no estimates are available, reports suggest that there may be "dozens" of Palestinian Ahmadi Muslims in the West Bank.&lt;ref name="PA"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137789#.VQCykfmsXD8 | title=PA's Moderate Muslims Face Threats | publisher=Israel National News | author=Maayana Miskin | date=May 31, 2010 | accessdate=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1207">'''Juan Carrasco''' (died c. 1670) was an [[apologist]], of [[Marrano]] parentage. He was born in [[Madrid]] and is sometimes called '''Carrasco of Madrid'''.  

Carrasco had first been an Augustin friar at [[Burgos]] and an excellent preacher.  Later, on a journey to [[Rome]], he became a convert to [[Judaism]] at [[Livorno]]. He was familiar with the writings of [[Nahmanides]], [[Isaac Abravanel]], and others, and while in [[Holland]] (probably at [[Amsterdam]], where he was [[Religious male circumcision|circumcised]]) he wrote in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] his "Apology of Judaism." This work was published at Nodriza ([[The Hague]]) in 1633, and was later incorporated in the "Coleccion de Reformadores Españoles," published by [[Benjamin Wiffen]], who believed Carrasco to have been a [[Protestant]].

In the [[Avesta]], reference is made to [[7 (number)|seven]] '''karshvar''' (''karšvrə'' &lt; [[Modern Persian]] ''keshvar''), [[clime]]s or zones, organizing the world map into a seven-storied [[ziggurat]] representing the [[cosmic mountain]]. The world is referred to  as the ''haft keshvar''. The word has also been translated as "region", "state" or "[[continent]]". 	 

The Avesta describes the karshvar as superimposed concentric circles one above the other, with increasing size. These are separated by waters, mountains or forests.

#Arezahi,
#Savahi,
#Fradadhafshu,
#Vidadhafshu,
#Vourubaresti, 
#Vourugaresti,
#Hvaniratha.	
The story of the creation of these seven regions is told in Bundahishn when "rain first fell upon the earth".&lt;ref name=wm/&gt; [[human|Man]] lives in the karshvar Hvaniratha.&lt;ref name=boyce-ts&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=M.|title=Textual sources for the study of Zoroastrianism|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1984|isbn=0-7190-1064-0}} p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Hvaniratha is believed to be "central one"&lt;ref name=boyce-ts/&gt; and whose size was as large as all others together.&lt;ref name=wm&gt;{{cite book|title=World of myths|first1=Marina|last1=Warner|first2=Felipe|last2=Fernández-Armesto|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2004|isbn=0-292-70607-3}} p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;The karshvar Hvaniratha is where "peak of Hara" (Alburz)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=W. Eilers|title=Alborz i. the name Alborz|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume= Vol. 1|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alborz-massif-iran#pt1|year= 1985|isbn=|quote=The Harā appears in Yt. 15.7 in the image of a fortress “held together by iron clamps.” At what point the name of this mythic primeval range came to be applied to the mountains we nowadays know as Alborz is an open question. To begin with, any huge chain of mountains was probably given the name “Alborz.” In the work of Ḥamdallāh Mostawfī (8th/14th century) the name is already established. The highest (volcanic) peak of the Caucasus is also called (with a sound metathesis) Elbrus (5,600 m., the same height as Damāvand). An obviously secondary derivation is found in the mountain name Alborz, near the village Pāznūya (from pā-zīnūya  “at the foot of the pass”) in Jahrom, Fārs}}&lt;/ref&gt; had "grown from the roots of Elburz mountains".&lt;ref name=wm/&gt; 

[[Sufi]] traditions postulate an eighth clime, the "heavenly Earth" or "cosmic North".	

In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], according to [[H. P. Blavatsky]] (''The Devil's Own'', 1891), [[Ahura]] is interpreted as  a generic name for the sevenfold Deity, the Ruler of the Seven Worlds, and Hvaniratha is the middle plane (the fourth of seven), corresponding to [[Earth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3681">{{nihongo3|uncleanness, defilement|穢れ・汚れ|'''Kegare'''}} is the Japanese term for a state of pollution and defilement, important particularly in [[Shinto]] as a religious term.&lt;ref name="EOS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nishioka|first=Kazuhiko|title=Kegare|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1212|work=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical causes of ''kegare'' are the contact with any form of death, childbirth (for both parents), disease and menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version, "Kegare"&lt;/ref&gt; In Shinto ''kegare'' is a form of ''[[tsumi]]'' ([[taboo]] violation), which needs to be somehow remedied by the person responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version, "Tsumi"&lt;/ref&gt; This condition can be remedied through purification rites called ''[[misogi]]'' and ''[[harae]]''. ''Kegare'' can have an adverse impact not only on the person directly affected, but also to the community he or she belongs to.

''Kegare'' is not a form of moral judgment, but rather a spontaneous reaction to amoral natural forces. Whether the defiling was caused by a deliberate act, as for example in the case of a crime, or by an external event, such as illness or death, is secondary.&lt;ref name="scheid"/&gt; It is therefore not an equivalent of [[sin]].

==Death as a source of ''kegare''==
The concept of ''kegare'' from death still has considerable force within Japanese society,&lt;ref name="scheid"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheid|first=Bernhard |title=Kegare|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/an/Shinto#Kegare|work=Religion in Japan|publisher=University of Vienna|accessdate=2 Nov 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; even during Buddhist funerals. Death and everything having to do with it are seen as a primary source of defilement.&lt;ref name="scheid"/&gt;

This is why, after the death of one of its members, a family will not send to friends and relatives the usual postcards with seasonal greetings during summer and winter, replacing them with letters of excuses. Those who attend a Buddhist funeral receive a small bag of salt to purify themselves before they return to their homes, in order to avoid bringing ''kegare'' to their families.&lt;ref name="eyfells"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eyfells|first=Eyjolfur|title=Shinto's spiritual value in the past and present|url=http://skemman.is/is/stream/get/1946/3342/10458/1/Eyjolfur_Eyfells_fixed.pdf|publisher=[[Skemman]]|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family's ''[[kami]]'' must be protected as much as possible from contact with death, blood, and disease. A still common consequence of this is the habit to give up the traditional New Year visit (''[[hatsumōde]]'') to a [[Shinto shrine]] if a death in the family has occurred within the last year.&lt;ref name="scheid"/&gt;

Shinto priests (the ''[[kannushi]]'') are expected to pay particular attention to avoid this kind of ''kegare'', and must be careful to deal correctly with death and disease. Given how important dealing with death is in religion, this strong death [[taboo]] cannot have been part of [[kami]] worship from the beginning.&lt;ref name="scheid"/&gt; The exclusion of death from religious rites became for the first time possible when another religion, Buddhism, could take charge of it.

'''Linda Gazzera''' (1890-1932) was an Italian spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]].

During 1908-1910, Gazzera was investigated in a series of [[séance]]s by the spiritualist Enrico Imoda who endorsed her alleged [[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]] as genuine. Photographs were taken, they were later published in a posthumous book entitled ''Fotografie di Fantasmi'' in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Imoda, Enrico. (1912). ''Fotografie di Fantasmi''. Fratelli Bocca.&lt;/ref&gt; French psychical researcher Guillaume de Fontenay in an afterword for the book cast doubt on the authenticity of the photographs, noting that the materializations looked dubious and two-dimensional with suspicious shadows.&lt;ref&gt;Chéroux, Clément. (2005). ''The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult''. Yale University Press. p. 208. {{ISBN|0-300-11136-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptical author [[Joseph McCabe]] has written that Gazzera was exposed as a fraud in 1911. According to McCabe "Her materializations and tricks were simple. She brought her birds and flowers and muslin and masks (or pictures) in her hair (which was largely false, and never examined) and her under-clothing, and she, by a common trick, released her hands and feet from control to manipulate them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]].

The first line is transcribed into [[Proto-Norse]] as either ''Ek erilaz sa Wilagaz haite'ka'' or ''Ek erilaz Sawilagaz haite'ka''.
This translates to "I am (an) ''[[erilaz]]'', I am called the wily" (or "I am called ''Sawilagaz'').
If the word in first line is translated as a name, ''Sawilagaz'' means "the one of the Sun ([[Sowilo]])." If the word is translated as "the wily" or "crafty one" or "deceitful one," then it may be related to a byname of [[Odin]] or another god.&lt;ref name="Flowers"/&gt;

The sequence in the second line contains a "magical" string of runes concluding in ''[[Alu (runic)|alu]]''.
The three consecutive [[Tiwaz rune]]s as an invocation of the god [[Tyr|Tiwaz]], and the eight [[Ansuz (rune)|Ansuz]] runes as an invocation or symbolic list of eight [[Æsir|gods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spurkland |first=Terje |authorlink= |title= Norwegian Runes and Runic Inscriptions |publisher=Boydell Press |year=2005 |location= |pages=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QDKqY-NWvUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |id= |isbn=1-84383-186-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Hasidic dynasty''' is a [[dynasty]] led by [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Jews|Jewish]] spiritual leaders known as [[rebbe]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year =2012| title =Hasidism| encyclopedia =[[World Book]]|volume=9|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually has some or all of the following characteristics:
#Each leader of the dynasty is often known as an ''ADMOR''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hasidic leader Yaakov Friedman, the Admor of Sadigura, dies at 84|first= Yair|last=Ettinger|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/hasidic-leader-yaakov-friedman-the-admor-of-sadigura-dies-at-84-1.491294|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=Jan 1, 2013|accessdate=Oct 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviation for '' '''AD'''oneinu '''MO'''reinu '''R'''abeinu'' - "our master, our teacher and our rabbi") or simply as ''[[Rebbe]]'' (or "the Rebbe"), and at times called the "Rav" ("rabbi"), and sometimes referred to in English as a "Grand Rabbi";
#The dynasty continues beyond the initial leader's lifetime by succession (usually by a family descendant);
#The dynasty is usually named after a key town in Eastern Europe where the founder may have been born or lived, or where the group began to grow and flourish;
#The dynasty has (or once had) followers who, through time, continue following successive leaders (rebbes) or may even continue as a group without a leader by following the precepts of a deceased leader.

A '''Hasidic group''' has the following characteristics:
#It was founded by a leader who did not appoint or leave a successor;
#It may be named after a key town in Eastern Europe where the founder may have been born or lived, or where the group began to grow and flourish, or it may be named after the founder himself;
#It has followers who continue as a group under the direction of rabbis who expound and interpret the precepts of the deceased founder.

However, during the [[Middle Ages]], the number of churches was even larger, with at least 12 churches in Visby and an additional large number in the countryside. Some of these are still visible as more or less well-preserved ruins.

==Background==
Gotland began to gradually abandon [[Norse religion]] and adopt [[Christianity]] during the 11th century.&lt;ref name="DMG"&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrén|first= Anders|authorlink= |title= Det Medeltida Gotland. En arkeologisk guidebok|trans-title=Medieval Gotland. An archaeological guide book. |url= http://libris.kb.se/bib/12028545|year= 2011|publisher= Historiska Media|location= Lund|language=Swedish|isbn= 978-91-85873-83-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first churches to be built on Gotland were wooden, built in the manner of [[stave church]]es.&lt;ref name=lansstyrelsenkyrkor/&gt; None of these have survived intact. The most well-preserved remains, today in the [[Swedish History Museum]], are those of [[Hemse stave church]].&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; Traces and archaeological evidence of earlier stave churches have been discovered in ten different sites on Gotland.&lt;ref name="DMG"/&gt; The remains point to an artistic decoration reminiscent of [[Viking art]].&lt;ref name=kulturen&gt;{{cite book |last1= Jonsson|first1= Marita|last2= Lindquist|first2= Sven-Olof|last3= Hejdström|first3= Raymond|date= 1999|title= Vägen till kulturen på Gotland|edition= 6th|url= http://libris.kb.se/bib/7768519|location= Visby|publisher= Gotlands fornsal|page= |isbn= 91-88036-32-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone churches began to replace wooden churches during the 12th century.&lt;ref name=lansstyrelsenkyrkor/&gt; These churches were [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style, with influences coming mainly from [[Architecture of Denmark|Denmark]] and western [[Architecture of Germany|German]] architecture,&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; but to a limited extent also from the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=kulturen/&gt; Importantly, the construction of [[Lund Cathedral]] in [[Scania]] established a source of influences in the relative vicinity. Likewise, the 1164 establishment of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of [[Roma Abbey]] on Gotland led to strong [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercian influences]] in the following period of church construction. These Romanesque churches were sometimes decorated internally with [[Church frescos in Sweden|frescos]]. Here also, the influences came most often from the west and south, but sometimes also from [[Russian culture|Russia]]. Similarly, the churches were adorned with stone sculpture, notably decorated [[baptismal font]]s. Here, too, influences came from both the west and the east,&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; but the sculptors themselves seem to have been native Gotlanders.&lt;ref name=kulturen/&gt; Finally, such churches also occasionally display wooden sculptures, such as [[triumphal cross]]es. These display a more markedly uniform western style, with influences coming from France or western Germany.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt;
[[File:Martebo kyrka church medieval servant Egypticus.jpg|thumb|left|During the Gothic era, the church portals were often decorated with sculptures, such as these at [[Martebo Church]]]]
During the 13th century, reconstruction works were started on several of these earlier churches. New churches were also commissioned. Gotland was enjoying a period of prosperity thanks to increasing trade, and, possibly, due to its role as a staging area for [[Northern Crusades|crusaders departing for the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref name="DMG"/&gt; The churches were made larger and more elaborate. The style began to shift in favour of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], although few churches on Gotland display a pronounced Gothic style. The most elaborate parts of these churches are often the portals, notably the main southern portals.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; The towers of these churches are also taller and more elaborate than earlier towers (which were often designed with a dual, defensive purpose). Another typical feature is the square [[choir (architecture)|choir]] that lacks an [[apse]] and instead has a straight eastern wall with three windows.&lt;ref name=kulturen/&gt; Internally, frescos and wooden sculpture continued to enjoy popularity, as well as occasionally [[stained glass]] windows. Artistic influences came via Visby from mainly western Germany. At the end of this period, Gotland entered a period of economic decline. Following the [[Black Death]], the invasion of Gotland by [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]] and the [[Battle of Visby]] (1361), and a general decrease in trade, many churches were left unfinished. Hence, several churches on Gotland display a peculiar form, where the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] is in Gothic style and disproportionally large in comparison with the rest of the otherwise Romanesque church. In such cases, reconstruction of the church had started with the choir but was brought to a halt before the whole reconstruction scheme could be finished.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt;

From about 1400, no new churches were erected and the general religious building activity decreases sharply. Internally, some churches receive further embellishment in the form of new [[altarpiece]]s or frescos during the 15th and 16th century. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], a new type of altarpieces and [[pulpit]]s were introduced.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; These post-Reformation furnishings from the 17th and 18th centuries are also well represented in the churches of Gotland.&lt;ref name=lansstyrelsenkyrkor/&gt;

The church building activity on Gotland thus took place in the period of approximately 250 years, from {{circa}} 1100 to 1350. Until the early 13th century, the pace of church building was comparable to the rest of [[Scandinavia]]. From then on, both the number and size of new churches increased significantly, until building activity came to a complete halt at the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="DMG"/&gt;

Only a few of the church buildings on Gotland have been significantly altered since the end of the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name=lansstyrelsenkyrkor/&gt; which is unusual in a European context, since medieval churches were often heavily reconstructed or renovated during the 19th century. The medieval parish churches of Gotland comprise the most well-preserved set of such churches in Sweden,&lt;ref name="DMG"/&gt; and indeed in the whole [[Baltic region]].&lt;ref name=lt&gt;{{cite journal|last= Hansson|first= Joakim|last2= |first2= |date= 2005|title= Lost values &amp; unused possibilities in the medieval churches in Gotland|url= http://www.menufakultetas.vdu.lt/var/uploads/editor/mik_1.pdf|journal= Meno istorija ir kritika (MIK)|publisher= |issn= 1822-4547|volume= 1/2005|issue= |pages= 60–72|doi= |accessdate= 12 October 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044918/http://www.menufakultetas.vdu.lt/var/uploads/editor/mik_1.pdf|archivedate= 4 March 2016|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, a small number of new churches have been built, notably in Visby.

The vast majority of the churches on Gotland belongs to the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Church of Sweden]], and the [[Diocese of Visby]].

The ''Buddhavamsa'' is a text which describes the life of [[Gautama Buddha]] and the 27 [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]] who preceded him.&lt;ref name=Morris1882/&gt; The Buddhavamsa is part of the ''[[Khuddaka Nikaya|Khuddaka Nikāya]]'', which in turn is part of the ''[[Sutta Pitaka|Sutta Piṭaka]]''. The ''Sutta Piṭaka'' is one of three main sections of the ''[[Pāli Canon]]'' of Theravāda Buddhism.

The first three of these [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]]—Taṇhaṅkara, Medhaṅkara, and Saraṇaṅkara—lived before the time of [[Dīpankara Buddha]]. The fourth Buddha, Dīpankara, is especially important, as he was the Buddha who gave ''niyatha vivarana'' (prediction of future [[Buddhahood]]) to the [[Brahmin]] youth who would in the distant future become the [[bodhisattva]] Gautama Buddha.&lt;ref name=Huntington/&gt; After Dīpankara, 23 more noble people (''[[Four stages of enlightenment|ariya-puggala]]'') would attain [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] before Gautama, the historical Buddha.

Many Buddhists also pay homage to the future (and 29th) Buddha, [[Maitreya]]. According to [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scripture]], Maitreya will be a successor of Gautama who will appear on Earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]''. The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya is found in the canonical literature of all Buddhist sects ([[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]), and is accepted by most Buddhists as a statement about an event that will take place when the ''Dharma'' will have been forgotten on ''[[Jambudvipa]]'' (the terrestrial realm, where ordinary human beings live).

==The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity==
According to Theravada Buddhist tradition, each kalpa has 1,000 [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]].&lt;ref name=Buddhistdoor&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Chapter 36: The Buddhas in the three periods of time|work=Buddhism in a Nutshell Archives|publisher=Buddhistdoor International|location=Hong Kong|year=|url=http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/bdoor/archive/nutshell/teach36.htm|accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous kalpa was the ''vyuhakalpa'' (Glorious aeon), and the present kalpa is called the ''bhadrakalpa'' (Auspicious aeon).&lt;ref name=Buswell106/&gt; The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity (''Saptatathāgata'') are seven Buddhas which bridge the vyuhakalpa and the bhadrakalpa:&lt;ref name=Buswell776/&gt;
#[[Vipassī Buddha|Vipassī]] (the 998th Buddha of the vyuhakalpa)
#[[Sikhī Buddha|Sikhī]] (the 999th Buddha of the vyuhakalpa)
#[[Vessabhū Buddha|Vessabhū]] (the 1000th and final Buddha of the vyuhakalpa)
#[[Kakusandha Buddha|Kakusandha]] (the first Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)
#[[Koṇāgamana Buddha|Koṇāgamana]] (the second Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)
#[[Kassapa Buddha|Kassapa]] (the third Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)
#[[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]] (the fourth and present Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)

Following the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity will be [[Maitreya]], the fifth and future Buddha of the bhadrakalpa.

==Historical mentions of previous Buddhas==
===Koṇāgamana (the second Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)===
The [[Koṇāgamana Buddha]], second Buddha of the bhadrakalpa, is mentioned in a 3rd-century BCE inscription by [[Ashoka]] at [[Nigali Sagar]], in today's [[Nepal]]. There is an [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka pillar]] at the site today. Ashoka's inscription in the [[Brahmi script]] is on the fragment of the pillar still partly buried in the ground. The inscription made when [[Ashoka|Emperor Asoka]] at [[Nigali Sagar]] in 249 BCE records his visit, the enlargement of a stupa dedicated to the Kanakamuni Buddha, and the erection of a pillar:

{{quote|"Devanam piyena piyadasin lajina- chodasavasa bhisitena Budhasa Konakamanasa thube-dutyam vadhite Visativa sabhisitena –cha atana-agacha-mahiyite silathabe-cha usa papite"&lt;br&gt;
''“His Majesty King [[Ashoka|Priyadarsin]] in the 14th year of his reign enlarged for the second time the stupa of the Buddha Kanakamuni and in the 20th year of his reign, having come in person, paid reverence and set up a stone pillar”''.&lt;ref&gt;Basanta Bidari - 2004 Kapilavastu: the world of Siddhartha - Page 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inscriptions of Asoka.

According to [[Xuanzang]], Koṇāgamana's relics were held in a stupa in [[Nigali Sagar]], in what is now [[Kapilvastu District]] in southern [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relics of the Buddha|author=John S. Strong|year=2007|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=_KLAxmR8PZAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gautama Buddha (Sakyamuni, the fourth and present Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)===
The historical Buddha, Gautama, also called Sakyamuni ("Sage of the [[Shakyas]]), is mentioned epigraphically on the [[Pillars of Ashoka|Pillar of Ashoka]] at [[Rummindei]] ([[Lumbini]] in modern [[Nepal]]). The [[Brahmi script]] inscription on the pillar gives evidence that [[Ashoka]], emperor of the [[Maurya Empire]], visited the place in 3rd-century BCE and identified it as the birth-place of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Paranavitana, S. (Apr. - Jun., 1962).

{{quote|''When King Devandmpriya Priyadarsin had been anointed twenty years, he came himself and worshipped (this spot) because the [[Buddha Shakyamuni]] was born here. (He) both caused to be made a stone bearing a horse (?) and caused a stone pillar to be set up, (in order to show) that the Blessed One was born here. (He) made the village of Lummini free of taxes, and paying (only) an eighth share (of the produce).''|The [[Rummindei]] Edict, one of the [[Minor Pillar Edicts]] of Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;Hultzsch, E.

The '''Mandapeshwar Caves''' ({{lang-mr|मंडपेश्वर गुंफा}}) is an 8th Century rock-cut shrine dedicated to [[Shiva]]&lt;ref name="Gaur"/&gt; located near [[Mount Poinsur]] in [[Borivali]], a [[suburb]] of [[Mumbai]] in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. The caves were originally Buddhist [[vihara]]s, before being occupied by the Brahmans.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;"An interesting example is the Mandapeshwar cave near Borivli which was once a Buddhist Vihara. It was later occupied by the Brahmans" {{cite book |last1=Kail |first1=Owen C. |title=Elephanta, the island of mystery |date=1984 |publisher=Taraporevala |page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylweAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The caves are situated in [[Mount Poinsur]], [[Borivali]], a suburb of [[Mumbai]]. Originally, the caves were on the banks of the [[Dahisar River]] but later the course of the river changed.&lt;ref name="frontline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fline/fl2615/stories/20090731261506600.htm|title=In a shambles|last=Bavadam|first=Lyla|date=18–31 July 2009|publisher=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|accessdate=2011-01-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125062548/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fline/fl2615/stories/20090731261506600.htm|archivedate=2013-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the neighbourhood was derived from this temple. It is believed that the name of [[Mount Poinsur]], on which the [[Saint Francis D'Assisi High School]] is situated, is a corruption of the name "Mandapeshwar". The Mandapeshwar caves are smaller and lesser known as compared to the [[Kanheri caves]] in the [[Sanjay Gandhi National Park]] in [[Borivali|Borivali East]].&lt;ref name="Gaur"/&gt; The ruins of an old Portuguese-built church stand on top of the caves. The [[Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church, Mt. Poinsur|Immaculate Conception Church]] is located to its south end. There is an open ground in front of the caves which is used as a playground and parking area by slumdwellers from the [[slum]] in front of it. The Swami Vivekanand Road runs in front of this cave.&lt;ref name="Gaur"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "crit"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mandapeshwar caves &amp; Portuguese churches 25.jpg|thumb|The ruins over the caves]]
[[File:Mandapeshwar caves &amp; Portuguese churches 20.jpg|thumb|A passageway within the ruins]]
The caves are believed to have been built approximately 1500 to 1600 years ago,&lt;ref name="Gaur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040125/spectrum/travel.htm|title=Pay dirt: Treasure amidst Mumbai’s trash|last=Gaur|first=Abhilash|date=25 January 2004|publisher=/www.tribuneindia.com|accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly around the same time as Jogeshwari caves (which were built between 520-550 CE).&lt;ref name="crit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crit.org.in/2004/09/suburban-caves-proposal/|title=Suburban Caves Proposal|date=1 September 2004|publisher=Collective Research Initiatives trust, Mumbai|accessdate=2009-11-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508102425/http://crit.org.in/2004/09/suburban-caves-proposal/|archivedate=8 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The caves were originally cut by Buddhist monks.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Most of the early rock-cut temples and rock-art in India was created by Buddhist monks. The monks were the missionaries of the revolutionary message of the Buddha and the best places to spread the new message where the nodes of trade routes. Maharashtra and many of its hills in the Western Ghats fit their purpose. The monks would dig out prayer halls or chaitya-grihas in the caves, while building votive stupas and dwelling places for themselves. Here they would meditate and influence the passing traders and anyone else who happened by. The hills around Mumbai were at the juncture of the sea trade routes. During the occupation of the khaneri caves, the Buddhist monks found another location where they created a hall of paintings. The cave was created by the Buddhist monks and then they hired travelling Persians to paint.

The name of the cave Mandapeshwar means Hall of Lord.

The sculptures in these caves are estimated to have been carved out at the same period as of those seen in the more splendid [[Jogeshwari Caves]]. It contained the largest Mandapa and a prominent Garbagriha.

This cave has seen through time, World war (when the soldiers used it), General people used to stay, Initial Portuguese used it as a place of prayer. These caves were witness to a series of invasions in the surrounding areas by different rulers and each time the caves were used for a different reason, sometimes even for things like housing by the armies or sometimes by refugees. During this period the monolithic paintings were badly defaced. After the invasion of the marathas in this area in the year 1739, for years this area was deserted.

Somewhere in time the caves were again discovered, it under the protection of Indian Archaeology Society.

Most of what can be seen on the walls now are just broken down remains which are sad reminders of its glorious past. The church (IC Church) and its graveyard are situated above the cave precincts. There are ruins of an old structure above the caves. These ruins belonged to a much older church built in 1544. This ruins is also under protection of Indian Archaeology Society.

There are four rock-cut shrines in Mumbai:  Elephanta Caves, Jogeshwari Caves, Mahakali Caves, Mandapeshwar Caves. All four caves have the same sculptures. The sculptures at Mandapeshwar were created beginning in the late Gupta Empire, or some time after.
Elephanta Island was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 to preserve the artwork. {{citation needed|date = October 2012}}

Mandpeshwer caves have sculptures of Nataraja, Sadashiva and a splendid sculpture of Ardhanarishvara. It also has Ganesha, Brahma and Vishnu statuettes. These works depicted the mythical tales of the Hindu gods and goddesses. Even today an elaborate sculpture representing the marriage of Shiva with Parvati may be viewed from the large square window at the south end of these caves. The caves are declared as an archaeological heritage site and therefore are protected under law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asimumbaicircle.com/images/list-of-protected-monuments-n-forts.pdf |title=List of the protected monuments of Mumbai Circle district-wise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"ਤਜ ਮਸੰਦ, ਪ੍ਰਭੁ ਏਕ ਜਪ, ਯਹ ਬਿਬੇਕ ਤਹਿਂ ਕੀਨ." (ਗੁਰੁਸੋਭਾ) "ਜੌ ਕਰ ਸੇਵ ਮਸੰਦਨ ਕੀ, ਕਹਿਂ ਆਨ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦ ਸਭੈ ਮੁਹਿ ਦੀਜੈ." (੩੩ ਸਵੈਯੇ)

&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is unclear when the ''Masand'' system started. It began with [[Guru Amar Das]] in some accounts,&lt;ref name="Farhadian2015p342"/&gt; by [[Guru Ram Das]] in other accounts,&lt;ref name="MittalThursby2006p244"/&gt; or [[Guru Arjan]] by still other accounts.&lt;ref&gt;History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1469-1606 C.E Volume 1, Surjit Singh Gandhi (2007), Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, Page 321&lt;/ref&gt;  A Masand was appointed for each religious administrative unit called the [[Sikh Manji]], a system that was founded by [[Guru Amar Das]].&lt;ref name=cole20&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Owen Cole|author2=Piara Singh Sambhi|title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIC_MgJ5RMUC&amp;pg=PA22| year=1995| publisher= Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-13-4|pages=20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p29"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

The ''Masand'' system was critical in empowering Sikhism with an independent economic resource pool, that helped pay for ''Gurdwara'' (temple) building, for building a Sikh army and the upkeep of Sikh soldiers, as well routine expenses such as ''langar'' (kitchen) which offered a free meal to visitors to the Sikh temples.&lt;ref name="MittalThursby2006p244"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sushil Mittal|author2=Gene Thursby|title=Religions of South Asia: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTqDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT244 |year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-59321-7|pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manji and Masand system of revenue collection for Sikh temples and other purposes was a source of major dispute between the Sikh Gurus and the Mughal Emperors. For example, [[Aurangzeb]] seized the tithe collections by the ''Masands'' for use by the Mughal treasury, and demolished Sikh temples throughout Punjab to emphasize the Islamic character of the Mughal empire.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p53"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|date=8 August 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition of Masands==
Slowly, Masands became corrupt and start treating themselves as Gurus. They started collecting money for personal motives. When Guru Gobind Singh got this news, he captured such Masands and punished them.&lt;ref&gt;Page 135, The History of Sikh Gurus, Prithi Pal Singh, Lotus Press, Jan 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Gobind Singh ordered Sikhs not to recognize or befriend the Masands and their deputies and wrote a Hymn against Masands which is incorporated in [[33 Savaiye]] of [[Dasam Granth]].&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from Savaiya 28, Savaiya 29, [[33 Savaiye]], [[Dasam Granth]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following is line from composition:

'''Ming yun''' ({{zh|t=命運|p=mìng yùn}}) is a concept of the personal life and destiny in the [[Chinese folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lizhu, Na. 2013. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ming'' is "life" or "[[Ṛta|right]]", the given status of life, and ''yùn'' defines "circumstance" and "individual choice"; ''mìng'' is given and influenced by the transcendent force ''[[Tiān]]'' (天), that is the same as the "divine right" (''tiān mìng'') of ancient rulers as identified by [[Mencius]].&lt;ref&gt;Lizhu, Na. 2013. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Personal destiny (''mìng yùn'') is thus perceived as both fixed (the status of life) and flexible, open-ended (the individual choice in matters of ''[[bào yìng]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Lizhu, Na. 2013. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mufti''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʌ|f|t|i}}; {{lang-ar|مفتي}}) is an [[Islam]]ic scholar who interprets and expounds Islamic law ([[Sharia]] and [[fiqh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=mufti| url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mufti| publisher=thefreedictionary| accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muftis are jurists qualified to give authoritative legal opinions known as [[fatwa]]s.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite book|author=William L. Cleveland, Martin Bunton|title=A History of the Modern Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_JMDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA561|page=561|publisher=Westview Press|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, they were members of the [[ulama]] ranking above [[qadi]]s.&lt;ref name=Cleveland/&gt;

==Background history==
With the introduction of the secular court system in the 19th century, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] councils began to enforce criminal legislation, in order to emphasize their position as part of the new executive. This creation of the hierarchical secular judiciary did not displace the original Shari'a courts.

[[Shari'a]] justice developed along lines comparable to what happened to the organization of secular justice: greater bureaucratization, more precise legal circumscription of jurisdiction, and the creation of a hierarchy. This development began in 1856.

Until the Qadi’s Ordinance of 1856, the qadis were appointed by the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] and were part of the Ottoman religious judiciary. This Ordinance recommends the consultation of muftis and [[ulama]]. In practice, the sentences of qadis usually were checked by muftis appointed to the courts. Other important decisions were also checked by the mufti of the Majlis al-Ahkdm or by a council of ulama connected with it. It is said that if the local qadi and mufti disagreed, it became customary to submit the case to the authoritative Grand Mufti.

Later, in 1880, the new Shari'a Courts Ordinance introduced the hierarchical judiciary. Through the Ministry of Justice, parties could appeal to the Cairo Shari'a Court against decisions of provincial qadis and ni'ibs. Here, parties could appeal to the Shari'a Court open to the Shaykh al-Azhar and the [[Grand Mufti]], where other persons could be added.

Lastly, judges were to consult the muftis appointed to their courts whenever a case was not totally clear to them. If the problem was not solved, the case had to be submitted to the [[Grand Mufti]], whose [[fatwa]] was binding on the [[qadi]].&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Rudolph. "Islamic and Secular Criminal Law in Nineteenth Century Egypt: The Role and Function of the Qadi". ''Islamic Law and Society'' 4, no. 1 (1997): 70–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==

A mufti will generally go through a course in ''iftaa'', the issuance of ''fatwa'', and the person should fulfill the following conditions set by scholars in order that he may be able to issue verdicts (fatwas):&lt;ref&gt;[http://spa.qibla.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=4980&amp;CATE=22 Reaching the status of mufti] by Abdurrahman ibn Yusuf Mangera.&lt;/ref&gt; Requirements also vary by country and sect. 

# Knowing [[Arabic]], (The relevant and required texts are in Arabic)
# Mastering the study of principles of Islamic [[jurisprudence]],
# Mastering the study of Maqasid ash-Shari`ah (Objectives of Shari`ah),
# Mastering the study of [[Hadith]],
# Mastering legal maxims.

==Relationship==

In the 1800s,and still seen today, Muslims relied on building trust with people and forging partnerships, a very important aspect of Islamic life. The mufti was an example of this. In a time where people were often self-financed and independent, kinship often substituted for markets where preexisting bonds of trust facilitated cooperative ventures. These kin-based partnerships had many limitations. For example, if seeking a mufti's advice, the wealth and relationship of the family to the Mufti can cause seniority and sentiment to dictate decisions. Hence, there was social gains from institutions supportive of these cooperative ventures across these groups. This dependency on trust, and personal relationships has been said to have been the cause of the [[Middle East]]'s descent from its Golden Commercial Age.&lt;ref&gt;Kuran, T. (2011). The long divergence: How Islamic law held back the Middle East. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==European parallels==

According to [[University of Pennsylvania]] professor George Makdisi, the term ''mufti'' is a direct equivalent of the later western term ''professor'', meaning one who is qualified to profess independent opinion on a subject (same as ''fatwa''). According to him, this was the highest level of academic credentials in classical Islamic academic tradition, above ''mudarris'' (doctor meaning teacher), and ''faqih'' (meaning Master)--a hierarchy later adopted in Western academic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;George Makdisi (1989) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/604423 Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disagreement and Radicalization==

The process to become a mufti is not standardized, and varies from country to country and sect to sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azhar.edu.eg/shariaa-qanon-tafahna/|title=الشريعة و القانون - بتفهنا الاشراف &gt; الرئيسية|website=www.azhar.edu.eg|language=ar-EG|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Muftis, as interpreters of religious law, often issue differing and conflicting [[Fatwa|fatwas]].

A Sydney Mufti compared unveiled women to "uncovered meat," though the Islamic body of the area attempted to disavow his statements. He has since gained popularity and raised his status in neighboring New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10409156|title=Radical mufti finds backing here|last=Collins|first=Simon Collins, Simon|date=2006-11-03|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ping Sien Si - 007 Muzha (deity) (16134811772).jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Muzha]]

'''Muzha''' ({{zh|c=木吒|p=Mùzha}}) is a figure in [[Chinese mythology]] and a god in [[Chinese traditional religion]].

Muzha appears in some works including ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' and ''[[Journey to the West]]''. According to folklore, Muzha was born a human during the end of the [[Shang dynasty]] to General [[Li Jing (deity)|Li Jing]]. He is a disciple of the [[Bodhisattva]]s [[Samantabhadra]] and [[Guanyin]]. He had two brothers, [[Nezha]] and [[Jinzha]].

==Appearance in Fengshen Yanyi==
In the classic Chinese novel ''Fengshen Yanyi''. Muzha is the second son of Li Jing and [[Lady Yin]]. In appearance, Muzha is seen wearing a small top knot, a silk sash, linen shoes, and a cotton like garment. Thus, Muzha was seen as a celestial being — such as that of a superiorman — in appearance.

For many years, Muzha had left his father, Li Jing, to study under Superiorman Universal Converter of White Egret Cave. Following the rebirth of Nezha, and the near death of Li Jing, Li Jing would  run into Muzha — as to save his life. Muzha would react with great anger towards Nezha and would soon battle it out with his renowned long sword against the fire-tipped spear. Soon enough during their fierce duel, Li Jing would try to make another escape; this was the point in which Muzha would be defeated by Nezha's golden brick — which thrust him to the ground due to its great weight. Following this point, Muzha would later present himself before Li Resounding, one of four superiormen of Nine Dragon Island. , Muzha chose to immediately kill Li Resounding at the first sign of defiance towards his words. Muzha would remain as a celestial protector of the Western Foothills with Nezha and Jinzha following this point.

The '''Nyah Kur''' (known in [[Thai language|Thai]] as {{lang|th|[[wikt:ชาวบน|ชาวบน]]}}, ''Chao Bon'') are an [[ethnic group]] native to [[Thailand]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. Closely related to the [[Mon people]], the Nyah Kur are the descendants of the Mon of [[Dvaravati]] who did not flee westward or assimilate when their empire fell under the influence of the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] when [[Suryavarman I]] gained the throne in the early 11th century.&lt;ref name=PanHla&gt;{{cite book |last=Hla |first=Nai Pan |authorlink= |title=The Significant Role of the Mon Language and Culture in Southeast Asia (part 1) |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/34786983/8/REMNANTS-OF-THE-DVARAVATI-OLD-MON-PEOPLE |accessdate=18 September 2013 |year=1992 |publisher=Institute for the Study of Cultures of Asia and Africa, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies |location=Tokyo, Japan |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Mon were believed to be one of the earliest people of continental Southeast Asia where they founded some of the earliest recorded civilizations in the region including the Dvaravati in Central Thailand, Sri Gotapura in Central Laos, [[Hariphunchai]] in Northern Thailand and the [[Thaton Kingdom]]. Dvaravati was among the first to receive Theravada missionaries from Sri Lanka in contrast to Hindu contemporaries, the Khmers and Chams. The Mon adapted the [[Pallava script]] to their language and the oldest Mon script was found in a cave in modern Saraburi dating around 550 AD. At the turn of the first millennium, the Mon came under constant pressure due to the [[Tai people|Tai]] migrations from the north and Khmer invasions from the east. When Suryavarman I, the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] heir to the throne of the [[Lavo Kingdom]], also became ruler of the [[Khmer Empire]], the vast majority of the Mon of Dvaravati fled west to other Mon lands, were taken as slaves or assimilated to the new culture.&lt;ref name=PanHla/&gt;

However a small remnant remained in the remote jungles of the [[Khorat Plateau]].&lt;ref name=ConsArticle/&gt; Little is known of their history. When they were discovered by western scholars in the early 20th century, it was variously assumed that they were part of the [[Lawa people|Lawa]] or [[Kuy people|Kuy]] ethnic groups. It was not until 1970 that their language was determined to be directly descended from [[Old Mon]], and in fact, more similar to Old Mon than the modern Mon of their brethren in present-day Burma and Western Thailand.&lt;ref name=PanHla/&gt; Although Nyah Kur and modern Mon are not mutually intelligible and the [[endonym]] ''Mon'' is unknown to the Nyah Kur, having remained isolated in the mountains between Central and Northeastern Thailand allowed the Nyah Kur to maintain their own ethnic identity which developed independently from the Mon during the last thousand years yet in some respects shows remarkable similarity to modern Mon culture.&lt;ref name=ConsArticle/&gt;&lt;ref name=PanHla/&gt;

Today, the Nyah Kur live in small villages distributed in a north-south strip that crosses [[Phetchabun Province|Phetchabun]], [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province|Nakhon Ratchasima]] and [[Chaiyaphum Province|Chaiyaphum]] provinces, the majority living in Chaiyaphum. The Thai refer to them as ชาวบน meaning "upper people" or "sky people". Their self-designation is ''Nyah Kur'', which in the Nyah Kur language means "mountain folk" and in modern Mon translates to "hill plantation people".&lt;ref name=PanHla/&gt;

==Language==
The [[Nyah Kur language]], as a direct descendant of Old Mon, is a sister language to the [[Mon language]] of [[Burma]], the two of which constitute the only languages of the [[Monic languages|Monic]] branch of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]].&lt;ref name=SEALANG&gt;Southeast Asian Languages [http://sealang.net/mk/monic.htm Mon-Khmer Languages Project]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 estimate places the number of speakers at approximately 1500 people with no monolinguals.&lt;ref name=ethnologue&gt;Nyah Kur [http://www.ethnologue.com/language/cbn reference] at Ethnologue (17th ed., 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects spoken in Phetchabun and Nakhon Ratchasima have limited intelligibility with that of Chaiyaphum and are nearly extinct. Even in Chaiyaphum, the language is spoken mostly among older Nyah Kur, while others prefer to identify as Thai and speak either the local [[Isan language]] or the national [[Thai language|Thai]] standard.&lt;ref name=ethnologue/&gt; Nyah Kur no longer has its own script and when written, employs the [[Thai alphabet]] is used. In 1984, a Nyah Kur-Thai-English dictionary was published.

==Culture==
In modern times, the Nyah Kur have had increasing contact with the surrounding Thai and Kuy population resulting modernization, migration and integration of cultures. Nyah Kur villages today are a mix of ethnic Nyah Kur and Thai-Lao families.&lt;ref name=ConsArticle/&gt; The Nyah Kur were historically Animists but today most practice Theravada Buddhism although traditional spirits, including Jao Paw Kun Dahn and Jao Paw Samian, are still worshiped.&lt;ref name=ConsArticle/&gt; The ''Pah Re Re'', a traditional courting celebration similar to that of the Mon,&lt;ref name=PanHla/&gt; is still practiced, usually around the time of the Thai [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]].&lt;ref name=ConsArticle/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10736">'''Presbyterian worship''' documents worship practices in [[Presbyterian]] churches; in this case, the practices of the many churches descended from the Scottish Presbyterian church at the time of the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]].

==Theology of Worship==

Historically, the driving principle in the development of the standards of Presbyterian worship is the [[Regulative principle of worship]], which specifies that (in worship), what is not commanded is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], Chapter XXI, paragraph I&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to those detailed in the ''History'' section below, Presbyterians also historically have held the following Worship positions:
* Only two [[sacraments]]:
** [[Baptism]], in which they hold to the paedo-baptist (i.e. [[Infant baptism]] as well as baptising unbaptised adults) and the [[Aspersion]] (sprinkling) or [[Affusion]] (pouring) positions, rather than the [[Baptism by immersion|Immersion]] position (although Immersion is valid)
** The [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] (also known as [[Eucharist|Communion]] or the [[Eucharist]])

==History==

===Worship at the time of the Reformation===

At the start of the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1560 there was no Reformed standard for worship in Scotland, so the shape the Church initially took was dependent on local Protestant patrons.&lt;ref name="Church History of Scotland"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.H.S. Burleigh |title=A Church History of Scotland |pages= 160–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing from exile in [[Geneva]], [[John Knox]] described in detail what should be done at weekly worship in a 'Letter of Wholesome Councell' dated 1556. Protestant preachers fleeing [[Marian Persecutions|Marian persecutions]] in England brought with them [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]'s second [[Book of Common Prayer]] (of 1552), which was commended by the [[Lords of the Congregation]]. Knox too initially supported it (indeed reportedly, he had influenced aspects of it). However, before leaving Geneva and with the encouragement of [[John Calvin]], he had written his own '[[Book of Common Order]]' and it was this that was printed and approved by the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] of 1562. Enlarged, it was reprinted with the Confession and the Psalms in metre in 1564, and it remained the standard until replaced with the [[Westminster Directory]] in 1643.&lt;ref name="Church History of Scotland"/&gt;

The [[Regulative principle of worship]] (see ''Theology of Worship'', above) saw many of the previous practices (inherited from the [[Roman Catholic]] church) cast aside.  Two major points which might be unusual by today's standards were:

* [[Exclusive psalmody]]: the doctrine that, in worship, only the Psalms (from the Bible) were to be sung; singing other words was only to be done outside the worship service&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], Chapter XXI, paragraph V&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[A cappella]] singing: the doctrine that no instruments were to be used in worship other than the human voice

Both of these were introduced, at least partly, to prevent the singing of hymns to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint|the Saints]].

===Introduction of Continuous Singing===
In early times the common method of singing in Presbyterian worship, was [[lining out]], where a [[Precentor#Presbyterian precentors|precentor]] read or sang one line and the congregation repeated it after them. The [[Directory of Public Worship]],&lt;ref&gt;''Of the Singing of Psalms'', [[Directory of Public Worship]]&lt;/ref&gt; says this:

:That the whole congregation may join herein, every one that can read is to have a psalm book; and all others, not disabled by age or otherwise, are to be exhorted to learn to read. But for the present, where many in the congregation cannot read, it is convenient that the minister, or some other fit person appointed by him and the other ruling officers, do read the psalm, line by line, before the singing thereof.

It appears from the wording that this was a practical measure in 1650, not a doctrinal position. Lining out was used by other denominations as well for the practical reasons that many people were not sufficiently literate or because of a lack of hymnals.

From around 1720 onwards, many advocated the introduction of continuous (or regular) singing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/fall97/sing.html The Regular Singing Controversy: The Case Against Lining-Out], Linda R. Ruggles&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous singing was introduced into many Presbyterian churches worldwide, even those that consider themselves to be following the traditional Presbyterian line on worship; there are some, who still practise lining out, such as the [[Steelites]].

===Introduction of Hymns===
{{see also|Exclusive psalmody}}
In this context, "hymns" means hymns that are not part of the Bible; the word "hymn" is used in the Bible, but it is claimed by advocates of exclusive psalmody that this refers to a specific type of psalm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prca.org/sermons/col_3_16.htm Psalms, hymns, and Spiritual songs], Rev. Ronald Hanko (PRCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

After singing psalms for 200 years, in 1861 the [[Church of Scotland]] first formally adopted hymns, with the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] doing the same in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/RSISBELL/keddie7.html Sing the Lord's Song! Part 7], John W. Keddie&lt;/ref&gt;  Hymns and other extra-biblical words are now widely used in Presbyterian circles; the details vary from denomination to denomination.

===Introduction of Instruments===
{{see also|A cappella}}

In the early nineteenth century, the Revd R. William Ritchie of St. Andrew's Church, [[Glasgow]], attempted to introduce an organ into his church, but was informed by the [[Presbytery (church polity)|Presbytery]] of Glasgow that "the use of organs in the public worship of God is contrary to the law of the land and constitution of our Established Church."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/glasgow/anec121.htm http://www.electricscotland.com/history/glasgow/anec121.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, the Revd Robert Lee introduced a [[Pump organ|harmonium]] into worship at [[Greyfriars Kirk]], [[Edinburgh]]. Lee defended instrumental music at the 1864 [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]], who declared that "such innovations should only be put down when they interfered with the peace of the Church and harmony of congregations". A pipe organ was subsequently installed in Greyfriars, and first used in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence James Moore, ''Sing to the Lord a New Song: A Study of Changing Musical Practices in the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, 1861 - 1901''. Available at [http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp49.29082005/02whole.pdf http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp49.29082005/02whole.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830091825/http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp49.29082005/02whole.pdf |date=2007-08-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present Practice==
Presbyterian churches practice worship the Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This occurs every Sunday( Lords Day). Other services often occur at other times of the week as well as meetings for prayer and Bible Study or simply mid week chapel with communion being served. Most mainline Presbyterians utilize Hymns and with some additions to more modern worship songs being introduced or part of a blended service".Most modern day Presbyterians do not strictly sing Psalms" as some once did. John Calvin in Geneva used biblical psalms almost exclusively in the Genevan Psalter, though it contained some gospel canticles and catechetical songs. This psalter was to become a prototype for Reformed worship, but Calvin did not have any objection to the use of original hymns in other churches, and he did not appeal to scripture in his preface to the psalter justifying his preference for the Psalms.[1]:42, 45

Other Presbyterian denominations hold exclusively to the psalms in metre.  The psalms in metre are still esteemed by worship leaders in the Church of Scotland while also recognizing the contribution of authors of hymns and worship songs from historic times to the contemporary.  
Use of contemporary worship songs is employed by some more independent or evangelical type of congregations within Presbyterianism.

John Calvin's direction for celebration of Holy Communion was every Lord's Day.&lt;ref&gt;At Least Weekly by Michael S. Horton http://www.midamerica.edu/resources/journal/11/horton.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of the Puritan influence upon some Presbyterians, worship and the celebration of the Eucharist became lessened to once per quarter.   This  has changed in most mainline  Presbyterian  denominational churches and celebration of Communion ranges from  once a quarter/ once a month to every Sunday or Lord's Day Service.  This movement is carried forward by those who believe that Word and Sacrament should be present in each service of worship. The Real Presence of Christ (spiritually) is highly viewed and understood. Presbyterians strongly disagree with simply the symbolic or memorial service as taught by many Anabaptists, but do not go as far as the consubstantiation view of Lutherans.   Presbyterians hold the "Spiritual Real Presence" of Christ in the sacrament of Communion. Today most mainline Presbyterian churches administer Communion by either passing the elements or by intinction.

Presbyterians admit the authority of the [[Presbyterian polity|Presbytery]] or [[Synod]] over all worship services in order to ensure that the worship of God, Father Son and Holy Spirit, is carried on properly and regularly in each congregation within the 'bounds' (area of jurisdiction).  This is done by the appointment of Ministers by the Presbytery, who can also dismiss (depose) the Ministers should their conduct of regular worship be unsatisfactory.  In modern times an effective presbytery is a forum for discussing and disseminating approaches to worship, always recognizing the supreme authority of the Word of God (Old and New Testaments of the Bible).

In the Church of Scotland the cancellation of any regular service of worship is a very serious matter.  Services are carried out even by small rural congregations in the most extreme weather and under conditions of power failure and other privations.  Elders, teaching and ruling, make every effort to ensure continuity or worship in every parish of Scotland at the published times.

==Early life==
Kavanaugh was born to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/a_fundraising_feast_for_relativitys_ryan_kavanaugh_at_adls_annual_entertain Jewish Journal: "A fundraising feast for Relativity's Ryan Kavanaugh at ADL's annual entertainment dinner"] by Danielle Berrin, October 12, 2011; accessed March 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2011/film/news/jewish-is-the-new-red-1118044473 ''Variety Magazine'': "Jewish is the new red"], October 15, 2011; accessed March 18, 2014. ''"Usually the person standing here is a Jew. I always get the question — Ryan Kavanaugh, red hair — but I'm here once again to assure you I'm Jewish on both sides ... until my mom admits she had an affair with the milkman or the mailman I will stay Jewish on both sides."''&lt;/ref&gt; in Los Angeles, California, where he was raised in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] neighborhood, and attended [[Brentwood School (Los Angeles, California)|Brentwood High School]]. His mother, Leslie (Levin),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/ryan_c_kavanaugh_born_1974_12292835&lt;/ref&gt; is a real estate broker, and his father, Jack Konitz, a dentist turned businessman, was born in Germany and later changed his surname to "Kavanaugh" before his son's birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/9c2a33a8-b34a-11e0-9af2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2wLe6neHP Ryan Kavanaugh profile], ft.com; accessed March 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2010/03/kavanaugh-201003 Ryan Kavanaugh profile], vanityfair.com; accessed March 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After attending [[UCLA]], Kavanaugh founded a small [[venture capital]] firm, which struggled in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] and was eventually wound up.&lt;ref name=Malibu/&gt;

==Career==

===Relativity Media===
{{Main|Relativity Media}}
Kavanaugh founded Relativity Media after briefly serving as a consultant to other small businesses and venture capitalists.&lt;ref name=Malibu/&gt; In the late 1990s, he asked his father for a $50,000 loan to start his own hedge fund; his father declined, but this did not dissuade Ryan, whose aim was to use mathematical tools to connect financing and movie projects in a more efficient manner than traditional [[Hollywood]] finance. At Relativity, he created what is now known as "the model", a [[monte carlo method|monte carlo model]] designed to predict the odds of a given film being successful. No film at Relativity is given a green light unless the model predicts a high probability of profitability. During Relativity's first year of operation, Kavanaugh executed what was considered to be an innovative finance deal for [[Marvel Studios]] which led them to create the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Kavanaugh went on to structure business deals for such companies as: [[Sony]], [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[Warner Brothers]], among many others. Kavanaugh has acquired a number of assets, including the marketing and distribution operations of [[John Malone]]'s [[Liberty Media]]/[[Liberty Starz|Starz]] film unit [[Overture Films]], and reaching a first of its kind TV pay deal with [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name=Malibu/&gt;

Kavanaugh forged a marketing, promotional, and production partnership with [[Sir Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Mobile]] and [[Virgin Produced]], in which Relativity owns a stake. Kavanaugh also brokered an innovative cross-platform marketing partnership with [[Clear Channel Radio]], the media company with the most reach in the United States. He was also instrumental in launching Relativity's historic partnership with China's [[Huaxia Film Distribution|Huaxia Film Distribution Co. Ltd.]] to become equal partners in Sky Land Entertainment with private-equity firm [[SAIF Partners]] and IDG China Media to handle production and distribution of films in China and U.S. This marks the first strategic alliance between a Hollywood film production entity and a Chinese government-sponsored company. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Relativity has produced, distributed, and/or structured financing for more than 200 motion pictures, generating more than $17 billion in worldwide box office revenue and earning 60 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations.&lt;ref name=casting&gt;{{cite web|title=CASTING HEATS UP ON RELATIVITY MEDIA'S CURRENTLY TITLED OUT OF THE FURNACE|url=http://www.zamm.com/articles/news/casting-heats-up-on-relativity-medias-currently-titled-out-of-the-furnace|publisher=Zamm My Movies|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=furniture/&gt; In 2012, Kavanaugh brokered a deal in which billionaire [[Ron Burkle]] will partner with Relativity and invest $800 million in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bond|first=Paul|title=Ron Burkle Closes Multiple Investments in Relativity Media|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ron-burkle-relativity-media-ryan-kavanaugh-284085|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Chairman and the largest shareholder, Kavanaugh will retain control of Relativity and control the majority of the board of directors of Relativity.&lt;ref name="HR Burkle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Block|first=Alex Ben|title=Ryan Kavanaugh Lawyer Threatens ''New Yorker'' Over 'Egregious' Ron Burkle profile (exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/ryan-kavanaugh-relativity-lawsuit-ron-burkle-new-yorker-375528|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Relativity Media expanded into television (Relativity Television), Sports Management (Relativity Sports) and Digital Content (Relativity Digital), with the aim of leverage divisions to create a global media company.&lt;ref name=ForbesWatched /&gt;

[[File:Taipei Cultural Mosque - Prayer Times.JPG|thumb|Salat times at [[Taipei Cultural Mosque]] in [[Taiwan]].]]

'''Salat times''' refers to times when [[Muslims]] perform prayers (''[[salat]]''). The term is primarily used for the five daily prayers plus the [[Friday prayer]]. According to Muslim beliefs, the salat times were taught by [[Allah]] to [[Muhammad]].

Prayer times are standard for [[Muslims]] in the world, especially the [[fard]] prayer times. They depend on the condition of the [[Sun]] and geography. There are varying opinions regarding the exact salat times, the [[Madh'hab|schools of Islamic thought]] differing in minor details. All schools agree that any given prayer cannot be performed before its stipulated time.

== Five daily prayers ==

The five daily prayers are obligatory (''[[fard]]'') and they are performed at times determined essentially by the position of the Sun in the sky. Hence, salat times vary at different locations on the Earth.

=== Fajr (dawn) ===
{{main|Fajr prayer}}

Fajr begins at ''subh saadiq'' -- true [[dawn]] or the beginning of twilight, when the morning light appears across the full width of the sky -- and ends at sunrise. Wudhu needed.

=== Dhuhr (midday) ===
{{Main|Zuhr prayer}}

The time interval for offering the Zuhr or Dhuhr prayer starts after the sun passes its [[zenith]] and lasts until 20 min (approx) before the call for the Asr prayer is to be given. There is thus a long period of time within which this prayer can be offered, but people usually make their prayer within two hours after the Azan has been announced from Mosque.{{According to whom|date=November 2017}}{{clarify|date=January 2018}} This prayer needs to be given in the middle of the work-day, and people normally make their prayers during their lunch break.

Shia (Jafari madhab) differs regarding end of zuhr time. Per all major Jafari jusrists, end of dhuhr time is about 10 minutes before sunset, the time that belongs exclusively to asr prayer. Dhuhr and asr time overlaps, apart from first 5 minutes of dhuhr, which is exclusively delegated for it. Asr prayer cannot be offered before zuhr in the zuhr time.

=== Asr (afternoon) ===
{{Main|Asr prayer}}

The Asr prayer starts when the shadow of an object is the same length as the object itself (or, according to [[Hanafi]] fiqh{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
, twice its length) plus the shadow length at zuhr, and lasts till sunset. Asr can be split into two sections; the preferred time is before the sun starts to turn orange, while the time of necessity is from when the sun turns orange until sunset.

Shia (Jafari madhab) differs regarding start of asr time. Per all major Jafari jusrists{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, start of asr time is about 5 minutes after the time of sun passing through zenith, that time belongs exclusively to dhuhr prayer. Time for dhuhr and asr prayers overlap, but the zuhr prayer must be offered before asr, except the time about 10 minutes before sunset, which is delegated exclusively to asr. In the case that the mentioned time is reached, asr prayer should be offered first (ada - on time) and dhuhr (kada - make up, late) prayer should be offered after asr.

=== Maghrib (sunset) ===
{{Main|Maghrib prayer}}

The Maghrib prayer begins when the sun sets, and lasts till the red light has left the sky in the west. It usually  lasts for about 18 to 20 minutes from the start of Isha Time.

=== Isha (night) ===
{{Main|Isha prayer}}

The Isha'a or isha prayer starts when the red light is gone from the western sky, and lasts until the rise of the "white light" (fajr sadiq) in the east. The preferred time for Isha is before midnight, meaning halfway between sunset and sunrise.

== Time calculation ==

[[File:Equation of time.svg|thumb|Equation of time]]

[[File:Sun-declination.jpg|thumb|Declination of the sun]]

To calculate prayer times two [[astronomical]] measures are necessary, the declination of the sun and the difference between clock time and [[sundial clock]]. This difference being the result of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit and the inclination of its axis, it is called the Equation of time. The declination of the sun is the angle between sun's rays and the equator plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/SunApprox.php Approximate Solar Coordinates]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above measures, to calculate prayer times for a specific location we need its spherical coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://praytimes.org/calculation/#Calculating_Prayer_Times Calculating Prayer Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following &lt;math&gt; T_Z &lt;/math&gt; is the time zone, and &lt;math&gt;T_E&lt;/math&gt; the time equation value. &lt;math&gt; Lng &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; are the [[Longitude]] and the [[Latitude]] of the considered point, respectively. &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Declination]] of the Sun for a given date.

An other important equation gives the time difference between when the sun hits its highest point in the sky (Dhuhr time) and any other angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, as follow:
&lt;math&gt; T(\alpha) = {1 \over 15} \arccos \left( {-\sin(\alpha)-\sin(L)*\sin(D) \over \cos(L)*\cos(D)} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

* Midday (Dhuhr) time is easily obtained. When the sun reaches the mid sky, time is given by: &lt;math&gt;T_{Dhuhr} = 12 + T_Z - (Lng/15 + T_E)&lt;/math&gt;
* Sunrise (Chorok) and Sunset (Maghreb) time are given by &lt;math&gt; T(0.833) &lt;/math&gt;, in fact it is the astronomical sunset/sunrise that occurs for &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. 0.833 is a slight correction that gives the actual time. So &lt;math&gt;T_{Chorok} = T_{Dhuhr} - T(0.833)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{Sunset} = T_{Dhuhr} + T(0.833)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we consider the elevation of the point we should add another correction to the constant &lt;math&gt; 0.0347 \times \sqrt{h} &lt;/math&gt;.

* For Fajr and Isha many conventions about the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; exist. It is of 17 and 18 degrees respectively for Fadjr and Isha prayers according to the [[Muslim World League]].
* For Asr time according to the majority of Muslim schools, including [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]], [[Ja'fari]], and [[Hanbali]], it is when the length of an object shadows became equal to its length plus the length of its shadow at noon. The Hanafi schools states that the time of Asr is when an object's shadow reaches two times the length of the object itself, plus the length of its shadow at noon. The time the shadow of an object reaches &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; times its length is given by the equation: &lt;math&gt;A(T) = {1 \over 15} \arccos \left( {\sin(\arccot(t+\tan(L-D)))-\sin(L)*\sin(D) \over \cos(L)*\cos(D)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.
* It is called for the Maghrib prayer when the sun is completely folded behind the horizon, plus 3 minutes by precaution.

Technological advances have allowed for products such as software-enhanced azan clocks that use a combination of GPS and microchips to calculate these formulas. This allows Muslims to live further away from mosques than previously possible, as they no longer need to rely solely on a [[muezzin]] in order to keep an accurate prayer schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorman|first=Carma R.|date=2009|title=Religion on Demand: Faith-based Design|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=1|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Friday prayer ==
{{Main|Jumu'ah}}

The Friday prayer replaces the dhuhr prayer performed on the other six days of the week. The precise time for this congregational prayer varies with the mosque, but in all cases it must be performed after dhuhr and before asr times. If one is unable to join the congregation, then they must pray the dhuhr prayer instead. This salat is compulsory to be done with ja'maat for men. Women have the option to perform Jumm'ah in the mosque or to pray [[zuhr]].

The prayer is performed after Isha (night) prayer, usually in congregation. Eight to twenty [[Rakat|Rakaat]] are typically performed, however, a short rest is taken after every four Rakat.

=== Salatul Janazah ===

Salat-e-Janaza or Namaze Janaza ( Funeral prayer )

The Muslims of the community gather to offer their collective prayers for forgiveness for the dead. This prayer has been generally termed as the Namaze Janaza.The prayer is offered in a particular way with extra (four)Takbirs but there is no Ruku' ( bowing ) and Sajdah (prostrating) It becomes obligatory for every Muslim adult male to perform the funeral prayer upon the death of any Muslim, however when it is performed by the few it will not be obligation for all. Women also can attend the prayer.

'''Saturn''' ({{lang-la|Saturnus}} {{IPA-la|saˈtʊr.nʊs|pron}}) is a god in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], and a character in [[Roman mythology|myth]] as a god of generation, dissolution, plenty, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation. In later developments, he also came to be a god of time. His reign was depicted as a [[Golden Age]] of plenty and peace. The [[Temple of Saturn]] in the [[Forum Romanum|Roman Forum]] housed the state treasury. In December, he was celebrated at what is perhaps the most famous of the [[Roman festivals]], the [[Saturnalia]], a time of feasting, role reversals, free speech, gift-giving and revelry. [[Saturn]] the planet and [[Saturday]] are both named after the god.

==Mythology ==

The Roman land preserved the remembrance of a very remote time during which Saturn and [[Janus]] reigned on the site of the city before its foundation: the Capitol was called {{lang|la|mons Saturnius}}.&lt;ref&gt;B. Liou Gilles "Naissance de la ligue latine. Mythe et cult de fondation" in ''Revue belge de philologie et d' histoire'' '''74''' 1. pp. 73–97: 75. {{doi|10.3406/rbph.1996.4096}}. Citing Festus s.v. Saturnia p. 430 L: "Saturnia Italia, et mons, qui nunc est Capitolinus, Saturnius appellabatur, quod in tutela Saturni esse existimantur. Saturnii quoque dicebantur, qui castrum in imo clivo Capitolino incolebant, ubi ara diacata ei deo ante bellum troianum videtur." And Ovid "Fasti" 6, 31: "A patre dicta meo quondam Saturnia Roma est".&lt;/ref&gt;
The Romans identified Saturn with the Greek [[Cronus]], whose myths were adapted for [[Latin literature]] and [[Roman art]]. In particular, Cronus's role in the genealogy of the Greek gods was transferred to Saturn. As early as [[Lucius Livius Andronicus|Livius Andronicus]] (3rd century BC), [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was called the son of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;''Saturni filius'', frg. 2 in the edition of Baehrens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saturn had two mistresses who represented different aspects of the god. The name of his wife, [[Ops]], the Roman equivalent of Greek [[Rhea (mythology)|''Rhea'']], means "wealth, abundance, resources."&lt;ref&gt;Hans Friedrich Mueller, "Saturn," ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The association with Ops is considered a later development, however, as this goddess was originally paired with [[Consus]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier was Saturn's association with [[Lua (goddess)|Lua]] ("destruction, dissolution, loosening"), a goddess who received the bloodied weapons of enemies destroyed in war.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil "Lua Mater" in ''Déesses latines et mythes védiques'' Bruxelles 1968 1959 pp. 98–115. D. compared this Roman figure with Indian deity Nírŗti.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Saturn's rule, humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in the "Golden Age" described by [[Hesiod]] and [[Ovid]].

==Etymology and epithets==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = By Saturn they seek to represent that power which maintains the cyclic course of times and seasons. This is the sense that the Greek name of that god bears, for he is called [[Cronus|Kronos]], which is the same as [[Chronos]] or [[Time]]. Saturn for his part got his name because he was "sated" with years; the story that he regularly devoured his own children is explained by the fact that time devours the courses of the seasons, and gorges itself "insatiably" on the years that are past. Saturn was enchained by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] to ensure that his circuits did not get out of control, and to constrain him with the bonds of the stars.&lt;br /&gt;—

According to [[Varro]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.64.&lt;/ref&gt; Saturn's name was derived from ''satu'', meaning  "sowing". Even though this etymology looks implausible on linguistic grounds (for the long quantity of the ''a'' in ''Sāturnus'' and also because of the [[epigraphy|epigraphically]] attested form ''Saeturnus'')&lt;ref&gt;CIL I 2nd 449.&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless it does reflect an original feature of the god.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dominique Briquel|Briquel]] p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; A more probable etymology connects the name with Etruscan god ''[[Satre (Etruscan god)|Satre]]'' and placenames such as ''Satria'', an ancient town of Latium, and ''Saturae palus'', a marsh also in Latium. This root may be related to Latin [[wikt:phytonym|phytonym]] ''[[Satureja|satureia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Alessio "Genti e favelle dell' antica Apulia" Taranto Cressati 1949 = ''Archivio Storico Pugliese'' 1949 II 1 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another epithet, variably ''[[Sterculius]]'', ''Stercutus'', and ''Sterces'', referred to his agricultural functions;&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.7.25.&lt;/ref&gt; this derives from ''stercus'',  "dung" or "manure", referring to re-emergence from death to life.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Kaufman in ''Harper's Magazine'', February 2008: ''Wasteland. A journey through the American cloaca.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman farming|Agriculture]] was important to Roman identity, and Saturn was a part of archaic Roman religion and ethnic identity. His name appears in the ancient hymn of the [[Salii|Salian priests]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], ''De verborum significatu'' 432L.&lt;/ref&gt; and his temple was the oldest known to have been recorded by the [[College of Pontiffs|pontiffs]].

[[Quintus Lucilius Balbus]] gives a separate etymology in [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero's]] [[De Natura Deorum|De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)]]. In this interpretation, the agricultural aspect of Saturn would be secondary to his primary relation with time and seasons. Since Time consumes all things, Balbus asserts that the name Saturn comes from the Latin word [[wikt:satis#Latin|''satis'']]; Saturn being an [[anthropomorphic]] representation of [[Time]], which is filled, or satiated, by all things or all generations. Since agriculture is so closely linked to [[seasons]] and therefore an understanding of the cyclical passage of time, it follows that agriculture would then be associated with the deity Saturn.

==Temple==
The temple of Saturn was located at the base of the [[Capitoline Hill]], according to a tradition recorded by Varro&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 52.&lt;/ref&gt; formerly known as ''Saturnius Mons'', and a row of columns from the last rebuilding of the temple still stands.&lt;ref name="Mueller, Saturn, p. 222"&gt;Mueller, "Saturn," p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was consecrated in 497 BC but the ''area Saturni'' was built by king [[Tullus Hostilius]] as confirmed by archaeological studies conducted by E. Gjerstad.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Mélanges A. Grenier'' Bruxelles 1962 pp. 757-762 as cited by Briquel p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; It housed the state treasury ([[aerarium]]) throughout Roman history.

==Festival's time==
The position of Saturn's festival in the [[Roman calendar]] led to his association with concepts of time, especially the temporal transition of the [[New Year]].  In the Greek tradition, Cronus was sometimes conflated with [[Chronus]], "Time," and his devouring of his children taken as an allegory for the passing of generations. The sickle or scythe of [[Father Time]] is a remnant of the agricultural implement of Cronus-Saturn, and his aged appearance represents the waning of the old year with the birth of the new, in antiquity sometimes embodied by [[Aion (deity)|Aion]]. In [[late antiquity]], Saturn is [[syncretism|syncretized]] with a number of deities, and begins to be depicted as winged, as is [[Kairos]], "Timing, Right Time".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel L. Macy, entry on "Father Time," in ''Encyclopedia of Time'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1994), pp. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Roman religion==

===Theology and worship===
[[File:Arch of SeptimiusSeverus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Ruins of the Temple of Saturn (eight columns to the far right) in February 2010, with three columns from the [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus]] (left) and the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] (center)]]

The figure of Saturn is one of the most complex in Roman religion. [[G. Dumézil]] refrained from discussing Saturn in his work on Roman religion on the grounds of insufficient knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''La religion romain archaïque'' Paris 1974 part I chap. 5; Italian translation Milan 1977 p. 244-245.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, his follower [[Dominique Briquel]] has attempted a thorough interpretation of Saturn utilising [[Trifunctional hypothesis|Dumézil's three-functional theory of Indoeuropean religion]], taking the ancient testimonies and the works of A. Brelich and G. Piccaluga as his basis.&lt;ref&gt;D. Briquel "Jupiter, Saturn et le Capitol. Essai de comparaison indoeuropéenne" in ''Revue de l' histoire des religions'' '''198''' 2 1981 pp. 131-162. A. Brelich ''Tre variazioni romane sul tema delle origini'' Roma 1956. G. Piccaluga ''Terminus'' Roma 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difficulty scholars find in studying Saturn is in assessing what is original of his figure and what is due to later hellenising influences. Moreover, some features of the god may be common to Cronus but are nonetheless very ancient and can be considered proper to the Roman god, whereas others are certainly later and arrived after 217 BC, the year in which the Greek customs of the [[Kronia]] were introduced into the Saturnalia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dominique Briquel|Briquel]] 1981 pp. 142 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the features which are definitely authentic of the Roman god, Briquel identifies:

# the time of his festival in the calendar, which corresponds to the date of the consecration of his temple (the Greek Cronia on the other hand took place in June–July);
# his association with ''[[Lua (goddess)|Lua Mater]]'', and
# the location of his cult on the Capitol, which goes back to remote times.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 7. Cited by Briquel above p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

These three elements in Briquel's view indicate that Saturn is a sovereign god. The god's strict relationship with the cults of the Capitoline Hill and in particular with Jupiter are highlighted by the legends concerning the refusal of gods [[Iuventas]] and [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]] to leave their abode in the shrines on the Capitol when the temple of Jupiter was to be built. These two deities correspond to the helper gods of the sovereign in Vedic religion (Briquel refers to [[Dhritarashtra]] and [[Vidura]], the figures of the [[Mahabharata]]) and to the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] and [[Hecatonchires]] in [[Hesiod]]. Whereas the helper gods belong to the second divine generation they become active only at the level of the third in each of the three instances of India, Greece and Rome, where they become a sort of continuation of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Iuventas shows a clear Varunian character in the liaison of Romulus with the ''iuvenes'' the young soldiers; Terminus has a Mitran character even though he shows Varunian traits in allowing the enlargement of the borders (''propagatio finium''): Briquel p. 134 n. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Dumézil postulated a split of the figure of the sovereign god in Indoeuropean religion, which is embodied by Vedic gods [[Varuna]] and [[Mitra]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Mitra-Varuna'' Paris 1940; ''Les dieux souverains des Indo-Europééens'' Paris 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two, the first one shows the aspect of the magic, uncanny, awe inspiring power of creation and destruction, while the second shows the reassuring aspect of guarantor of the legal order in organised social life.  Whereas in Jupiter these double features have coalesced, Briquel sees Saturn as showing the characters of a sovereign god of the [[trifunctional hypothesis|Varunian type]]. His nature becomes evident in his mastership over the annual time of crisis around the winter solstice, epitomised in the power of subverting normal codified social order and its rules, which is apparent in the festival of the [[Saturnalia]], in the mastership of annual fertility and renewal, in the power of annihilation present in his paredra Lua, in the fact that he is the god of a timeless era of plenty and bounty before time, which he reinstates at the time of the yearly crisis of the winter solstice. Also, in Roman and Etruscan reckoning Saturn is a wielder of lightning; no other agricultural god (in the sense of specialized human activity) is one.&lt;ref&gt;Briquel p. 151 citing Pliny II 138–139; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' I 42; XI 259. Saturn's lightningbolts are those of wintertime.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the mastership he has on agriculture and wealth cannot be that of a god of the third function, i.e. of production, wealth, and pleasure, but it stems from his magical lordship over creation and destruction. Although these features are to be found in Greek god Cronus as well, it appears that those features were proper to Roman Saturn's most ancient aspects, such as his presence on the Capitol and his association with Jupiter, who in the stories of the arrival of the [[Pelasgian]]s in the land of the [[Sicels]]&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Anitiquities'' I.19.1; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I.7.27–31&lt;/ref&gt; and that of the [[Argei]] orders human sacrifices to him.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' V.621–662, particularly 626–629.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrifices to Saturn were performed according to "Greek rite" (''[[ritus graecus]]''), with the head uncovered, in contrast to those of other major Roman deities, which were performed ''[[capite velato]]'', "with the head covered." Saturn himself, however, was represented as veiled (''involutus''), as for example in a wall painting from [[Pompeii]] that shows him holding a sickle and covered with a white veil. This feature is in complete accord with the character of a sovereign god of the Varunian type and is common with German god [[Odin]]. Briquel remarks [[Servius]] had already seen that the choice of the Greek rite was due to the fact that the god himself is imagined and represented as veiled, thence his sacrifice cannot be carried out by a veiled man: this is an instance of the reversal of the current order of things typical of the nature of the deity as appears in its festival.&lt;ref&gt;Briquel p. 148 who cites Servius ''Ad Aenaeidem'' III 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch writes his figure is veiled because he is the father of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Briquel p. 148 n. 63 who cites Plutarch ''Quaestiones Romanae'' II.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] notes that the cult statue of Saturn was filled with oil; the exact meaning of this is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 15.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Its feet were bound with wool, which was removed only during the Saturnalia.&lt;ref name = "Macrobius-1.8.5"&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.8.5.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the statue was filled with oil and the feet were bound with wool may relate back to the myth of "The Castration of Uranus".  In this myth Rhea gives Cronus a rock to eat in Zeus' stead, thus tricking Cronus. Although mastership of knots is a feature of Greek origin it is also typical of the Varunian sovereign figure, as apparent e.g. in Odin. Once Zeus was victorious over Cronus, he sets this stone up at Delphi and constantly it is anointed with oil and strands of unwoven wool are placed on it.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves, "The Greek Myths: 1" page 41&lt;/ref&gt;  It wore a red cloak,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''De testimonio animae'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and was brought out of the temple to take part in [[pompa circensis|ritual processions]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Antiquitates Romanae'' 7.72.13.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[lectisternium|lectisternia]]'', banquets at which images of the gods were arranged as guests on couches.&lt;ref name="Mueller, Saturn, p. 222"/&gt; All these ceremonial details identify a sovereign figure. Briquel concludes that Saturn was a sovereign god of a time that the Romans perceived as no longer actual, that of the legendary origins of the world, before civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Briquel p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little evidence exists in Italy for the cult of Saturn outside Rome, but his name resembles that of the Etruscan god [[Satre (Etruscan god)|Satres]].&lt;ref&gt;Found on the [[Piacenza Liver]]; see also [[Martianus Capella]] 1.58. Mueller, "Saturn," p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The potential cruelty of Saturn was enhanced by his identification with [[Cronus]], known for devouring his own children. He was thus used in translation when referring to gods from other cultures the Romans perceived as severe; he was equated with the Carthaginian god [[Baal-hamon|Ba'al Hammon]], to whom children were sacrificed, and to [[Yahweh]], whose [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] was referred to as ''Saturni dies'', "Saturn's day," in a poem by [[Tibullus]], who wrote during the reign of [[Augustus]]; eventually this gave rise to the word "Saturday" in English.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, "Saturn," p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The identification with Ba'al Hammon later gave rise to the African Saturn, a cult that enjoyed great popularity until the 4th century. It had a popular but also a mysteric character and required child sacrifices. It is also considered as inclining to monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;M. Leglay ''Saturn africaine. Histoire'' Paris ''BEFRA'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ceremony of initiation the myste ''intrat sub iugum'', ritual that Leglay compares to the Roman ''[[tigillum sororium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Leglay pp. 385-386.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though their origin and theology are completely different the Italic and the African god are both sovereign and master over time and death, fact that has permitted their encounter. Moreover, here Saturn is not the real Italic god but his Greek counterpart Cronus.

Saturn is associated with a major religious festival in the Roman calendar, ''Saturnalia''.  Saturnalia celebrated the harvest and sowing, and ran from December 17–23.  During Saturnalia, the social restrictions of Rome were relaxed.  The figure of Saturn, kept during the year with its legs bound in wool, was released from its bindings for the period of the festival.&lt;ref name = "Macrobius-1.8.5" /&gt; The revelries of Saturnalia were supposed to reflect the conditions of the lost "Golden Age" before the rule of Saturn was overthrown, not all of them desirable except as a temporary release from civilized constraint. The Greek equivalent was the [[Kronia]].&lt;ref&gt;William F. Hansen, ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature'' (Cornell University Press, 2002), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrobius]] (5th century AD) presents an interpretation of the Saturnalia as a festival of light leading to the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.1.8–9; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433–1177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  The renewal of light and the coming of the new year was celebrated in the later [[Roman Empire]] at the ''Dies Natalis'' of [[Sol Invictus]], the "Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun," on December 25.&lt;ref&gt;see Robert A. Kaster, ''Macrobius: Saturnalia, Books 1–2'' ([[Loeb Classical Library]], 2011), note on p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman legend==

It was customary for the Romans to represent divine figures as kings of Latium at the time of their legendary origins. 
Macrobius states explicitly that the Roman legend of Janus and Saturn is an affabulation, as the true meaning of religious beliefs cannot be openly expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 7, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the myth&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius Saturnalia I, 9; Vergil Aeneis VII, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Saturn was the original and [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] ruler of the [[Capitolium]], which had thus been called the ''Mons Saturnius'' in older times and on which once stood the town of ''Saturnia''.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V&amp;nbsp;42 and 45; Vergil ''Aeneis'' VIII 357-8; Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' I 34; Festus p. 322 L; Macrobius ''Sat.'' I 7, 27 and I 10, 4; Pliny the Elder ''Natural History'' III 68; Minucius Felix  ''Octavius'' 22; Tertullian ''Apologeticum'' 10 as cited by Briquel p.&amp;nbsp;154.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sometimes regarded as the first king of [[Latium]] or even the whole of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," pp.&amp;nbsp;138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there was a tradition that Saturn had been an immigrant god, received by [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] after he was usurped by his son Jupiter and expelled from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," p.&amp;nbsp;139. The Roman theologian [[Varro]] listed Saturn among the [[List of Roman deities#Sabine gods|Sabine gods]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Versnel's view his contradictions—a foreigner with one of Rome's oldest sanctuaries, and a god of liberation who is kept in fetters most of the year—indicate Saturn's capacity for obliterating social distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," pp. 139, 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Porta Maggiore Alatri.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Alatri's main gate of the cyclopical walls]]

The Golden Age of Saturn's reign in Roman mythology differed from the Greek tradition. He arrived in Italy "dethroned and fugitive,"&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; but brought agriculture and civilization for which he was rewarded by Janus with a share of the kingdom, becoming himself king. As the Augustan poet [[Virgil]] described it, "He gathered together the unruly race" of [[faun]]s and [[nymph]]s "scattered over mountain heights, and gave them laws ...&amp;nbsp;. Under his reign were the golden ages men tell of: in such perfect peace he ruled the nations."&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''[[Aeneid]]'' 8.320–325, as cited by Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered the ancestor of the Latin nation as he fathered [[Picus]], the first king of Latium, who married Janus' daughter [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]] and in his turn fathered [[Faunus]]. Saturn was also said to have founded the five ''Saturnian'' towns of Latium: Aletrium (today [[Alatri]]), Anagnia ([[Anagni]]), Arpinum ([[Arpino]]), [[Atina, Lazio|Atina]] and Ferentinum ([[Ferentino]], also known as Antinum) all located in the [[Latin Valley]], [[province of Frosinone]]. All these towns are surrounded by cyclopical walls; their foundation is traditionally ascribed to the [[Pelasgians]].&lt;ref&gt;Mario Pincherle, Giuliana C. Volpi: ''La civiltà minoica in Italia. Le città saturnie'' Pisa Pacini 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Saturn also had a less benevolent aspect, as indicated by the blood shed in his honor during gladiatorial ''munera''. His consort in archaic Roman tradition was [[Lua (goddess)|Lua]], sometimes called ''Lua Saturni'' ("Saturn's Lua") and identified with Lua Mater, "Mother Destruction," a goddess in whose honor the weapons of enemies killed in war were burned, perhaps as expiation.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, "Saturn," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p.&amp;nbsp;222.&lt;/ref&gt; H.S. Versnel, however, proposed that ''Lua Saturni'' should not be identified with ''Lua Mater'', but rather refers to "loosening"; she thus represents the liberating function of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," p.&amp;nbsp;144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gladiatorial ''munera''==
Saturn's [[chthonic]] nature connected him to the underworld and its ruler [[Dis Pater]], the Roman equivalent of Greek [[Pluto (mythology)|Plouton]] (Pluto in Latin) who was also a god of hidden wealth.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," in ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual'' (Brill, 1993, 1994), pp. 144–145. See also the [[Satre (Etruscan god)|Etruscan god Satre]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 3rd-century AD sources and later, Saturn is recorded as receiving [[gladiator]]ial offerings ''(munera)'' during or near the Saturnalia.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Ausonius]], ''Eclogue'' 23 and ''De feriis Romanis'' 33–7. See Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," pp. 146 and 211–212, and Thomas E.J. Wiedemann, ''Emperors and Gladiators'' (Routledge, 1992, 1995), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; These gladiator combats, ten days in all throughout December, were presented by the [[quaestor]]s and sponsored with funds from the treasury of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;Eight days were subsidized from the Imperial treasury ''(arca fisci)'', and two mostly by the sponsoring [[Roman Magistrates|magistrate]] himself; Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex-Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of gladiatorial ''munera'' was criticized by [[Christian apologists]] as a form of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, "Saturn," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 222; Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no evidence of this practice during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], the offering of gladiators led to later theorizing that the primeval Saturn had demanded human victims. [[Macrobius]] says that Dis Pater was placated with human heads and Saturn with sacrificial victims consisting of men ''(virorum [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victimis]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.7.31; Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The figurines that were exchanged as gifts ''([[sigillaria (ancient Rome)|sigillaria]])'' during the Saturnalia may have represented token substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.10.24; Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 166. For other Roman practices that may represent substitutes for human sacrifice, see [[Argei]] and [[oscilla]], the latter of which were used also at the [[Feriae Latinae|Latin Festival]] and the [[Compitalia]]: [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On coins==
[[File:Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.jpg|thumb|right|Saturn driving a ''quadriga'' on the reverse of a denarius issued by Saturninus]]
In 104 BC, the [[tribune|plebeian tribune]] [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] issued a [[denarius]] depicting Saturn driving a four-horse chariot ''([[quadriga]])'', a vehicle associated with rulers, [[Roman triumph|triumphing generals]], and [[sun god]]s. Saturninus was a [[populares|popularist]] politician who had proposed reduced-price grain distribution to the poor of Rome. The head of the [[Roma (mythology)|goddess Roma]] appears on the obverse. The Saturnian imagery played on the tribune's name and his intent to alter the [[Social class in ancient Rome|social hierarchy]] to his advantage by basing his political support on the common people ''([[plebs]])'' rather than the senatorial elite.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, "Saturnus and the Saturnalia," p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic interpretation==

The single principle behind the universe is described by [[Atharvaveda]] in Mantra X.8.11 in the following words:

:यदेजति पतति यच्च तिष्ठति प्राणदप्राणन्निमिषच्च यद् भुवत् |
:तद् दाधार पृथिवीं विश्वरूपं तत् सं भूय भवत्येकमेव ||

as the one reality existing which possessing multifarious forms and qualities upholds this world that has resting on it whatever which desires to move or fly or stay stationary which breathes or does not breath, which sees and does not see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atharva Veda Vol.2|publisher=Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, Delhi|pages=309–310|url=http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/atharvaveda_v2/atharvaveda.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]], the word,'''Sthiti''', refers to maintenance, of the created world, the life-giver, duration of life of the maintenance of universal creation, and according to Sri [[Brahma Samhita]], it refers to preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sthiti|url=http://vedabase.net/s/sthiti|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507090539/http://vedabase.net/s/sthiti|archivedate=2014-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jaina interpretation==

In [[Jainism]], the word, ''Sthiti'', refers to the length or duration (in time) of ''ayu-karma'', the specific period for which the karmic matter, consisting of desires or passions that motivate actions remains, bound with the soul, the specific length of life in the ''gati'' whether as heavenly being or hell being is determined by the ''sthiti'' of ''ayu'' that stays bound; ''bhava-leshya''  affects ''sthiti'' and ''pradesa-bandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jainism and early Buddhism|publisher=Jain Publishing Co.|pages=348–350|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5_EdL2FtIqQC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9780895819567|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of [[Karma in Jainism|karman]]s of a [[Jiva]] is dependent on ''adhayavasaya'' ('the tenure of the mind'), and therefore, on the strength of the ''kasayas'' ('binding factors').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Doctrine of karman in Jain Philosophy|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|publisher=Jain Publishing Co.|page=71|url=  https://books.google.com/?id=bd-5sKkV1XQC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false |isbn=9780895819710|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist interpretation==

[[Abhidharma-kosa]], a [[Buddhist]] text, in Sloka II.46 tells us that – "Arising is existence following upon non-existence; duration is the series; impermanence is the rupture of all series; and between the successive states of the series"; in [[Buddhism]] ''sthiti'' refers to the impermanence of duration; it is the impermanence of duration that destroys [[dharma]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kalatattatvakosa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages= 354–355|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_YHYrni9wckC&amp;pg=PA317&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9788120815476|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]], as a result of the analysis of change, commute impermanence in terms of ''jati'' ('nascent'), ''sthiti'' ('static'), ''jara'' ('decaying') and ''nasa'' ('cessant') moments taking "change of what exists" as signifying two moments, static and decaying. The followers of [[Theravada]] reject the jara-moment, and the [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantikas]] reject the sthiti-moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Philosophy: A historical Analysis|author=David J.Kalupahana|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EBggX7yZkCQC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9780824803926|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoga school’s interpretation==

The Vastu-sutra Upanishad with reference to ''Kriyavastha'' ('rituals of postural action') speaks of six essential disciplines that can be applied to [[Asana]]; the language of postures refers to three rhythms – ''Shrishti'' ('emanation'), ''Sthiti'' ('maintenance') and ''Samhara'' ('resorption'). ''Vaijayanti Kosha'' defines '''Sthiti''' as the act of maintaining. ''Sthiti'' relates to adulthood and emphasizes organic and pranic actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iyengar: The Yoga Master|author=B.K.S.Iyengar|publisher=Shambhala Publications|page=196,204|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__aW4TWCS8kC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9781590305249|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per [[Yoga]] terminology, the word, ''Sthiti'', means 'steadiness' i.e. steadiness of the mind –

:तत्र स्थितौ यत्रोऽभ्यासः ||

:"Of these two, abhyās, practice, is the effort to develop steadiness" - (Yoga Sutra 13)

[[Samadhi]] is the highest ''Sthiti'' of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yog Darshan|author=Robert William Eaton|publisher=Lulu.com|page=98,102|url=https://books.google.com/?id=h1Qzsk2sqB0C&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9781411628878|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yoga]] school recommends exercises to be practiced in accordance with one’s physical condition, age and constitution; the general rule is to follow ''vriddhi'' (during youth when the body is healthy and growing), ''sthiti'' (during middle age when the body is neither growing nor decaying) and ''laya'' (during old age when the body gets old and is decaying). The different ''asana'' ('postures'), which are duly graded, are also called ''sthiti''. Moreover, absence of commonly experienced states of mental distraction known as ''citta vritti'' is called ''sthiti'' ('stationary') or absolute tranquility, in that state one experiences ''prasanta-vahita'' ('flow of peace'); and in which state the yogi desires to remain continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga for Three Stages of Life|author=Srivatsa Ramaswami|publisher=Inner Traditions|page=1,48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sUzBl2k7Z98C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9780892818204|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Yoga Rahasya'', ''Sthiti'' is a [[karma]] meant for the house-holder, and ''Sthiti'' means – to stay i.e. the priority to maintain health rather than increase strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Krishnamacharya|author=A.G.Mohan|publisher=Shambhala publications|pages=39–40|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E6nQQQ0OWo8C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9780834822498|date=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaishnava interpretation==

According to [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava Dharma]], the five functions of [[Shakti]] are ''triodhana'' or ''triobhava'' ('delusion'), ''shrishti'' ('creation'), ''sthiti'' ('sustenance'), ''laya'' or ''samhrti'' ('dissolution') and ''anugraha'' ('grace'); these account for its ''Kiryashakti'' ('power of action'). [[Avyakta]], [[aksara]], [[yoni]], [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]], [[Guna|trigunas]], sthiti, [[Maya (illusion)|maya]], [[svabhava]] etc., are synonyms of [[Prakṛti|Prakrti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laxmi Tantra: A Pancaratra Text|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=xxvi,81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pENlKmZ4r94C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9788120817357|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'' has six ''prakarnas'' ('divisions') – ''vairagya'' ('renunciation'), ''mumuksu-vyavahara'' ('longing for salvation'), ''utpatti'' ('cosmological origin'), ''sthiti'' ('preservation'), ''upasama'' ('quiescence') and ''nirvana'' ('absorption').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global History of Philosophy|author=John C.Plott|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=452|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wTwBGPLQnxQC&amp;pg=PA452&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9788120805507|date=December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five stories in ''Sthiti Prakarna'' narrated by [[Rishi]] [[Vashistha]], show that by forgetting that the actor, the perceiver, the knower or "I" is one's own creation identifying with action, and by identifying with the actor, the perceived and the known, one becomes totally bound and suffers repeated births. ''Sthiti'' or preservation of the "I" is important for growth when one learns and experiences the different aspects of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wisdom of Vasistha|author=Raghunandan|publisher=Motilal banarsidass|page=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CkgYPD54vAsC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9788120820432|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shaivite interpretation==

The five activities attributed to [[Ishvara]] by the [[Shaivites]] are – ''shrishti'' ('emanation or projection'), ''sthiti'' ('maintenance'), ''samhara'' ('withdrawal'), ''vilaya'' ('concealment of the real nature') and ''anugraha'' ('grace'), and therefore, [[Shiva]] is known as ''pancakrityakari'', the continuous do-er of five-fold act which is different from the concept of [[Brahman]] who is ''niskriya'' ('without activity'). ''Pratayabhijna'' insists on meditation on ''panca-krtya'' and the practice of ''vikalpa-ksaya'' during which course the retention and enjoyment of what one perceives (''abhasana'') is ''rakti'' or ''sthiti'' i.e. preservation, which is withdrawn at the time of knowledge. Sthiti is thus the inward cessation of all ''darsanas'' ('empirical knowledge, the experience of things').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pratayabhijnahardayam: The Secret of Self-recognition|author=Jaideva Singh|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=23, 30, 39, 70|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dVJSChd9hOoC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=sthiti#v=onepage&amp;q=sthiti&amp;f=false|isbn=9788120803237|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Devi-Bhagavata'' III.7.25-26 speaks of the three shaktis of the three [[gunas]] – ''jnana-shakti'' of [[sattva]], ''kriya-shakti'' of [[rajas]] and ''artha-shakti'' or ''dravya-shakti'' of [[Tamas (Philosophy)|tamas]]; [[jnana]] and [[dravya]] show the nature of ''[[prakasa]]'' ('light', 'knowledge') and ''sthiti'' ('sustenance', 'existence') in a clearer way. ''Shrishti'' (natural state and Nature), ''Sthiti'' (continuation and maintenance) and ''Samhara'' (annihilation and reabsorption) constitute the triad which alludes to a ceaseless process of creation, sustenance and dissolution in a repeating cycle starting from the emptiness of a positive content which causes multifarious forms to shine forth in the mid-way of its movement before receding to rest from where the process started. ''Sthiti'' is defined as that by virtue of which the gunas are recognized as ''gunas'', and is the common name of the other two genders viz. birth and death.

'''The Fundamentalism Project''' was an international scholarly investigation of conservative religious movements throughout the world, funded by the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. The project began in 1987, directed by [[Martin E. Marty]] and [[R. Scott Appleby]], concluding in 1995. The understanding of [[fundamentalism]] framing the project was considered controversial in some cases, though even those scholars with criticism of the assumptions upon which the project was based admit that there is a great deal of useful empirical information to be found in the publications that grew out of the project.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1159">The '''Theosophical Order of Service''' (TOS) is an international organization founded in 1908 by [[Annie Besant]], the second International President of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]]. Its motto is: "A union of those who love in the service of all that suffers." 

The TOS is found in many countries in the world and is engaged in various service projects that seek to alleviate suffering, such as medical missions, assistance during disasters, [[orphanage]]s, scholarships, establishment of schools, rehabilitation of malnourished children, caring for the disabled, preventing cruelty to animals, promoting [[vegetarianism]], character building for young people, etc. TOS members need not be members of the Theosophical Society, but it is administered by Theosophists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">In the [[occult]] study of the [[esotericism|esoteric]] meaning of runes, the '''Uthark theory''' originated in the 1930s with the work of philologist [[Sigurd Agrell]] (1881–1937), a professor at [[Lund University]], Sweden.

He theorised that the ''rune row'' is a [[cipher]], and that one can understand its meaning by placing the first rune, "F", last, resulting in an ”Uthark” instead of the traditional [[Runic alphabet|"Futhark"]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.swipnet.se/~w-93783/uthark/uthark.html Uthark at Swipnet]. Accessed September 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He articulated the bulk of his theory in his book of 1932, ''Die spätantike Alphabet-Mystik und die Runenreihe'' [The Alphabet-mysticism of late antiquity and the sequence of the runes].

The suggestion has not been accepted in mainstream [[runology|runic studies]], due to lack of historical sources, but has found proponents in occult circles and in popular culture.

Kenneth Meadows promoted the Uthark theory in his 1995 book ''Rune Power''. [[Thomas Karlsson]], founder of the magical Order [[Dragon Rouge]] and [[Therion (band)|Therion]] lyricist, then published the first monograph dedicated to the subject after Agrell's work of 1932: ''Uthark: Nightside of the Runes''&lt;ref&gt;
