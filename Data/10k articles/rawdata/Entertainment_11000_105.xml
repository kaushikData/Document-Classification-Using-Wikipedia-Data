==History==

===Launch===
The original Al Jazeera Satellite Channel (then called JSC or Jazeera Satellite Channel) was launched on 1 November 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://network.aljazeera.net/about-us/timeline|title=Our Story {{!}} Al Jazeera Media Network|work=Al Jazeera Media Network|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the closure of the first [[BBC Arabic Television|BBC Arabic]] language television station, then a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]], owned by Saudi King [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]]'s cousin, [[Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud|Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to thwart a documentary pertaining to executions under sharia law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html|title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station|publisher=Allied-media|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ($137 million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''.

Al Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered [[Six-hour clock|6-hours]] of programming per day; this would increase to [[12-hour clock|12-hours]] by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable, as well as through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world). 1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of [[24-hour clock|24-hour]] broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html|title=A decade of growth|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=1 November 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees, and the agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far as EU and [[Russia]]. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25 million at the time.

===Expansion===

===Al Jazeera English===
{{main article|Al Jazeera English}}
[[File:Al Jazeera English Newsdesk.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Al Jazeera English]] newsroom]]
In 2003, Al Jazeera hired its first English-language journalists, among whom was [[Afshin Rattansi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afshinrattansi.com/|title=Afshinrattansi.com|publisher=Afshinrattansi|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the BBC's [[Today Programme]].

In March 2003, it launched an English-language website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aljazeera.com/ aljazeera.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707133146/http://aljazeera.com/ |date=July 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#Online|below]])

On 4 July 2005 Al Jazeera officially announced plans to launch a new English-language satellite service to be called [[Al Jazeera International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/07/04/aljazeera.spread.ap/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050710010536/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/07/04/aljazeera.spread.ap/index.html|archivedate=10 July 2005|title=Al Jazeera turns its signal West|publisher=Web.archive|date=10 July 2005|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new channel started at 12h [[GMT]] on 15 November 2006 under the name [[Al Jazeera English]] and has broadcast centers in [[Doha]] (next to the original Al Jazeera headquarters and broadcast center), London, [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Washington D.C. The channel is a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week news channel, with 12 hours broadcast from Doha, and four hours each from London, Kuala Lumpur, and Washington D.C. Among its staff were journalists hired from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline]]'' and other top news outfits. Josh Rushing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Power|url=http://matthewpower.net/Matthew_Power/GQRushing.html|title=Josh Rushing: From USMC to Al Jazeera|publisher=Matthew Power: GQ|date=June 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921042700/http://matthewpower.net/Matthew_Power/GQRushing.html|archive-date=2012-09-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former media handler for [[CENTCOM]] during the [[Iraq]] war, agreed to provide commentary; [[David Frost]] was also on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Deborah Soloman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/magazine/12wwln_q4.html?_r=0|title=Bye-Bye, BBC|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 February 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4318284.stm|title=David Frost joins al-Jazeera TV|work=BBC News|date=7 October 2005|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interesting technical feat, the broadcast of the new operation was handed off between bases in [[Doha]], London, Washington, D.C., and [[Kuala Lumpur]] on a daily cycle.

The new English language venture faced considerable regulatory and commercial hurdles in the North America market for its perceived sympathy with extremist causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jamal Dajani |url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=f3d3ade3488a2bca1e957e754c4ebd08 |title=Al Jazeera English Falls Short of Expectations |publisher=New America Media |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605161737/http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=f3d3ade3488a2bca1e957e754c4ebd08 |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tony Burman|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/about/burman/letters/2006/11/aljazeera_should_be_available.html|title=Al-Jazeera should be available in Canada|newspaper=CBC|date=17 November 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6105952.stm|title=Al-Jazeera English TV date set|newspaper=BBC News|date=1 November 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, others felt Al Jazeera's competitive advantage lay in programming in the [[Arabic language]]. There were hundreds of millions of potential viewers among the non-[[Arabic language]] speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who might be interested in seeing news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny [[Qatar]], beyond even what had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the [[BBC World Service]] was preparing to launch its own [[Arabic language]] station in 2007.

===Al Jazeera Balkans===
[[File:Wadah Khanfar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wadah Khanfar]], Former Director General of Al Jazeera Media Network]]

In 2011 Al Jazeera Media Network created [[Al Jazeera Balkans]], a version of Al Jazeera in the [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]/[[Croatian language|Croatian]]/[[Serbian language|Serbian]] language(s) stationed in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina catering to and broadcasting around the [[Balkans]]. In 2013 they announced the creation of [[Al Jazeera Türk]], a version of Al Jazeera that will be in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] language(s) stationed in Istanbul catering to and broadcasting around Turkey. On January 22, 2014 Al Jazeera Turk`s website launched with news content. The move made Al Jazeera Turk the first 24-hour news operation to go digital before broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Vivarelli.

===Al Jazeera America===
{{Main article|Al Jazeera America}}
Al Jazeera America was an American version of Al Jazeera English. The channel launched on 20 August 2013 exclusively on cable and satellite systems in the [[United States]].

On 2 January 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network announced that it purchased [[Current TV]] in the United States and would be launching an American news channel. Originally 60% of the channel's programming would be produced in America while 40% would be from Al Jazeera English, that has since changed to almost all the content being U.S. originated.

Though Current TV had large distribution throughout the United States on cable and satellite TV, it averaged only 28,000 viewers at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stelter |first=Brian |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/current-tv-finds-a-good-number-within-its-tiny-ratings/|title=Current TV Finds a Good Number Within Its Tiny Ratings|newspaper=New York Times|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of Current TV by Al Jazeera allowed [[Time Warner Cable]] to drop the network due to its low ratings, but released a statement saying that they would consider carrying the channel after they evaluated whether it made sense for their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeerausannouncement.com/ |title=Ali Velshi Joins Al Jazeera America |work=Al Jazeera |date=4 April 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DOQkfDdQ?url=http://www.aljazeerausannouncement.com/ |archivedate=3 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/02/business/al-jazeera-current-tv/index.html?eref=edition|title=Al Jazeera buys Al Gore's Current TV|work=CNN|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/usa/news/al-jazeera-buys-current-tv-252/ |title=Al Jazeera buys Current TV in bid for US airtime |work=RT News |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131104610/http://rt.com/usa/news/al-jazeera-buys-current-tv-252/ |archivedate=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/01/2013132255769130.html |title=Al Jazeera buys US channel Current TV|newspaper=Al Jazeera|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20896484#TWEET494584|title=Al Jazeera targets US expansion after buying Current TV|work=BBC|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/03/time-warner-cable-al-jazeera-america_n_2404879.html|title=Time Warner Cable Will Consider Carrying Al Jazeera's U.S. Network|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel was later added to Time Warner and [[Bright House Networks]] lineups after a new carriage deal was agreed upon.

On January 13, 2016, Al Jazeera America CEO Al Anstey announced that the network would cease operations on April 12, 2016, citing the "economic landscape".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Al Jazeera America to Shut Down|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/al-jazeera-america-shut-down-855477|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Jazeera Sports===
{{Main article|Al Jazeera Sports}}

In 2004 Al Jazeera expanded into the world of sports with the establishment of [[Al Jazeera Sports]] (now known as [[beIN Sports]]) and the building of 8 Arabic language specialty sports channels.

On 1 January 2014, Al Jazeera Sports was renamed [[beIN Sports]] after its acquisition of [[beIN Media Group]] the channels were legally spun off and to have consistency with all the Network's sports properties. According to [[Kate O'Brian]], President of Al Jazeera America, beIN sports revenue helped fund the network when it was in operation similar to how [[BBC Worldwide]] helps fund the BBC.

===Other channels===
Al Jazeera Media network also operates [[Al Jazeera Documentary Channel]] an Arabic language documentary channel, [[Al Jazeera Mubasher]], a live politics and public interest channel (similar to [[C-SPAN]], [[Houses of the Oireachtas Channel]] or [[BBC Parliament]]), which broadcasts conferences in real time without editing or commentary the first channel of its kind in the Middle East and [[Al Jazeera Turk]], a mainly online channel at the moment.

===Restructuring===
[[File:Aljazeera London 03.jpg|200px|thumb|Al Jazeera's former Knightsbridge London Control Room]]
Al Jazeera restructured its operations to form a network that contains all their different channels. [[Wadah Khanfar]], then the managing director of the Arabic Channel, was appointed as the Director General of the Al Jazeera Network. He also acted as the Managing Director of the Arabic channel. Khanfar resigned on 20 September 2011, proclaiming that he had achieved his original goals, and that eight years was enough time for any leader of an organization, in an interview aired on Aljazeera English.

On 26 November 2009, Al Jazeera English received approval from the CRTC, which enables Al Jazeera English to broadcast via satellite in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2009/11/26/al-jazeera.html|title=Al-Jazeera English gets CRTC approval|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=26 November 2009|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, in accordance with the renaming of the corporation, AJMN was legally re-designated from a "public institution to a 'private institution of public utility'"; however, it was unknown how this would affect editorial management and funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advanced-television.info/2011/07/15/al-jazeera-restructures-ahead-of-expansion/ |title=Al Jazeera "restructures" ahead of expansion |date=15 July 2011 |publisher=Advanced Television |author=Chris Forrester |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222014722/http://advanced-television.info/2011/07/15/al-jazeera-restructures-ahead-of-expansion/ |archivedate=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/qatar/al-jazeera-turning-into-private-media-organisation-1.837871|title=Al Jazeera turning into private media organisation|author=Habib Toumi|date =13 July 2011|work= Gulf News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network is also funded though its television contracts and revenue from its sports division.

[[File:Vienna - Vienna Opera main auditorium - 9825.jpg|300px|thumb|The auditorium of the [[Vienna State Opera]].]]
[[File:Sala de cine.jpg|thumb|upright|350px|A typical [[movie theater]] auditorium]]
An '''auditorium''' is a room built to enable an audience to hear and watch performances at venues such as theatres. For movie theatres, the number of auditoriums is expressed as the number of '''screens'''.  Auditoria can be found in entertainment venues, community halls, and theaters, and may be used for rehearsal, presentation, performing arts productions, or as a [[learning space]].

== Etymology ==
The term is taken from [[Latin language|Latin]] (from ''audītōrium'', from ''audītōrius'' (“‘pertaining to hearing’”)); the concept is taken from the Greek auditorium, which had a series of semi-circular seating shelves in the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|theatre]], divided by broad 'belts', called ''diazomata'', with eleven rows of seats between each. 
[[File:The Third Session of the 12th National People's Congress open 20150305.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The grand auditorium of the [[Great Hall of the People]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]].]]
[[Image:Regensburg Stadttheater Zuschauerraum 2004.jpg|thumb|right|The auditorium of the Municipal Theatre of Regensburg, Germany.]]

== {{anchor |Auditorium structure}} Auditorium structure ==
The audience in a modern theatre are usually(citation needed) separated from the performers by the [[proscenium arch]], although other [[stage (theatre)|types of stage]] are common.

The price charged for seats in each part of the auditorium (known in the industry as the '''house''') usually varies according to the quality of the view of the stage. The seating areas can include some or all of the following:

* Stalls, orchestra or arena: the lower flat area, usually below or at the same level as the stage.
* [[Balcony|Balconies]] or galleries: one or more raised seating platforms towards the rear of the auditorium. In larger theatres, multiple levels are stacked vertically above or behind the stalls. The first level is usually called the dress circle or grand circle. The highest platform, or upper circle is sometimes known as ''the gods'', especially in large opera houses, where the seats can be very high and a long distance from the stage.
* [[Box (theatre)|Boxes]]: generally placed immediately to the front, side and above the level of the stage. They are often separate rooms with an open viewing area which generally seat only a handful of people. These seats are generally considered the most prestigious of the house. A state box or royal box is sometimes provided for dignitaries.
* [[Stadium seating|Seating arrangement]]: Seating arrangements in an auditorium seating layout (or assembly space) will either be identified as “multiple-aisle” or “continental.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatresolutions.net/auditorium-seating-layout/|title=Auditorium Seating Layout Complete Guide {{!}} Theatre Solutions Inc.|date=2016-10-20|newspaper=Theatre Solutions Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms are commonly found in design standards manuals, building codes, and similar architectural reference documents. Each size is unique, with specific guidelines governing row size, row spacing, and exit ways. Basically, a multiple-aisle arrangement will have a maximum of 14-16 chairs per row with access to an aisle-way at both ends. In a continental arrangement, all seats are located in a central section. Here the maximum quantity of chairs per row can greatly exceed the limits established in a multiple-aisle arrangement. In order to compensate for the greater length of rows allowed, building codes will require wider row spacing, wider aisles, and strategically located exit doors. Although it would seem like more space is called for, a '''continental seating''' plan is often not any less efficient than a multiple-aisle arrangement. In fact, if it’s carefully planned, a continental arrangement can frequently accommodate more seating within the same space.

== Similar structures at other venues ==

Sports venues such as [[stadium]]s and [[racetrack]]s also have royal boxes or enclosures, for example at the [[All England Club]] and [[Ascot Racecourse]], where access is limited to [[royal families]] or other distinguished personalities. In other countries, sports venues have [[luxury box]]es, where access is open to anyone who can afford tickets.

'''''Beast of Blood''''', released in the UK as '''''Blood Devils''''', is a 1970&lt;ref&gt;Weldon, Michael (1983). "The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film". Ballantine Books. ISBN 345-34345-5. Page 42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[horror film]]. A sequel to ''[[The Mad Doctor of Blood Island]]'', it was directed by [[Eddie Romero]]. It was the fourth in a series of four Filipino horror films, produced by Romero and Kane W. Lynn, known as the "Blood Island" series, which also included ''[[Terror Is a Man]]'', ''[[Brides of Blood]]'' and ''Beast of Blood''.&lt;ref name="povrow"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9GknfDYd4sC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=%22kane+lynn%22+romero&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DyMWabwK_Z&amp;sig=3gBpB5dtOZ8phDckdDbHQX2gPwc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLr5yM3rPYAhUqrlQKHc-DDfYQ6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kane%20lynn%22%20romero&amp;f=false|first=Fred Olen|last=Ray|title=The New Poverty Row: Independent Filmmakers as Distributors|publisher=McFarland|date=1991|isbn=0-89950-628-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63–88}} It was also Romero's last film for Lynn's Hemisphere Pictures, as the two went separate ways after this film was completed.&lt;ref name="povrow" /&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Plot==
The plot of this film picks up where ''[[The Mad Doctor of Blood Island]]'' leaves off. Upon leaving Blood Island, the ship carrying Dr. Bill Foster (John Ashley), Sheila Willard, her father and Carlos Lopez explodes and sinks after mutated "chlorophyll creature" Don Ramon Lopez (the titular "Beast") is found secreted on board and goes on a rampage, destroying the ship. The monstrous Don Ramon washes up back on Blood Island and heads into the jungle. Dr. Foster is the only other survivor, and after a few months recovering in a hospital, he heads back to Blood Island on another ship. On board is reporter Myra Russell ([[Celeste Yarnall]]), who is investigating the explosion of the ship.

When Foster and Russell arrive on the island, they find the natives in a state of fear, believing that the old Lopez mansion is cursed. With the village headman Ramu ([[Alfonso Carvajal (actor)|Alfonso Carvajal]]) and the ship's captain (played by co-producer Beverly Miller), they search the house and find Razak (Bruno Punzalan) alive. The "green men" return and after a fight, Myra is captured and taken to the evil Dr. Lorca ([[Eddie Garcia]]), who is still alive but horribly scarred from his seeming demise in the earlier film.

Dr. Foster and Laida (Liza Belmonte) search the mountains and find Dr. Lorca's hidden lab. Laida goes back to the village for help and Lorca shows Foster his latest experiments. He has removed Don Ramon's head and has attached it to machines while the decapitated body remains strapped to a table. Lorca knows the head can speak, but it refuses to say anything.

The captain, Laida and Ramu lead an attack on Lorca's headquarters and fight with his men. Laida finds her father, who shows signs of the chlorophyll poisoning, and rescues him. Foster shoots Razak. Don Ramon's head controls his body from afar and wills it to attack and apparently kill Dr. Lorca, crushing his head with a piece of machinery. Lorca's lab explodes, killing all inside, and Foster and the group leave with a box of Dr. Lorca's papers and notes.

==Cast==

*[[Celeste Yarnall]] as Myra J. Russell

==Production==
The film's budget has been estimated at between $125,000 to $200,000.&lt;ref name="tom"&gt;Tom Weaver, "Interview with John Ashley", ''Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers: Writers, Producers, Directors, Actors, Moguls and Makeup'', McFarland 1988 p 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/TrashCompactor0205Starbrite/Trash_Compactor_0205_%28Starbrite%29#page/n25/mode/1up/search/%22john+ashley%22|title=The John Ashley Filmography|magazine=Trash Compactor|edition=Volume 2 No. 5|page=26|year=1990|first=John|last=Lamont}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor Ronald Remy did not return to play Dr. Lorca as he had in ''Mad Doctor of Blood Island'', so in ''Beast of Blood'', Garcia played the mad doctor. Co-producer Beverly Miller played the ship's captain.&lt;ref name ="povrow" /&gt;{{rp|75}}&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Sam (2002). "Mad Doctor of Blood Island" (audio commentary track). Image Entertainment. ID146211DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;{{time needed|date=August 2018}}

To promote the film, the producers had fake $10 bills printed that folded in half, revealing an ad flier for ''Beast of Blood'' when opened. The phony bills were then scattered all over the surrounding neighborhood nearest the drive-in that was playing the film.&lt;ref name="linernotes"&gt;Arena, Jim (2002). "Beast of Blood" (dvd liner notes). Image Entertainment. ID145711DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Arena said, "The poster for the film depicted the chlorophyll monster gruesomely ripping its own head off! This horrific drawing eventually became better known than the film itself. While no such scene actually exists in the picture, it is the kind of tantalizing movie promotion that helped get those cars lining up at the drive-in".&lt;ref name="linernotes" /&gt;

==Release==
The film was released in 1970 on a double bill with ''Curse of the Vampires'',&lt;ref name="povrow" /&gt;{{rp|76}} a 1966 Filipino horror film that was directed by Gerardo de Leon.&lt;ref name="povrow" /&gt;{{rp|84}} ''Beast of Blood'' did substantial business in New York theaters, and producer Lynn (as Hemisphere Pictures) looked forward to getting the distribution rights to Ashley's next horror film, titled ''[[Beast of the Yellow Night]]''. However, Ashley and his own production company, Four Associates, put up the money to produce the film themselves with director Romero, and Ashley cut a deal with [[Roger Corman]]'s then-fledgling New World Pictures to distribute it. After ''Beast of Blood'', Lynn found himself cut out of the deal entirely.&lt;ref name="povrow" /&gt;{{rp|77}}
[[Image Entertainment]] released ''Beast of Blood'' on [[DVD]] in 2002, including an audio commentary track by Sam Sherman and interviews with Romero and Yarnall. In 2018, it was released on [[Blu-ray]] by [[Severin Films]].

'''''Calculords''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[Strategy video game|strategy]] [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Seanbaby|Ninja Crime]]. It was released for [[iOS]] on February 21, 2014, and for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in August of the same year.

The game received positive reviews from critics, citing its inventive and fun gameplay.

== Gameplay ==
Calculords is based on the framework of a [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based strategy game]] in which the player controls one side of three lanes and the opponent controls the other.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/Calculords/review.asp?c=57758|title=Calculords Review|work=Pocket Gamer|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides attempt to destroy the other's base by sending troops towards it. Each base has a certain number of [[Health (gaming)|hit points]]; once those drop to zero, the base is destroyed and that side loses the game.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The player draws cards from a virtual deck representing units. These units have numbers, while the player is given a set of numbers at the start of each turn. The player must perform [[Equation|mathematical equations]] to make their set of numbers equal the numbers on the cards, at which time they can deploy that particular card.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The player receives bonuses if they are able to use the entire set of numbers in a single turn, which increase for each turn they can use all the numbers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Plot ==
The player plays as the "Star Nerd", a human soldier who travels across the galaxy attempting to conquer various planets that are ruled by warlords.

== Development ==
The game's creator, [[Seanbaby]], was inspired to develop the game because he thought [[Collectible card game|CCG]] video games were "sort of a mess" and wanted to improve on them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pockettactics.com/articles/seanbaby-speaks-calculords-weird-idea-id-never-get-see-unless-made/|title=Seanbaby speaks: &amp;quot;Calculords is a weird idea that I'd never get to see unless I made it&amp;quot;|website=Pocket Tactics|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added the math equations to the game because he believed there was "something satisfying in having equations to work out".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He did not mind if the math problems reduced the game's commercial appeal, saying that while he hoped the game was successful, his primary motivation was to have fun developing the game, and that those who were mainly motivated by making a commercially appealing game were "probably an asshole".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The game was positively received by critics, with an aggregate score of 83 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/calculords|title=Calculords|website=Metacritic|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zack Kotzer of [[Kill Screen]] noted that while the game was "not [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]]", it still made him "feel like a math hero of the universe" and "more confident in [his] relationship with numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://killscreendaily.com/articles/calculords-makes-me-feel-math-genius-and-s-magical/|title=Calculords makes me feel like a math genius, and that's magical - Kill Screen - Videogame Arts &amp; Culture.|date=2015-09-30|access-date=2017-06-20|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930133520/http://killscreendaily.com/articles/calculords-makes-me-feel-math-genius-and-s-magical/|archivedate=2015-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ChromaGun''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[puzzle video game]] developed by Pixel Maniacs, an [[Indie game|independent game]] [[Independent video game development|studio]] from [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pixel-maniacs.com/chromagun|title=ChromaGun - Mix Colors, Solve puzzles!|last=Maniacs|first=Pixel|website=pixel-maniacs.com|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

''ChromaGun'' is a puzzle game revolving around using colors. The player uses the ChromaGun, a paint-shooting weapon, to colorize walls and floating spherical robots, called Worker Droids. These Worker Droids are attracted to walls of the same color and will move towards them.

The player's objective is to solve puzzles by cleverly rearranging Worker Droids, changing their colors, and guiding them to door-opening triggers, switches or electrified tiles. The player can shoot paint in the [[primary color]]s red, blue and yellow using the ChromaGun. The primary colors can be mixed together on walls and Worker Droids to create the [[secondary color]]s green, purple and orange. Mixing more than two different colors will result in black, which Worker Droids are not attracted to.

The game consists of many short puzzle levels to solve, however a single mistake can render a puzzle unsolvable, forcing to restart the level. There are 26 levels in total, each with only one solution.

==Reception==
ChromaGun was met with mixed-to-positive critical reception on all platforms. 

Twinfinite's Chaz Miller scored it 3.5/5, praising the game's art direction, difficulty and concept, but stated that the puzzles could get "frustrating" or "repetitive" in portions, and had no alternative solutions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/2016/02/chromagun-review/|title=ChromaGun Review|website=twinfinite.net|language=en-US|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagogames' Alexx Aplin scored the game with a 9.5/10, praising the game design, gameplay, voice acting and the inclusion of support for [[Color blindness|colorblind]] individuals, but stated that playing with a [[gamepad]] feels "twitchy" and that "the difficulty scales in strange places". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bagogames.com/chromagun-review-paint-with-all-the-colors|title=ChromaGun Review - Paint with all the Colors of a Gun|website=bagogames.com|language=en-US|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On review aggregate [[Metacritic]], the game currently sits at 69/100 for the Nintendo Switch&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/chromagun|title=ChromaGun|website=Metacritic|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 74/100 for PlayStation 4&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/chromagun|title=ChromaGun|website=Metacritic|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Corps Altsachsen''' is a fraternity (''[[Studentenverbindung]]'') in [[Dresden]], Germany. It was  founded on October 31, 1861 and is one of 162 ''[[German Student Corps]]'' in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the [[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent]] (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical [[Corporation (university)|Fraternities]] in Europe with roots dating back to the 15th century.&lt;ref name="DieCorps"&gt;Die Corps. "Was sind die Corps? - Who are the Corps?" http://www.die-corps.de/interessenten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klimczuk"&gt;Klimczuk, Stephen &amp; [[Gerald Warner|Warner, Gerald]]. "[[Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries|Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries: Uncovering Mysterious Sites, Symbols, and Societies]]". Sterling Publishing, 2009, New York and London. {{ISBN|978-1-4027-6207-9}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;212–232 ("University Secret Societies and Dueling Corps").&lt;/ref&gt;

Four presidents ("[[Rector (academia)|Rektor]]") of [[Dresden University of Technology]], Dresden's largest university with approximately 30.000 students, are among the list of members of the fraternity, underlining the deep connection between the Corps and the local alma mater.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt; The connections with the university and the city of Dresden go far back to the fraternity's early beginnings in the late 19th century, with members aspiring to drive developments for the university over the course of history. Two major accomplishments were (1) ensuring the university's recognition by developing the former Technical Institute into the Royal Saxon Technical College of Dresden in the late 1800s and (2) founding of today's [[Studentenwerk]] Dresden in the early 1900s as the university's student council.&lt;ref name="AS1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt; Outside of the university's circles, many of the fraternity's members  drove developments in the architectural style and design of several of Dresden's buildings such as the "Dresden's Neuer Bahnhof".&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"&gt;Corps Altsachsen: Hundert Jahre Corps Altsachsen. 1. Auflage. Köln 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in the fraternity is open to [[Honour|honorable]] men&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; studying at one of Dresden's [[University|universities]] and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;Die Corps. "Prinzipien der Corps" An article explaining the principles of being a Corps Student: http://www.die-corps.de/prinzipien.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Corps Altsachsen value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt; as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Altsachsen's members wear the traditional [[couleur]], colored stripes, in grey-green-gold. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, who are stemming from very diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name="lit_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;

== Fundamentals and principles ==
Like all ''German Student Corps'', Altsachsen expects tolerance from its members in [[German Student Corps#Politics|political]], [[German Student Corps#Sciences|scientific]] and [[List of members of German student corps|religious]] affairs.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Altsachsen as an entity always remains neutral. This ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]'' is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging "fox") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal [[ethos|character]] and [[recognition (sociology)|merit]], before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (''Rezeption'').&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; The fraternity has about 200 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

[[File:Mühlberg - Säbelmensur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Academic fencing|Academic "Mensur" fencing]] in 1900. Steel goggles were added to protect the eyes and nose nowadays.]]
Members of the Corps Altsachsen value and practice the tradition of engagements in ''[[academic fencing]]'', or ''"Mensur"'' in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the [[German school of fencing]], is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character,&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fechten"&gt;Die Corps. "Hoch bitte – Los!" An article explaining the role of academic fencing at Corps: http://www.die-corps.de/fechten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices.&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2c" /&gt; Altsachsen's members identify themselves wearing the traditional ''couleur'', colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as "wearing colors" (German: ''Farben tragen''), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;

Altsachsen's members value the art of ''[[rhetoric]]''. The tradition is kept alive by both impromptu or "stand-up and talk" speeches (''Stegreifrede'' in German) as well as elaborate platform presentations typical of industry and academia. All members must present a significant number of such talks and are graded on their presentation skills. In order to become a full member, pledge members must pass a curriculum of predetermined talks in front of their peers and guests.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

''Activity'' and ''responsibility'' are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term ("Semester") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of ''Alter Herr'' (alumnus).&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

Long-term guidance is expected from and provided by said ''Alte Herren'', who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities ([[Weinheim]] and [[Bad Kösen]]) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network ([[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent|WSC]]/[[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband|KSCV]]).&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;

{{Quote|The '''object and purpose of the Corps''' was and still is solely the education of students to become a strong, free and cosmopolitan personality who is not held back by religious, racist, national, scientific or philosophical limitations of the mind. Three primary institutions within the fraternity aid with achieving this aim; including the '''Corpsconvent''' [regular council meetings of the Corps Brothers], the '''Kneipe'''  [celebratory get-together of Corps Brothers with speeches, beer and songs], and today's '''Bestimmungsmensur'''  [the event of academic fencing with sharp blades for the first or one of the first times], where the ones to fence are chosen on the basis of placing two equal opponents in front of each other. [...] This experience, and the intertwined need to overcome one's own fear, dedicated to the union of his Corps, and the connected strengthening of the sense of community aids the personal growth just as does taking a hit without losing one's stand and accepting the assessment of the '''Mensur'''  by the own Corps Brothers.|[[:de:Hermann Rink]]&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Rink: ''Die Mensur, ein wesentliches Merkmal des Verbandes.''

=== Foundation as Rhetoric Society in 19th century Dresden ===
[[File:Dresden photochrom2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brühl's Terrace]] in 1890.]]

The fraternity was founded on October 31, 1861, at the [[Brühl's Terrace]] in Dresden's city center as the Rhetoric Society by students of Dresden's former [[Institute of Technology]], now the Dresden University of Technology. The name chosen for the new fraternity was originally ''[[Polyhymnia]]'', after the muse of sacred poetry, rhetoric and [[eloquence]]. The founders strongly believed that a rhetoric education and discourse should be part of a complete humanistic higher education. The colors ''grey-green-gold'' were chosen to represent the fraternity's principles focusing on academia (grey), being full of fresh energy and hope for its principles (green), and valuing friendship among fraternity brothers (gold).&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt; The strong connection to the fraternity's founding location is often revived with a rhetoric get-together at Brühl's Terrace and spontaneous afternoon pub gatherings near the river [[Elbe]] as well as lavish [[Ball (dance)|balls]] throughout the year.

[[File:SchlägerOvBMuseumFriedrichsruh.jpg|thumb|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by Altsachsen's members then and now.]]
By 1868, the fraternity had adopted the tradition of academic fencing or ''"Mensur"'' challenges (back then "duels"&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;) with members of other proper fraternities&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt; and had changed its official name to ''Akademische Verbindung Polyhymnia'' (Academic Fraternity Polyhymnia). The motto "Litteris et amicitiae" (Science and Friendship) was adopted on June 25, 1880.&lt;ref name="AS1911"&gt;Festschrift zur Feier des fünfzigjährigen Bestehens der freischlagenden Verbindung "Polyhymnia" an der Technischen Hochschule zu Dresden. Technische Hochschule Dresden, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The fraternity's [[Coat of arms of Germany|coat of arms]] was chosen in the same year, depicting the one-headed black eagle of the time of the German Empire (1871-1918) instead of the two-headed eagle at the time of the fraternity's foundation.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

=== Influencing the development of the Technical Institute of Dresden ===
Dresden's main university, today's Technical University (short: TU) Dresden was founded in 1828 as one of the first [[Institute of technology|technical institutes]] of the world, then called "Technical School of Saxony". After Saxony joined the newly formed German Empire in 1871, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute (Königlich-Sächsisches Polytechnikum). At this point in time, topics not connected with technology, such as history and languages, were introduced to the school curriculum. Several of Altsachsen's fraternity members were in high-ranking institute and government positions and had an influential role by lobbying Saxony's state government to recognize the technical institute as a higher education provider with polytechnical merits, which resulted in yet another name change to ''Königlich-Sächsischen Technischen Hochschule Dresden'' (Royal-Saxon Technical College of Dresden) in 1890.&lt;ref name="AS1961"&gt;Corps Altsachsen: Hundert Jahre Corps Altsachsen. 1. Auflage. Köln 1961, S. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; 
To honor the recognition of the educational institution, the fraternity established the ''academic principle'' (''akademische Prinzip''). This meant that every member could only become an alumnus after graduating with a higher academic degree and in good academic standing, an initiative by fraternity member and Honorary Senator Fritz Zeuner, son of the former president of the Poly-technical Institute Gustav Zeuner. They and others in the fraternity significantly influenced the college's course, eventually leading to the college's privilege to graduate students with doctoral degrees in 1900. Aside from traditional doctoral graduations, the university was also allowed to honor exceptional scientists and businessmen as honorary doctors; the first such honor was granted to Friedrich August Siemens.&lt;ref name="AS1961"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift Der Technischen Universität Dresden, Volume 18, Issue 5, Technischen Universität Dresden, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TU-Dresden-Georg-Schumann-Bau 2.jpg|thumb|The typical, early 1900s style of campus architecture is exemplified in today's nearby Schumann-Building at the [[Dresden University of Technology|TU Dresden]].]]

=== Foundation of Franconia ===
During the late 1800s, fraternities began forming fraternity circles and umbrella organizations. Differences in opinion about tolerance and general politics led to the end of ''honorable greeting and fencing'' with certain types of fraternities, such as the Cheruscia Dresden in 1899. This led to problems trying to maintain a high level of fencing engagements among similar fraternities, which is why five of Polyhymnia's fraternity brothers founded the "fencing fraternity Franconia Dresden" ("Freischlagende Verbindung Franconia", later "Corps Franconia Dresden") in Juli of 1899. Monetary stimulus for the new fraternity was provided by Polyhymnia's alumni-organisation. Both "fencing fraternities", not yet Corps at that point, formed the Dresden Fraternity Cartel ("Dresdner Verbindungs-Cartell" D.V.C.) to rival and engage in regular social and fencing events.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Schüler: Weinheimer S.C.-Chronik, Darmstadt 1927, S. 434-454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Michael Doeberl, Alfred Bienengräber: Das akademische Deutschland, Volume 2, C.A. Weller, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joining the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent ===
To guarantee her members reliable means to fence with other fraternities of like principles, Polyhymnia joint the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC) in 1927 and was renamed Corps Altsachsen.&lt;ref name="PG81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karlheinz Blaschke, Holger Starke, Uwe John: Geschichte der Stadt Dresden, Volume 3, Theiss Verlag, 2006, S. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The name change from ''Polyhymnia'' to ''Corps Altsachsen'' happened in compliance with WSC rules for fraternity names at that time.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; Likewise, most of the local fraternities merged to form similar umbrella organizations in the following years. From that point on, most of the social activity, such as eloquent balls as well as fencing engagements became limited to like-minded fraternities, the German Student Corps.&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt;

=== Suspension during times of the national socialist rule ===
Similar to other fraternities who encouraged their members to have their own free thought and will, members of the Corps Altsachsen felt the increasing pressure of national socialist surveillance as well as political pressure in the early 1930s. A similar-minded fraternity, ''Corps Makaria Dresden'', fused with the Corps Altsachsen in 1934, which strengthened bonds and numbers within the fraternity. Still, as political pressures in Nazi Germany had increased to dangerous levels for fraternities during the next years, Corps Altsachsen officially suspended activities in 1936.&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt;  During the 1930s, eventually all corps abiding by a free democratic order did the same as their view of the world was in stark contrast to the so-called [[Führerprinzip]] (Führer-principle), where one person governs essentially as dictator instead of relying on a democratic, consensus-based majority in a convent.&lt;ref name=AS1961/&gt;

[[File:Corps Altsachsen Winternacht.png|thumb|House of the fraternity in a snowy Christmas winter night in Dresden.]]

=== Post-war reconstitution and return to Dresden ===
After the war, the fraternity was reconstituted at the [[University of Cologne]] in 1950&lt;ref name="Asta1972"&gt;Universitätsführer. Universität zu Köln, Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and soon fused with the smaller ''Corps Gothia Dresden'' in 1953. Originally located in Köln-Lindenthal, Altsachsen soon moved to Köln-Marienburg, where it stayed until the [[Iron Curtain]] collapsed.&lt;ref name=AS1961/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asta1972"/&gt; During the Soviet dictatorship in East Germany, fraternities abiding by free will and common consensus were again not allowed to exist as they could not be controlled by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Party]]. Following [[Germany's reunification]] in 1989, the fraternity returned to Dresden in 1994 with the aid of the ''[[Blaues Kartell]]'', a circle of four like-minded fraternities that Altsachsen had joined in 1993. The ''Blaues Kartell'' today includes the [[Corps Saxo-Thuringia München]] in [[Munich]], Corps Hannoverania in [[Hanover]] and [[Corps Berlin]] in [[Berlin]]. In 1997, the Corps Altsachsen transitioned its headquarters to its newly remodeled fraternity house on Weissbachstreet 1, right in the middle of the [[Campus]] of the Dresden University of Technology, thereby reconnecting with its traditional roots.&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt;

[[File:Dresden Weiße Flotte Terrassenufer.jpg|thumb|[[:de:Dresden (Schiff, 1926)|Steamboat]] at [[Brühl's Terrace]]]]

=== Today ===
The fraternity is known for its strong commitment to the university and its rhetoric traditions as well as lavish social events. Among these are regular boat parties on Dresden's [[Paddle steamer|steam boats]] as well as traditional balls allowing the Corps brothers to enjoy [[Waltz dance|waltz]], [[latin dance|Latin]] or many other forms of [[ballroom dance]].&lt;ref name="AShp"&gt;Webpage of the Corps Altsachsen - "Aktuelles" showing current events http://www.altsachsen.de Retrieved on Oct. 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these events are not limited to the region of Dresden, as there are several trips per year to other cities.

== Relationships with other fraternities ==
Corps Altsachsen is a member of the ''[[Blaues Kartell]]'', a circle of four German Student Corps that understand the union as "one fraternity spanning four cities" (Dresden, Munich, Hanover, and Berlin).

'''Dramatic structure''' is the structure of a [[drama]]tic work such as a [[Play (theater)|play]] or [[film]]. Many scholars have analyzed dramatic structure, beginning with [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE). This article looks at Aristotle's analysis of the Greek tragedy and on [[Gustav Freytag]]'s analysis of [[Theater of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] drama.

==History==
In his ''Poetics'', the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher Aristotle put forth the idea the play should imitate a single whole action. "A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end" (1450b27).&lt;ref name="fall2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1450b Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; He split the play into two parts: complication and unravelling.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] drama critic [[Horace]] advocated a 5-act structure in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]: "Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu fabula" (lines 189–190) ("A play should not be shorter or longer than five acts").

The fourth-century Roman grammarian [[Aelius Donatus]] defined the play as a three part structure, the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]).

In 1863, around the time that playwrights like [[Henrik Ibsen]] were abandoning the 5-act structure and experimenting with 3 and 4-act plays, the [[Germany|German]] playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote ''Die Technik des Dramas'', a definitive study of the 5-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag's pyramid.&lt;ref name="fall3"&gt;University of South Carolina (2006). [http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm The Big Picture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023073242/http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Freytag's pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts: [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] (originally called introduction), [[rising action]] (rise), [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], [[falling action]] (return or fall), and [[dénouement]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[wikt:resolution|resolution]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[revelation]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]].&lt;ref name="fall4"&gt;University of Illinois: Department of English (2006). [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/lit_resources/english%20102/miscellaneous/freytag.htm Freytag’s Triangle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716152819/http://www.english.uiuc.edu/lit_resources/english%20102/miscellaneous/freytag.htm |date=July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle's analysis==
Many structural principles still in use by modern storytellers were explained by Aristotle in his ''Poetics''. In the part that we still have, he mostly analyzed the tragedy. A part analyzing the comedy is believed to have existed but is now lost.

Aristotle stated that the tragedy should imitate a whole action, which means that the events follow each other by probability or necessity, and that the causal chain has a beginning and an end.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0009 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VII]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a knot, a central problem that the protagonist must face. The play has two parts:  complication and unravelling.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; During complication, the protagonist finds trouble as the knot is revealed or tied; during unraveling, the knot is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section XVIII ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] are of special interest:  the reversal, which throws the action in a new direction, and the recognition, meaning the protagonist has an important revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0008 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VI]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reversals should happen as a necessary and probable cause of what happened before, which implies that turning points needs to be properly set up.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0013 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications should arise from a flaw in the protagonist. In the tragedy, this flaw will be his undoing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0015 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freytag's analysis&lt;!--'Dramatic arc' redirects here--&gt;==
[[File:Freytags pyramid.svg|thumb|250px|"Freytag's pyramid", symbolizing his theory of dramatic structure]]
According to Freytag, a drama is divided into five parts, or acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freytag|first=Gustav|title=Die Technik des Dramas|year=1863|url=http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|accessdate=2009-01-20|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116004731/http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some refer to as a '''{{visible anchor|dramatic arc}}'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and dénouement. Freytag's Pyramid can help writers organize their thoughts and ideas when describing the main problem of the drama, the rising action, the climax and the falling action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Freytag's analysis of dramatic structure is based on five-act plays, it can be applied (sometimes in a modified manner) to short stories and novels as well, making dramatic structure a [[literary element]]. Nonetheless, the pyramid is not always easy to use, especially in modern plays such as [[Alfred Uhry]]'s ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' and  [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'', which is actually divided into 25 scenes without concrete acts.

===Exposition===
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}

The exposition is the portion of a story that introduces important background information to the audience; for example, information about the setting, events occurring before the main plot, characters' back stories, etc. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising action===
In the rising action, a series of events build toward the point of greatest interest. The rising action of a story is the series of events that begin immediately after the exposition (introduction) of the story and builds up to the climax. These events are generally the most important parts of the story since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and ultimately the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=125-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climax===
{{main article|Climax (narrative)}}

The climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist's fate. If the story is a comedy and things were going badly for the protagonist, the plot will begin to unfold in his or her favor, often requiring  the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths.  If the story is a tragedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from good to bad for the protagonist, often revealing the protagonist's hidden weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=128-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falling action===
During the falling action, the conflict between the [[protagonist]] and the [[antagonist]] unravels, with the protagonist winning or losing against the antagonist. The falling action may contain a moment of final suspense, in which the final outcome of the conflict is in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dénouement&lt;!--'Dénouement' redirects here--&gt;===
{{see also|Detective dénouement }}
The '''''dénouement'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) comprises events from the end of the falling action to the actual ending scene of the drama or narrative. [[Conflict (narrative)|Conflict]]s are resolved, creating normality for the characters and a sense of [[catharsis]], or release of tension and anxiety, for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=137-140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the French word ''dénouement'' is derived from the word ''dénouer'', "to untie", from ''nodus'', Latin for "knot." It is the unraveling or untying of the complexities of a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The comedy ends with a ''dénouement'' (a conclusion), in which the protagonist is better off than at the story's outset. The tragedy ends with a catastrophe, in which the protagonist is worse off than at the beginning of the narrative. Exemplary of a comic ''dénouement'' is the final scene of [[Shakespeare]]’s comedy ''[[As You Like It]]'', in which couples marry, an evildoer repents, two disguised characters are revealed for all to see, and a ruler is restored to power. In Shakespeare's tragedies, the ''dénouement'' is usually the death of one or more characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==

Freytag's analysis was intended to apply to ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama, not modern.

Contemporary dramas increasingly use the fall to increase the relative height of the climax and dramatic impact ([[melodrama]]). The protagonist reaches up but falls and succumbs to doubts, fears, and limitations. The negative climax occurs when the protagonist has an epiphany and encounters the greatest fear possible or loses something important, giving the protagonist the courage to take on another obstacle. This confrontation becomes the classic climax.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;Teruaki Georges Sumioka: The Grammar of Entertainment Film 2005, {{ISBN|978-4-8459-0574-4}}; [http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sumioka-info/resouce/resouce.html lectures at Johannes-Gutenberg-University in German]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dusit Thani''' ({{lang-th|ดุสิตธานี}}) was a [[miniature city]] and [[micronation]] project created by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) of Siam (Thailand) in [[Dusit Palace]] (later moved to Phaya Thai) in the 1910s–1920s. The project explored aspects of democracy, as members of the court were to be "citizens" owning property in the model city. Elections were held, a constitution written, and two newspapers regularly published for the fictional country. Although critics have dismissed the project as nothing more than the king playing with dollhouses, others regard it as the first trial of a constitutional government in Thailand.

== Introduction ==
Dusit Thani was a Thai miniature city that was designed as a model city, established by King Vajiravudh or King Rama VI of Thailand. It was reported that Dusit Park was originally sited as the location of the city, which later was moved to Phraya Thai at the end of 1919. "Dusit Thani" means 'town in heaven'. "Dusit" is the name of the fourth of the six levels of Buddhist heaven and "Thani" means 'town'.&lt;ref name=SteveVanBeek&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beek|first1=Steve Van|title=The Heavenly City of Dusit Thani|url=http://www.stevevanbeek.com/4a1b_heavenly_city_of_dusit_thani.php|website=Steve Van Beek|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Rama VI was interested in democracy as he was the first Thai king to go to study abroad in England and to pursue the intention of his father (King Rama V) and grandfather (King Rama IV) of bringing modernization to the nation. The city was an experiment in democratic constitution which the king, himself, chose to initiate.&lt;ref name=ken2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=L.|first1=Ken|title=The Story of Thai Democracy: Royal Origins|url=https://kenlwrites.com/2017/06/21/the-story-of-thai-democracy-1-royal-origins/|website=KEN L|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== King Vajiravudh (King Rama VI) ==
The reign of [[Vajiravudh|King Rama VI]] is considered one of the golden ages of Thai literature. He was hoping to educate his citizens about [[democracy]] and set up Dusit Thani, a democratic model city. It was difficult for Thai's at that time to understand the king, who was Westernized, and his concept of democracy because it was unfamiliar and hard to comprehend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=His Majesty King Mongkutklao or King Rama VI|url=http://www.surdi.su.ac.th/en/2014/07/his-majesty-king-mongkutklao-or-king-rama-vi/|website=Silapakorn University Research and Development Institute|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background of Dusit Thani ==
In the nineteenth century, [[Scale model|miniature]] objects became a [[fad]], especially in England where King Rama VI was educated. Dusit Thani was an example of the miniature object at that period. The intention of the city was to show equality of all citizens in a democratic society. Craftsmen were hired by noble families in Bangkok in order to reconstruct their houses in the miniature city. They had to register and buy land to become citizens in the city. They could freely express and participate in debating public affairs in the city. Two political groups were founded in Dusit Thani, the Blue Party and the Red Party. King Rama VI adopted the name "MR. Rama" to participate in the city.&lt;ref name=SteveVanBeek /&gt;&lt;ref name=ken2017 /&gt;

== Geography ==
[[Dusit District|Dusit Park]] was a rice field before modernizing.  Later, Dusit Thani was relocated to [[Phaya Thai District|Phraya Thai]] where it was redeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peleggi|first1=Maurizio|title=Lord of things|date=2002|publisher=University of Hawai'I Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
The miniature model city was planned on one acre of the Dusit Park or the Royal Amporn Gardens near the present Congress building. Buildings inside Dusit Thani were scaled to one-fifteenth life size. Palaces, hotels, hospitals, a clock tower, 12-story buildings, a fire brigade, a bank, flying bridges, trade centers, canal locks, and newspapers, were represented in the city.&lt;ref name=SteveVanBeek /&gt;

== Reception ==
The project was a failure. It was rejected because the country was not ready for democracy and if the city was actually built, the constitution would be used only in the city but not nationwide. The constitution of Dusit Thani was written by King Rama VI and it was administered by the Blue and the Red political groups with representatives selected by elections. In 1925, the king died, which caused a halt to the miniature city project and the city was never actually built. There were some attempts by Thai students, who were educated in Europe and had been interested in democracy and modernization, to carry on the ideal of democracy. Seven years after the king's death a revolution occurred. A new government, a [[constitutional monarchy]], replaced 700 years of absolute monarchy. However, Dusit Thani had a different path. The model city was poorly preserved after the king's death and had never been repaired. Only a few surviving buildings were moved to the gardens of the Monk's Hospital. They were either covered by dust or ended up in trash cans. No remains are left to be seen today except for a tiny bandstand.&lt;ref name=SteveVanBeek /&gt;&lt;ref name=ken2017 /&gt;

'''French post-structuralist feminism''' takes [[post-structuralism]] and combines it with [[feminist]] views and looks to see if a literary work has successfully used the process of [[mimesis]] on the image of the female. If successful, then a new image of a [[woman]] has been created by a woman for a woman, therefore it is not a biased opinion created by [[men]]. Along with [[Luce Irigaray]] and [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Hélène Cixous]] is considered one of the mothers of poststructuralist feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zffBjzTsRHUC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Feminism: a paradigm shift |page=88 |first=Neeru |last=Tandon |year=2008 |isbn=9788126908882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, these three together with [[Bracha Ettinger]] have considerably influenced French feminism and [[Feminist psychology|feminist]] [[psychoanalysis]].

==''L’Écriture féminine''==
''[[Écriture féminine]]'' literally means ''women's writing.'' It is a [[philosophy]] that promotes women's experiences and feelings to the point that it strengthens the work. It is a strain of feminist literary theory that originated in France in the 1970s.

[[Hélène Cixous]] first uses this term in her essay, ''The Laugh of the Medusa'' in which she asserts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies. Écriture féminine places experience before language, and privileges the anti-linear, cyclical writing so often frowned upon by patriarchal society.''{{cite quote|date=April 2017}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Important French post-structuralist feminists==
===Hélène Cixous===

In the 1970s, Cixous began writing about the relationship between sexuality and language. Like many other feminist theorists, Cixous believes that human sexuality is directly tied to how people communicate in society.

====The Laugh of the Medusa====
In [[Hélène Cixous]]' essay "The Laugh of the Medusa", she discusses how women have been repressed through their bodies all through history. She suggests that if women are forced to remain in their bodies as a result of male repression then they can do one of two things. The first option is to remain trapped inside their bodies, thereby perpetuating the passivity women have been a party to throughout history. The second option is to use the female body as a medium of communication, a tool through which women can speak. This is ironic given the body, the very thing women have been defined by and trapped within, can now become a vehicle in transcending the boundaries once created by the body.&lt;ref name = "adv"/&gt;

In the original myth Medusa was a beautiful woman who confronted endless hardships that were brought about by the actions of men. She was raped, killed, and beheaded by various gods. However even in the face of tragedy and disgrace, Medusa was still portrayed as a meaningful figure. Following the moment her head was cut off, a Pegasus flew out of her body, representing the birth of beauty.

In the more popular version known by most today, Medusa is a monster with hair of a thousand snakes whose glance will turn anything she looks at into stone. Cixous claims that this monstrous image of Medusa exists only because it has been directly determined by the male gaze. Even though this version of the myth is misrepresentative of the original version, people continue to believe the modern version without question.&lt;ref name = "adv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/english/English295/albright/main1.htm |title=Helene Cixous' "The Laugh of the Medusa" Resource Page |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cixous suggests that it is important for women to expose the flaws in language that currently exist. Through the awareness of such flaws, as well as the invention of new ways of expression, women can overcome the obstacles that are constructed by what she labels a phallocentric discourse. She argues that even through attempts to expose current inadequacies, it will always be impossible to define a feminine practice of writing because this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded. "It will always surpass the discourse that regulates the phallocentric system; it does and will take place in areas other than those subordinated to philosophico-theoretical domination. It will be conceived of only by those who are breakers of automatisms." &lt;ref name = "adv"/&gt;

===Luce Irigaray===
Born in [[Belgium]] in 1932 Irigaray is a French feminist, psychoanalytic, and cultural theorist. Best known works: Speculum of the Other Woman (1974) and This Sex is Not One (1977).
She was inspired by the psychoanalytic theories of [[Jaques Lacan]] and the deconstruction of Jaques Derrida. Her work aims to reveal a perceived masculine philosophy underlying language and gestures toward a “new” feminine language that would allow women to express themselves if it could be spoken.

===Julia Kristeva===
Born on June 24, 1941 in [[Bulgaria]] Kristeva is a Bulgarian-French philosopher, [[literary critic]], [[psychoanalyst]], [[feminist]], and (most recently) novelist, who has lived in France since the mid-1960s. [[Julia Kristeva]] has become influential in today's international critical analysis, cultural theory, and feminism after publishing her first book ''Semeiotikè'' in 1969.
Although Kristeva does not refer to her own writing as feminist, many feminists turn to her work in order to expand and develop various discussions and debates in feminist theory and criticism.

Three elements of Kristeva's thought have been particularly important for feminist theory in Anglo-American contexts:
*Her attempt to bring the body back into discourses in the human sciences;
*Her focus on the significance of the maternal body and pre-oedipal in the constitution of subjectivity; and
Her notion of abjection as an explanation for oppression and discrimination.

===Critique of classical psychoanalysis===
[[Sigmund Freud]] established the initial theories which would serve as a basis for some of Cixous' arguments in her writings. Freud's analysis of gender roles and sexual identity concluded with separate male ([[Oedipus]]) and female ([[Electra]]) theories of which Cixous was critical. For [[Bracha Ettinger]] both Oedipus and Electra are complexes that belong to the phallic paradigm. She proposes a different paradigm: the feminine-matrixial borderspace.

'''Gaita''' is a style of Venezuelan folk [[music]] from [[Maracaibo]] in [[Zulia State]]. According to Joan Corominas, it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for "goat", which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the [[furro]] instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include [[maraca]]s, [[cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]], [[charrasca]] and [[tambora (Venezuelan drum)]]. Song themes range from humorous and love songs to [[protest song]]s.

The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as [[salsa music|salsa]] and [[Merengue music|merengue]] in the 1970s.

Famous Gaita groups include  Cardenales del Éxito, Rincón Morales, Estrellas del Zulia, Barrio Obrero, [[Gran Coquivacoa]], Saladillo, Universidad de la Gaita, Koquimba, Melody Gaita,   [[Maracaibo 15]],and many others. The group [[Guaco (band)|Guaco]] started as a Gaita group but now plays a unique and distinct rhythm influenced by many Afro-Caribbean and Iberian rhythms including Gaita Zuliana, Tamborera, Joropo, Son Montuno, Tamunangue, Copla, Chinmangele, Guaracha, Vals, Merengue, Rumba, Fandango, Buleria, Flamenco, and many other.

[[Trinidad and Tobago]] has adopted gaita and calls it [[parang]] with some variation. Trinidad shares a common history of Spanish colonisation with Venezuela and there have been close relationships between the two countries with many aspects of shared culture. Since Trinidad shares a history of oil exploration &amp; production with Venezuela, many early workers within the Venezuelan oil industry came from Trinidad and this has stimulated many interactions between the peoples. The [[Taíno people]] from Venezuela first settled Trinidad 10,000 years ago before sea level rise further divided Trinidad from mainland Venezuela.

==Types==
There are many types of Gaita.

*Folk Gaita (disappeared)
*Contemporary Gaita

[[File:HowNotToWriteAPlay.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]])]]
'''''How Not to Write a Play''''' is a book written by [[Walter Kerr]], one time chief theatre critic for the ''[[New York Times]]''.

The first edition was published in 1955 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], four years after Kerr had begun work as a theater critic for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''.

His book is an examination of what Kerr perceived were various negative trends and flaws in playwriting. Kerr's tone is at various points jocular, learned and lucid, with humorous titles, clear prose and an evident wide knowledge of playwrights from the [[Greek literature|Greeks]] all the way to [[Arthur Miller]] and other playwrights of the mid 20th century.

Of moderate length (244 pages), the book takes on many themes and topics. Kerr offers insights both into the practice and finances of contemporary theatre, blaming the declining audience (declining even in 1955) on the poor and un-entertaining fare being put before the public by both commercial and institutional producers.

In particular, he blames decades of slavish imitation of [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], not only because their styles had become hackneyed and arthritic (Ibsen, himself, had abandoned "Ibsenism" after only a decade), but because they were created by and for an intelligentsia, and no thriving theatrical culture has ever been built that way, citing the case of [[William Shakespeare]] ''vs.'' the school of [[John Lyly]], among others.

He asserts that plays will always be more successful if they are highly entertaining, and argues that that entertainment can be at once enjoyable and artistically sophisticated. He also calls for a return to verse, pointing out [[Christopher Fry]] as an example of a new and supple 20th-century theatrical verse style.

Above all, Kerr is an advocate for creating believable, active characters and putting them into interesting stories, even at the expense of clean structures in plays, overarching intellectual / political theses, or delicate dissections of neurasthenic and impotent personalities.

In light of Kerr's marriage to playwright [[Jean Collins Kerr]], his musing on the ethics of a critic reviewing a wife's play inspired [[Ira Levin]]'s [[Critic's Choice (play)|play]] and [[Critic's Choice (1963 film)|movie]] ''Critic's Choice''.

'''''Hulk''''' is a 2003 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[Hulk (comics)|character of the same name]] directed by [[Ang Lee]] which stars [[Eric Bana]] as the title character, [[Jennifer Connelly]] as [[Betty Ross]], [[Sam Elliott]] as General [[Thaddeus E. "Thunderbolt" Ross]] , [[Josh Lucas]], and [[Nick Nolte]] as Bruce's father. The film explores the origins of Bruce Banner, who after a lab accident involving gamma radiation finds himself able to turn into a huge green-skinned monster whenever he is emotionally provoked or stressed, while he is pursued by the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] and comes into a conflict with his biological father, who has his own dark agenda for his son.

Development for the film started as far back as 1990. The film was at one point to be directed by [[Joe Johnston]] and then [[Jonathan Hensleigh]]. More scripts had been written by Hensleigh, [[John Turman]], [[Michael France]], [[Zak Penn]] (who would go on to write ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''), [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]], [[Michael Tolkin]], and [[David Hayter]] before Ang Lee and [[James Schamus]]' involvement. ''Hulk'' was shot mostly in [[California]], primarily in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

''Hulk'' was a commercial success, grossing over $245 million worldwide, higher than its $137 million budget, earning praise for its visual effects, ambition, performances and complexity (especially compared with other superhero films released at that time), while the film's pacing, bleak tone, Hulk’s CGI aspects and lack of more action were subjects of criticism. A reboot, titled ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', was released on June 13, 2008 as the second film of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Plot==
During the 1960s, [[scientist]] David Banner has the idea to forge [[supersoldier]]s by introducing modified [[DNA]] sequences extracted from various [[animals]] to strengthen the human cellular response, but General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] denies him permission to use human subjects, considering it dangerous and stupid. Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself. After the birth of his son Bruce, he finds that his son may have inherited the effects and seeks a cure, but is stopped in the process by a furious Ross who'd found out about the secret work. Following a traumatic event, Bruce remembers nothing of the incident, and has been raised by the Krenzlers.

Years later, Bruce is a [[geneticist]] working with colleague and girlfriend [[Betty Ross]], within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on [[nanobot|nanomed]] research to achieve instantaneous cell repair by using low-level [[gamma radiation]] exposure to turn on the nanomeds once they are introduced into a living organism, planning to use it to cure all from sicknesses such as [[cancer]] and [[Alzheimer's]]. They get harassed by Major [[Glenn Talbot]] who plans to use the work to forge supersoldiers. During routine maintenance of their appropriated [[gamma-ray spectrometer]], a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment's program sequence. Unable to prevent the machine from firing, Bruce throws himself in front of a colleague to shield the man and is exposed to a massive amount of [[gamma radiation]].

Betty visits Bruce in the hospital and remarks that he should be dead, but Bruce feels great. A new [[janitor]] at the lab claims that he is Bruce's biological father, whom Bruce forgot. Bruce presumes the janitor was lying until he finds it was truth when he checks his own genes. When under extreme stress, Bruce transforms into the Hulk, a huge, humanoid, green-skinned monstrous being who destroys the laboratory, though Bruce forgets soon after. General Ross suspects Bruce of collaborating with David Banner but deduces Bruce has [[repressed memories]] after questioning. He orders Bruce to be put under house arrest.

Through a phone call with his father, Bruce learns that the radiation unleashed something that was already in his DNA, and that David Banner plans to have Betty killed by his [[dogs]], which now have similar powers to the Hulk thanks to David mutating them with gamma radiation. Bruce is then attacked by Talbot who accused him of going behind the back to cut him from the work, leading to a second transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seriously injures Talbot before leaping to save Betty. After being wounded in a lengthy struggle, he kills David's dogs and changes back into Bruce before being captured by the military the next morning.

Bruce is kept under observation at a secret desert base, while Talbot intends to weaponize the Hulk's powers. David tries to recreate Bruce's failed experiment, but instead of turning into another Hulk he finds himself able to [[Absorbing Man|absorb any material he touches]] or energy to which he is exposed. He hands himself over to the military after lying to Betty and telling that he had accidentally murdered his wife in front of the child Bruce due to fury done by Ross's interference.

Bruce has a nightmare about the event, he realises his father thought he was a monster and tried to kill him while his mother [[Self sacrifice|protected him]]. This leads to a more powerful transformation into the Hulk. While attempting to gain a sample of the monster, Talbot is killed by a [[grenade-launcher]] he uses. The Hulk escapes Desert Base and rampages across the desert to [[San Francisco]], battling Army forces sent after him. Betty calms Bruce into his human form.

David tries to taunt his son into transforming into the Hulk, but fails. He then decides to "go first" and bites an electrical cable, absorbing all the electricity in San Francisco. The electricity hits Bruce, triggering his own transformation. A brutal fight ensues between David and the Hulk, with David absorbing the Hulk's energy. It proves too much for David to handle, but when he himself transforms into a massive creature, he is killed by an Army missile. One year later, Bruce is presumed dead, while General Ross mentions apparent Hulk sightings and Betty admits her love for Bruce. In a [[South American]] [[jungle]], Bruce has become a doctor and is approached by rebel militants who want to take medical supplies from the poor. Bruce faces the militants' leader, warning him that, "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry". His eye turns green and the roar of the Hulk is heard from the distance.

==Cast==
*[[Eric Bana]] as [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner / Hulk]] (known legally as Bruce Krenzler throughout the movie): a gamma-radiation research scientist who was exposed to a large amount of gamma radiations in an accident in his labs and after the incident. Bana was cast in October 2001, signing for an additional two sequels.&lt;ref name=Rider/&gt; Ang Lee felt obliged to cast Bana upon seeing ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'', and first approached the actor in July 2001.&lt;ref name=Chopper&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Rob Worley]]|url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=2269|title = Countdown to ''Hulk'': Ang Lee's new green destiny|publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]]|date = 2003-06-19|accessdate = 2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was heavily pursued by other actors. Bana was also in heavy contention for ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'', but lost out to [[Nicolas Cage]].&lt;ref name=Rider/&gt; Bana explained, "I was obsessed with [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|the TV show]].

==Development==

===Jonathan Hensleigh===
Producers [[Avi Arad]] and [[Gale Anne Hurd]] began the development for ''Hulk'' in 1990,&lt;ref name=Hurd&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Rob Worley]]|url =http://www.mania.com/bcomiccon-ihulk-hulk-hulkib_article_88790.html|title = Comic-Con: ''Hulk'', ''Hulk'', ''Hulk''!|publisher = Comics2Film|date = 2002-08-06|accessdate = 2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same year the final [[Death of the Incredible Hulk|TV movie based on the 1970s TV series]] aired. They set the property up at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR101955|title = Marvel Characters holding attraction for filmmakers|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = 1992-12-12|accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael France]] and Stan Lee were invited into Universal's offices in 1994, with France writing the script. Universal's concept was to have the Hulk battle [[terrorists]], an idea France disliked. [[John Turman]], a Hulk comic book fan, was brought to write the script in 1995, getting approval from Lee. Turman wrote ten drafts and was heavily influenced by the ''[[Tales to Astonish#The Hulk and the Sub-Mariner|Tales to Astonish]]'' issues, which pitted the Hulk against General Ross and the military,&lt;ref name=dream/&gt; the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], the atomic explosion origin from the comics,&lt;ref name=make/&gt; and [[Brian Banner]] as the explanation for Bruce's inner anger.

Hurd brought her husband [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] as co-producer the following year and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] was hired to use [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the Hulk. Universal was courting France once more to write the script,&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite book|author = David Hughes|title = Comic Book Movies|publisher = [[Virgin Books]]|year = 2003|location = [[London]]|pages = 261–269|isbn = 0-7535-0767-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but changed their minds when [[Joe Johnston]] became the director in April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Michael Fleming|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117434784|title = A Mania For Marvel|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = 1997-04-14|accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio wanted Hensleigh to rewrite the script due to his successful results on Johnston's ''[[Jumanji (film)|Jumanji]]''. France was fired before he wrote a single page, but received a buy-off from Universal.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; Johnston dropped out of directing in July 1997 in favor of ''[[October Sky]]'', and Hensleigh convinced Universal to make the ''Hulk'' his directing debut. Turman was brought back a second time to write two more drafts.

Filming was set to start in December 1997 in [[Arizona]] for a summer 1999 release date, but filming was pushed back for four months.&lt;ref name=bulk&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116675959|title = U bulks up ''Hulk''|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = 1997-08-11|accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karon/&gt; Hensleigh subsequently rewrote the script with [[J. J. Abrams]]. [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] were also brought on board to rewrite with Hensleigh still attached as director.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; In October 1997, ''Hulk'' had entered [[pre-production]] with the creation of [[prosthetic makeup]] and [[computer animation]] already under way. [[Gregory Sporleder]] was cast as "Novak", Banner's archenemy while [[Lynn "Red" Williams]] was cast as a convict who transforms into a combination of human, ant and beetle.&lt;ref name=Karon&gt;{{cite news|author = Paul Karon|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116674626|title = U adds duo to ''Hulk'' cast|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = 1997-10-31|accessdate = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1998 Universal put ''Hulk'' on [[Wikt:hiatus|hiatus]] due to its escalating $100 million budget and worries of Hensleigh directing his first film. $20 million was already spent on script development, computer animation, and prosthetics work. Hensleigh immediately went to rewrite the script in order to lower the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Chris Petrikin|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117468230|title = U has ''Hulk'' take a seat|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = 1998-03-02|accessdate = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael France===
Hensleigh found the rewriting process to be too difficult and dropped out, and felt he "wasted nine months in [[pre-production]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Ken P|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/496/496784p2.html|title = An Interview With Jonathan Hensleigh|publisher = [[IGN]]|date = 2004-03-05|accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time. France claimed "Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure if this was a [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[adventure film|adventure]], or a [[comedy film|comedy]], and I kept getting directions to write both. I think that at some point when I wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a [[Jim Carrey]] or [[Adam Sandler]] movie."&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; France was writing the script on fast track from July—September 1999. Filming for ''Hulk'' was to start in April 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Michael Fleming|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117503960|title = Marvel takes cue from its superheroes|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = 1999-07-13|accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Michael Fleming|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117755342|title = Stewart goes boldly; renewed U fills its slate|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = 1999-09-02|accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France stated his vision of the film was different from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his "amiable, [[nerd]]y genius" incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced [[Brian Banner]], Bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; However, he has [[anger management]] issues before the Hulk is even created, which makes everything worse. The "Don't make me angry..." line from the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|TV series]] was made into dialogue that Banner's father would say before beating his son. Elements such as the "Gammasphere", Banner's tragic romance with Ross, and the [[Black Operation|black op]]s made it to the final film. France turned in his final drafts in late 1999-January 2000.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

===Ang Lee===
[[Michael Tolkin]] and [[David Hayter]] rewrote the script afterwards, despite positive response from the producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured [[Leader (comics)|The Leader]], [[Zzzax]], and the [[Absorbing Man]] as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and get caught in the same accident that creates the Hulk.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hater"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Dayna Van Buskirk|title = Feature Article: The Lost ''Hulk'': David Hayter's Draft|publisher = [[UGO Networks]]|url = http://screenwriting.ugo.com/film/incrediblehulkbyhayter.php |accessdate=2010-04-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080602002713/http://screenwriting.ugo.com/film/incrediblehulkbyhayter.php |archivedate = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Ang Lee]] and his producing partner [[James Schamus]] became involved with the film in January 20, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Cathy Dunkley|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117791724.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title = From ''Tiger'' to U's ''Hulk'' for helmer|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = 2001-01-12|accessdate = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's father with the Absorbing Man.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Andy Seiler|url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-04-13-ang-lee.htm#more|title = Ang Lee gets inside Hulk's head|work= [[USA Today]]|date = 2001-04-13|accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee cited influences from ''[[King Kong]]'', ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Faust]]'', and [[Greek mythology]] for his interpretation of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Scott B|title = An Interview with Ang Lee|publisher = [[IGN]]|date = 2003-06-17|url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/424/424621p1.html|accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.&lt;ref name="beast"&gt;{{cite news|author = Adam Smith|title = The Beast Within|pages = 66–77|work= [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date = 2003-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France criticized Schamus and Hayter for claiming they were aiming to make Banner a deeper character, and was saddened they had denigrated his and Turman's work in interviews. Schamus elected to get solo credit. France felt, "James Schamus did a significant amount of work on the screenplay. For example, he brought in the Hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use Banner's father as a real character in the present. But he used quite a lot of elements from John Turman's scripts and quite a lot from mine, and that's why we were credited."&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Rob Worley]]|url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=2258|title = Countdown to 'Hulk': Screenwriter Michael France talks ''Hulk'', ''Punisher'' and Beyond|publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]]|date = 2003-06-17|accessdate = 2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Rob Worley]]|url =http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=2206|title = Countdown to ''Hulk'': Producers Avi Arad and Gale Anne Hurd talk|publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]]|date = 2003-06-05|accessdate = 2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Turman and Schamus received final credit.

===Filming===
Filming began on March 18, 2002 in [[Arizona]], and moved on April 19 to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. This included [[Advanced Light Source]], [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley labs]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island military base]], and the sequoia forests of [[Porterville, California|Porterville]], before several weeks in the [[Utah]] and [[California]]n deserts. The penultimate battle scene between Hulk and his father used the real Pear Lake in Sequoia National Park as a backdrop. Filming then moved to the Universal backlot in [[Los Angeles]], using Stage 12 for the water tank scene, before finishing in the first week of August. Filming of ''Hulk'' constituted hiring 3,000 local workers, generating over $10 million into the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Rob Worley]]|title = Berkeley Workers Make Way For ''The Hulk''|date = 2002-04-16|url = http://www.mania.com/berkeley-workers-make-way-for-bithe-hulkib_article_88063.html|publisher = Comics2Film|accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = David E.Williams|title = Temper, Temper,|date = July 2003|url = http://www.theasc.com/magazine/july03/cover/page2.html#|work= [[American Cinematographer]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marv&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Rob Worley]]|title = Marvel CC: ''Hulk'' TV, ''Daredevil'' Trailer 2, ''Punisher'', More!|date = 2002-08-09|url = http://www.mania.com/marvel-cc-hulk-tv-daredevil-trailer-2-punisher-more_article_88811.html|publisher = Comics2Film|accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leung&gt;{{cite news|author = Kevin Leung|url = http://www.mania.com/bihulkib-smashes-san-fran_article_88162.html|title = ''Hulk'' Smashes San Fran!|publisher = Comics2Film|date = 2002-04-26|accessdate = 2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mychael Danna]], who previously collaborated with Lee on ''[[Ride with the Devil (film)|Ride with the Devil]]'' and ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]]'', was set to compose the [[film score]] before dropping out.

Eric Bana commented that the shoot was, "Ridiculously serious... a silent set, morbid in a lot of ways." Lee told him that he was shooting a Greek tragedy: he would be making a "whole other movie" about the Hulk at [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].

The [[film score|musical score]] for ''Hulk'' was composed by [[Danny Elfman]], who scored ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' the previous year.

However, Danna's score was rejected by studio executives for its non-traditional approach, which featured Japanese taiko, African drumming, and Arabic singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wheeler|first1=Brad|title=Life of Pi composer Mychael Danna on making a soundtrack sing and a director happy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/awards-and-festivals/film-awards/life-of-pi-composer-mychael-danna-on-making-a-soundtrack-sing-and-a-director-happy/article8970089/|website=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=August 16, 2014|date=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elfman was then approached by Universal's president of film music, Kathy Nelson. With 37 days to compose over two hours of music, Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Patrick|title=Elfman masters a monster: Score one for 'The Hulk'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/24/entertainment/et-gold24|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=August 16, 2014|date=June 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; While instructing to retain much of the character of Danna's score, Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did not sound like his previous superhero scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filmtracks: Hulk |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/hulk.html |website=[[Filmtracks.com]] |accessdate=August 16, 2014 |date=March 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030722044336/http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/hulk.html |archivedate=July 22, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "They did leave some of my music in the movie," said Danna, "so the Arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine. What happened is that they panicked, they brought in Danny and he heard what I've been doing and I guess he liked it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Evening with Mychael Danna on the Phone|url=http://www.bsospirit.com/entrevistas/danna2_e.php|website=BSOSpirit|accessdate=August 16, 2014|page=2|date=March 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[soundtrack album]] was released on June 17, 2003 by [[Decca Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phares|first1=Heather|title=Hulk [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hulk-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000033896|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features the song "[[Set Me Free (Velvet Revolver song)|Set Me Free]]" by [[Velvet Revolver]], which is played during the film's end credits.

==Release==
===Marketing===
Universal Pictures spent $2.1&amp;nbsp;million to market the film in a 30-second [[television advertisement|television spot]] during [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] on January 26, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Brian Linder|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/383/383657p1.html|title = Super Bowl Shuffle|publisher = [[IGN]]|date = 2003-01-24|accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; And a 70-second teaser trailer was attached to ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' on May 3, 2002. Just weeks before the film's release, a number of [[workprint]]s were leaked on the Internet. The visual and special effects were already being criticized, despite the fact that it was not the final editing cut of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Rob Worley]]|url =http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=2231|title = ''Criminal Macabre'', ''Transformers'', ''Hulk'' and ''Spider-Man'': Comics2Film wrap for June 11, 2003|publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]]|date = 2003-06-11|accessdate = 2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''Hulk'' received mixed-to-positive reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calculated a 62% approval rating out of 232 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "While Ang Lee's ambitious film earns marks for style and an attempt at dramatic depth, there's ultimately too much talking and not enough smashing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hulk/|title = Hulk (2003)|publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate = 2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison [[Metacritic]] collected an average score of 54 based on 40 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hulk| title = Hulk (2003): Reviews|publisher = [[Metacritic]]|accessdate = 2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave a positive review, explaining, "[[Ang Lee]] is trying to actually deal with the issues in the story of the Hulk, instead of simply cutting to brainless [[visual effects]]." Ebert also liked how the Hulk's movements resembled [[King Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Roger Ebert]]|url =

Conversely, [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' considered "the film is more thoughtful and pleasing to the eye than any blockbuster in recent memory, but its epic length comes without an epic reward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Mick LaSalle]]|url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/10/31/DD153299.DTL|title = ''Hulk'' is a smash-'em-up blockbuster|work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date = 2003-10-31|accessdate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ty Burr]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' felt "[[Jennifer Connelly]] reprises her stand-by-your-messed-up-scientist turn from ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Ty Burr]]|url = http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;id=1842|title = This not-so-incredible ''Hulk'' takes simple joys to serious extremes|publisher = [[The Boston Globe]]|date = 2003-06-29|accessdate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated, "a big-budget comic-book adaptation has rarely felt so humorless and intellectually defensive about its own pulpy roots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Lisa Schwarzbaum|url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,458306~1~0~hulk,00.html|title = The Hulk (2003)|work= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date = 2003-06-20|accessdate = 2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, ''Hulk'' received retrospective praise from critics for its artistic difference from other superhero films. In 2012, [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] cited the film as one of the few big budget superhero films that "really departed from formula, in terms of subject matter or tone", writing that the film is "pretty bizarre... in its old-school Freudian psychology, but interesting for that reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Matt Zoller Seitz|Seitz, Matt Zoller]]|author2=Abrams, Simon|title=TRAILER WATCH – Marvel’s THE AVENGERS: Just Another Superhero Movie?|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2012/03/trailer-watch-marvels-the-avengers-just-another-superhero-movie-132289/|website=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation|Penske Business Media, LLC]]|accessdate=13 November 2018|date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scout Tafoya's 2016 video essay on another film directed by Ang Lee, ''[[Ride with the Devil (film)|Ride with the Devil]]'', he mentioned ''Hulk'' as "Lee's ill-fated but quietly soulful and deeply sad adaptation of ''The Incredible Hulk'' comics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tafoya|first1=Scout|title=The Unloved - Ride with the Devil|url=https://vimeo.com/181056445|website=[[Vimeo]]|publisher=Vimeo, Inc.|accessdate=13 November 2018|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Peter Sobczynski of [[RogerEbert.com]] wrote that the film is "a genuinely great example of cinematic pop art that deserves a reappraisal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sobczynski|first1=Peter|title=Stan Lee: 1922-2018|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/stan-lee-1922-2018|website=[[Roger Ebert]]|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=13 November 2018|date=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''Hulk'' was released on June 20, 2003, earning $62.1&amp;nbsp;million in its opening weekend, which made it the 16th highest ever opener at the time. With a second weekend drop of 70%, it was the first opener above $20&amp;nbsp;million to drop over 65%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/drops.htm| title=Biggest Second Weekend Drops at the Box Office |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went on to gross $132,177,234 in North America on an estimated budget of $137,000,000, and made $113,183,246 in foreign countries, coming to a worldwide total of $245,360,480.&lt;ref name=mojo&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hulk.htm|title = Hulk (2003)|publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a final North American gross of $132.2&amp;nbsp;million it became the largest opener not to earn $150&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/|title=Biggest Opening Weekends at the Box Office|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
Connelly and [[Danny Elfman]] received nominations at the [[30th Saturn Awards]] with [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Music|Best Music]]. The film was nominated for [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] but lost out to another film based on Marvel characters, ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''.

==Reboot==
{{Main|The Incredible Hulk (film)}}
After the mixed reception of ''Hulk'', [[Marvel Studios]] reacquired the film rights to the character, and writer [[Zak Penn]] began work on a sequel titled ''The Incredible Hulk''. However, [[Edward Norton]] rewrote Penn's script after he signed on to star, retelling the origin story in flashbacks and revelations, to help in establishing the film as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]; director [[Louis Leterrier]] agreed with this approach.&lt;ref name=muscle&gt;{{cite news| title = Norton's Double Duty on Hulk|publisher = SuperheroHype.com| date = 2007-08-15|url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=6209|accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leterrier acknowledged that the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in [[South America]].&lt;ref name=nycc&gt;{{cite news| title = .

'''''Krazy Kat''''' (also known as '''''Krazy &amp; Ignatz''''' in some reprints and compilations) is an American newspaper [[comic strip]] by cartoonist [[George Herriman]] (1880–1944), which ran from 1913 to 1944. It first appeared in the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York Evening Journal]]'', whose owner, [[William Randolph Hearst]], was a major booster for the strip throughout its run. The characters had been introduced previously in a side strip with Herriman's earlier creation, ''[[The Dingbat Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blackbeard, Bill and Martin Williams, "The Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics". pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "Krazy Kat" originated there, said by the mouse by way of describing the cat. Set in a dreamlike portrayal of Herriman's vacation home of [[Coconino County, Arizona]], ''Krazy'' {{nowrap|''Kat''{{'s}}}} mixture of offbeat [[surrealism]], innocent playfulness and poetic, idiosyncratic language has made it a favorite of comics aficionados and art critics for more than 80 years.&lt;ref name = "Kramer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD 26"&gt;McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip focuses on the curious relationship between a guileless, carefree, simple-minded cat named Krazy of indeterminate gender (referred to as both "he" and "she") and a short-tempered mouse named Ignatz. Krazy nurses an unrequited love for the mouse. However, Ignatz despises Krazy and constantly schemes to throw bricks at Krazy's head, which Krazy interprets as a sign of affection, uttering grateful replies such as "Li'l dollink, allus f'etful", or "Li'l ainjil". A third principal character, Officer Bull Pupp, often appears and tries to "protect" Krazy by thwarting Ignatz' attempts and imprisoning him. Later on, Officer Pupp falls in love with Krazy.

Despite the slapstick simplicity of the general premise, the detailed characterization, combined with Herriman's visual and verbal creativity,  made ''Krazy Kat'' one of the first comics to be widely praised by intellectuals and treated as "serious" art.&lt;ref name="Kramer"&gt;Kramer.&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[Gilbert Seldes]] wrote a lengthy [[panegyric]] to the strip in 1924, calling it "the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in America today."&lt;ref&gt;Seldes, Gilbert. "[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/SELDES/ch15.html The Krazy Kat That Walks By Himself]". The Seven Lively Arts. New York: Harper and Brothers, 1924, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[E. E.

== Overview ==
[[File:1922 0121 krazykat det 650.jpg|thumb|400px|right|alt=cartoon page of Krazy Kat as Krazy tries to understand why Door Mouse is carrying a door from January 21, 1922|Notice the ever-changing backgrounds in this January 21, 1922 page as Krazy tries to understand why Door Mouse is carrying a door.]]

''Krazy Kat'' takes place in a heavily stylized version of [[Coconino County, Arizona]], with Herriman filling the page with caricatured flora and fauna, and rock formation landscapes typical of the [[Painted Desert (Arizona)|Painted Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;Heer 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt; These backgrounds tend to change dramatically between panels, even while the characters remain stationary. While the local geography is fluid, certain sites were stable—and featured so often in the strip as to become iconic. These latter included Officer Pupp's jailhouse and Kolin Kelly's brickyard. A Southwestern visual style is evident throughout, with clay-shingled rooftops, trees planted in pots with designs imitating [[Navajo people|Navajo]] art, along with references to Mexican-American culture. The strip also occasionally features incongruous trappings borrowed from the stage, with curtains, backdrops, theatrical placards, and sometimes even floor lights framing the panel borders.

The descriptive passages mix whimsical, often [[alliteration|alliterative]] language with [[eye spelling|phonetically-spelled dialogue]] and a strong poetic sensibility ("[[Agathla Peak|Agathla]], centuries aslumber, shivers in its sleep with splenetic splendor, and spreads abroad a seismic spasm with the supreme suavity of a vagabond volcano.").&lt;ref&gt;''A Mice, A Brick, A Lovely Night'' 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Herriman was also fond of experimenting with unconventional page layouts in his Sunday strips, including panels of various shapes and sizes, arranged in whatever fashion he thought would best tell the story.

Though the basic concept of the strip is simple, Herriman always found ways to tweak the formula. Ignatz's plans to surreptitiously lob a brick at Krazy's head sometimes succeed; other times Officer Pupp outsmarts Ignatz and imprisons him. The interventions of Coconino County's other anthropomorphic animal residents, and even forces of nature, occasionally change the dynamic in unexpected ways. Other strips have Krazy's imbecilic or [[Gnome (rhetoric)|gnomic]] pronouncements irritating the mouse so much that he goes to seek out a brick in the final panel. Even [[self-referential humor]] is evident—in one strip, Officer Pupp, having arrested Ignatz, berates Herriman for not having finished drawing the jailhouse.&lt;ref&gt;''Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman'' 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public reaction at the time was mixed; many were puzzled by its iconoclastic refusal to conform to linear comic strip conventions and straightforward gags. But publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] loved ''Krazy Kat'', and it continued to appear in his papers throughout its run, sometimes only by his direct order.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cast of characters ==

=== Krazy Kat ===
Simple-minded, curious, mindlessly happy and perpetually innocent, the strip's title character drifts through life in Coconino County without a care. Krazy's dialogue is a highly stylized [[argot]] ("A fowl konspirissy – is it pussible?")&lt;ref&gt;''Pilgrims on the Road to Nowhere'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; phonetically evoking a mixture of English, French, Spanish, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and other dialects, often identified as George Herriman's own native [[New Orleans]] dialect, [[Yat dialect|Yat]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; Often singing and dancing to express the Kat's eternal joy, Krazy is hopelessly in love with Ignatz and thinks that the mouse's brick-tossing is his way of returning that love. Krazy is also completely unaware of the bitter rivalry between Ignatz and "Offissa" Pupp and mistakes the dog's frequent imprisonment of the mouse for an innocent game of [[tag (game)|tag]] ("Ever times I see them two playing games togedda, Ignatz seems to be It").&lt;ref&gt;''There is a Heppy Lend, Fur, Fur Awa-a-ay-'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt; On those occasions when Ignatz is caught before he can launch his brick, Krazy is left pining for the "l'il ainjil" and wonders where the beloved mouse has gone.

Krazy's own gender is never made clear and appears to be fluid, varying from strip to strip. Most authors post-Herriman (beginning with Cummings) have mistakenly referred to Krazy only as female,&lt;ref&gt;Crocker.&lt;/ref&gt; but Krazy's creator was more ambiguous and even published several strips poking fun at this uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;''Necromancy By the Blue Bean Bush'', 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Katnip Kantata in the Key of K'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; When filmmaker [[Frank Capra]], a fan of the strip, asked Herriman to straightforwardly define the character's sex, the cartoonist admitted that Krazy was "something like a sprite, an elf. They have no sex. So that Kat can't be a he or a she. The Kat's a spirit—a pixie—free to butt into anything."&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most characters inside the strip use "he" and "him" to refer to Krazy, likely as a gender-neutral "he".

=== Ignatz Mouse ===
[[File:Krazypanel-4-16-1922.jpg|thumb|right|266px|alt=cartoon Ignatz being marched off by Officer Pupp for trying to throw a brick at Krazy Kat.|Ignatz being marched off by Officer Pupp for trying to throw a brick at Krazy Kat. Behind the newspaper, Krazy is reading and describing aloud the very same cartoon in which they are all appearing.]]
Ignatz is driven to distraction by Krazy's naïveté, and he throws bricks at Krazy Kat's head.  To shield his plans from Officer Pupp, Ignatz hides his bricks, disguises himself, or enlists the aid of willing Coconino County denizens (without making his intentions clear). Easing Ignatz's task is Krazy Kat's willingness to meet him anywhere at any appointed time, eager to receive a token of affection in the form of a brick to the head.  Ignatz is married with three children, though they are rarely seen.

Ironically, although Ignatz seems to generally dislike Krazy, one strip shows his ancestor, [[Mark Antony]] Mouse, fall in love with Krazy's ancestor, an Egyptian cat princess (calling her his "Star of the Nile"), and pay a sculptor to carve a brick with a love message. When he throws it at her, he is arrested, but she announces her love for him, and from that day on, he throws bricks at her to show his love for her (which would explain why Krazy believes that Ignatz throwing bricks is a sign of love). In another strip, Krazy kisses a sleeping Ignatz, and hearts appear above the mouse's head.

In the last five (or so) years of the strip, Ignatz's dislike for Krazy was noticeably downplayed. While earlier, one got the sense of his taking advantage of Krazy's willingness to be "bricked", now one gets the sense of Ignatz and Krazy as chummy co-conspirators against Pupp, with Ignatz at times quite aware of the positive way Krazy interprets his missiles.

=== Officer Bull Pupp ===
A police dog who loves Krazy, and always tries (sometimes successfully) to thwart Ignatz's desires to pelt Krazy Kat with bricks. Officer Pupp and Ignatz often try to get the better of each other even when Krazy is not directly involved, as they both enjoy seeing the other played for a fool. He appears slightly less frequently than Krazy and Ignatz. He is also the main character of his own short film series.

=== Secondary characters ===
Beyond these three, Coconino County is populated with an assortment of incidental, recurring characters.
*'''Joe [[Stork]]:''' the "purveyor of progeny to prince &amp; [[proletariat|proletarian]]",&lt;ref&gt;''A Mice, A Brick, A Lovely Night'' 67, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; often makes baby deliveries to various characters. (In one strip, Ignatz tries to trick him into dropping a brick onto Krazy's head from above). The character debuted in ''Gooseberry Sprig'' as the titular character's "Prime Minister." 
*'''Kolin Kelly:''' a dog; a brickmaker by trade who bakes his wares in a kiln.  Often Ignatz's source for projectiles, although he distrusts the mouse.
*'''Mrs. Kwakk Wakk:''' a duck in a [[pillbox hat]], a [[scold]] and busybody who frequently notices Ignatz in the course of his plotting and informs Officer Pupp. She is a social climber, attempting in one strip continuity to replace Pupp as police chief.

Other characters who make semi-frequent appearances are: 
*'''Walter Cephus Austridge:''' a nondescript [[ostrich]]
*'''Bum Bil Bee:''' a transient, bearded insect
*'''Don Kiyote:''' an inconsequential heterodox Mexican [[coyote]]
*'''Mock Duck:''' a clairvoyant fowl of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent who operates a [[Chinese laundry|cleaning establishment]].
*'''Gooseberry Sprig:''' the Duck Duke, who briefly starred in his own strip before ''Krazy Kat'' was created.
*Also: Krazy's '''Aunt Tabby''' and '''Uncle Tom'''; and his aerial and aquatic cousins, respectively: '''Krazy Katbird''' and '''Krazy Katfish'''. 
*Ignatz also has relations; his family of look-alike mice includes his wife, '''Magnolia''' and a trio of equally unruly sons named '''Milton, Marshall''' and '''Irving'''.

== History ==
''Krazy Kat'' evolved from an earlier comic strip of Herriman's, ''[[The Dingbat Family]]'', which started in June 1910 and was later renamed ''The Family Upstairs''. This comic chronicled the Dingbats' attempts to avoid the mischief of the mysterious unseen family living in the apartment above theirs and to unmask that family. Herriman would complete the cartoons about the Dingbats, and finding himself with time left over in his [[Eight-hour day|8-hour work day]], filled the bottom of the strip with slapstick drawings of the upstairs family's mouse preying upon the Dingbats' cat.&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Krazykat.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=cartoon page of Ignatz Mouse resolves not to throw any more bricks at Krazy. |Ignatz Mouse resolves not to throw any more bricks at Krazy. Temptation follows him at every turn, and ultimately he finds a loophole to indulge his passion. (January 6, 1918)]]

This "basement strip" grew into something much larger than the original cartoon. It became a daily comic strip with a title (running vertically down the side of the page) on October 28, 1913 and a black and white full-page Sunday cartoon on April 23, 1916. Due to the objections of editors, who didn't think it was suitable for the comics sections, ''Krazy Kat'' originally appeared in the Hearst papers' art and drama sections.&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell, O'Connell and De Havenon 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst himself, however, enjoyed the strip so much that he gave Herriman a lifetime contract and guaranteed the cartoonist complete creative freedom.

Despite its low popularity among the general public, ''Krazy Kat'' gained a wide following among intellectuals. In 1922, a [[jazz]] [[ballet]] based on the comic was produced and scored by [[John Alden Carpenter]]; though the performance played to sold-out crowds on two nights&lt;ref&gt;Blackbeard 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; and was given positive reviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'',&lt;ref name = "McDonnell 66-7"&gt;McDonnell, O'Connell and De Havenon 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; it failed to boost the strip's popularity as Hearst had hoped. In addition to Seldes and Cummings, contemporary admirers of ''Krazy Kat'' included [[Willem de Kooning]], [[H. L. Mencken]], and [[Jack Kerouac]].&lt;ref name="MOD 26"/&gt; More recent scholars and authors have seen the strip as reflecting the [[Dada]] movement&lt;ref&gt;Inge.&lt;/ref&gt; and prefiguring [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;Bloom.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1935, ''Krazy Kat''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Sunday edition was published in full color. Though the number of newspapers carrying it dwindled in its last decade, Herriman continued to draw ''Krazy Kat''—creating roughly 3,000 cartoons—until his death in April 1944 (the final page was published exactly two months later, on June 25). Hearst promptly canceled the strip after the artist died, because, contrary to the common practice of the time, he did not want to see a new cartoonist take over.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animated adaptations ===
[[File:Krazy Kat Bugologist 1916 silent.ogv|thumb|right|thumbtime=4|The title card of this 1916 silent short read ''Krazy Kat – Bugologist''. A Cartoon By George Herriman. Animated by [[Frank Moser (artist)|Frank Moser]]." Length 3m24s, 416kbit/s]]
The comic strip was animated several times (see filmography below).  The earliest ''Krazy Kat'' shorts were produced by Hearst in 1916. They were produced under [[Hearst-Vitagraph News Pictorial]] and later the [[International Film Service]] (IFS), though Herriman was not involved. In 1920, after a two-year hiatus, the [[Bray Productions|John R. Bray studio]] began producing a second series of ''Krazy Kat'' shorts.&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton.&lt;/ref&gt; These cartoons hewed close to the comic strips, including Ignatz, Pupp and other standard supporting characters. Krazy's ambiguous gender and feelings for Ignatz were usually preserved; bricks were occasionally thrown.  With added sound effects and music, these cartoons were in periodic reissue during the 1930s and 1940s, and ended up being syndicated to television in the 1950s.

In 1925, animation pioneer [[Bill Nolan (animator)|Bill Nolan]] decided to bring Krazy to the screen again.  Nolan intended to produce the series under Associated Animators, but when it dissolved, he sought distribution from [[Margaret J. Winkler]]. Unlike earlier adaptations, Nolan did not base his shorts on the characters and setting of the Herriman comic strip. Instead, the feline in Nolan's cartoons was a male cat whose design and personality both reflected [[Felix the Cat]].  This is probably due to the fact that Nolan himself was a former employee of the [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan]] studio.&lt;ref&gt;Maltin 205–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Herriman characters appeared in the Nolan cartoons at first, though similarly altered: Kwakk Wakk was at times Krazy's paramour,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler Productions: copyright synopsis for ''Web Feet'' (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; with Ignatz often the bully trying to break up the romance.&lt;ref&gt;''Rail Rode''.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Nolan's influence waned and new directors, Ben Harrison and Manny Gould, took over the series. By late 1927, they were solely in charge.

Winkler's husband, [[Charles B. Mintz]], slowly began assuming control of the operation. Mintz and his studio began producing the cartoons in sound beginning with 1929's ''[[Ratskin]]''. In 1930, he moved the staff to [[California]] and ultimately changed the design of Krazy Kat. The new character bore even less resemblance to the one in the newspapers. Mintz's Krazy Kat was, like many other early 1930s cartoon characters, imitative of [[Mickey Mouse]], and usually engaged in slapstick comic adventures with his look-alike girlfriend and loyal pet dog.&lt;ref&gt;Maltin 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, animator [[Isadore Klein]], with the blessing of Mintz, set to work creating the short, ''[[Lil' Ainjil]]'', the only Mintz work that was intended to reflect Herriman's comic strip. However, Klein was "terribly disappointed" with the resulting cartoon, and the Mickey-derivative Krazy returned.&lt;ref&gt;Maltin 210–11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1939, Mintz became indebted to his distributor, [[Columbia Pictures]], and subsequently sold his studio to them.&lt;ref&gt;Maltin 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the name [[Screen Gems]], the studio produced only one more Krazy Kat cartoon, ''[[The Mouse Exterminator]]'' in 1940.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;[http://columbia.goldenagecartoons.com/history/screen/  Screen Gems] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807202522/http://columbia.goldenagecartoons.com/history/screen/ |date=August 7, 2009 }}, The Columbia Crow's Nest — Columbia Cartoon History.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Features produced 50 ''Krazy Kat'' cartoons from 1962–1964, most of which were created at [[Gene Deitch]]'s [[Rembrandt Films]] in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now the Czech Republic), whilst the rest were produced by Artransa Film Studios in Sydney, Australia.  The cartoons were initially televised interspersed with ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' (some of which were also produced by Artransa) and ''[[Snuffy Smith]]'' cartoons to form a half-hour TV show.  These cartoons helped to introduce Herriman's cat to the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom generation]]. The King Features shorts were made for television and have a closer connection to the comic strip; the backgrounds are drawn in a similar style, and Ignatz is present. This incarnation of Krazy was made female; Penny Phillips voiced Krazy while [[Paul Frees]] voiced Ignatz. The recurring character Officer Bull Pupp also has his own cartoon series. [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]] did the music for most of the [[List of Krazy Kat episodes|episodes]].&lt;ref name ="Crafton"/&gt;  Most of the episodes are available on DVD.

=== A "Kounterfeit Krazy" ===
In 1951, [[Dell Publishing]] revived the characters for a run of comic books. All five issues were drawn by cartoonist [[John Stanley (comics)|John Stanley]], best known for his ''[[Little Lulu]]'' comic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stanleystories.blogspot.com/2008/08/from-krazy-kat-4-1952-soups-on.html |title=from 'Krazy Kat' #4, 1952: soup's on! |first= Frank M.|last=Young |work=Stanley Stories|date=August 9, 2008|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the general plot premise is reminiscent of Herriman's strip, the look and feel are entirely different: firmly in the visual and written style of 1950s "funny animal" strips for children. Krazy is male in this version of the strip while Ignatz is female. This "Krazy Kat" also made several one-shot appearances in Dell's ''[[Four Color Comics]]'' series, from 1953 through 1956 (#454, 504, 548, 619, 696,)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell Four Color Comics |url=http://www.dellfourcolorcomics.com/Comics/DellFourColor/DellFour-ColorSeries2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721005015/http://www.dellfourcolorcomics.com/Comics/DellFourColor/DellFour-ColorSeries2/ |archivedate=July 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reprinted in some [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]] and Page Comics over the next decade.

== Chronology of formats ==
The strip went through several format changes during its run, each of which impacted the artwork and the narratives that the form of the strip could accommodate.  What follows are the landmarks, which can also help to date the era of a given strip.

* '''July 26, 1910:''' First "beaning" of Kat by Mouse at bottom of ''[[The Dingbat Family]]''. Strip is not sectioned off, but a detail at the bottom of the panels. Strip as a whole tended to run 4&amp;nbsp;inches × 13&amp;nbsp;inches.  Soon the Kat and Mouse were a five-panel 1½ inch strip at the bottom of the cartoon.&lt;ref name="MOD 55"&gt;McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1911:'''  First brief run of ''Krazy and I. Mouse'' standalone strips (probably as a replacement to ''The Family Upstairs'').  Also, the characters briefly take over the strip for a couple of periods in '''1912''' (at least once, while the Dingbats are "on holiday" in '''July 1912'''.)
* '''October 28, 1913.'''  ''Krazy Kat'' debuts as a five-panel daily vertical strip which runs down the side of a full comics page. This remains its daily format until sometime in 1920.&lt;ref name="MOD 57"&gt;McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''April 23, 1916:'''  First black and white full page Sunday strip.
* '''March 4&amp;nbsp;– October 30, 1920:'''  The "Panoramic Dailies" period, where Herriman is allowed to experiment wildly in an unbroken daily horizontal 3 × 13&amp;nbsp;inch space.
* '''November 1920 on:'''  Herriman is constrained to a more conventional daily horizontal format containing three equal split sections, with the center section further split in two.  This allows the strip to be run full page, half page or a third of a page, according to editorial whim.  From September 13 to October 15, 1921, Herriman regains some control (no split center section) and resumes the previous years' format experiments.
* '''January 7&amp;nbsp;– March 11, 1922:''' In the ''New York Journal'', 10 weeks of Saturday full-page color strips, in addition to the ongoing Sunday full page black-and-white strips. (In other words, two original full-page strips every week).  This is then canceled due to its lack of noticeable commercial success, compared to the new Saturday color sections in out-of-town Hearst papers which contained no ''Krazy Kat.''&lt;ref&gt;''A Katnip Kantata in the Key of K'', 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''August 1925 to September 1929:''' Sundays are confined to 3-row, split-middle-line format allowing some papers to reduce cartoon's size and reformat into two daily-sized rows.&lt;ref name="MOD 77"&gt;McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Summer 1934:''' Full page Sunday strips cease entirely, for roughly a year.
* '''June 1, 1935:'''  Full page Sunday strips resume, now in color, until Herriman's death.
* '''December 11, 1938:''' "Optional" horizontal panel begins running on bottom of Sunday strips, as placeholder for potential advertising.
* '''June 25, 1944:''' Final Sunday strip published.

For many decades, only a small percentage of Herriman's strip was available in reprinted form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The first ''Krazy Kat'' collection, published by [[Henry Holt and Company]] in 1946, just two years after Herriman's death, gathered 200 selected strips.&lt;ref&gt;Tashlin.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Europe, the cartoons were first reprinted in 1965 by the Italian magazine ''Linus'', and appeared in the pages of the French monthly ''Charlie Mensuel'' starting in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Exhibit catalog from the ''Musée de la bande dessinée'' in [[Angoulême]], 1997, cited in ''BDM 2005–2006'', by Bera, Denni and Mellot.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] produced a single hardcover collection of selected episodes and sequences spanning the entire length of the strip's run.  The Netherlands' Real Free Press published five issues of ''Krazy Kat Komix'' in 1974–1976, containing a few hundred strips apiece; each of the issues' covers was designed by [[Joost Swarte]].  However, owing to the difficulty of tracking down high-quality copies of the original newspapers, no plans for a comprehensive collection of ''Krazy Kat'' strips surfaced until the 1980s.

All of the [[Sunday strip]]s from 1916 to 1924 were reprinted by [[Eclipse Comics]] in cooperation with Turtle Island Press. The intent was to eventually reprint every Sunday ''Krazy Kat'', but this planned series was aborted when Eclipse ceased business in 1992. Beginning in 2002, [[Fantagraphics]] resumed reprinting Sunday ''Krazy Kat''s where Eclipse left off; in 2008, their tenth release completed the run with 1944. Fantagraphics then reissued, in the same format, the strips previously printed in Eclipse's now out-of-print volumes.&lt;ref&gt;''There is a Heppy Lend, Fur, Fur Awa-a-ay-'', 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Eclipse and Fantagraphics reprints include additional rarities such as older George Herriman cartoons predating ''Krazy Kat''.

[[Kitchen Sink Press]], in association with Remco Worldservice Books, reprinted two volumes of color Sunday strips dating from 1935 to 1937; but like Eclipse, they collapsed before they could continue the series.&lt;ref name="Bibliography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://krazy.com/biblio.htm |title=Bibliography |last1=Campbell |first1=Peter |website=Coconino County |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090912084757/http://krazy.com/biblio.htm |archive-date=2009-09-12 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Issue number five of ''The 3-D Zone'' comic book series, published by The 3-D Zone in June 1987, features reprints of ''Krazy Kat'' strips converted into 3-D, and also includes two pairs of red/blue 3-D glasses.

The [[daily strip]]s for 1921 to 1923 were reprinted by Pacific Comics Club.  The 1922 and 1923 books skipped a small number of strips, which have now been reprinted by ''[[Comics Revue]]''. ''[[Comics Revue]]'' has also published all of the daily strips from September 8, 1930 through December 31, 1934. Fantagraphics come out with a one-shot reprint of daily strips from 1910s and 1920s in 2007, and plans a more complete reprinting of the daily strip in the future.

Scattered Sundays and dailies have appeared in several collections, including the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] book reprinted by [[Woody Gelman|Nostalgia Press]], but the most readily available sampling of Sundays and dailies from throughout the strip's run is ''Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman'', published by [[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Bibliography"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignatzmouse.net/us/mouse-biblio.html The Mouse Bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a detailed biography of Herriman and was, for a long time, the only in-print book to republish ''Krazy Kat'' strips from after 1940. Although it contains over 200 strips, including many color Sundays, it is light on material from 1923 to 1937. A small selection of dailies appears in a 2018 literary anthology published by [[The Green Bag]].&lt;ref&gt;Re-readings, Volume III (edited by Ross E. Davies) (Green Bag Press 2018), pages 87-95 and coda.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Monday Magazine''''' is a free arts and entertainment magazine in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Contrary to what the name suggests, ''Monday'' was distributed throughout the greater Victoria area every Thursday until July 2013 when it became an arts calendar monthly. The publication features articles on art, food and entertainment in Victoria but is most widely used as an event listing. 

''Monday'' was founded in 1975 by Gene Miller, a native New Yorker who arrived in Victoria in 1970, five years before founding Monday. Miller aspired to create a publication for the Victoria readership that was rooted in the social consciousness of the  [[Village Voice]] but written in the style of [[The New Yorker]].&lt;ref name="rrj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rrj.ca/issue/1994/spring/181/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129010007/http://www.rrj.ca/issue/1994/spring/181/ |archivedate=2006-11-29 |df= }} Ryerson Review of Journalism - Spring 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after establishing the paper, Miller was joined by [[Andrew Burchill Lynch|Andrew Lynch]] and George Heffelfinger and the three divided ownership equally. In 1988, Miller—disheartened with his creation—sold his one-third interest to Lynch and Heffelfinger.&lt;ref name="rrj"/&gt; Andrew Lynch continued in his role as publisher of ''Monday'' until it was taken over by David Black's Island Publishers Ltd. in 1996. It is currently published by [[Black Press Group Ltd.]]

Until May 1, 2013, ''Monday Magazine'' earned its reputation as a critical voice in Victoria's political, social and cultural communities. It is no longer a member of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies. The paper targets educated, active adults and currently reaches approximately 38,445 households.

''Monday'' routinely received awards for investigative features on the environment, social and political justice, arts, culture and the outdoors. In 2011 and 2012, its staff earned 20 newspaper awards through the BCYCNA, CCNA and AAN organizations. ''Monday Magazine'' historically tended to the left of the political spectrum and was often critical of centre and right wing politicians and policies at the city and provincial levels.

The '''Musée Mécanique''' (''English'': Mechanical Museum) is a [[for-profit]] interactive museum consisting of 20th-century [[penny arcade (venue)|penny arcade]] games and artifacts located at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The museum owns over 300 mechanical machines, and is one of the largest privately owned collection of such games in the world.&lt;ref name="Atlas1"/&gt;

==History==
Owner Ed Zelinsky began collecting at age 11 and his games were exhibited in the 1920s at [[Playland (San Francisco)|Playland]]. In 1972 Playland closed and Musée Mécanique became a part of the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]].&lt;ref name="Atlas1"/&gt; The museum moved into the [[basement]] of [[Cliff House, San Francisco|Cliff House]], just a few blocks north and across the [[Great Highway]] from the Playland site. Zelinsky's son, Dan Zelinsky, took a temporary job in the 1970s maintaining the collection.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; The museum was featured in the 2001 film ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]''&lt;ref name="SFGate2"&gt;{{cite news | title=Old and in the way / The Musee Mecanique will soon be history | work=Ferris Wheel | publisher=[[SF Gate]] | url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-02-27/news/17532160_1_cliff-house-machines-san-francisco-s-musee-mecanique | accessdate=24 September 2011 | first=Carl | last=Nolte | date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 2011 episode of the Japanese television show [[GameCenter CX]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Move to Fisherman's Wharf===
In 2002, when renovations to the Cliff House had begun, the [[National Park Service]] announced plans to relocate the Musée Mécanique temporarily to Fisherman's Wharf. A portion of the $14 million renovation was devoted to moving the museum, with support from the National Park Service, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and museum owner Ed Zelinsky.&lt;ref name="Preservation1"/&gt; 

The museum move instigated protests against the move by San Francisco locals. An [[online petition]] was created to protest the closure of the museum, with over 12,000 signatures being collected. Many of the protesters believed that the money was unavailable to fund the move and renovations, but many were emotional due to the historical and [[nostalgic]] meaning of the museum due to its history at Playland. Many of the protesters were also unaware of the museum's for-profit status, and many attempted to donate to the museum to keep it at its current location. Despite public frustration, museum manager Dan Zelinsky remained excited about the move, understanding the historical and emotional connections that San Francisco locals held for the museum: "You have to understand that people grew up with these kind of machines&amp;nbsp;... To the generation before, these were the [[video games]]. Many visitors haven't been here since childhood, but when they walk through that door, they are going [[time travel|back in time]]."

'''Nautanki''' is one of the most popular folk operatic theater performance forms of South Asia, particularly in northern India. Before the advent of Bollywood (the Hindi film industry), Nautanki was the biggest entertainment medium in the villages and towns of northern India. Nautanki's rich musical compositions and humorous, entertaining storylines hold a strong influence over rural people's imagination. Even after the spread of mass media (such as television and DVDs), a crowd of 10,000 to 15,000 can be seen at the top Nautanki performances. Nautanki's origins lie in the Saangit, Bhagat, and Swang musical theatre traditions of Northern India. One Saangit called ''Saangit Rani Nautanki Ka'' became so popular that the whole genre's name became Nautanki.

==Performances==
Nautanki performances are operas based on a popular folk theme derived from romantic tales, mythologies, or biographies of local heroes. The performance is often punctuated with individual songs, dances, and skits, which serve as breaks and comic relief for audiences. Audiences sometimes use the breaks to go to the toilet or pick up food from their homes or nearby shops. Nautanki performances involve a lot of community participation from audiences. For instance, community members provide logistical support, financial support, and talented actors for Nautanki performances. Audience members choose what script will be performed and often intervene during the performance to demand a repeat of a particular song or skit.
[[File:DevendraSharma PunditSharma.png|thumb|Legendary Nautanki artist and [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] awardee Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma as Amar Singh Rathore and Dr. Devendra Sharma as Ram Singh in ''Amar Singh Rathore'']]
Nautanki performances can take place in any open space available in or around a village that can accommodate audiences in hundreds or thousands. Sometimes this space is made available by the village chaupal (village community center). Other times, the playground of the local school becomes the performance site. A Nautanki stage is elevated above the ground and is made up of wooden cots (usually provided by local villagers). Until a few decades back, there was no electricity in Indian villages, so light was provided either by big lanterns or Petromax (a device run by kerosene oil).

The pleasure of Nautanki lies in the intense melodic exchanges between two or three performers; a chorus is used sometimes. 

Traditional Nautankis usually start late at night, often around 10 p.m. or so, and go all night until sunrise the next morning (for a total of 8–10 hours). There is no intermission in Nautanki performances. 

==Story lines==
Story lines of traditional Nautankis range from mythological and folk tales to stories of contemporary heroes. For instance, while Nautanki plays such as ''Satya-Harishchandra'' and ''Bhakt Moradhwaj'' are based on mythological themes, ''Indal Haran'' and ''Puranmal'' originated from folklore. In the first half of the 20th century, contemporary sentiment against British rule and feudal landlords found expression in Nautankis such as ''Sultana Daku'', ''Jalianwala Bagh'', and ''Amar Singh Rathore''. In the last four decades, Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma (a renowned Nautanki maestro) and later Dr. Devendra Sharma have co-authored many new Nautankis. These new Nautankis are centered on contemporary social messages such as health, HIV/AIDS, women's empowerment, dowry, immigration, and family planning. They are of a much shorter duration — around two hours. This is to give audiences an opportunity to watch performances during a break in their daily routine. These contemporary Nautankis have been performed extensively in India and America and met with resounding popularity.

Some popular traditional Nautankis are ''Syah-Posh (Pak Mohabbat)'', ''Sultana Daku'', ''Indal Haran'', ''Amar Singh Rathore'', ''Bhakt Puranmal'', and ''Harischandra-Taramati''. Some popular contemporary ones are ''Mission Suhani'', ''Subah ka Bhoola'', ''Behkaani and Muskaani'', and ''Beti ka Byah'' (all of these contemporary Nautankis are written by Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma).

==Performers==
Some famous performers are Gokul Korea, Ghasso, Ram Swarup Sharma of Samai-Khera, Manohar Lal Sharma 
and Giriraj Prasad of Kaman District Bharatpur, Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma, Chunni Lal, Puran Lal Sharma, Amarnath, Gulab Bai, and Krishna Kumari.

== Overseas ==
In 2002, Nautanki was introduced in America by Dr. Devendra Sharma, a Nautanki artist, singer, writer, director, and scholar of communication and performance. The participants in Sharma's productions are engineers, doctors, and other members of the Indian diaspora living in America, who are given a rare opportunity to connect with their cultural roots. At the same time, these performances have exposed other communities in America to Indian culture. 

One such Nautanki is ''Mission Suhani'', an original Nautanki co-authored by Sharma and Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma that communicates a contemporary and controversial social issue concerning Indians and Indian immigrants in America. It critically examines the phenomenon of some Indian men who come to America to study or work, but go back to India and get married — either because of parental pressure or to get a big dowry (cash given to the groom's family by the bride's side). Many of these men leave their wives in India and never bring them to America, where they often have another wife or a girlfriend. One of the unique aspects of this Nautanki is that it is bilingual (Hindi and English). This protects the traditional operatic and artistic elements of Nautanki while effectively communicating the story and contemporary social issue to a diverse audience. Nautankis such as ''Mission Suhani'' involving global social issues help to update Nautanki to emerging issues in India and around the world.

The '''''Newsweek'' gay actor controversy''' refers to the reaction to a piece written in 2010 by ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine writer Ramin Setoodeh in which he asserts that openly [[gay]] actors are not capable of convincingly playing straight characters. Setoodeh's article provoked strong reactions from both within and outside the entertainment industry.

==Straight Jacket==
In a ''Newsweek'' article titled "Straight Jacket" dated April 26, 2010, journalist Ramin Setoodeh reviewed the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'' starring [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] as the male lead. Hayes had recently [[Coming out|come out]] as gay in an interview with the [[LGBT]]-interest ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.advocate.com/Arts_and_Entertainment/People/Sean_Hayes_I_Am_Who_I_Am/
  | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setoodeh found Hayes's performance "wooden and insincere, like he's trying to hide something, which of course he is". Setoodeh also challenged the acting ability of openly gay actor [[Jonathan Groff]], who had recently joined the cast of ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. While recognizing Groff as "a knockout singer and a heartthrob" for his Broadway performance in ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'', Setoodeh found that Groff's television performance was "off" and distracting. From these two performances, along with how Setoodeh's perceptions of the performances of actors [[Rock Hudson]], [[Tab Hunter]], [[Van Johnson]] and [[Anthony Perkins]]—closeted or semi-closeted during their careers but now known to have been gay—changed with his knowledge of the actors' homosexuality, Setoodeh concluded that once the public learns that an actor is gay, the actor can no longer convincingly play straight characters. Setoodeh acknowledged the ability of actors [[Neil Patrick Harris]] and [[Portia de Rossi]] to play straight characters on television (on ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' and ''[[Better Off Ted]]'' respectively) but dismissed them with the claim that they are playing caricatures, not characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Setoodeh|first1=Ramin|title=Straight Jacket| date = April 26, 2010|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/236999|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=19 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430084711/http://www.newsweek.com/id/236999|archivedate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backlash==
The day after the ''Newsweek'' article appeared online, LGBT media website [[AfterElton.com]] denounced Setoodeh and his conclusions. Editor Michael Jensen noted previous articles by Setoodeh in which he claimed that effeminate characters on television were harmful to the gay movement and seemed to suggest that openly gay teenage murder victim [[E.O. Green School shooting|Lawrence King]] was partially to blame for his own murder because of his effeminate self-expression. He pondered whether Setoodeh's opinion on openly gay actors was rooted in some issue of Setoodeh's own with effeminate men. Jensen questioned what Setoodeh, himself openly gay, hoped to accomplish with the article and asserted that by writing it, Setoodeh was only making it harder for gay actors to make the decision to come out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Actress [[Kristin Chenoweth]], Hayes's co-star in ''Promises, Promises'', rose to Hayes's defense. Posting to Newsweek.com, Chenoweth noted that Hayes was nominated for [[Drama League Award|Drama League]], [[Outer Critics Circle Award|Outer Critics Circle]] and [[Tony Award]]s and that "thousands of people have traveled from all over the world to enjoy Hayes’ performance and don’t seem to have one single issue with his sexuality". She accused Setoodeh of engaging in [[selection bias]] through his choices of actors upon whom he focused the article and found the entire piece "horrendously homophobic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"I hope observing this process firsthand — and talking with our cast — will be illuminating to Mr. Setoodeh, and inform his future journalistic endeavors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Jarrett Barrios]], president of the LGBT media watchdog organization [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) joined with openly gay [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning screenwriter [[Dustin Lance Black]] to take Setoodeh to task, writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"The whole posse of off-kilter anecdotes in "Straight Jacket" seem only to confirm one thing: America is starting to embrace open gay and lesbian actors in heterosexual roles on stage and screen and Setoodeh himself is not yet ready to. In one example, Setoodeh goes out of his way to call Sean Hayes "queeny" and assert it as a disqualifier for his straight role in "Promises, Promises." It's when the author peddles tired stereotypes like a {{sic}} "queeny" that the piece leans away from reality and tilts toward openly gay Setoodeh's own issues with sexuality and femininity. The truth is, the glass ceiling Setoodeh posits has been constructed by his own arguments -- ones that ignore fact after fact about the direction Hollywood is headed in 2010. Maybe Setoodeh can't see 'Glee' and 'Promises, Promises' except through a lens of dark stereotypes he's inherited. Maybe he's got some axe to grind. But whatever the reason, with the stakes so high for gay Americans at this moment, it is no excuse for his editors inflicting such hurtful — and baseless — musings on the readers of ''Newsweek''. We'd all have been better off leaving Setoodeh's tortured thoughts on his therapist's couch and leaving baseless stories like this one on the editor's desk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barrios |first=Jarrett |author2=Dustin Lance Black |title='Milk' scribe joins GLAAD against Newsweek |publisher=''The Hollywood Reporter'' |date=May 12, 2010 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iec86729e87e7d194b2681ba2b0cfa4b6 |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517041119/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iec86729e87e7d194b2681ba2b0cfa4b6 |archivedate=May 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; GLAAD further called upon ''Newsweek'' and Setoodeh to issue an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Several openly gay actors, including [[Cheyenne Jackson]], [[Michael Urie]], [[Jane Lynch]] and [[Cynthia Nixon]] strongly criticized Setoodeh's article.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Three months after the article appeared, Groff spoke to British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' about it. Comparing the article to a bad review based on an actor's not using an appropriate accent for a role, Groff said "You just have to take it like any good or bad review, and try to let it roll off your back. I've played all kinds of characters, with all kinds of sexuality, and I hope to go on doing that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Setoodeh's response==
On May 10, 2010, Ramin Setoodeh wrote a piece responding to the controversy. Titling it "Out of Focus", Setoodeh asserted that his intention "was not to disparage my own community, but to examine an issue that is being swept under the rug", the issue supposedly being that society as a whole has trouble accepting openly gay actors in straight roles, and that he wanted to start a debate on the subject. He characterized much of the criticism directed at him as "attacks" and said that his opponents were twisting his words. He denied assertions that he is self-loathing or homophobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Setoodeh's response prompted AfterElton.com editor Jensen to accuse Setoodeh of "play[ing] the victim card" and failing to address any of the criticisms that were leveled at the article. "If his goal was to start a 'debate,' and he says it was, it's telling how uninterested he seems to be in actually having that debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==''Newsweek''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s response==
''Newsweek'' culture editor [[Marc Peyser]] sat down with Dustin Lance Black and Jarrett Barrios to discuss the fallout from Setoodeh's article and the broader issues of being openly gay in Hollywood. Barrios and Black continued to point out what they viewed as attacks on the ability and talent of gay actors and discussed whether an actor at the top of his or her profession could maintain a career after coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Defending Setoodeh==
Screenwriter and producer [[Aaron Sorkin]] wrote a piece for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' in which he asserted that people being critical of Setoodeh were missing the point. Assuring readers that Setoodeh is "on the side of the good guys", Sorkin wrote, "The problem doesn't have anything to do with sexual preference. The problem has everything to do with the fact that we know too much about each other and we care too much about what we know. In one short decade we have been reconditioned to be entertained by the most private areas of other people's lives." Rather than directing ire at Setoodeh or boycotting ''Newsweek'', celebrities should "[b]oycott the red carpet instead. You're going to win the Emmy, Ryan, and you're going to get the whole publicity bump that comes with it. You and your cast should proudly walk past every microphone that's shoved in your faces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Andrew Wallenstein wrote that he could not understand what Setoodeh supposedly did wrong. Asserting that "sexual orientation can distort a performance, and in more ways than one", Wallenstein continues, "there is always the possibility that even the most brilliant closeted actor in the most incredibly scripted heterosexual role could fall short, especially in a romantic lead role". Gay actors, he wrote, should be considered for straight leading roles but they may not be successful in playing them, and it is possible that Setoodeh merely identified two who cannot. Regardless of whether that is true or not, people should not "vilify those who dare to speak their mind even when being unkind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Produced by [[DIC Entertainment]], the made-for-TV films are either based on various DIC productions such as ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'', ''[[Sabrina: The Animated Series]]'', and ''[[Dennis the Menace (1986 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', or are loose adaptations of stories from classic literature such as ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''. One film, ''[[Groove Squad]]'', which was about a group of crimefighting cheerleaders, was an original story. All of these films were later released to [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in the U.S. by [[MGM Home Entertainment]] under the ''DIC Movie Toons'' label. In 2008, [[Gaiam]] re-released the films on DVD.

'''OneWebDay''' is an annual day of Internet celebration and awareness held on September 22. The stated goal of founder [[Susan P. Crawford]] is for OneWebDay to foster and make visible a global constituency that cares about the future of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T17w9LKPuzQ|title=Rocketboom Interview: Susan Crawford of OneWebDay.org|date= August 20, 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first OneWebDay was held on September 22, 2006. The idea was created by [[Susan P. Crawford]], who was an [[ICANN]] board member at the time, in association with other Internet figures such as [[Doc Searls]], [[David Weinberger]], [[David R. Johnson]], [[Mary Hodder (author)|Mary Hodder]], and [[David Isenberg]], who would all join the board of what would eventually become a [[501(c)3]] corporation – OneWebDay Inc. A website was established and a global network of events promoted. The 2006 OneWebDay's anchor celebration featured speakers [[Craig Newmark]], [[Scott Heiferman]], and [[Drew Schutte]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Battery Park]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

By 2008 OneWebDay had grown to more than 30 international events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.onewebday.org/wiki/ OneWebDayWiki – OneWebDayWiki]. Archive.onewebday.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Washington Square Park]], New York City, speakers included Crawford, [[John Perry Barlow]], [[Jonathan Zittrain]], [[Craig Newmark]], and [[Lawrence Lessig]].&lt;ref name=nyc2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://punkcast.com/1431/index.html |title= One Web Day – NYC 2008 – Washington Sq. Park – Sep 22 2008: |accessdate=2009-04-12 |last=MacFie |first=Joly |date=2009-01-21 |work=webcast |publisher=[[punkcast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, after founder Crawford had joined the [[Obama administration]], [[Mitch Kapor]] took over chairmanship of OneWebDay.  It was also announced that funding had been granted by the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onewebday.org/?p=668 |title=New Leadership for OneWebDay |accessdate=2009-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[ning (website)|ning]]-based organizing network was set up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090826061400/http://owdtest.ning.com/ my.onewebday.org] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, it was announced that OneWebDay would "retire its brand" and be folded into a new [[Mozilla Foundation]] year-round initiative called Drumbeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onewebday.org/wp2009/2010/04/06/onewebday-joins-forces-with-mozilla-drumbeat-%E2%80%93-364-extra-days-to-build-an-open-web/ |title=OneWebDay Joins Forces with Mozilla Drumbeat – 364 Extra Days to Build an Open Web! |accessdate=2010-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, a number of veterans{{clarify|date=September 2013|reason=military veterans or veterans of the OneWebDay movement?}} took over organizing the 2010 event on a volunteer basis. A new website and network was established. Events took place in several cities including New York City, [[Melbourne]], [[Calcutta|Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[London]], and [[Pachuca]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In 2011, the main event was a presentation in New York City by [[Bob Frankston]] – "Infrastructure commons – the future of connectivity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://isoc-ny.org/p2/?p=2462 ISOC-NY #OneWebDay event: Bob Frankston – “Infrastructure commons – the future of connectivity” #broadband | ISOC-NY NOTICE BOARD]. Isoc-ny.org (2011-09-23). Retrieved on 2013-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the theme of OneWebDay was advancing local content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120908085131/http://onewebday.org/ OneWebDay.org] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the theme was [[accessibility]], particularly in remembrance of web-accessibility advocate [[Cynthia Waddell]], who died in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://onewebday.org/onewebday-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the OneWebDay theme was ''Recognizing Core Internet Values'', and promoted the viewing of three videos: a [[TEDx]] talk by [[Dave Moskowitz]], "The Internet Belongs to Everyone" from the [[United States Department of State|United States State Department]], and the Dynamic Coalition on Core Internet Values at the 2014 [[Internet Governance Forum]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In 2015 the theme is ''Connecting the Next Billion'', aligned with the current IGF Intersessional Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/policy-options-for-connection-the-next-billion|title=Connecting the Next Billion|author=Carl Gahnberg|work=intgovforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotes the viewing of a speech by [[Catherine Novelli]] – 'Connecting The World' at the USA-IGF in July 2015.

In 2016 the theme was again ''Connecting the Next Billion'', this time highlighting a speech by United States Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment [[Catherine A. Novelli]].

In 2017 the theme was ''Open The Pipes'', about the need for connectivity for Community Networks, and highlights a speech by [[Internet Society]] CEO/President Kathy Brown at [[Mobile World Congress]] in Shanghai.

In 2018 the theme is, in co-ordination with the [[Global People's Summit]], "Reimagine Humanity: Changing the Status Quo" and promotes participation in a global conversation about ways of achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

'''Pig shows''' are an event  where [[pigs]] are evaluated for their quality. They are evaluated on a multitude of things which include composition (muscle vs. fat), capaciousness, and skeletal integrity along with general appearance and conformation to their respective breed. Other names for a pig show include '''swine show''' and '''hog show'''. A pig show is frequently part of a larger [[agricultural show]].

==History==
Pig shows began on farms where the owner and other pig farmers would gather to decide which pig had the best qualities for [[Selective breeding|breeding]]. These would not be named pig shows, but ultimately they were making a decision on which animals to retain to breed. Eventually, breeders would meet at a specified location and bring an outside person to evaluate their pigs, and to order them in a ranking. These were the first shows.  

A show is typically divided up into classes so that the judge can study fewer pigs at a time. Typically these classes are broken down to the breed of pig, weight, or age. There are division or breed champions and reserve champions. Then ultimately, an over-all grand champion will be chosen.
&lt;ref&gt;Wendt, K.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swine judging==
Swine judging is the process of selectively ordering swine or [[domestic pig]]s in order to determine the best pig. For market hogs, traits are ranked in order of their importance: Degree of muscling, growth, capacity or volume, degree of leanness, structure and soundness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.ca.uky.edu/agripedia/agmania/livestock/Hogs/hogmark.asp
 |title       = Ranking of Traits for Market Hogs
 |publisher   = University of Kentucky, College of Agriculture
 |accessdate  = 2011-08-19

 |archivedate = 2012-03-24
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For breeding gilts, the traits by order of importance are: Structure and soundness, Growth, Underline quality, Capacity or volume, Degree of muscling, Degree of leanness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.ca.uky.edu/agripedia/agmania/livestock/Hogs/hogmate.asp
 |title       = Ranking of Traits for Maternal Line Breeding Gilts
 |publisher   = University of Kentucky, College of Agriculture

 |archivedate = 2012-03-24
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge will have different priorities and rank importance of certain traits differently than other judges. Judges are selected because they are typically influential breeders within the show pig industry.

=== Pig shows in People's Republic of China ===
In [[People's Republic of China|China]], the first pig show was the Guangdong Breeding Pigs Auction which began January 18, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | script-title=zh:拍卖与养猪生产发展的融合——第7届湖北种猪拍卖展销暨学术交流会 | date= | publisher=中国种猪信息网 | url =http://www.teacup-pigs.info/chinese-pig-auction.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-19 | language = zh }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pig shows in china are pig-breeding auctions. More than 10 provinces have in the past hosted these pig-breeding auctions, but only two provinces ([[Guangdong Province]] and [[Hubei Province]]) still host it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | script-title=zh:广东省种猪拍卖会举行 长白种猪2万元夺魁 | date= | publisher=广东农业信息网 | url =http://www.agri.gov.cn/dfxxlb/gdxxlb/t20071220_940931.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-09-02 | language = zh }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raindance''' are British [[rave]] event organisers. They were one of the best known rave names on the Rave scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The first event was held at a circus tent on 16 September 1989 at Jenkins Lane, [[Beckton]] in east [[London]]. This was Britain's first legal all night rave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muckfm.com/raindance_303 Raindance rave festivals - Muck FM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raveflyers.co.uk/gallery/images_temp/raindance_undercover_16sep89.jpg Flyer for the very first Raindance event]&lt;/ref&gt;

DJ's such as [[Carl Cox]], [[Dave Angel]], [[LTJ Bukem]], [[Mr C]], [[DJ Rap]], [[John Digweed]], [[Kevin Saunderson|Kevin "Reece" Saunderson]], [[Slipmatt]], [[Fabio (DJ)|Fabio]] and [[Grooverider]] started out at Raindance. Live acts such as Shades of Rhythm, [[N-Joi]] and [[The Prodigy]] have all played at Raindance.
[[File:Raindance MA2.jpg|thumb|right|MA-2 bomber jacket with the Raindance logo]]
From 1989 to 1993, Raindance went on to hold large-scale events across [[Essex]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Leicestershire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://scrapbook.sean.at/?p=12 Raindance@ 7am Melton (Mowbray) Airfield] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070810022012/http://scrapbook.sean.at/?p=12 |date=2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxfordshire]], [[Somerset]] and even Spain. The venues Raindance used held up to 10,000 ravers. DJ Slipmatt's brother, Paul Nelson, was one of the original promoters. The original idea to hold a rave came from Slipmatt himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kineticpromotions.org/bin/content/dj_slipmatt.html Kinetic Promotions - DJ Slipmatt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518120403/http://www.kineticpromotions.org/bin/content/dj_slipmatt.html |date=2011-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But by 1993 with pressure from the authorities ([[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]) and the rave music scene splintering into different dance genres, Raindance took a break from holding mass events. Between 1993 and 1998 there were one-off events, then the promoters returned hosting regular indoor events in clubs around North and East London.

In 1999 Raindance started hosting raves at The Drome, an unused car park underneath [[London Bridge railway station]]. They would get regular attendances of over 2,000 people at this  venue. In 2002, The Drome was renovated and [[SEOne|seOne]] was born. Over the next 8 years SeOne would be Raindance's home and with a 3,000 capacity with 7 different arenas (Jenkins Lane 89-90, Old Skool 91-93, Jungle/Drum &amp; Bass 93-10, Hardcore 95-10, Hard House, Breakbeat, House &amp; Trance). Raindance continues to put parties on all over the UK.

==History==
===Company formation===
====Parent company and founders====
SmartStudy was founded in June, 2010,&lt;ref name="founded"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shin|first=Myung-jin|title=

Kim, who was around thirty-years-old at the time, was a publisher and the oldest son at his family's business, Samsung Publishing Company Ltd., SmartSudy's [[parent company]], with his father, CEO Kim Jin-yong, and his grandfather, the company's founder, Kim Bong-kyu.&lt;ref name="publisher"&gt;{{cite web|title=김민석 삼성출판사 N그룹장 "인기 앱이 종이책 매출 늘려.. 전자책-종이책 윈윈 가능해"|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/%EA%B9%80%EB%AF%BC%EC%84%9D-%EC%82%BC%EC%84%B1%EC%B6%9C%ED%8C%90%EC%82%AC-n%EA%B7%B8%EB%A3%B9%EC%9E%A5-%EC%9D%B8%EA%B8%B0-%EC%95%B1%EC%9D%B4-%EC%A2%85%EC%9D%B4%EC%B1%85-%EB%A7%A4%EC%B6%9C-%EB%8A%98%EB%A0%A4-090016259.html|date=March 7, 2012|work=[[Yahoo!

After graduation, he was a developer and project manager at [[Hangame]]&lt;ref name="publisher"/&gt; and also, worked at [[NHN Entertainment Corporation|NHN]].&lt;ref name="start"/&gt;

With Samsung Publishing as it's first investor, the media [[startup company]]&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramirez|first=Elaine|title=How This 'Baby Shark' Video Went Insanely Viral In Indonesia|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elaineramirez/2017/09/01/smartstudy-pinkfong-baby-shark-video-indonesia/#1de845873e19|date=September 1, 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; SmartStudy was formed by Kim, his close friend Park, who also worked at NHN, and Lee, who he met at Nexon. Lee had begun his career as an [[online community]] developer at Freechal.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt;

====Startup develops a strategy====
While brainstorming ideas for the company, the thought of making video games was quickly dropped, because, as Lee said, “At that point, we were all tired of making games". The final choices were education and medicine, but as they had no expertise in medicine, they focused on education. With more ideas from Samsung Publishing, they decided to focus on the children's education market by making and uploading four music videos for Samsung Publishing's children's songs on their apps. The international response was good. “It was then that we realized that instead of making what we want, we should create content based on what the market wants,” Lee said.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt;

Discussing what market they would focus on, Kim said reaching out to  global customers was more viable, as potential customers were limited in South Korea, where the birthrate per year was around 400,000.&lt;ref name="teaching"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Young-joo|title=통통 튀는 핑크퐁, 뽀로로가 샘내겠네요|url=https://news.joins.com/article/21565204|date=May 12, 2017|work=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|language=Korean|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further planned to target [[pre-kindergarten]] or 2-year-old to [[kindergarten]], looking to open offices in China and the U.S. to make local content geared for each of those markets. According to Lee, the U.S. users favored "interactive, actionable content such as writing letters on the tablet or taking pictures with the character", while Asian users preferred "one-way streaming video content".&lt;ref name="Iot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yoo|first=Eva|title=SmartStudy: Kindergarten Education On IoT|url=https://technode.com/2015/07/01/smartstudy-kindergarten-education-iot/|date=July 1, 2015|work=TechNode|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on results in South Korea and China, they focused on creating content in English and Spanish for the U.S. market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Ji-yeon|title=Local IT startups attracts millions of investment from Chinese capital|url=https://www.arirang.com/News/News_Print.asp?type=news&amp;nseq=191693|date=May 27, 2016|work=[[ArirangTV]]|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started producing videos with its characters in several languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish and Russian; and operating its own mobile app providing content directly to viewers.&lt;ref name="IPO"/&gt; Many of the creators at the company were from children's book publishing and many of the apps were based on [[chant]] melodies to attract children's attention.&lt;ref name="china"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yoo|first=Eva|title=South Korea’s First-Gen Unicorn Game Developers Are Now Gamifying Education|url=https://technode.com/2016/02/24/korean-game-developer-parents-are-gamifying-child-education/|date=February 24, 2016|work=TechNode|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also added [[Video on demand|mobile VOD]], comics, and finally, games.&lt;ref name="company ltd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of SMARTSTUDY Co., Ltd|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=245212275|date=November 27, 2018|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the company grew, they continued their debate on games and entertainment versus education. "Education combined with entertainment, [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]], is hard to achieve. If it’s too much focused on games, it has less educational value, and if it’s too much focused on education, it will need sugar-coating with game features", Lee said.&lt;ref name="Iot"/&gt; Consequently, they returned to their forte in September, 2016, when they released a mobile game called “Monster Super League”.&lt;ref name="IPO"/&gt; Kim said he understood the importance of child education, but thought about the expertise of team members who were prior game developers at Nexon or [[NCSoft]], and who were also fathers.&lt;ref name="china"/&gt;

They realized their market with international growth through [[Google]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[app store]]s and expanded to [[IPTV]] in late 2013. They felt their willingness to understand subtle cultural differences instead of just enhancing language aspects benefited them. An example they provided was utilizing country differences in the sounds a police car siren makes, to localize their products for children. In particular, for Chinese marketing, they created new work using old [[Chinese folklore|Chinese fables]] and texts that Chinese children would know from kindergarten, and uploading on native platforms like [[Youku]], [[iQiyi]] and [[Tencent Video]] in China, where [[YouTube]] is banned.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt;

====Work atmosphere and locations====
Journalist Kwon Oh-seong of [[The Hankyoreh]] visited the company for interviews in April, 2015 and described a unique organizational culture that emphasized autonomous work. His visit coincided with a customary monthly birthday rooftop celebration, presently the one for 34-year-old CEO Kim. The employees, with an average age of thirty, called each other by nicknames like "Radio", and "Patriarch" for Kim, and detailed a flexible work atmosphere, with periods of self-imposed hard work, along with [[chimaek]] breaks and unlimited vacation rewards. Kim said the structure is based on the teachings of his father, who allowed him freedom to grow and create on his own.&lt;ref name="hani"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kwon|first=Oh-seong|title=휴가 무제한인 회사…그래도 잘 나가요|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/686640.html|date=April 13, 2015|work=[[The Hankyoreh]]|language=Korean|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, the company had branches in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name="founded"/&gt; In 2017, CEO Bin Jeong, of Pinkfong's U.S. branch, which opened in 2016 with a couple of employees, said SmartStudy had about 150 employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pinkfong Q&amp;A|url=https://thesavvyscreener.com/2017/08/14/pinkfong-qa/|date=August 14, 2017|work=The Savvy Screeener|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writing about women in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] jobs, she said about 60 percent were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bin|first=Jeong|title=What Women Want: How to Encourage Female Talent to Pursue STEM Jobs|url=http://www.edtechroundup.org/editorials--press/guest-post-what-women-want-how-to-encourage-female-talent-to-pursue-stem-jobs|date=August 3, 2017|work=The Ed Tech Roundup|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success with Pinkfong and "Baby Shark"===
In August 2015, their big breakthrough occurred on YouTube with their popular character and [[brand]] Pinkfong, a [[magenta]]-colored animated fox,&lt;ref name="start"/&gt; which was used in a "[[Baby Shark#Pinkfong versions|Baby Shark]]" song and dance video. It was launched in late 2015, and started going viral on YouTube in 2016, becoming the company's most popular series with 800 million views by September 2018.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; By  2018, the company reported 150 million people in 112 countries had downloaded its app.&lt;ref name="IPO"/&gt;

==Finance and sales==
By 2014, the parent company, Samsung Publishing, was seeing an increased net profit from its new subsidiary SmartStudy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ko|first=Jong-min|title=[종목이슈] 삼성출판사, 계열사 이익 급증…매출 '사상 최대'|url=http://www.newspim.com/news/view/20150319000354|date=March 19, 2014|work=NewsPim|language=Korean|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017, Samsung Publishing sales were approximately $160 million.&lt;ref name="related"/&gt; In 2015, SmartStudy's sales were 9.5 billion won (about US$8.5 million). In 2016, SmartStudy's sales increased 80 percent, due to revenue from YouTube and apps sales, to 17.5 billion [[South Korean won|won]] (about US$15.5 million), with overseas sales accounting for 65 percent.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teaching"/&gt; In 2017, SmartStudy sales were 27.2 billion won (about US$24,127,000) with an operating profit of 1.9 billion won (about US$1,685,000).&lt;ref name="IPO"/&gt;

In September 2018, Samsung Publishing's stocks "soared" by more than 76 percent after Pinkfong's "Baby Shark" song charted on the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40]] at number 37.&lt;ref name="related"/&gt; In November 2018, industry sources were predicting that SmartStudy was preparing to go [[Initial public offering|public]] in 2020, with CEO Kim the biggest shareholder with 23.1 percent stake and Samsung Publishing which owns 20.8 percent.&lt;ref name="IPO"/&gt;

'''''Song of the South''''' is a 1946 American [[Live-action animated film|live-action/animated]] [[musical film]] produced by [[Walt Disney]] and released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]. It is based on the collection of [[Uncle Remus]] stories as adapted by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], and stars [[James Baskett]] as Uncle Remus. The film takes place in the [[southern United States]] during the [[Reconstruction Era]], a period of American history shortly after the end of the [[American Civil War]] and the abolition of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The story follows 7-year-old Johnny ([[Bobby Driscoll]]) who is visiting his grandmother's [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] for an extended stay. Johnny befriends Uncle Remus, one of the workers on the plantation, and takes joy in hearing his tales about the adventures of [[Br'er Rabbit]], [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|Br'er Fox, and Br'er Bear]]. Johnny learns from the stories how to cope with the challenges he is experiencing living on the plantation.

[[Walt Disney]] had wanted to produce a film based on the Uncle Remus stories for some time. It was not until 1939 that he began negotiating with the Harris family for film rights, and later in 1944, filming for ''Song of the South'' finally began. The studio constructed a plantation set for the outdoor scenes in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and some other scenes were filmed in [[Hollywood]]. The film is mostly live action, but includes three animated segments, which were later released as stand-alone television features. Some scenes also feature a combination of live action with animation. ''Song of the South'' premiered in Atlanta in November 1946 and the remainder of its initial theater run was a financial success. The song  "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" won the 1947 [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and Baskett received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] for his performance as Uncle Remus.

Since its release, ''Song of the South'' has remained a subject of controversy. Some critics have described the film's portrayal of [[African Americans]] as [[Racism in the United States|racist]] and offensive, pointing out the [[African-American Vernacular English|black vernacular]] and other qualities as stereotypes. In addition, the [[plantation]] setting is sometimes criticized as idyllic and glorified. Because of this controversy, Disney has yet to release ''Song of the South'' on any [[home video]] format in the United States. Some of the musical and animated sequences have been released through other means, and the full film has seen home video distribution in other countries around the world. The cartoon characters from the film have continued to remain popular for decades, being featured in a variety of books, comics, and other media. The Disney theme park ride [[Splash Mountain]] is also based on the film.

==Synopsis==

=== Setting ===
The film is set on a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] in the southern [[United States]], specifically in the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], some distance from [[Atlanta]]. Although sometimes misinterpreted as taking place [[antebellum South|before the American Civil War]] while [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was still legal in the region, the film takes place during the [[Reconstruction Era]] after slavery was abolished.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cohen | first = Karl F. | authorlink = | title = Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America | publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]], Inc. | series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1997 | location = [[Jefferson, North Carolina]] | pages = 64 | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7864-2032-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kaufman | first = Will | authorlink = | title = The Civil War in American Culture | publisher = [[Edinburgh University Press]] | series = | volume = | edition = | year = 2006 | location = Edinburgh | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7486-1935-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Langman | first1 = Larry | authorlink1 = | last2 = Ebner | first2 = David | title = Hollywood's Image of the South: A Century of Southern Films | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]] | series = | volume = | edition = | year = 2001 | location = Westport Connecticut, London | pages = 169 | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-313-31886-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Snead | first1 = James A. | authorlink1 = | last2=MacCabe | first2=Colin | last3=West | first3=Cornel | title = White Screens, Black Images: Hollywood from the Dark Side | publisher = [[Routledge]] | series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1994 | location = New York | pages = 88, 93 | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-90574-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris' original Uncle Remus stories were all set after the [[American Civil War]] and the abolition of slavery. Harris himself, born in 1848, was a racial reconciliation activist writer and journalist of the Reconstruction Era. The film makes several indirect references to the Reconstruction Era: clothing is in the newer [[1870s in fashion|late-Victorian style]]; Uncle Remus is free to leave the plantation at will; black field hands are [[sharecropper]]s, etc.&lt;ref name="Promotional Program Page 7"&gt;''Walt Disney Presents "Song of the South"'' Promotional Program, Page 7.

===Plot===
Seven-year-old Johnny ([[Bobby Driscoll]]) is excited about what he believes to be a vacation at his grandmother's Georgia plantation with his parents, John Sr. (Erik Rolf) and Sally ([[Ruth Warrick]]). When they arrive at the plantation, he discovers that his parents will be living apart for a while, and he is to live at the plantation with his mother and grandmother (Lucile Watson) while his father returns to Atlanta to continue his controversial editorship in the city's newspaper. Johnny, distraught because of his father's departure, secretly sets off that night for Atlanta with only a [[bindle]].

As Johnny sneaks away from the plantation, he is attracted by the voice of [[Uncle Remus]] ([[James Baskett]]) telling tales of a character named [[Br'er Rabbit]]. By this time, word had gotten out that Johnny was missing, and some plantation residents are looking for him. Johnny evades being discovered, but Uncle Remus catches up with him. They befriend each other and Uncle Remus offers him some food for his journey, taking him back to his cabin. Back at the cabin, Uncle Remus tells Johnny the traditional African-American folktale, "[[Br'er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute]]". In the story, Br'er Rabbit ([[Johnny Lee (actor)|Johnny Lee]]) attempts to run away from home only to change his mind after an encounter with [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear]] (James Baskett and [[Nick Stewart]]). Johnny takes the advice and changes his mind about leaving the plantation, letting Uncle Remus take him back to his mother.

Johnny makes friends with Toby (Glenn Leedy), a young black boy who lives on the plantation, and Ginny Favers ([[Luana Patten]]), a poor white girl. Ginny gives Johnny a puppy after her two older brothers, Joe (Gene Holland) and Jake (George Nokes), threaten to drown it. Johnny's mother refuses to let him take care of the puppy, so he takes the dog to Uncle Remus. Uncle Remus takes the dog in and delights Johnny and his friends with [[Tar-Baby|the fable of Br'er Rabbit and the Tar-Baby]], stressing that people shouldn't get involved with something they have no business with in the first place. Johnny heeds the advice of how Br'er Rabbit used [[reverse psychology]] on Br'er Fox and begs the Favers Brothers not to tell their mother (Mary Field) about the dog. The reverse psychology works, and the boys go to speak with their mother. After being spanked, they realize that Johnny had fooled them. In an act of revenge, they tell Sally about the dog. She becomes upset that Johnny and Uncle Remus kept the dog despite her order (which was unknown to Uncle Remus). She instructs Uncle Remus not to tell any more stories to her son.

Johnny's birthday arrives and Johnny picks up Ginny to take her to his party. On the way there, Joe and Jake push Ginny into a mud puddle. With her dress ruined, Ginny is unable to go to the party and runs off crying. Johnny begins fighting with the boys, but their fight is broken up by Uncle Remus. Johnny runs off to comfort Ginny. He explains that he does not want to go either, especially since his father will not be there. Uncle Remus discovers both dejected children and cheers them up by telling the story of [[The Laughing Place|Br'er Rabbit and his "Laughing Place"]]. When the three return to the plantation, Sally becomes angry at Johnny for missing his own birthday party, and tells Uncle Remus not to spend any more time with him. Saddened by the misunderstanding of his good intentions, Uncle Remus packs his bags and leaves for Atlanta. Johnny rushes to intercept him, but is attacked by a bull and seriously injured after taking a shortcut through a pasture. While Johnny hovers between life and death, his father returns. Johnny calls for Uncle Remus, who is then escorted in by his grandmother. Uncle Remus begins telling a tale of Br'er Rabbit and the Laughing Place, and the boy miraculously survives.

Johnny, Ginny, and Toby are next seen skipping along and singing while Johnny's returned puppy runs alongside them. Uncle Remus is also in the vicinity and he is shocked when Br'er Rabbit and several of the other characters from his stories appear in front of them and interact with the children. Uncle Remus rushes to join the group, and they all skip away singing.

==Production==

===Background===
[[Walt Disney]] had long wanted to produce a film based on the Uncle Remus storybook, but it was not until the mid-1940s that he had found a way to give the stories an adequate film equivalent in scope and fidelity. "I always felt that Uncle Remus should be played by a living person", Disney commented, "as should also the young boy to whom Harris' old Negro philosopher relates his vivid stories of the Briar Patch. Several tests in previous pictures, especially in ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'', were encouraging in the way living action and animation could be dovetailed. Finally, months ago, we 'took our foot in hand,' in the words of Uncle Remus, and jumped into our most venturesome but also more pleasurable undertaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/background/index.html|title=The Movie: Background|accessdate=January 18, 2007|publisher=Song of the South.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney first began to negotiate with Harris' family for the rights in 1939, and by late summer of that year he already had one of his storyboard artists summarize the more promising tales and draw up four boards' worth of story sketches.&lt;ref name="Gabler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|date=October 31, 2006|publisher=Knopf|isbn=0-679-43822-X|pages=432–9, 456, 463, 486, 511, 599}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1940, Disney visited the Harris' home in Atlanta. He told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that he wanted to "get an authentic feeling of Uncle Remus country so we can do as faithful a job as possible to these stories."&lt;ref name="Gabler"/&gt; [[Roy Oliver Disney]] had misgivings about the project, doubting that it was "big enough in caliber and natural draft" to warrant a budget over $1 million and more than twenty-five minutes of animation, but in June 1944, Disney hired Southern-born writer Dalton Reymond to write the screenplay, and he met frequently with [[King Vidor]], whom he was trying to interest in directing the live-action sequences.&lt;ref name="Gabler"/&gt;

Dalton Reymond wrote a treatment for the film.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; Because Reymond was not a professional screenwriter, [[Maurice Rapf]], who had been writing live-action features at the time, was asked by [[the Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] to work with Reymond and co-writer Callum Webb to turn the treatment into a shootable screenplay.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; According to [[Neal Gabler]], one of the reasons Disney had hired Rapf to work with Reymond was to temper what Disney feared would be Reymond's "white Southern slant".

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rapf was a minority, a Jew, and an outspoken [[Left-wing politics|left-winger]], and he himself feared that the film would inevitably be [[Uncle Tom]]ish. "That's exactly why I want you to work on it," Walt told him, "because I know that you don't think I should make the movie. You're against Uncle Tomism, and you're a radical."&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rapf initially hesitated, but when he found out that most of the film would be live-action and that he could make extensive changes, he accepted the offer.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; Rapf worked on ''Uncle Remus'' for about seven weeks. When he got into a personal dispute with Reymond, Rapf was taken off the project.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; According to Rapf, Walt Disney "ended every conference by saying 'Well, I think we've really licked it now.' Then he'd call you the next morning and say, 'I've got a new idea.' And he'd have one. Sometimes the ideas were good, sometimes they were terrible, but you could never really satisfy him."&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt; Morton Grant was assigned to the project.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; Disney sent out the script for comment both within the studio and outside the studio.&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt;

===Casting===
''Song of the South'' was the first live-action dramatic film made by Disney.&lt;ref name="IMDb-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038969/trivia|title=Trivia for ''Song of the South''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Baskett]] was cast as Uncle Remus after responding to an ad for providing the voice of a talking butterfly. "I thought that, maybe, they'd try me out to furnish the voice for one of Uncle Remus' animals," Baskett is quoted as saying. Upon review of his voice, Disney wanted to meet Baskett personally, and had him tested for the role of Uncle Remus. Not only did Baskett get the part of the butterfly's voice, but also the voice of Br'er Fox and the live-action role of Uncle Remus as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/biographies/baskett.html|title=James Baskett as Uncle Remus|publisher=Song of the South.net|accessdate=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Baskett filled in as the voice of [[Br'er Rabbit]] for [[Johnny Lee (actor)|Johnny Lee]] in the "Laughing Place" scene after Lee was called away to do promotion for the picture.&lt;ref name="IMDb-2" /&gt; Disney liked Baskett, and told his sister Ruth that Baskett was "the best actor, I believe, to be discovered in years". Even after the film's release, Disney maintained contact with Baskett.&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt; Disney also campaigned for Baskett to be given an [[Academy Award]] for his performance, saying that he had worked "almost wholly without direction" and had devised the characterization of Remus himself. Thanks to Disney's efforts, Baskett won an honorary [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; After Baskett's death, his widow wrote Disney and told him that he had been a "friend indeed and [we] certainly have been in need".&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt;

Also cast in the production were child actors [[Bobby Driscoll]], [[Luana Patten]], and [[Glenn Leedy]] (his only screen appearance). Driscoll was the first actor to be under a personal contract with the Disney studio.&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Driscoll biography at [http://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/biographies/driscoll.html Song of the South.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Patten had been a professional model since age 3, and caught the attention of Disney when she appeared on the cover of ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/biographies/patten.html|title=Luana Patten as Ginny Favers|publisher=Song of the South.net|accessdate=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leedy was discovered on the playground of the Booker T. Washington school in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], by a talent scout from the Disney studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/biographies/leedy.html|title=Glenn Leedy as Toby|publisher=Song of the South.net|accessdate=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruth Warrick]] and Erik Rolf, cast as Johnny's mother and father, had actually been married during filming, but divorced in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/biographies/warrick.html|title=Ruth Warrick as Sally|publisher=Song of the South.net|accessdate=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/biographies/rolf.html|title=Eric Rolf as John|publisher=Song of the South.net|accessdate=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hattie McDaniel]] also appeared in the role of Aunt Tempy.

===Filming===
Production started under the title ''Uncle Remus''.&lt;ref name="Gabler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The budget was originally $1,350,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety159-1945-09#page/n55/mode/1up ''Variety'' 12 September 1945 p 12]&lt;/ref&gt; The animated segments of the film were directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]], while the live-action segments were directed by Harve Foster.&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt; Filming began in December 1944 in Phoenix, where the studio had constructed a plantation and cotton fields for outdoor scenes, and Disney left for the location to oversee what he called "atmospheric shots".&lt;ref name="Gabler"/&gt; Back in Hollywood, the live action scenes were filmed at the [[Samuel Goldwyn Studio]].

On the final day of shooting, Jackson discovered that the scene in which Uncle Remus sings the film's signature song, "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah", had not been properly [[blocking (stage)|blocked]]. According to Jackson, "We all sat there in a circle with the dollars running out, and nobody came up with anything. Then Walt suggested that they shoot Baskett in close-up, cover the lights with cardboard save for a sliver of blue sky behind his head, and then remove the cardboard from the lights when he began singing so that he would seem to be entering a bright new world of animation. Like Walt's idea for [[Bambi#Production|Bambi on ice]], it made for one of the most memorable scenes in the film."&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt;

=== Animation ===
[[File:Laughingplace.jpg|thumb|[[Br'er Rabbit]] takes [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear]] to his "[[The Laughing Place|laughing place]]"]]
There are three animated segments in the film (in all, they last a total of 25 minutes). The last few minutes of the film also contain combine animation with live-action. The three sequences were later shown as stand-alone cartoon features on television.
* ''Br'er Rabbit Runs Away'': (~8 minutes) Based on "[[Br'er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute]]". Includes the song "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]", 
* ''Br'er Rabbit and the Tar Baby'': (~12 minutes) Based on "[[Tar-Baby]]". The segment is interrupted with a short live-action scene about two-thirds through. It features the song "How Do You Do?"
* ''Br'er Rabbit's Laughing Place'': (~5 minutes) Based on "[[The Laughing Place]]". The song "Everybody's Got a Laughing Place" is featured.

=== Music ===
Nine songs are heard in the film, with four [[reprise]]s. Nearly all of the vocal performances are by the largely African-American cast, and the renowned all-black [[Hall Johnson|Hall Johnson Choir]] sing four pieces: two versions of a [[Blues|blues number]] ("Let the Rain Pour Down"), one chain-reaction-style folk song&lt;ref&gt;Walt Disney's ''Song of the South'', 1946 Publicity Campaign Book, Distributed by RKO Pictures. Copyright Walt Disney Pictures, 1946. "The chain-reaction, endless song, of which American folk music is so plentiful [...] The number is 'Uncle Remus Said,' and it consists of a single, brief melody repeated as often as new lyrics come along."&lt;/ref&gt; ("That's What Uncle Remus Said") and one [[Negro spiritual|spiritual]] ("All I Want").

"Let the Rain Pour Down" is set to the melody of "[[Midnight Special (song)|Midnight Special]]", a traditional [[blues]] song popularized by [[Lead Belly]] (Huddie William Ledbetter). The song title "Look at the Sun" appeared in some early press books, though it is not actually in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Song of the South Song Lyrics|url=http://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/lyrics/index.html|accessdate=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" was influenced by the chorus of the pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] folk song "[[Zip Coon]]", that is considered racist as it plays on an African American stereotype.&lt;ref name=Doo-dah!&gt;{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=Ken|title=Doo-dah!: Stephen Foster and the Rise of American Popular Culture|year=1997|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0684810102|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackface!|url=http://black-face.com/|publisher=black-face.com|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Fox Theater night.jpg|thumb|The film premiered at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta)|Fox Theatre]] in Atlanta in 1946.]]
The film premiered on November 12, 1946, at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta)|Fox Theater]] in Atlanta.&lt;ref name="Gabler"/&gt; Walt Disney made introductory remarks, introduced the cast, then quietly left for his room at the [[Georgian Terrace Hotel]] across the street; he had previously stated that unexpected audience reactions upset him and he was better off not seeing the film with an audience. James Baskett was unable to attend the film's premiere because he would not have been allowed to participate in any of the festivities, as Atlanta was then a [[racially segregated]] city.&lt;ref&gt;In a October 15, 1946 article in the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', columnist Harold Martin noted that to bring Baskett to Atlanta, where he would not have been allowed to participate in any of the festivities, "would cause him many embarrassments, for his feelings are the same as any man's". The modern claim that no Atlanta hotel would give Baskett accommodation is false: there were several black-owned hotels in the [[Sweet Auburn]] area of downtown Atlanta at the time, including the Savoy and the McKay. [http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PressReleases1999_2nd/June99_AtlantaNABHA.html Atlanta's Black-Owned Hotels: A History].&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed $3.3 million at the box office.&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety169-1948-01#page/n62/mode/1up "Top Grossers of 1947", ''Variety'', 7 January 1948 p 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

As had been done earlier with ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', Disney produced a [[Sunday strip|Sunday comic strip]] titled ''Uncle Remus &amp; His Tales of Br'er Rabbit'' to give the film pre-release publicity. The strip was launched by [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]] on October 14, 1945, more than a year before the film was released. Unlike the ''Snow White'' comic strip, which only adapted the film, ''Uncle Remus'' ran for decades, telling one story after another about the characters, some based on the legends and others new, until it ended on December 31, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/brerrab.htm|title=Br'er Rabbit|publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|accessdate=January 18, 2007|first=Don|last=Markstein|archivedate=September 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bDugm3on?url=http://toonopedia.com/brerrab.htm|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the newspaper strips, Disney ''Br'er Rabbit'' comics were also produced for comic books; the first such stories appeared in late 1946. Produced both by [[Western Publishing]] and European publishers such as [[Egmont Publishing|Egmont]], they continue to appear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coa.inducks.org/character.php/x/BR/date/42 Coa.inducks.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, a Giant Golden Book entitled ''Walt Disney's Uncle Remus Stories'' was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. It featured 23 illustrated stories of Br'er Rabbit's escapades, all told in a Southern dialect based on the original Joel Chandler Harris stories.

''Song of the South'' was re-released in theaters several times after its original premiere, each time through [[Buena Vista Pictures]]: in 1956 for the 10th anniversary; in 1972 for the 50th anniversary of [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]; in 1973 as the second half of a double bill with ''[[The Aristocats]]''; in 1980 for the 100th anniversary of Harris' classic stories; and in 1986 for the film's own 40th anniversary and in promotion of the upcoming [[Splash Mountain]] attraction at [[Disneyland]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The film has been broadcast on European television, including the [[BBC]] as recently as 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2006-08-27#at-10.00&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he favored allowing film students to have access to the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songofthesouth.net/news/archives/mobileregister.html|title='Song of the South'|authorlink=|date=January 6, 2002|publisher=Alabama Mobile Register|pages=|language=|quote=|accessdate=January 18, 2007|author=Mike Brantley|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/movie-answer-man-02132000&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite not having a home video release in the United States, audio from the film—both the musical soundtrack and dialogue—were made widely available to the public from the time of the film's debut up through the late 1970s. In particular, many [[book-and-record set]]s were released, alternately featuring the animated portions of the film or summaries of the film as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songofthesouth.net/memorabilia/records/index.html|title=''Song of the South'' Memorabilia|publisher=Song of the South.net|accessdate=January 18, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213064927/http://www.songofthesouth.net/memorabilia/records/index.html|archivedate=February 13, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walt Disney Company has also allowed key portions of the film to be issued on many VHS and DVD compilations in the U.S., as well as on the long-running [[Walt Disney anthology television series]]. Most recently, "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" and some of the animated portions of the film were issued on the ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' 2-DVD Special Edition set. These segments are part of a 1950 Walt Disney TV special included on the DVD which promoted the then-forthcoming ''Alice in Wonderland'' film.

The full-length film has been released in various European, Latin American, and Asian countries. In the UK, it was released on [[PAL]] VHS tape in 1982 and again in 1991. In Japan it appeared on [[NTSC]] VHS, Beta, and [[laserdisc|LaserDisc]] in 1985 then again on LaserDisc in 1990 with subtitles during songs (additionally, under [[Japanese copyright law]], the film is now in the [[public domain]]).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/japanese%20court%20rules%20pre-1953%20movies%20in%20public%20domain_1002318 Japanese Court Rules Pre-1953 Movies in Public Domain]", contactmusic.com, December 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A NTSC LaserDisc was released in Hong Kong for the Chinese rental market by Intercontinental Video Ltd, which has been the exclusive distributor of Walt Disney Studios since 1988.

In July 2017 after being inaugurated as a [[Disney Legends|Disney Legend]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] expressed a desire for ''Song of the South'' to be re-released publicly to American audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/first-act-disney-legend-whoopi-goldberg-tells-disney-stop-hiding-history-152327.html|title=In Her First Act As A Disney Legend, Whoopi Goldberg Tells Disney To Stop Hiding Its History|last=Amidi|first=Amid|publisher=Cartoon Brew|date=July 15, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Although the film was a financial success, netting the studio a profit of $226,000 ($2,833,970 in 2017 dollars) &lt;ref name="BobThomas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Bob |year=1994 |title=Walt Disney: An American Original |publisher=[[Hyperion Books]]|location=New York. |pages=161 |isbn=0-7868-6027-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some critics were less enthusiastic about the film, not so much the animated portions as the live-action portions. [[Bosley Crowther]] for one wrote in ''The New York Times'', "More and more, Walt Disney's craftsmen have been loading their feature films with so-called 'live action' in place of their animated whimsies of the past, and by just those proportions has the magic of these Disney films decreased", citing the ratio of live action to animation at two to one, concluding that is "approximately the ratio of its mediocrity to its charm".&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt; However, the film also received positive notice. ''Time'' magazine called the film "topnotch Disney".&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; In 2003, the [[Online Film Critics Society]] ranked the film as the 67th greatest animated film of all time.&lt;ref name="OFCS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/pages/pr/top100animated |title=Top 100 Animated Features of All Time |accessdate=January 18, 2007 |publisher=[[Online Film Critics Society]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ADt9yaLh?url=http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/pages/pr/top100animated |archivedate=August 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 55% approval rating, based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/song_of_the_south/ | title=Song of the South (1946) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] | accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
[[File:Uncle Remus 1946.JPG|thumb|[[James Baskett]] was voted an [[Honorary Academy Award]] for his portrayal of Uncle Remus, the first African-American man to win any kind of Oscar.]]
The score by [[Daniele Amfitheatrof]], [[Paul Smith (film and television composer)|Paul J. Smith]], and [[Charles Wolcott]] was nominated in the "Scoring of a Musical Picture" category, and "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]", written by [[Allie Wrubel]] and [[Ray Gilbert]], won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]] at the [[20th Academy Awards]] on March 20, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Song of the South'' opened in Los Angeles in 1947, which became its qualification year for the awards.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Academy Honorary Award|special Academy Award]] was given to Baskett "for his able and heart-warming characterization of Uncle Remus, friend and story teller to the children of the world in Walt Disney's ''Song of the South''". Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten in their portrayals of the children characters Johnny and Ginny were also discussed for [[Academy Juvenile Award]]s, but in 1947 it was decided not to present such awards at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oyla20.de/cgi-bin/designs/clock/index.cgi?page=text&amp;id=905147061207559454&amp;userid=48045629|title=That Little Girl in 'Song of the South' a Big Girl Now|last=Parsons|first=Luella|date=February 28, 1960|publisher=Lincoln Sunday Journal and Star|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
The film has received significant controversy for its handling of race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.time.com/2009/12/09/top-10-disney-controversies/slide/song-of-the-south/ Time]&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural historian Jason Sperb describes the film as "one of Hollywood's most resiliently offensive racist texts".&lt;ref name="sperb"&gt;Jason Sperb, ''Disney's Most Notorious Film,'' University of Texas Press (2012), {{ISBN|0292739745}}, {{ISBN|978-0292739741}}; reviewed in John Lingan, [http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/01/song_of_the_south_disney_s_most_notorious_film_by_jason_sperb_reviewed.html Bristling Dixie], ''Slate'' January 4, 2013 (accessed August 21, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Sperb, [[Neal Gabler]], and other critics have noted the film's release as being in the wake of the [[Double V campaign]], a [[propaganda]] campaign in the United States during [[World War II]] to promote victory over racism in the United States and its armed forces, and victory over fascism abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Sperb, ''Disney's Most Notorious Film''&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the film's production, there was concern that the material would encounter controversy. Disney publicist Vern Caldwell wrote to producer [[Perce Pearce]] that "the negro situation is a dangerous one. Between the negro haters and the negro lovers there are many chances to run afoul of situations that could run the gamut all the way from the nasty to the controversial."&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt;

The Disney Company has stated that, like Harris' book, the film takes place after the [[American Civil War]] and that all the African American characters in the movie are no longer slaves.&lt;ref name="Promotional Program Page 7" /&gt; [[Production Code|The Hays Office]] had asked Disney to "be certain that the frontispiece of the book mentioned establishes the date in the 1870s"; however, the final film carried no such statement.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

When the film was first released, [[Walter Francis White]], the executive secretary of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), telegraphed major newspapers around the country with the following statement, erroneously claiming that the film depicted an [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era .281781.E2.80.931860.29|antebellum]] setting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People recognizes in "Song of the South" remarkable artistic merit in the music and in the combination of living actors and the cartoon technique. It regrets, however, that in an effort neither to offend audiences in the north or south, the production helps to perpetuate a dangerously glorified picture of slavery. Making use of the beautiful Uncle Remus folklore, "Song of the South" unfortunately gives the impression of an idyllic master-slave relationship which is a distortion of the facts.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

White however had not yet seen the film; his statement was based on memos he received from two NAACP staff members – Norma Jensen and Hope Spingarn – who attended a press screening on November 20, 1946. Jensen had written that the film was "so artistically beautiful that it is difficult to be provoked over the clichés" but that it contained "all the clichés in the book", mentioning that she felt scenes like blacks singing traditional black songs were offensive as a stereotype. Spingarn listed several things she found objectionable from the film, including the use of [[African-American English]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; Jim Hill Media stated that both Jensen and Spingarn were confused by the film's Reconstruction setting, writing that "It was something that also confused other reviewers who from the tone of the film and the type of similar recent Hollywood movies [''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''; ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]''] assumed it must also be set during the time of slavery." Based on the Jensen and Spingarn memos, White released the "official position" of the NAACP in a telegram that was widely quoted in newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jimhillmedia.com/alumni1/b/wade_sampson/archive/2005/11/16/1289.aspx Jim Hill Media. ''Wednesdays with Wade: Did the NAACP kill "Song of the South"?'' November 15, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times''' Bosley Crowther made a similar assumption, writing that the movie was a "travesty on the ''antebellum'' South."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B03E7D71E38E53ABC4051DFB767838D659EDE ''The New York Times.'' ''The Screen; 'Song of the South,' Disney Film Combining Cartoons and Life, Opens at Palace—Abbott and Costello at Loew's Criterion'' By Bosley Crowther, November 28, 1946.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine, although it praised the film, cautioned that it was "bound to land its maker in hot water", because the character of Uncle Remus was "bound to enrage all educated Negroes and a number of [[wiktionary:damn Yankee|damyankees]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,777351,00.html|work=Time|title=The New Pictures|date=November 18, 1946|volume=48|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]], a congressman from Harlem, branded the film an "insult to American minorities [and] everything that America as a whole stands for."&lt;ref name="Watts 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Steven|title=The Magic Kingdom: Walt Disney and the American Way of Life|year=2001|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=0-8262-1379-0|pages=276–277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgARIndAbjAC&amp;vq=song+of+the+south}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Negro Congress]] set up picket lines in theaters in the big cities where the film played, with its protesters holding signs that read "''Song of the South'' is an insult to the Negro people" and, lampooning "Jingle Bells", chanted: "Disney tells, Disney tells/lies about the South."&lt;ref name="Watts 2001" /&gt;  On April 2, 1947, a group of protesters marched around [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)]] with picket signs reading, "We want films on Democracy not Slavery" and "Don't prejudice children's minds with films like this".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/823179800|title=Who's afraid of the Song of the South? : and other forbidden Disney stories|last=Jim.|first=Korkis,|date=2012|publisher=Theme Park Press|others=Norman, Floyd.|isbn=0984341552|location=Orlando, Fla.|oclc=823179800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish newspaper ''B'nai B'rith Messenger'' of Los Angeles considered the film to be "tall[ying] with the reputation that Disney is making for himself as an arch-reactionary".

Some black press had mixed reactions on what they thought of ''Song of the South''. While Richard B. Dier in ''The Afro-American'' was "thoroughly disgusted" by the film for being "as vicious a piece of propaganda for white supremacy as Hollywood ever produced," Herman Hill in ''The Pittsburgh Courier'' felt that ''Song of the South'' would "prove of inestimable goodwill in the furthering of interracial relations", and considered criticisms of the film to be "unadulterated hogwash symptomatic of the unfortunate racial neurosis that seems to be gripping so many of our humorless brethren these days."&lt;ref name="Gevinson"&gt;{{cite book|last= Gevinson|first=Alan|title= Within Our Gates: Ethnicity in American Feature Films, 1911-1960|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=California|isbn= 978-0520209640|page=956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of any public release in the US since 1986, ''Song of the South'' has made its way around in the form of bootleg copies found around numerous internet message boards. The film has grown an online following that has kept the film's presence alive, despite the general audience's views on the film, according to Jason Sperb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sperb|first=Jason|date=2010-09-12|title=Reassuring Convergence: Online Fandom, Race, and Disney's Notorious Song of the South|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/392280|journal=Cinema Journal|language=en|volume=49|issue=4|pages=25–45|doi=10.1353/cj.2010.0016|issn=1527-2087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Splash Mountain at Disneyland.JPG|thumb|The Disney theme park ride, [[Splash Mountain]], is based on ''Song of the South''.]]
As early as October 1945, a [[comic strip|newspaper strip]] named ''Walt Disney Presents "Uncle Remus" and His Tales of Br'er Rabbit'' appeared in the United States, and this production continued until 1972. There have also been episodes for the series produced for the [[Disney comics|Disney comic books]] worldwide, in the U.S., Denmark and the Netherlands, from the 1940s up to the present day, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=BR&amp;view=3 "Brer Rabbit"] at [[Inducks]]&lt;/ref&gt; Br'er Bear and Br'er Fox also appeared frequently in Disney's [[Big Bad Wolf#Disney's version|Big Bad Wolf]] stories, although here, [[Br'er Bear]] was usually cast as an honest farmer and family man, instead of the bad guy in his original appearances.

Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear appeared as guests in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. They also appeared in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. Br'er Bear and the Tar-Baby also appear in the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. Br'er Bear can be seen near the end while the Toons are celebrating finding the will. The Tar-Baby can briefly be seen during the scene driving into Toon Town.

Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear also appeared in the 2011 video game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'' for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game is a virtual recreation of Disneyland and it features a mini game based on the Splash Mountain attraction. Br'er Rabbit helps guide the player character through that game, while Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear serve as antagonists. The three Br'ers also appear as meet-and-greet characters in the game, outside Splash Mountain in Critter Country. In the game, [[Jess Harnell]] reprises his role from the attraction as Br'er Rabbit and also takes on the role of Br'er Fox, while Br'er Bear is voiced by [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]], who previously voiced Br'er Bear and Br'er Frog in the Walt Disney World version of Splash Mountain. This is the Br'ers' first major appearance in Disney media since ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' in 2004 and their first appearance as computer-generated characters.

The '''Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961''' affects [[Title 15 of the United States Code]], Chapter 32 "Telecasting of Professional Sports Contest" (§§ 1291-1295) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_32.html |title=15 U.S. Code Chapter 32 - TELECASTING OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CONTESTS &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=2012-01-03 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Sports Broadcasting Act was passed in response to a court decision which ruled that the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated [[competition law|antitrust laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shea|first=Stuart|date= |title=Calling the Game: Baseball Broadcasting from 1920 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5QcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Calling+the+Game:+Baseball+Broadcasting+from+1920+to+the+Present&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij-OW6x4PWAhXIrlQKHU6TCQgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Gillette%20&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=SABR, Inc.|page=357|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The court ruled that the "pooling" of rights by all the teams to conclude an exclusive contract between the league and [[CBS]] was illegal.

The Act overrules that decision, and permits certain joint broadcasting agreements among the major professional sports. It recognizes the fact that the various franchises in a sports league, while competitors in the sporting sense, are not as much business competitors as they are interdependent partners, whose success as enterprises is intertwined, as a certain level of competitive balance between them must exist for any of them to remain viable enterprises.  Therefore, it permits the sale of a television "package" to a network or networks in which the league members share equally, a procedure which is common today. Of the five major North American professional team sports, the Act is most pertinent to the NFL, as all of its regular-season and playoff games are covered by the rights assigned by its various packages with the networks, including its own.  

The law has been interpreted to include the so-called "blackout rules" which protect a home team from competing games broadcast into its home territory on a day when it is playing a game at home, and from having to broadcast games within its home market area that have not sold out.  It also, in effect, protects high school football and college football game attendance by blacking out pro football games locally on Friday evenings and Saturdays during those sports' regular seasons; these measures effectively outlawed the broadcasting (and, in practice, the playing) of NFL games on those days, since virtually all of the country is within 75 miles (120 km) of at least one high school game on every Friday night in September and October. 

===Exceptions===
This portion of the act has since been partially circumvented; the NFL extended its season in 1978 to allow a few weeks of Friday night or Saturday games if the league so wished. Late-season Saturday games have been common since then, but Friday night games are still extremely rare; the league has played only eight Friday games since 1978, mostly because of the NFL's restrictions during Christmas. (In 2005, a [[Miami Dolphins]]-[[Kansas City Chiefs]] matchup, scheduled for Sunday, October 23 in Miami, was moved up to 7pm Friday night due to [[Hurricane Wilma]]. The game was televised only in the South Florida and Kansas City TV markets, and was not seen nationally.)&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-10-20-chiefs-dolphins-moved_x.htm?csp=36&lt;/ref&gt;

===College football===
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA)'s broadcast packages are not subject to the antitrust exemption and it suffered for it, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the NCAA's restrictive television policies were a violation of antitrust law in the 1980s when the [[University of Georgia]] and the [[University of Oklahoma]] sued the NCAA over television restrictions (limit of six television appearances over two years) established in 1952. However, after their court victory, neither Georgia nor Oklahoma made serious efforts to market their own television packages, but instead followed the lead of their conferences, the [[Southeastern Conference]] and the [[Big 12 Conference|Big 8 Conference]] respectively.

The [[College Football Association]], an alliance of 64 schools from some of the major conferences and selected independents, sold their own television package in 1984, first to ABC, and later to CBS. The [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]] conferences, not CFA affiliates, sold their own separate package, to ABC.

By 1990, the landscape changed. ABC had both the CFA, Big Ten, and Pac-10 packages, and NBC the Notre Dame home package. It was once again relegated to limited appearances.

The CFA collapsed, and in 1995, the Southeastern Conference signed a national deal with CBS.  They are the only major conference guaranteed a national "game of the week" because ESPN's games may come from any of the conferences they offer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportslawnews.com/archive/jargon/ljsportsbroadcasingact.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102084416/http://www.sportslawnews.com/archive/jargon/ljsportsbroadcasingact.htm |date=January 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current views on the Sports Broadcasting Act==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
In November 2006, former Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman [[Arlen Specter]], (&lt;!-- In 2006, Specter was a Republican--&gt;[[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Pennsylvania|PA]]) proposed legislation to repeal the NFL's antitrust exemption under the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961.

Specter's concern was based on the [[National Football League]]'s [[NFL Network]], which is available in a limited number of homes, as compared to the other broadcasters of the NFL.  For the 2006-07 NFL season, each NFL team annually earned more than $120 million in shared TV money. The league's officials negotiated various deals with CBS, [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[Disney]], and ended up with a six-year (later extended to eight), $24 billion broadcast and cable rights contract. The television deals ended in 2013. Additionally, [[DirecTV]] paid $700 million every year through 2010 for its Sunday Ticket package.  The NFL also decided to keep an eight-game Thursday-to-Saturday night package in-house, placing it on its [[NFL Network]].

Both the Sunday Ticket and NFL Network became issues of concern to Specter, possibly because [[DirecTV]] rival [[Comcast]] is headquartered in his home state of [[Pennsylvania]].  Comcast's [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] network attempted to bid for the eight-game package the NFL gave to their own network, but lost.

The NFL Network's high per-subscriber fees charged to the cable companies force cable firms to offer the channel as a premium-tier network.  This, according to the NFL, is unacceptable, and they demanded their channel be placed on a basic tier, as compared to the higher-priced sports tiers.  By doing so, cable companies would have to reduce the number of basic channels or increase the basic cable package rate to comply with the NFL's request. NFL rules however, require that NFL games shown on cable channels (including the NFL Network), be shown on a broadcast television station in the markets of the participating teams (subject to blackouts for the home team when necessary).

The other major concern is the lack of availability of NFL Sunday Ticket, restricting it severely through its exclusivity with DirecTV.  A similar situation happens with NASCAR HotPass, which moved from the cable companies to DirecTV in 2007, and thwarted by Major League Baseball's MLB Extra Innings, which MLB attempted to push to DirecTV exclusively starting in 2009, but was stopped by threats from legislators.

In what may have been a goodwill gesture to Senator Lautenberg of [[New Jersey]] and, in an effort to sway Specter, the NFL gave Time Warner and Cablevision subscribers a free week of programming between December 24 and December 30, 2006.  The timing allowed subscribers to tune into the Rutgers–Kansas State Texas Bowl matchup and another college bowl game featuring Minnesota and Texas Tech.  Lautenberg had complained that many Rutgers fans in New Jersey were being unfairly denied the opportunity to watch Rutgers in the Texas Bowl because the NFL Network, which has rights to the game, had not yet reached deals with Cablevision and Time Warner Cable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6013">[[File:Rodeo, Texas, USA (14290090987).jpg|thumb|The steer is trying to buck off the mounted individual]]
'''Steer riding''' is a [[rodeo]] youth event that is an introductory form of [[bull riding]] for younger riders, usually between the ages of seven&lt;ref name=caldwell/&gt; and fourteen.&lt;ref name=calgary/&gt;  Instead of [[bucking bull]]s, the children ride [[Cattle#Terminology|steers]] that buck. Steers are used because they are known to have a less volatile temperament than [[bull]]s and many breeds weigh less than bulls, which makes them a perfect stepping stone to junior bulls. The steers usually weigh between {{convert|500|to|1000|lb}}.&lt;ref name=caldwell&gt;{{cite web|title=Caldwell Night Rodeo – Jr. Steer Riding|url=http://www.caldwellnightrodeo.com/events/2016/jr-steer-riding|website=caldwellnghtrodeo.com|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steer riding usually follows [[mutton busting]] and calf riding as the participant ages and grows. Many young and aspiring bull riders who train in steer riding compete in the [[National Junior Bullriders Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Junior Bullriders Association|url=http://www.njbranow.org/about.html|website=www.njbranow.org|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Junior Bullriders Association holds these annual contests:

* 6 &amp; Under [[mutton busting|Mutton Bustin]]
* 8 &amp; Under Calf Riding
* 11 &amp; Under Steer Riding
* 13 &amp; Under Peewee Bullriding
* 15 &amp; Under Jr. Bullriding
* 19 &amp; Under Sr. Bullriding

Riders use equipment and riding techniques that are similar to adult bull riding.  The steers are equipped with the following: a flank strap – the flank strap is placed around a steer's flank, just in front of the hind legs, to encourage bucking. And then they also use a "steer rope" – a rope that goes around the steer for the rider to hang onto with a [[cowbell|bell]] underneath. The riders wear batwing [[chaps]], and [[spur]]s.  For safety, they use [[protective vest]]s&lt;ref name=package&gt;{{cite web|title=Steer Riding Rodeo Youth Package|url=http://www.rodeomart.com/Steer-Riding-Rodeo-Youth-Package-p/10-101-steer-riding-rodeo-yout.htm|website=RodeoMart.com|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[helmet]]s with a [[face mask (gridiron football)|face mask]] that resemble those worn by hockey [[goalie]]s.&lt;ref name=camden/&gt;

Events are usually broken down by age brackets.&lt;ref name=camden/&gt; Parental permission is required for their children to compete, and they must sign a [[liability waiver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labor Day Rodeo Junior Steer Riding – Performance – Visit Meeteetse, Wyoming!|url=http://meeteetsewy.com/shop/labor-day-rodeo/labor-day-rodeo-junior-steer-wrestling-performance/|website=Visit Meeteetse, Wyoming!|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible for competitors to be seriously injured in the event.&lt;ref name=camden&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Letitia|title=Steer-riding Kundabung cowboy keeps winning|url=http://www.camdencourier.com.au/story/4049371/steer-riding-kundabung-cowboy-keeps-winning/?cs=12|website=Camden Haven Courier|accessdate=17 February 2017|language=en|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like bull riding, riders must stay on for eight seconds for a qualified ride.  Half of the score is awarded for the cowboy’s ability to ride, and the other half for the steer’s ability to buck. One difference is that in some steer riding competitions, riders are allowed to hang on with both hands. They can choose to compete riding one-handed, like the adults, but if they do, they fall under the same rules as bull riding and can be disqualified for grabbing the steer with both hands.  Riders can also be disqualified for touching the animal or themselves during the ride. Failure to stay on for the full 8 seconds or a disqualification results in a no score.&lt;ref name=calgary&gt;{{cite web|title=Junior Steer Riding {{!}} Calgary Stampede|url=http://www.calgarystampede.com/stampede/rodeo/junior-steer-riding|website=www.calgarystampede.com|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riding steers allows riders to develop needed skills before taking on bulls. As bulls are being bred to be more athletic and dangerous, it is more important than ever for adolescent, teenagers, and young adults to get all of the experience they need before taking on bulls. One man, a former PRCA World Champion Bull Rider, Cody Custer, discusses this issue at length on his web site. When youngsters take on "junior bulls" that only a decade or two ago were considered pro level bulls, they have an extremely low success rate and get discouraged or injured beyond what is reasonably acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Bull Riding|url=http://www.codycuster.com/youth-bull-riding.html|website=Cody Custer|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Too much bull|url=https://www.sbnation.com/longform/2014/7/8/5877463/too-much-bull-an-industry-obsessed-with-breeding-bigger-nastier-bulls|website=SBNation.com|accessdate=17 February 2017|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some steers not used in rodeo who have been trained not to buck and instead are gentled to be ridden. Most people who have trained their cattle to be ridden have used them to perform similar tasks which horses perform, such as trail riding, jumping, and running. However, they do require different maintenance and handling than horses. It should also be noted that some breeds of cattle are more conducive than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farm Show – Cattle-Riding "Cowboys" Catching On|url=https://www.farmshow.com/a_article.php?aid=20898|website=www.farmshow.com|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Talk''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[magazine]] published from 1999 to 2002. The magazine gained notoriety for its celebrity profiles and interviews.&lt;ref name="alger"/&gt; The magazine was a joint venture of [[Miramax]]'s Talk Media and [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Magazines]]. Hearst would manage circulation, manufacturing, newsstand distribution and subscription fulfillment. Talk Media was in charge of advertising sales, editorial content and marketing.&lt;ref name=hearst/&gt;

==History and profile==
Talk Media was founded in July 1998 by [[Miramax|Miramax Films]], [[Tina Brown]] and Ron Galotti to publishing books and Talk magazine and produce television programs. Talk Media formed a joint venture with [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Magazines]] for the magazine only in February 1999.&lt;ref name=hearst&gt;{{cite news|title=Miramax Films and Hearst Magazines Announce Plans to Publish Talk|url=http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/miramax-films-and-hearst-magazines-announce-plans-to-publish-talk|accessdate=February 16, 2016|work=Hearst Publishing|date=February 11, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of ''Talk'' appeared in September 1999.&lt;ref name="alger"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Alex Kuczynski|author2=Geraldine Fabrikant|title=Lifelines Cut, Talk Magazine Goes Silent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/19/business/lifelines-cut-talk-magazine-goes-silent.html|accessdate=16 February 2016|work=The New York Times|date=19 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover story of the debut issue was an interview with [[Hillary Clinton]], which took place shortly after the [[Clinton-Lewinsky scandal]], in which she explained that her husband [[Bill Clinton]] had a chronic need to please women. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that at times, "''Talk'' seemed more interested in promoting such Miramax stars as [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] than in politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtz |first=Howard |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/01/19/tina-browns-talk-magazine-suddenly-silenced/1871c9ba-e75e-46ee-9af2-f975e32f0180/ |title=Tina Brown's Talk Magazine Suddenly Silenced |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2002-01-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the magazine never became a commercial success, and was shut down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/business/media/03carr.html?hp|title=The Media Equation; 10 Years Ago, An Omen No One Saw|author=David  Carr|date=3 August 2009|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 18, 2002.&lt;ref name="alger"/&gt; [[Politico.com]] estimated that Brown had "bombed through some $50 million in 2 1/2 years" on the failed venture. A $1 million contract settlement in 2002 ended Brown's involvement in Talk Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Norris |first=John |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/tina-brown-how-to-lose-100-million-105907 |title=How to Lose $100 Million |work=POLITICO Magazine |publisher=Politico.com |date=May–June 2014 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5791">'''Tam cúc''' (三菊, "three chrysanthemums") is a [[trick-taking game|multi-trick]] [[card game]] popular in [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Jude Wudarczyk: "Tam Cúc, the game of three chrysanthemums" The Playing-Card Vol XXVI No 1 (1997) pp 2-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Tam Cuc is not just played for entertainment, but also played in ceremonies and festivals. It is a card game that is commonly played in [[Vietnamese New Year|New Year celebrations]], it a habit of northerner to play this game while wait for the [[banh chung]] to cook. Tam cúc is mostly played by women because the number of cards is less than in the [[Tổ tôm]], which is more common among men. It is similar to the games of [[:zh:車馬包|Chēmǎbāo]], [[:zh:擲虎|Zhìhǔ]], and [[Giog]].

==Card set==
[[File:三菊.png|thumb|350px|Tam cúc]]
A deck of tam cúc has 32 cards with 2 kinds of set red and black. Each set has 1 general (''tướng'' 將), 2 advisors (''sĩ'' 士), 2 elephants (''tượng'' 象), 2 chariots (''xe'' 車), 2 cannons (''pháo'' 砲), 2 horses (''mã'' 馬), and 5 soldiers (''tốt'' 卒).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagat.com/class/chess.html Games played with chess cards] "There is a 32 card pack used in Vietnam for the game Tam Cúc (three chrysanthemums). Unusually, this pack has cards in the same numbers as the pieces used for the board game Xiangqi - each colour one general, two each of advisors, elephants, chariots, cannons and horses, and five soldiers."&lt;/ref&gt; The black side general is called ''tướng bà'', and red side is called ''tướng ông''.Red side advisors are called ''sĩ điều''. The rest of the cards are addressed by their name and color. The deck of the tam cúc is similar to [[Xiangqi|Chinese chess pieces]].

==Rules==

===Setting===
The Tam Cuc deck is divided from high to low in rank as follows:

General &gt; intellectuals &gt; elephants &gt; carts &gt; guns &gt; horses &gt; soldiers

The red suit is worth more than black of same rank.

Combinations of the hand:
*Pair
: same color same rank ex: pair of red guns, or pair of black intellectuals.
*Three card combo
: General + intellectual + elephant; or cart + gun + horse. However, intellectual + elephant + cart; or elephant + cart + gun are not a three card combo.
*Four sons
: 4 soldier cards of the same color.
*Five sons
: 5 soldier cards of the same color.

===How to play===
Tam Cuc can be played with 4, 3, or 2 players. When played with three players one red soldier and one black soldier will not be used, or a total of five cards are discarded: the two generals, both of red and black intellectuals, and 1 red soldier and 1 black soldier.
At first one-person will shuffle the deck of card and another will play as the House. The way to become the House is that players will each call out the name of the card general, intellectuals, elephant, cart, gun, horse, and soldier and the card will be deal until the called get the card that they called and become the House. The following house will be establishing the person on the right of the previous House. The House allows dealing the card and goes first. The deck of card is deal out until the end. The house will lay down the cards first and called out for how many card going he be play single card, two cards, or three cards. The following person will lay down the number of card the same as the number being called out face down. When all the players placed down their cards, starting with the house each player will flip their cards up and the one with the highest hand will become the House and the process starts again until end. An exception is that every player allows accept defeated and hides their hand to keep their cards secret. All played cards get collected and discarded as trash.

===Special cases===
If one have five sons (5 soldiers with same color) or four sons (4 soldiers with same color), they show their hand and win automatically and become the House. As there are only four players then there will be no five sons because missing 1 black and 1 red soldier. When the last ground is play, if the House calls a black soldier pair (the lowest hand possible) and if the hand is win then it become pair and more point will be added to the player. Also, when the last ground is play, if the House calls three black soldiers and if the hand is win then it become 3 of a kind and more point will be added to the player. In some area the player allow to exchange their cards in secret face-down to make better to both side of the players. This is called "night walker" (''đi đêm'') .

== "Kalyeserye" plot ==
At the start of this "Kalyeserye" episode, Lola Nidora ([[Wally Bayola]]) announces that she will allow Alden (Alden Richards) and [[Yaya Dub]] (Maine Mendoza) to hold their hands and will apply a no-restrictions policy on their meeting as long as they trust each other for the sake of love. After the announcement, Lola Nidora together with her two other sisters namely Lola Tidora ([[Paolo Ballesteros]]) and Lola Tinidora ([[Jose Manalo]]) reminisce their younger years.  Their younger version were portrayed by [[Pauleen Luna]] (Nidora), [[Patricia Tumulak]] (Tidora) and [[Julia Clarete]] (Tinidora).

Back at the mansion of the three Lolas, Lola Nidora receives a mystery call and the caller says that the Riding in Tandem would be going to ruin the show at their bungalow (the Philippine Arena).  The secret diary is in the hands of the Riding in Tandem.  Meanwhile, Alden is making his way to the bungalow of Lola Nidora.

In the bungalow, Lola Nidora recollects about her past relationships such as Alberto (parody version of [[Albert Einstein]]), Antonio (parody version of [[Antonio Luna]]), Ferdinand (parody version of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]) and even Anselmo, whom Lola Nidora had carried away with him but her mother was not in favor of Anselmo, until she had met Miguel de Explorer, whom Lola Nidora really loves. Lola Nidora continues her story explaining the family tree of the de Explorer clan. Suddenly, DuhRizz arrives and she says that she really loves Alden but hates Yaya Dub but she later apologizes about her mistakes to them. Rihanna enters the scene and she calls her chat mate Harry, but Lola Nidora orders Rihanna to get the juice for her and DuhRizz.  Lola Nidora tells DuhRizz that she can still find her true love, regardless of her social status, her beauty or her education background. Lola Nidora then calls Yaya Dub. Yaya Dub arrives alongside with Bae-by Baste and Yaya Luvs.

Alden finally arrives at the bungalow, bringing a box of roses and a box containing a missing glass slipper, the same slipper that Yaya Dub left after her first "Bulaga pa More! Dabarkads Pa More!" performance last August 12. Alden slowly enters and finally meets Yaya Dub.  Lola Nidora enters the scene and lectures the couple about true love that waits for the right time and then she later proclaims that this is their right time for them.  Then, the couple hugs Lola Nidora.  Both Alden and Yaya Dub deliver their messages together.  Lola Tidora and Lola Tinidora arrive and tell the couple to have their first dance together, but before their dance, Alden puts the missing slipper on the foot of Yaya Dub.  The couple proceeds to their formal dance.

Afterwards, the Riding in Tandem arrives in the scene and Alden chases them to the car park. Suddenly, Frankie Arenolli arrives, wearing an outfit filled with logos of known brands (actual sponsors for the event), while Yaya Dub and Alden runs away.  Frankie delivers a short speech and claims that Yaya Dub should have become his wife and Frankie should be the one for her and not Alden.  As the show almost come to a close, Lola Tidora notices that Lola Nidora is missing.  Lola Nidora and the Rogelios are at the car park, fighting off the Riding In Tandem and Nidora successfully snatches her secret diary from one of the riders.

Some netizens criticized the gown worn by Maine Mendoza during the event and pointed that it was already worn by actress [[Kim Chiu]] on a previous event.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/showbiz/pep/541989/allan-k-appeals-for-sobriety-amid-same-gown-issue-involving-maine-mendoza-and-kim-chiu/story/|title=Allan K appeals for sobriety amid same gown issue involving Maine Mendoza and Kim Chiu|last=Tuazon|first=Nikko|date=October 25, 2015|work=GMA News Online|access-date=November 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Tagalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liz Uy of Stylized Studio who was hired to do [[Wardrobe stylist|stylist]] works for the show made a statement regarding the gown and argued that the producers of ''Eat Bulaga!'', TAPE Inc., purchased the gown from Francis Libiran and she had chosen it to fit the [[Cinderella]]-themed event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2015/10/26/1515042/stylist-liz-uy-speaks-issue-over-maine-mendozas-tamang-panahon-gown|title=Stylist Liz Uy speaks up on issue over Maine Mendoza's 'Tamang Panahon' gown|last=|first=|date=October 26, 2015|work=philstar.com|access-date=November 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Libiran also commented on the issue and said that indeed Chiu wore the gown in a 2013 fashion show but the one that Mendoza wore was a different one although it was the same design as the gown modeled by Chiu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/211063/aldub-fallout-from-ratings-wars-to-gown-wars/|title=AlDub fallout: From ratings wars to gown wars|last=Vergara|first=Alex Y.|date=October 26, 2015|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Viscontisforzatarot.jpg|thumb|right|Three cards from a [[Visconti-Sforza tarot deck]]]]
The '''tarot''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ær|oʊ}}; first known as '''[[trionfi (cards)|trionfi]]''' and later as '''tarocchi''', '''tarock''' and tarot) is a pack of [[playing card]]s, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of [[Europe]] to play games such as Italian [[tarocchini]], [[French tarot]] and [[Austria]]n [[Königrufen]]. Many of these tarot card games are still played today. In the late 18th century, it began to be used in parallel for [[divination]] in the form of [[tarotology]] and [[cartomancy]] and specialist packs were developed for such occult purposes.

Like common playing cards, the tarot has four [[suit (cards)|suits]] (which vary by region: French suits in Northern Europe, Latin suits in Southern Europe, and German suits in Central Europe).  Each suit has 14 cards, ten [[Pip (counting)|pip cards]] numbering from one (or [[Ace]]) to ten and four [[face card]]s ([[King (playing card)|King]], [[Queen (playing card)|Queen]], [[Knight (playing card)|Knight]], and [[Jack (playing card)|Jack/Knave]]).  In addition, the tarot has a separate 21-card [[trump (card games)|trump]] suit and a single card known as [[The Fool (tarot card)|the Fool]].  Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following suit.&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qqm1AAAAIAAJ |title=The game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City |isbn=9780715610145 |author1=Dummett |first1=Michael A. E |last2=Mann |first2=Sylvia |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tarot cards, without occult symbology, are still used throughout much of Europe to play card games. 

In [[English-speaking countries]], where these games are not played, tarot cards are used primarily for [[divination|divinatory]] purposes, usually using specially designed packs.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt; The cards are traced by some occult writers to [[ancient Egypt]] or the [[Kabbalah]] but there is no documented evidence of such origins or of the usage of tarot for divination before the 18th century.&lt;ref name="DummettGame"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word '''[[wikt:tarot|tarot]]''' and German ''Tarock'' derive from the Italian ''tarocchi'', the origin of which is uncertain but ''taroch'' was used as a synonym for foolishness in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Vitali, Andrea. [http://www.letarot.it/page.aspx?id=220 About the etymology of Tarocco] at Le Tarot Cultural Association. Retrieved 4 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitali, Andrea. [http://www.letarot.it/page.aspx?id=264 Taroch - 1494] at Le Tarot Cultural Association. Retrieved 4 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The decks were known exclusively as ''[[trionfi (cards)|trionfi]]'' during the fifteenth century. The new name first appeared in [[Brescia]] around 1502 as ''tarocho''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Entre ''farsa'' et ''barzelletta'': jeux de cartes italiens autours de 1500|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2008|volume=37|issue=2|pages=89-102}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, a new game played with a standard deck but sharing a very similar name ([[triomphe|trionfa]]) was quickly becoming popular. This coincided with the older game being renamed ''tarocchi''.&lt;ref name="DummettGame"/&gt; In modern Italian, the singular term is ''tarocco'', which, as a noun, means a type of [[Blood orange#Tarocco|blood orange]], and, as an adjective, means 'fake, counterfeit'.

==History==
[[File:Tarot-cary-collection-ita-sheet-3s-c1500..jpg|thumb|Milanese tarocchi, c. 1500.]]
Playing cards first entered [[Europe]] in the late 14th century, most likely from [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]], with suits of Batons or Polo sticks (commonly known as Wands by those practicing occult or divinatory tarot), Coins (commonly known as disks, or [[pentacle]]s in occult or divinatory tarot), Swords, and Cups. These suits were very similar to modern tarot divination decks and are still used in traditional [[Italian playing cards|Italian]], [[Spanish playing cards|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] playing card decks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Laycock]] in ''Skeptical—a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7316-5794-2}}, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented tarot packs were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in [[Milan]], [[Ferrara]], [[Florence]] and [[Bologna]] when additional trump cards with allegorical [[illustration]]s were added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called ''carte da trionfi'', triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as [[trionfi (cards)|trionfi]], which became "trumps" in English. The earliest documentation of ''trionfi'' is found in a written statement in the court records of [[Florence]], in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=In Search of Tarot Sources|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2012|volume=41|issue=2|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pratesi, Franco. [http://trionfi.com/giusto-giusti Studies on Giusto Giusti] at trionfi.com. Retrieved 4 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving tarot cards are the 15 or so [[Visconti-Sforza tarot deck]]s painted in the mid-15th century for the rulers of the [[Duchy of Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=25 |title=A Wicked Pack Of Cards|isbn=9780312162948 |author1=Dummett |first1=Michael|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lost tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] and described by Martiano da Tortona probably between 1418 and 1425, since the painter he mentions, [[Michelino Molinari da Besozzo|Michelino da Besozzo]], returned to Milan in 1418, while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a 60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]] and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as "trumps" since in 1449 Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a ''novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus'', or "a new and exquisite kind of triumphs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=Italian Cards - New Discoveries|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1989|volume=18|issue=1, 2|pages=28-32, 33-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the [[Sola Busca tarot|Sola-Busca]] and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.&lt;ref name="DummettGame"/&gt;

In [[Florence]], an expanded deck called ''[[Minchiate]]'' was used. This deck of 97 cards includes [[astrology|astrological]] symbols and the four elements, as well as traditional tarot motifs.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;

Although a Dominican preacher inveighed against the evil inherent in cards (chiefly owing to their use in gambling) in a sermon in the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Steele. A Notice of the Ludus Triumphorum and some Early Italian Card Games; With Some Remarks on the Origin of the Playing Cards." '''Archaeologia,''' vol LVII, 1900: pp 185-200.&lt;/ref&gt; no routine condemnations of tarot were found during its early history.&lt;ref name="DummettGame"/&gt;

Because the earliest tarot cards were hand-painted, the number of the decks produced is thought to have been small. It was only after the invention of the [[printing press]] that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the [[Italian Wars]]. The most important tarot pattern used in these two countries was the [[Tarot of Marseilles]] of Milanese origin.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;

==Tarot gaming decks==
{{Main article|Tarot card games}}
[[File:Joueurs de tarot.JPG|thumb|200px|A French tarot game in session]]
The original purpose of tarot cards was to play games. A very cursory explanation of rules for a tarot-like deck is given in a manuscript by Martiano da Tortona before 1425. Vague descriptions of game play or game terminology follow for the next two centuries until the earliest known complete description of rules for a French variant in 1637.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|last2=McLeod|first2=John|title=A History of Games Played with the Tarot Pack|date=2004|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston|pages=17-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game of tarot has many regional variations. [[Tarocchini]] has survived in Bologna and there are still others played in Piedmont and Sicily, but in Italy the game is generally less popular than elsewhere.

The 18th century saw tarot's greatest revival, during which it became one of the most popular card games in Europe, played everywhere except [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]], the [[Iberian peninsula]], and the [[Rumelia|Ottoman Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parlett|first1=David|title=The Oxford Guide to Card Games|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-214165-1|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[French tarot]] experienced a revival beginning in the 1970s and France has the strongest tarot gaming community. Regional tarot games—often known as ''tarock'', ''tarok'', or ''tarokk'' are widely played in central Europe within the borders of the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]].

===Italian-suited tarot decks===
[[File:Tarot Piedmont 0.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Tarocco Piemontese]]: the Fool.]]
These were the oldest form of tarot deck to be made, being first devised in the 15th century in northern Italy. The so-called occult tarot decks are based on decks of this type. Three decks of this category are still used to play certain games:
* The '''[[Tarocco Piemontese]]''' consists of the four suits of swords, batons, cups and coins, each headed by a king, queen, cavalier and jack, followed by the [[pip cards]] for a total of 78 cards. Trump 20 outranks 21 in most games and the Fool is numbered 0 despite not being a trump.
* The '''[[Swiss 1JJ Tarot]]''' is similar, but replaces the Pope with Jupiter, the Popess with Juno, and the Angel with the Judgement. The trumps rank in numerical order and the Tower is known as the House of God. The cards are not reversible like the Tarocco Piemontese.
* The '''[[Tarocco Bolognese]]''' omits numeral cards two to five in plain suits, leaving it with 62 cards, and has somewhat different trumps, not all of which are numbered and four of which are equal in rank. It has a different graphical design than the two above as it was not derived from the [[Tarot of Marseilles]].

===Italo-Portuguese-suited tarot deck===
The '''[[Tarocco Siciliano]]''' is the only deck to use the so-called Portuguese suit system which uses Spanish pips but intersects them like Italian pips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-12.html Tarocco Siciliano, early form] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]] website. Retrieved 26 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the trumps are different such as the lowest trump, ''Miseria'' (destitution). It omits the Two and Three of coins, and numerals one to four in clubs, swords and cups: it thus has 64 cards but the ace of coins is not used, being the bearer of the former [[stamp tax]]. The cards are quite small and not reversible.[[#cite note-8|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===French-suited tarot decks===
The illustrations of French-suited tarot trumps depart considerably from the older Italian-suited design, abandoning the Renaissance allegorical motifs. With the exception of novelty decks, French-suited tarot cards are almost exclusively used for [[card games]]. The first generation of French-suited tarots depicted scenes of animals on the trumps and were thus called "[[Tiertarock]]" ('Tier' being German for 'animal') appeared around 1740. Around 1800, a greater variety of decks were produced, mostly with [[genre art]] or [[veduta]]. Current French-suited tarot decks come in these patterns:

*The '''''[[Industrie und Glück]]''''' (Industry and Luck) genre art tarock deck of Central Europe uses Roman numerals for the trumps. It is sold with 54 cards; the 5 to 10 of the red suits and the 1 to 6 of the black suits are removed. 
*The '''[[Cego|Adler-Cego]]''' animal tarot is used in Germany's [[Black Forest]] and has 54 cards organized in the same fashion as the ''Industrie und Glück''. Its trumps use Arabic numerals but within centered indices. 
*The '''[[Tarot Nouveau]]''' has 78 cards and is commonly played in France. Its genre art trumps use Arabic numerals in corner indices.

===German-suited tarot decks===
[[German playing cards|German-suited decks]] for [[Bauerntarock]], [[Württemberg Tarock]] and [[Bavarian Tarock]] are different. They are not true tarot/tarock packs, but a [[Bavaria]]n or [[Württemberg]] pattern of the standard German-suited decks with only 36 cards; the [[pip card]]s ranging from 6 to 10, Under Knave (''[[Unter (playing card)|Unter]]''), Over Knave (''[[Ober (playing card)|Ober]]''), King, and Ace. These use [[Ace-Ten games|Ace-Ten ranking]], like [[Klaverjas]], where Ace is the highest followed by 10, King, Ober, Unter, then 9 to 6. The heart suit is the default trump suit.&lt;ref name="DummettGame"/&gt; The Bavarian deck is also used to play [[Schafkopf]] by excluding the Sixes.

[[File:ALLIETTE 1.jpg|thumb|120px|Prototype for Etteilla's tarot (1785).]] 
The earliest evidence of a tarot deck used for cartomancy comes from an anonymous manuscript from around 1750 which documents rudimentary divinatory meanings for the cards of the [[Tarocco Bolognese]].&lt;ref name=Pratesi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=Italian Cards: New Discoveries, no. 9|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1989|volume=17|issue=4|pages=136–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=Tarot Cartomancy in Bologna|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2003|volume=32|issue=2|pages=79-88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularization of esoteric tarot started with [[Antoine Court de Gébelin|Antoine Court]] and [[Etteilla|Jean-Baptiste Alliette]] (Etteilla) in Paris during the 1780s, using the [[Tarot of Marseilles]].&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=K. Frank|title=A Century with the Waite-Smith Tarot (and all the others...)|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2010|volume=38|issue=3|pages=217-222}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[French tarot]] players abandoned the Marseilles tarot in favor of the [[Tarot Nouveau]] around 1900, the Marseilles pattern is now used mostly by cartomancers.

===Occult tarot decks===

[[Etteilla]] was the first to issue a tarot deck specifically designed for occult purposes around 1789. In keeping with the misplaced belief that such cards were derived from [[the Book of Thoth]], Etteilla's tarot contained themes related to [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Jensen" /&gt;

The 78-card tarot deck used by esotericists has two distinct parts:

* The '''[[Major Arcana]]''' (greater secrets), or trump cards, consists of 22 cards without [[Suit (cards)|suits]]: [[The Magician (Tarot card)|The Magician]], [[The High Priestess]], [[The Empress (Tarot card)|The Empress]], [[The Emperor (Tarot card)|The Emperor]], [[The Hierophant]], [[The Lovers]], [[The Chariot (Tarot card)|The Chariot]], [[Strength (Tarot card)|Strength]], [[The Hermit (Tarot card)|The Hermit]], [[Wheel of Fortune (Tarot card)|Wheel of Fortune]], [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]], [[The Hanged Man (tarot card)|The Hanged Man]], [[Death (Tarot card)|Death]], [[Temperance (Tarot card)|Temperance]], [[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]], [[The Tower (Tarot card)|The Tower]], [[The Star (Tarot card)|The Star]], [[The Moon (Tarot card)|The Moon]], [[The Sun (Tarot card)|The Sun]], [[Judgement (Tarot card)|Judgement]], [[The World (Tarot card)|The World]], and [[The Fool (Tarot card)|The Fool]]. Cards from The Magician to The World are numbered in [[Roman numerals]] from I to  XXI, while The Fool is the only unnumbered card, sometimes placed at the beginning of the deck as 0, or at the end as XXII.
* The '''[[Minor Arcana]]''' (lesser secrets) consists of 56 cards, divided into four suits of 14 cards each; ten numbered cards and four court cards. The court cards are the King, Queen, Knight and Page/Jack, in each of the four tarot suits. The traditional Italian tarot suits are [[Suit of swords|swords]], [[Suit of batons|batons]], [[Suit of coins|coins]] and [[Suit of cups|cups]]; in modern occult tarot decks, however, the batons suit is often called wands, rods or staves, while the coins suit is often called pentacles or disks.

The terms "major arcana" and "minor arcana" were first used by [[Jean-Baptiste Pitois]] (also known as Paul Christian) and are never used in relation to Tarot card games. Some decks exist primarily as artwork; and such art decks sometimes contain only the 22 major arcana.  

The three most common decks used in esoteric tarot are the [[Tarot of Marseilles]], the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck]], and the [[Thoth tarot deck]].&lt;ref name="Jensen" /&gt;

He and a small group of people fly to the Indian Ocean after learning that his oil rig has sunk after being taken over by Somalian pirates. The helicopter becomes trapped in a thunderstorm and Sinbad refuses to go back, ignoring the pleas of his pilot. The helicopter crashes into the sea and he is washed ashore, Sinbad later battles a giant crab and meets up with his surviving crew, Gemma and Whitaker as well as Mehrak, the leader of the Somalian pirates, and Atash, the oil tanker's captain and his crew member. Sinbad also encounters Loa, a female warrior living on the island. Loa tells Sinbad that he must fulfill a long-forgotten pledge and become a warrior to save the world from catastrophe from Elmec Ishu, a supernatural force that is angered by the oil spill after Sinbad's rig is sunk. The island suddenly experiences a violent earthquake, and the group then plunges into the sea, the island is actually the back of an enormous but harmless sea creature and they are attacked by a flock of large flying reptiles (called Rocs in the film), they take them back to their nest to be fed to their young. Meanwhile, Simon, the CEO of Sinbad's company, takes over while Sinbad is missing.

The group manage to fight off a Roc and flee their nest, but a crew member is devoured by a young Roc. They flee to a cave, which is home to a club-wielding Cyclops. Whitaker checks out the inside of the cave, but is ultimately killed and possibly eaten by the Cyclops. Sinbad blinds the Cyclops and later trips and impales him by a stalagmite. When night falls, the men are seduced and hypnotized by some Sirens, and are to be eaten by them. Loa and Gemma prepare to kill the Sirens when it is darker, so that they can avoid getting hypnotized by looking into their eyes. But unfortunately, Gemma is hypnotized by a Siren and devoured. Loa kills all of the Sirens as they are preparing to devour the men, and Sinbad finishes off their queen. Later Sinbad and his companions enter a small village, called 'Utopia', where all those who are stranded join. Loa realizes her father is the leader of the 'Utopia' and Sinbad, Mehrak, and Atash are forced to fight each other. Atash is shot by one of them after Mehrak refuses to kill him.

Sinbad tries to convince the people that he knows a way to escape, but one of them says he's lying, Loa kills the man and a fight is started between those who want to join Sinbad and those who want 'Utopia'. Mehrak is injured and fights gallantly but is killed seeing her father get injured. while trying to distract them while Sinbad and Loa escape. Sinbad knows that he must retrieve otherworldly crystals in a mountain, in order to escape the island and lowers himself down, and retrieves the crystal and kills a demon residing in the mountain with explosives. Sinbad and Loa learn that the crystal produces steam when in contacts with water after her father died. They use an old hot-air balloon and use the crystal to power the balloon, and find a ship and call for help, Loa is missing but the ship crew manages to find her. Sinbad and Loa head back to his company and uses his mini submarine to head into the sea to bring the oil rig to surface while Elmec Ishu unleashes his wrath on the city by summoning deadly water spouts, Simon is killed after sabotaging Sinbad's mission. The submarine is confronted by a giant squid, but it does not attack them, the oil rig is successfully raised and Elmec Ishu stops his rampage and appears, and commands the squid to bring the submarine to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theasylum.cc/product.php?id=170 |title=The Asylum &amp;#124; THE 7 ADVENTURES OF SINBAD |publisher=Theasylum.cc |date= |accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Three Card Poker''' is a casino [[table game]] based on [[poker]].

==History==
[[File:Norwegian Dawn casino 3.JPG|thumb|A Three Card Poker table in a casino aboard the ''[[Norwegian Dawn]]'' cruise ship]]

The casino variant of Three Card Poker was first created by Derek Webb in 1994 and patented in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Card Poker|url=http://www.casingdom.com/three-card-poker/|accessdate=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb's goal wasn't to create a version of poker that played with the speed of other table games. It was important to Webb that he got the correct mix of three important factors for any casino game: the game rules were easy to understand, the payouts were large enough to attract players, and the house edge was enough that casino owners would be interested in adopting the game.

Webb established a business called Prime Table Games to market the game in both the United States and United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intellectual Property Office patent entry|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-find-number/patents?csbpub=GB2291360&amp;csbtype=F|accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Casino Association, now known as the National Casino Industry Forum (NCiF) suggested that Webb gain some experience in the US first, since the UK had regulations against such a table game and his application was not strong enough to convince regulators to make significant changes to their rules and regulations for a new game.

The first casino to adopt the game was [[Grand Casino Gulfport]] in Mississippi, after Webb had unsuccessful sales pitches with casino owners in Reno, Las Vegas, and Atlantic City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3CardPoker.com|url=http://www.3cardpoker.com/|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Kingdom gambling regulations were changed to allow the introduction of Three Card Poker in 2002.

Prime Table Games continued marketing Three Card Poker until 1999, when [[Shuffle Master]] acquired the rights to the game outside the British Isles. The sale was prompted by a lawsuit filed that year in US federal court by Progressive Gaming International Corporation (PGIC), the then-owners of [[Caribbean stud poker]], alleging patent infringement; Shuffle Master agreed to defend that litigation as part of the purchase. Subsequently in 2007, Prime Table Games showed in a countersuit that the 1999 PGIC litigation was based on invalid patent claims; PGIC settled for $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/progressive-agrees-to-pay-20-million-to-end-lawsuit/|title=Progressive agrees to pay $20 million to end lawsuit|first=Howard|last=Stutz|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Prime Table Games filed suit against Shuffle Master in 2008 alleging in part that Shuffle Master had undisclosed knowledge that the PGIC claims were invalid prior to the 1999 purchase; it was later settled for over $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/charge-hurts-shuffle-master-earnings/|title=Charge hurts Shuffle Master earnings|first=Howard|last=Stutz|date=January 14, 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Three Card Poker is played as heads-up between the player's hand and the dealer's hand. After all [[ante (poker)|ante]] wagers are placed, three cards are dealt to each player and the dealer. Players have a choice to either fold or continue in the game by placing a "play" wager equal to their ante. Hands are then exposed and wagers resolved.&lt;ref name=SFGate&gt;{{cite web|title=Winning a 3-card poker can be tough|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/gaming/article/Winning-at-3-card-poker-can-be-tough-5717160.php|author= Matt Villano|publisher=SfGate |date=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SlotsDoc|url=http://slotsdoc.com/|date=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dealer's hand must be Queen high or better for the dealer hand to play. If the dealer does not play, then there is no action on play wagers and ante wagers are paid 1 to 1. If the dealer does play, the dealer and player hands are compared. If the player hand loses, both the ante and play wagers are lost. If the player hand wins both the ante and play wagers are paid 1 to 1. If the hands are tied, then there is no action on either wager.&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;

Additional optional bets are offered. The Pair Plus wager is a bet that the player's hand will be a pair or better. The Pair Plus wager loses if the player has less than a pair and wins with a pair or better. The payoff applies regardless of the dealer's hand, as the Pair Plus wager is not in competition against the dealer's hand. Some casinos also offer an Ante Bonus, which is paid on the ante wager for a straight or better. The typical Ante Bonus paytable pays 5 to 1 for a straight flush, 4 to 1 for a three of a kind, and 1 to 1 for a straight. Like the Pair Plus wager, the Ante Bonus pays regardless of whether that hand beats the dealer's hand.&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;

==Variations==
Some venues have added a wager called Prime in United Kingdom casinos and the game is known as Prime Three Card Poker. The Prime wager is optionally placed before cards are dealt and pays on the color of the player cards. If all three cards are the same color the payoff is 3 to 1. However when included with the dealer hand if all six cards are the same color then the payoff is increased to 4 to 1.

Another variation is "six card bonus", in which the players are given a payout based on the best five-card poker hand that can be made using any combination of the player's three cards and the dealer's three cards. Payoff ranges from 5 to 1 for three of a kind to 1000 to 1 for royal flush. Payoffs are paid regardless of whether any other bets pay.

The '''Taitr Academy of Goa''' is a government body established by the [[Government of Goa]] in 2009 during the tenure of [[Digambar Kamat]] as the [[Chief Minister of Goa]]. The Academy was inaugurated on 16 January 2009 in [[Margao]] at the hands of the [[tiatr]] artist ''Master'' Jose Francisco Vaz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nt Network |url=http://www.navhindtimes.com/story.php?story=2009021312 |title=Eminent Tiatrist Master Vaz to open Tiatr Academy on Feb 16: Navhindtimes.com, Goa |publisher=Navhindtimes.com |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy's aim is to foster and develop [[Tiatr]] and its dances, music, songs and literature; especially the Konkani Literature in Roman script as well as through them the cultural unity of [[Goa]] as well as [[India]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiatracademygoa.com/Constitution%20of%20Tiatr%20Academy%20of%20Goa.html |title=Constitution - Aims, Activities &amp; Objectives of the Tiatr (Konkani Drama Academy) of Goa, TAG |publisher=Tiatracademygoa.com |date=2009-02-02 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The [[tiatr]] has a rich history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sahapedia.org/oxem-ghoddlem |title=Oxem Ghoddlem |publisher=Sahapedia |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 125 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tiatr to complete 125 years since inception |url=http://www.navhindtimes.in/tiatr-to-complete-125-years-since-inception/ |title=Tiatr to complete 125 years since inception &amp;#124; The Navhind Times |publisher=Navhindtimes.in |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an important form of [[theatre]] in the [[Konkani language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/the-medium-is-the-message-the-magic-of-tiatr-goas-traditional-konkani-theatre-form/ |title=The medium is the message: The magic of Tiatr, Goa’s traditional Konkani theatre form |publisher=The Indian Express |date=2014-10-05 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[tiatr]] was performed in 1892 in [[Bombay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bhavya Dore |url=https://scroll.in/article/805490/tiatr-goas-best-loved-theatre-form-is-getting-an-english-language-twist-from-a-veteran-director |title=Tiatr, Goa’s best-loved theatre form, is getting an English-language twist from a veteran director |publisher=Scroll.in |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
The upper body of the robot is controlled by the operator through the operator panel. The upper part of the operator is located on the chest of the "robot", where a unidirectional transparent glass window is available for the operator to observe the situation ahead. The "robot" has a shoulder, arm and head that is higher than the actual performer's head (up to 8 feet in total). The part above the "robot" chest is a remote control mechanism. The operator in the body can manipulate the upper part of the "robot" through the control panel in the chest of the body to complete various instructions. The actions and sounds are pre-programmed and automatically triggered when the corresponding actions and commands are made. The robot can identify the interactive objects through the AI and automatically retrieve interactive interactive samples.

The lower body of the Titan robot is led by the operator. The active joint on the buttocks is wider than the actual actor. The purpose is to make the movement more mechanical. It explains why the Titan is so flexible and smooth, so that it is the most advanced in the industry. Robotic walking mechanisms (such as Petman in Boston, USA and Aisimo in Honda, Japan) are not comparable in terms of motion accuracy.

In addition, the body can also be controlled by an outside assistant, especially when the actor encounters a potential crisis that is unpredictable, the assistant who observes in the distance is taken over by the remote control. (For example, if a child appears in a visual blind zone, the assistant can take over the manipulation to avoid harming the surrounding people)
