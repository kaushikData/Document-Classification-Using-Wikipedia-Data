==Social predictions==

* According to the UN Population Bureau, life expectancy in 2200 will be around 100 for developed countries and the world population will be about 11 billion.

==Calendric predictions==
* On March 14, 2100 (which will be February 29, 2100 in the Julian calendar), the difference between the [[Julian calendar]] and the [[Gregorian calendar]] reaches 14 days.

'''Abydenus''' ({{lang-grc|Αβυδηνός}}) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]], and the author of a ''History of the Chaldeans and Assyrians'', of which some fragments are preserved by [[Eusebius]] in his ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'', and by [[Cyril of Alexandria]] in his work against [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]].  Several other fragments are preserved by [[George Syncellus|Syncellus]].  These were particularly valuable for chronology. An important fragment, which clears up some difficulties in Assyrian history, has been discovered in the Armenian translation of the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon]]'' of Eusebius.

It is uncertain when he lived, but he is to be distinguished from [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus Abydenus]], who lived in the time of [[Alexander the Great]]; for this Abydenus mentions [[Berossus|Berosus]], who lived at a later period. He probably wrote around 200 BC and, as Cyril states, in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic dialect]].

'''Ahmad ibn Hamdun ibn al Hajj''' or '''Abu-l-Abbas Ahmad ibn Mohammed ibn Hamdun Ibn al-Hajj''' (died 1898) was a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] physician and scholar&lt;ref&gt;[[Évariste Lévi-Provençal]], ''Les Historiens des Chorfa'' (1922), pp. 368-71&lt;/ref&gt; who composed a history of the [[Alaouite dynasty]] in 15 volumes by order of [[Hassan I of Morocco|Moulay Hasan I]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Ibn al-Hajj, ''Ad-Dur al-Muntakhab al-Mustahsan fi Ba'd Ma'athir Amir al-Mu'minin Mawlana al-Hasan'', Rabat, Bibliothèque Royale&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a treatise titled "Addourat ettibbya" (pearls of medicine), in which he gave, for the first time in the history of Morocco, a technical overview of medical treatments.&lt;ref&gt;H.P.J.

The {{nihongo|'''Araya Site'''|荒屋遺跡|Araya Iseki}} is a late [[Japanese Paleolithic]] settlement located in the former town of [[Kawaguchi, Niigata|Kawaguchi]] in what is now part of the city of [[Nagaoka, Niigata]] in the [[Hokuriku region]] of [[Japan]]. It was found to contain one of the largest number of stone tools of any site thus far discovered in Japan. The site was designated a [[Monuments of Japan|National Historic Site of Japan]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/164611 |title=荒屋遺跡|trans-title= Araya Iseki|language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The site is located on a [[river terrace]] near the confluence of the [[Shinano River]] and the Uono River, approximately one kilometer south of [[Echigo-Kawaguchi Station]]. Four excavations have been conducted so far. Excavated materials are stored in [[Meiji University]] (1st survey), [[Tohoku University]] (2nd and 3rd surveys), the Nagaoka City Board of Education (4th survey), and at [[Tokyo National Museum]]. The site contains the ruins of a several villages from approximately 17,000 years ago. The ruins overlap, indicating that a semi-nomadic population repeatedly returned to this site over many centuries. 

Excavated artefacts included over 6,000 fine grained blades, 1,000 sculptured sword stones and 9,000 sculpted sword spalls, and over 100,000 arrow and spear points. The base materials were mostly hard shale, which is common in along the [[Sea of Japan]] coastal areas. It was estimated that the bone, horn and leather products were also actively produced at the site, to make completed spears and arrows, and as such material were also needed as part of the secondary processing to produce very thin sharpened blades. The style of tools found display both [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] traits, and the style of the stone swords was similar to what has been found widely distributed across [[Siberia]] and into [[Alaska]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5378">The '''autochthonous theory about the origin of the Bulgarians''' is [[fringe theory|an alternative]] to the official Bulgarian historiography, which dates chronologically from the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandar Nikolov, The Phenomenon of “Parahistory” in Post-Communist Bulgaria, Old Theories and New Myths on Proto-Bulgarians, in  Quest for a Suitable Past, Myths and Memory in Central and Eastern Europe with Claudia Florentina Dobre and Cristian Emilian Ghiţă as ed. Central European University Press, 2018, {{ISBN|9633861365}}, pp. 135-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergence and development ==
[[Georgi Rakovski]], one of the first Bulgarian national activists, coined in 1860s the theory, to that the Bulgarians were an autochthonous population on the Balkans, known to the ancient writers as [[Thracians]].&lt;ref&gt;Dessislava Lilova, The homeland as terra incognita: geography and Bulgarian national identity, 1830s-1870s in The Balkans as Europe, 1821-1914, Volume 21 of Rochester studies in East and Central Europe with Timothy Snyder and Katherine Younger as ed., Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2018, {{ISBN|1580469159}},  pp. 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This historiographical concept was exposed scientific for the first time in 1910 in the book "The Origin of the Bulgarians and the beginning of the Bulgarian state and the Bulgarian church" by [[Gancho Tzenov]]. Fundamental tenet of the autochthonous theory is that the [[Bulgars]], that were actually [[Bulgarians]] are not settlers in Europe, but people who have inhabited the [[Balkans]] since antiquity. That is, they as a people, although had different names in different historical epochs, are actually direct descendants of indigenous tribes as [[Thracians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Macedones]], [[Getae]] etc., who lived on the same territory.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Gorny, War on Paper? Physical Anthropology in the Service of States and Nations, p. 163, in Legacies of Violence: Eastern Europe’s First World War, Volume 3 Europas Osten im 20. Jahrhundert with Jochen Böhler, Wlodzimierz Borodziej and Joachim von Puttkamer as ed. Walter de Gruyter, 2014, {{ISBN|9783486857566}}, pp. 131-168.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This theory, though denied and rejected as a [[Pseudohistory|marginal one]], has its supporters and theorists in its various variations today as Georgi Rakovski and Gancho Tsenov have been rediscovered. Their theories have been updated as an alternative to the accepted [[Migration Period|migration theories]].  One of them establishes a complete continuity between ancient Balkan populations and modern Bulgarians. Thracians  are considered simply ancestors of the modern Bulgarians and their continuity is projected to the prehistoric times. Generally, proponents of ''Thracomania'' assume that the Thracians and Bulgarians are the same people, and that therefore the descended from the Thracians must be in fact Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Marinov and Nicolas Zorzin, Thracology and Nationalism in Bulgaria. Deconstructing Contemporaneous Historical and Archaeological Representations. EX NOVO. Journal of Archaeology, Volume 2, December 2017, ISSN 2531-8810, pp. 85-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In another version of these hypotheses it is assumed that the Bulgars, who were Thracians, after a long journey from the Balkans to [[Central Asia]] in [[classical Antiquity]], have returned to their native homeland in the [[early Middle ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Tchavdar Marinov, "Ancient Thrace in the Modern Imagination: Ideological Aspects of the Construction of Thracian Studies in Southeast Europe (Romania, Greece, Bulgaria)" pp. 80, 111, in Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Three: Shared Pasts, Disputed Legacies, Balkan Studies Library with Roumen Daskalov, Alexander Vezenkov as ed. BRILL, 2015, {{ISBN|9004290362}}, pp. 10-118.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some modern Bulgarian researchers have attempted to prove the [[deception]], that "[[Thracian language#Inscriptions|Ezerovo ring]]" inscription, written with [[Greek letters]] in [[Thracian language]],&lt;ref&gt;Julia Valeva, Emil Nankov and Denver Graninger, Companion to Ancient Thrace, Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World: Literature and Culture, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2015, {{ISBN|1444351044}}, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; is in fact in Slavic language, close to modern Bulgarian and that was not the Greek alphabet, but the original script of the Ancient Thracians.&lt;ref&gt;Николай Тодоров, доктор по филология, За бог Зевс – бог Живе, Орфей, пръстена от Езерово и античната българска книжнина.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2000s the [[Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], has promoted  the similar idea that a "[[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egiptian]]" script on [[Rosetta stone]] is written in Slavic language close to modern [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and that was the language of the [[Ancient Macedonians]].&lt;ref&gt;Tome Boshevski, Aristotel Tentov, Tracing the script of the Ancient Macedonians. This paper presents the results of research realized within the project "Deciphering the Middle Text of the Rosetta Stone", supported by Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 2003–2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Ginsberg''' (born 1947) is a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.c-span.org/video/?419699-1/qa-benjamin-ginsberg Interview] on January 23, 2017 on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Q &amp; A (U.S. talk show)|Q &amp; A]]''. Ginsberg said he was libertarian because his [[Wikipedia]] biography said he was libertarian.&lt;/ref&gt; [[political scientist]] and professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]&lt;ref name=tws29oct01/&gt; who is notable for his criticism of American politics, in which he says that [[citizens]] have become "marginalized as political actors"&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; and [[political parties]] weakened&lt;ref name=tws29oct04/&gt; while state power has grown.&lt;ref name=tws29oct01/&gt;  His assessment of the futility of voting, along with his notion that the public has an illusion of control over government, has caused controversy, and sometimes his explanations have been criticized. He is a co-author, along with Matthew Crenson, of ''Downsizing Democracy,'' 2004, which received critical attention in mainstream newspapers.

==Biography==
At the [[University of Chicago]] studying [[political science]], Ginsberg earned a bachelor's degree in 1968, a master's degree in 1970, and a doctorate in 1973.&lt;ref name=tws29oct13&gt;{{cite news

===''Downsizing Democracy''===
This 2002 book received serious critical attention from reviewers in major newspapers who explained, and criticized, the analysis of Ginsberg and co-author Matthew Crenson.
* A reviewer from the ''[[Associated Press]]'' elaborated that the authors commented on dwindling civic participation in America.&lt;ref name=tws29oct09/&gt; A newspaper chronicled a pattern of reduced interest in civic groups, using diminished [[Lions Club]] attendance from the 1970s to 2004, as an example of the "decline of mass political participation."&lt;ref name=tws29oct09/&gt; Ginsberg and Crenson argue that civic decline is "not simply a consequence of the decay of civil society brought on by [[television|TV]], [[suburbanization]] and busy lives;"&lt;ref name=tws29oct09/&gt; rather, government [[regulation|regulatory commissions]], which were supposed to have served as watchdogs on special interests, have been taken over by those interests.&lt;ref name=tws29oct09/&gt; As a result, "Citizens became less vigilant and involved, and interests like the [[bank]]s and [[railroads]] came to control the very commissions that were supposed to work on behalf of the public good."&lt;ref name=tws29oct09/&gt; Ginsberg criticizes "statutes and judicial rulings" for making advocacy by litigation commonplace, and effectively removing many issues from the political arena.&lt;ref name=tws29oct09&gt;{{cite news

* A ''[[Washington Post]]'' reviewer discussed how Ginsberg and Crenson charted the declining importance of [[citizenship|citizens]] to political and public life in the United States.&lt;ref name=tws29oct10/&gt; People are better described as [[consumer]]s, not [[citizens]].&lt;ref name=tws29oct10/&gt; Americans no longer embrace civic responsibility.&lt;ref name=tws29oct10/&gt; Many people don't bother to vote, according to one report.&lt;ref name=tws29oct10/&gt; The authors argue that the public has ''chosen'' to stay aloof from government which it sees as "another service provider."&lt;ref name=tws29oct10/&gt; Many factors are blamed for causing this shift, including fewer patronage jobs.&lt;ref name=tws29oct10/&gt; Candidates use [[public opinion polls|polls]] to focus on the dwindling number of persons who show up to vote.&lt;ref name=tws29oct10/&gt; Increasing court involvement is blamed, as well, for diminishing the role of public sentiment. The authors suggest that the 1960s [[civil rights]] movement has morphed into a litigation struggle about rights and a "middle class" prerogative.&lt;ref name=tws29oct10/&gt; Reviewer Kerry Lauerman suggested Ginsberg and Crenson "overstate on occasion," such as characterizing the issues of [[AIDS]], [[breast cancer]], and [[gun violence]] as "the causes of the comfortable."&lt;ref name=tws29oct10/&gt; The reviewer criticized the writing style as sometimes "turgid" but concluded overall that the analysis was "thoughtful and useful", but needed more analysis of the role of the [[News media|media]].&lt;ref name=tws29oct10&gt;{{cite news

* A review in the ''[[Independent Review]]'', a quarterly academic journal, found the writing style to be "well documented" and "analytical," which exposed the "thoroughly corrosive impact of beltway politics on democratic processes and citizen power."&lt;ref name=tws29oct12&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggest that citizens, who used to be the "backbone of the western state," are no longer relevant.&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; While government has grown, influential citizens have been reduced to recipients of government services and "marginalized as political actors."&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; Government can raise an army and collect taxes without widespread public support; the withholding tax has made the voluntary component of tax paying less important; a professional military limits the need for citizen soldiers; [[special interests]] provide [[bureaucrats]] with a substitute for public support.&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; The authors blame, in part, [[Progressive Era]] reforms such as [[primaries]] and recalls and [[referendums]] as weakening the parties' ability to mobilize voters.&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; Neither party has much enthusiasm for mobilizing more voters.&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; Group conflict dominates, and government is little more than a "broker for competing interests."&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; Inside-the-Beltway regulatory agencies have a huge advantage over colleagues elsewhere.&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; Ginsberg and Crenson think that increased litigation, caused by lowering the requirements for class-action lawsuits, works to the benefit of [[special interests]] who can cause changes beneficial to them without having to energize apathetic voters.&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; The reviewer writes: "the authors trace the [[civil rights]], consumer, and [[Environmentalism|environmental movements]] from their beginnings as popularly based struggles to the narrow group causes they have become today."&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; The reviewer suggested that the authors have "acuity" but neglected to consider that "big government itself" may be the problem.&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; The reviewer criticized the argument as having "fallen short" in some respects by focusing on non-elected public officials skilled at channeling power to special interests.&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; The reviewer thinks elected officials still have incentives to mobilize wider publics and to act responsibly.&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt; But the reviewer concluded that American government might become "a Frankenstein's monster of exceptionally powerful officialdom with neither defined goals nor clear responsibility to the American public."&lt;ref name=tws29oct12/&gt;

===''The Captive Public''===
* A reviewer from ''[[The New York Times]]'' evaluated Ginsberg's ''The Captive Public: How Mass Opinion Promotes State Power'' 1986. Ginsberg argued that people think they're in control since they vote and answer [[public opinion polls]], but he argues that such control is illusory.&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; He thinks government used tactics such as extending rights of modern [[citizenship]] to diverse new groups, such as minorities and women, as well as encouraging [[voting]] as an alternative to more dangerous unwanted protests, such as [[strike action|striking]] or [[rioting]], to tame a wary public.&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; "To vote meant not to strike or riot," and the state preferred citizens to vote rather than mount more serious challenges to its power such as [[lawsuits]], [[protests]], [[union organizer|organizing]], [[parliamentary procedure]], or [[lobbying]].&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; Schools taught children the benefits of voting with such repetition until it became a "tenacious myth of mass control," in his view.&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; Since elections happen periodically, they limit citizen participation in politics to the selection of leaders and keep people away from policy formation.&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; Ginsberg sees public opinion polling as a "subtle instrument of power" since it renders opinions "less dangerous, less disruptive, more permissive, and, perhaps, more amenable to governmental control."&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; He sees policy based not on mass opinion but on managing mass opinion, a kind of giant [[public relations]] project.&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; Reviewer Mark Crispin Miller found Ginsberg's analysis compelling but "a bit too careful to do justice to the complex advertising mechanism that has swallowed up our politics," and found his focus "too narrow", "too simple", with a "libertarian bias."&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; He criticizes Ginsberg's terms as "too crude" such as using "the state" to describe regulatory agencies, and for equating agencies such as the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] with [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]].&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; Miller criticized Ginsberg for ignoring the "subtle and extensive interrelationships" between government, corporations, advertising agencies and the mass media.&lt;ref name=tws29oct07/&gt; Miller thinks Ginsberg underestimated the public, and "has translated his fellow citizens into a featureless manipulated mass, without fears or desires worth taking seriously."&lt;ref name=tws29oct07&gt;{{cite news

===Citizenship, political parties, and polling===
Ginsberg has criticized the Washington political climate as "toxic", characterized by a "cycle of attack and counterattack" in which minor indiscretions are used as political weapons.&lt;ref name=tws29oct08/&gt; Ginsberg sees this as a "structural" problem.&lt;ref name=tws29oct08&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ginsberg sees voting as a passive and meaningless act which gives the illusion of public control over government, he sometimes criticizes both political parties as having a "resistance" to sincerely working towards increased voter participation.&lt;ref name=tws29oct11/&gt; One newspaper reporter, writing about low [[voter turnout]] in 1998, suggested there was a "deep-rooted resistance within both [[political parties|parties]] to expanding the national electorate," and quoted Ginsberg as saying "Politicians who have risen to power in a low-turnout political environment have little to gain and much to fear from an expanded electorate."&lt;ref name=tws29oct11/&gt; Ginsberg added when officeholders talk about "getting out the vote," they generally mean their own voters, not non-participants.&lt;ref name=tws29oct11&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg argued that [[citizenship]] has been undermined by a move to a voluntary military. He believes citizen participation in the military is good since it strengthens patriotism, which means "sacrifice and a willingness to die for one's country."&lt;ref name=tws29oct02/&gt; But the switch to a voluntary military eliminates "a powerful [[patriotism|patriotic]] framework" since "instead of a disgruntled army of citizen soldiers, the military seems to consist of professional soldiers and private contractors."&lt;ref name=tws29oct02/&gt; Ginsberg suggested that the "government learned the lessons of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and has found ways to insulate the use of military force" from society.&lt;ref name=tws29oct02&gt;{{cite news

Ginsberg has commented on campaign strategies; for example, he suggested that a photo of young [[Bill Clinton]] shaking the hand of President [[John F.

===The effect of administrative bloat on universities===
Ginsberg has been an outspoken critic of the expansion in the number and pay of non-teaching university administrators on campuses throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters (2011) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; As these administrators now outnumber faculty in every university in the U.S., he points out that this is the fundamental reason for rapid tuition increases despite the fact that the faculty to student ratio has remained nearly unchanged and faculty salaries generally track inflation. There is general consensus that Ginsberg's observations are correct with some studies showing that administrators not qualified to be assistant professors in their own discipline are hired to oversee faculty  at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13583883.2016.1181198&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions have insighted rage in some faculty,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/the-fall-of-the-faculty-the-rise-of-the-all-administrative-university-and-why-it-matters/418285.article&lt;/ref&gt; yet little has changed at university campuses since the publication of Ginsberg's book. Ginsberg places the blame not only on administrators but also on faculty for seceding their universities to inept administrators. Even critics have said, "Ginsberg rightly points out that numbers of administrators and professional staffers have grown far more quickly than numbers of faculty, pushing up the costs that students and their families pay without enhancing the academic side of their experience."

'''Blanche Athena Clough''' was a British [[classicist]] who was the Principal of [[Newnham College]] (1920-1923). She was the secretary to her aunt, [[Anne Clough]], Principal of [[Newnham College]], and remained at the College as an administrator after her aunt's death in 1892. Clough wrote a memoir of her aunt, which was published in 1903. She was particularly involved in assisting [[Katharine Stephen]] in work towards the Royal Charter and Statutes granted in 1917 whereby [[Newnham College]] became the first women’s College to be a self-governing academic community.

==Biography==
Clough came up to [[Newnham College]] in 1884 to read Classics. She remained as secretary to her aunt, [[Anne Clough]] and then as an administrator in the college. Clough turned down the opportunity to become Principal in 1911 but finally took the role in 1920. During her time as Principal (1920-1923), Clough fought to have women admitted to full membership of [[Cambridge University]].

'''Christopher Fyfe''' (9 November 1920 – 26 August 2008) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] historian most noted for his work on [[Sierra Leone]] in West Africa.

==Biography==
Christopher Hamilton Fyfe was born in England in 1920 to a family of Scottish ancestry. His father moved to [[Ontario]], Canada, where he became principal of [[Queen's University]]. The family subsequently moved to [[Aberdeen]], where his father served a similar role at [[Aberdeen University]].&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/obituaries/Christopher-Fyfe.4497685.jp "Christopher Fyfe – Pioneer of African history" (obituary)], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 16 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Fyfe graduated from [[Gordonstoun School]] and entered [[University College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="hargreaves"&gt;John Hargreaves, [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/28/sierraleone "Christopher Fyfe – Historian whose work sparked a cultural revival in Sierra Leone" (obituary)], ''The Guardian'', 28 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His studies were interrupted by a spell in the [[British Army|Army]] during [[World War II]] as a [[infantry support weapon|gunner]]. After graduating from college, he became a school teacher in [[Düsseldorf]], West Germany.

In 1950 Fyfe was invited by his brother-in-law, who was with the colonial secretariat in [[Freetown]], to organise the Sierra Leonean archives.&lt;ref name="hargreaves"/&gt; After two years as the government archivist, preserving and classifying precious documents, and teaching assistants, he returned to England. There he lived first in London, then [[Bristol]] and [[Belfast]].

Fyfe spent ten years working on his seminal ''History of Sierra Leone'' (1962).&lt;ref name="hargreaves"/&gt; He modelled his 852-page text on [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', writing it as a single block of text. When the publisher demanded chapters, Fyfe inserted numbered breaks.

In his masterwork, Fyfe explored the history of the Creole ([[Krio people]]) of Sierra Leone, celebrating their role as "the unrecognised vehicle by which not only British rule but trade, education, and Christianity, were conveyed to west Africa".&lt;ref name="hargreaves"/&gt; His work stimulated scholars from Sierra Leone, who studied the Creoles specifically. They later adopted a new identity as the Krio people, marking their sense of ethnicity.&lt;ref name="hargreaves"/&gt;

Following the publication of his book, Fyfe took up a lectureship at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1962, at the newly founded Centre of African Studies. He became a reader in 1964, retaining this position until his retirement in 1991. The bicentenary of Freetown was celebrated in 1987 with an international, interdisciplinary conference, at which Fyfe was honoured as a father of the Krio cultural revival.&lt;ref name="hargreaves"/&gt;

He edited the ''[[Journal of African History]]'' and wrote numerous reviews of new books in the field. He regularly revised his lectures in light of the latest trends in historical research. He published a biography of [[James Africanus Horton]], the first African graduate of the University of Edinburgh; a collection of letters written by freedmen who settled in Sierra Leone; and edited works with other historians.

Fyfe produced a shorter history of Sierra Leone, which was used as a school text book in Sierra Leone. He was a mentor to many younger researchers of Sierra Leone. Some became key figures in the intellectual establishment of [[Freetown]]. Some became at odds with various governments and had to go into exile.&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt;

Fyfe was active in the arts scene in [[Edinburgh]]. He helped preserve Old Town from motorway development that would have cut through the historic architecture. He died in London in 2008, aged 87.&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt;

'''Ebenezer Mission''' station was established near [[Lake Hindmarsh]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] (near [[Jeparit, Victoria|Jeparit]]) in 1859 by the [[Moravian Church]] on the land of the [[Wergaia|Wotjobaluk]]. The first missionaries were two Germans, Reverend [[Friedrich Hagenauer]] and Reverend F.W. Spieseke (c. 1821–1877)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article199838651 |title=The Ebenezer Mission Station. |newspaper=[[The Ballarat Star]] |volume=XXII, |issue=160 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=7 July 1877 |accessdate=5 August 2017 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1861 the Victorian Colonial Government gazetted {{convert|1897|acre|km2}} as a reserve for the Ebenezer Mission Station. The mission was established a few years after the failure of the Moravian [[Lake Boga mission]] in [[Wemba-Wemba]] territory.

Horatio Cockburn Ellerman, an early settler who established Antwerp Station, suggested the site where the mission station was established rather than the three sites suggested by the Government. The site selected was known as ''Banji bunag'' and had traditional meaning for the  Wotjobaluk being a [[corroboree]] ground according to elder [[William John Kennedy|Uncle Jack Kennedy]], and also contained the grave for an aboriginal woman shot dead, the mother of [[William Wimmera]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kenny, pg 134-145, ''The Lamb Enters the Dreaming - Nathaniel Pepper and the Ruptured World'', Scribe Publications, Melbourne, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-921215-16-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark_1995"&gt;Ian D. Clark, pp177-183, ''Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803-1859'', Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-85575-281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main aim of the [[Mission (station)|mission]] was to 'civilise' and Christianise the Aboriginal inhabitants of the area. In 1860, the first convert to [[Christianity]], [[Nathanael Pepper]], was baptised.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kenny, ''The Lamb Enters the Dreaming - Nathaniel Pepper and the Ruptured World'', Scribe Publications, Melbourne, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-921215-16-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanaustralia.com/e/ebenezer.htm Ebenezer Mission] at German Australia&lt;/ref&gt; Rations were given to residents on the condition that they attended church services and school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/missionvoices/ebenezer/mission_history/default.htm Ebenezer Mission History]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609174810/http://abc.net.au/missionvoices/ebenezer/mission_history/default.htm |date=2007-06-09 }} at ABC Mission Voices&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Half-caste act|1886 Act to Provide for the Protection and Management of the Aboriginal Natives of Victoria]] which forced half caste aborigines off missions, by 1892 the number of residents at Ebenezer Mission Station dropped to only 30 people.

In 1902 the State Government of Victoria decided to close the Ebenezer Mission due to low numbers. The mission closed in 1904, and most of the land was handed back to the Victorian Lands Department and made available for selection in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article227773071 |title=The Ebenezer Mission Station. |newspaper=[[The Bendigo Independent]] |issue=10782 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=13 February 1905 |accessdate=5 August 2017 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}} &lt;/ref&gt; In the following twenty years many Wergaia people were forcibly moved to [[Lake Tyers Mission]] in Gippsland under police escort, along with closure of all rations to Ebenezer Mission and seizure of children. Despite these measures, some Wergaia families avoided relocation and remained on their ancestral lands.&lt;ref name="Clark_1995" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">'''Edward Grimeston''' (died 1640) was an English [[sergeant-at-arms]] and one of the most active translators of his day. 

==Life==
He was sworn in as sergeant-at-arms to assist the Speaker in the [[Parliament of England]] on 17 March 1609/10.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, “Edward Grimeston, the Translator,” p. 587–9.&lt;/ref&gt; He married a daughter of Armiger Strettly.&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;Boas, “Edward Grimeston, Translator and Sergeant-at-Arms,” p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a son, Edward, and Sir [[Sir Harbottle Grimston, 1st Baronet|Harbottle Grimston]] was his nephew. He was buried in [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]], on 14 December 1640.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

[[Image:HistorieFranceTP2.jpg|thumb|256px|Titlepage of Edward Grimeston's ''A Generall Historie of France'', 1624.]]

==Works==
Edward Grimestone published several large and influential histories, dedicating them to Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], and [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk]]. [[George Eld]] printed and published Grimestone's ''A General Inventory of the History of France'' (1607), and in conjunction with stationers Adam Islip, M. Flesher, and [[William Stansby]], Grimestone's ''A General History of the Netherlands'' (A. Islip and G. Eld, 1609), ''The General History of Spain'' (A. Islip and G. Eld, 1612), ''The General History of the Magnificent State of Venice'' (G. Eld and W. Stansby, 1612), and ''A General History of France'' (G. Eld and M. Flesher, 1624).

Grimestone's histories were used for source material by several well-known seventeenth-century playwrights. ''The General History of Spain'' ([[1612 in literature|1612]]) was likely the source for [[Philip Massinger]]'s ''[[Believe as You List]]'', and ''A General Inventory of the History of France'' ([[1607 in literature|1607]]) was the primary source for [[George Chapman]]'s ''[[Bussy D'Ambois]]'', ''[[The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois]]'', and ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron]]''.&lt;ref name="Boas" /&gt;

Grimestone also published ''The Honest Man, or The Art to Please in Court'' (1632), a translation of a French courtly conduct manual by Nicolas Faret, ''L’Honneste Homme. Ov l’Art de plaire a la court'' (1630). ''The Honest Man'' offers advice to the would-be courtier or gentleman along the lines of [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (''Il libro del Cortegiano'', 1528).&lt;ref&gt;See Faret, ''The Honest Man, or The Art to Please in Court'', 1632.&lt;/ref&gt; Grimestone dedicated the book to Richard Hubert, the courtier and groom porter to [[Charles I of England]].&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7378">The [[Ancient history|ancient world]] lacked standardized practices of [[forensic science]], which aided criminals in escaping punishment. Criminal investigations and trials relied on [[oath]]s, [[Confession (law)|confession]]s and witness [[testimony]].&lt;ref name="Schafer 40"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schafer|first=Elizabeth D.|title=Forensic Science|chapter=Ancient science and forensics|editor=Ayn Embar-seddon, Allan D. Pass (eds.)|publisher=Salem Press|year=2008|pages=40|isbn=978-1-58765-423-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a time when a distinction between [[science]] and such phenomena as [[religion]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[superstition]] had not yet been made, some civilizations used practices such as the [[trial by ordeal]] to determine guilt or innocence.

However, ancient sources contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow the concepts of forensic science that were made possible by the [[scientific revolution]] centuries later. Predating the [[scientific method]], these techniques were not based on a scientific understanding of the world in the modern sense, but rather on common sense and practical experience.&lt;ref name="Schafer 40" /&gt;

On the other hand, the development of an accurate way of measuring density by [[Archimedes]] marks a watershed in the use of objective methods, not just in forensics but also in physical science.

==Physical methods==
[[File:Archimedes water balance.gif|thumb|right|180px|Archimedes may have used his principle of buoyancy to determine whether the golden crown was less [[density|dense]] than solid gold.]]
The [[Archimedes#Discoveries and inventions|"Eureka" legend]] told of [[Archimedes]] (287–212 BC), where the philosopher proved that a crown was not solid gold by comparing measurements of its displacement of water and its weight, is a direct forerunner of modern [[forensic engineering]] techniques.&lt;ref name="Schafer 41"&gt;Schafer, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The case marks a critical point when quantitative methods become vital, as well as establishing the concepts of [[density]], [[buoyancy]], [[force]] and [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. 

The first recorded example of [[forensic dentistry]] may be the account of [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], the Roman emperor [[Nero]]'s mother, who sent for the head of her enemy [[Lollia Paulina]] to verify her death. While the face was distorted beyond recognition, Agrippina could recognize a distinctively colored front tooth that she had previously noticed in Lollia’s mouth.&lt;ref name="Schafer 41" /&gt;

The [[Old Testament]] story of the ''[[shibboleth]]'', in which the victorious Gileadites identified (and killed) the vanquished Ephraimites because they could not properly pronounce the word "shibboleth", foreshadows modern [[voice identification]] techniques.&lt;ref name="Schafer 40" /&gt;

==Lie detection==
In legal cultures where evidence consisted almost exclusively of oaths and testimony, finding out who told the truth was of great importance. While [[trial by ordeal]] was often used, some ancient lie detection techniques relied solely on the observation of the suspects' behavior. 

In [[History of India|ancient India]] around 500 BC, priests tested suspected thieves by putting them into dark tents with donkeys whose tails were coated in soot. The suspects were told that the donkeys would bray if touched by thieves, and that the suspects should now pull the animals' tails. Those who left the tent with clean hands (indicating that they had not dared to touch the animals for fear of being found out as thieves by the donkeys' braying) were considered guilty.&lt;ref name="Schafer 41" /&gt;

Another technique employed in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] bore resemblance to modern [[polygraph]] tests in that it, too, relied on physiological reactions. Dried rice was placed in the mouth of suspects, and when they spat the rice out, they were considered guilty if they still had rice sticking to their tongue. Persons under stress tend to have a dry mouth and cannot produce enough saliva to spit out all the rice, and a guilty person would presumably be under more stress in such a situation than an innocent.&lt;ref name="Schafer 42"&gt;Schafer, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew [[story of Susanna]] depicts the use of [[interrogation]] of two separate witnesses, resulting in their contradicting each other and exposing the falsehood of their accusation against Susanna.

==Documents and prints==
In societies where most people were illiterate, documents were often forged and methods of detecting or preventing fraud were much sought after. In [[ancient Rome]], officials employed experts in [[handwriting analysis]] to compare the writing styles of scribes in order to detect forgery.&lt;ref name="Schafer 41" /&gt;

The ancients were aware of [[fingerprint]]s, and may have known that their patterns were unique to each person.&lt;ref name="Schafer 42" /&gt; They did not, however, use that knowledge for criminal investigations (as in modern [[dactylography]]). But in the first century BC the Roman attorney [[Quintilian]] won his client’s acquittal for murder by showing that the suspect's hand did not match a bloody palm print at the murder site.&lt;ref name="Schafer 42" /&gt;

Prints were more commonly used for identification. Hand and fingerprints were widely accepted as [[signature]]s as early as 2000 BC in [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name="Schafer 42" /&gt;

==Medical evidence==
Ancient physicians often took part in criminal investigations, in part because of their connections to rulers, and [[Hippocrates]] recommended as early as in the fourth century BC 
that physicians learn how to recognize injuries and poisonings inflicted by criminals.&lt;ref name="Schafer 43"&gt;Schafer, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[autopsy|Autopsies]] that sought to determine the cause of death are attested at least in the early third millennium BC, although they were opposed in many ancient societies where it was believed that the disfigurement of dead persons prevented them from entering the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref name="Schafer 43" /&gt; Notable Greek autopsists were [[Erasistratus]] and
[[Herophilus of Chalcedon]], who lived in 3rd century BC [[Alexandria]], but in general, autopsies were rare in ancient Greece.&lt;ref name="Schafer 43" /&gt; Notably, in 44 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] was the subject of an official autopsy after [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his murder]] by rival senators, and the physician's report noted that the second stab wound Caesar received was the fatal one.&lt;ref name="Schafer 43" /&gt; Some historians believe that the word "forensic" itself relates to that autopsy conducted after Caesar's murder in the [[Roman Forum]].&lt;ref name="Schafer 43" /&gt;

Ancient physicians could not easily establish [[poison]]ing as a cause of death, because its symptoms were often similar to those of natural [[seizure]]s.&lt;ref name="Schafer 41" /&gt; While poisons were a matter of particular interest to ancient scientists, the methods of analysis they devised remained simplistic. Many of these were collected in the works of the reputed physician and poet [[Nicander of Colophon]] (c. 200 BC), but his works were published in print for the first time in 1499.&lt;ref name="Schafer 41" /&gt;

'''Frang Bardhi''' ([[Latin]]: ''Franciscus Blancus'', {{lang-it|Francesco Bianchi}}, 1606–1643) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] bishop and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pipa|first=Arshi|year=1959| title=Communism and Albanian Writers|url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts20_3/AH1959.html |publisher=[[Robert Elsie]]|accessdate=2017-10-14|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.albanianhistory.net%2Ftexts20_3%2FAH1959.html&amp;date=2012-01-10|archivedate= 2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elsie|first=Robert|year=2005|title=Albanian Literature: A Short History|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Frang+Bardhi&amp;source=web&amp;ots=lcUHiaXMB4&amp;sig=US38H37yeZCqE1MWLwfQxWJ9nYo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Frang%20Bardhi&amp;f=false |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9781845110314 |accessdate=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardhi is best known as an author of the early eras of [[Albanian literature]]. He served as [[Bishop of Sapë]] (1635–1644).&lt;ref name=HierarchiaIV-Sape&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/hierarchiacathol04eubeuoft#page/304/mode/2up|last1=Gauchat|first1=Patritius (Patrice)|title=Hierarchia catholica medii et recentioris aevi | volume=Vol. IV|pages=305|date=1935|publisher=Libraria Regensbergiana|location=Münster|ISBN=}} ''(in Latin)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bardhi was born in [[Kallmet]] or [[Nënshat]] in the northern Albanian [[Zadrima]] region near [[Lezhë]]. He came from a family consisting of many figures high in the hierarchy of the [[Catholic Church]] and state officials or military commanders of the [[Republic of Venice]]. His uncle was Bishop of Sapa and Sarda. He studied [[theology]] in [[Italy]]. On 17 December 1635, Francesco Bianchi was appointed during the papacy of [[Pope Urban VIII]] as [[Bishop of Sapë]].&lt;ref name=HierarchiaIV-Sape /&gt;&lt;ref name=CathHierFranBian&gt;{{Cite web|last=Cheney |first=David M.|authorlink=|title=Bishop Francesco Bianchi |publisher=''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''|date=|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bbnchif.html  |accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 1636, he was [[consecrated]] bishop by [[Ciriaco Rocci]], [[Cardinal-Priest]] of [[San Salvatore in Lauro]], with [[Giovanni Battista Altieri]], [[Bishop of Camerino|Bishop Emeritus of Camerino]], and [[Ottavio Broglia]], [[Bishop of Asti]], serving as [[co-consecrators]].&lt;ref name=CathHierFranBian /&gt;

Bardhi is remembered as the author of the first Albanian dictionary ''Dictionarium latino-epiroticum'' (Latin-Albanian dictionary) published in [[Rome]] in 1635, comprising 5,640 entries. Its appendix contains a list of 113 proverbs, phrases, and idioms, some of which are translations from other languages into Albanian with the vast majority being collected from the [[Albanian folklore]].&lt;ref name="Bihiku"&gt;{{cite book| pages=14, 15| last1=Bihiku|first1 = Koço| title=A history of Albanian literature|location= Tirana| year=1980| publisher=[[8 Nëntori Publishing House]]| oclc=9133663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardhi also wrote a biography of [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], called ''[[The Apology of Scanderbeg]]'' published in [[Venice]] in 1636.&lt;ref&gt;Georgius Castriotus Epirensis, vulgo Scanderbegh. Per Franciscum Blancum, De Alumnis Collegij de Propaganda Fide Episcopum Sappatensem etc. Venetiis, Typis Marci Ginammi, MDCXXXVI (1636).&lt;/ref&gt; The Apology of Scanderbeg was a polemic against Slavic Catholic priest [[Ivan Tomko Mrnavić]], who claimed that Kastrioti was of Slav origin.&lt;ref name="Demiraj2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartl|first=Peter|editor=Bardhyl Demiraj|title=Pjetër Bogdani und die Anfänge des alb.

From 1637 on, Bardhi submitted reports in Italian and Latin to the Congregation of the [[Propaganda Fide]] in [[Rome]] which contain a mine of information about his [[diocese]], about political developments, about Albanian customs and about the structure and position of the Catholic Church in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-occupied [[Albania]].

'''Gaslamp fantasy''' (also known as '''gaslight fantasy''' or '''gaslight romance''') is a [[Genre|subgenre]] of both [[fantasy]] and [[historical fiction]]. Generally speaking, this particular realm of fantasy employs either a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] or [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] setting. The ''gaslamp fantasy'' genre is not to be confused with ''[[steampunk]]'', which usually has more of a [[science fiction|super-science]] edge and [[uchronia|uchronic]] tone. ''Gaslamp fantasy'' also differs from classical Victorian/Edwardian [[faerie]] or pure fantasy in the [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] or [[Lewis Carroll]] style or from historical crime-novels in the [[Anne Perry]] or [[June Thomson]] style by the [[supernatural]] elements, themes, and subjects it features. Many of its tropes, themes, and stock characters derive from [[Gothic fiction|Gothic literature]] — a long-established genre composed of both [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Horror fiction|horrific]] traits and motivated by the desire to rouse fear, apprehension, and other intense emotions within the reader — and could be described as an attempt to modernize literary Gothicism.

Writer and artist [[Kaja Foglio]] originally coined the term in an effort to distinguish her and husband [[Phil Foglio]]'s comic series, ''[[Girl Genius]]'', from "[[steampunk]]". Kaja hoped to suggest the work's distinctive style, a medley of [[alternate history]] and Victorian-esque "mad science".&lt;ref name="Marissa Meli"&gt;Marissa Meli.

[[File:Dracula1st.jpeg|190px|thumb|right|First edition cover of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ever-popular vampire novel, ''Dracula'', a common reference for gaslamp fantasy literature.]]

Later on, however, fantasy-fans redirected the term to denote a spin-off genre of [[Sherlock Holmes|Holmesian]] fantasy or [[Victorian era|Victorian-based]] Gothic tales. According to fantasy-fans as a whole, the subgenre consists, namely, of contemporary or modern fantasy pieces set in the Victorian "gaslamp" era. However, the subgenre also includes some works with a pre-Victorian setting ([[Susanna Clarke]]'s [[British Regency|Regency]] novel ''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell]]'', for example). More samplings of the genre can be found in publications such as the ''[[Gaslight Grimoire]]'' anthologies and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' comics.

==Origin==

The term "gaslamp fantasy" was first coined on April 26, 2006, by webcomic artist Kaja Foglio to differentiate her comic, ''[[Girl Genius]]'', from conventional steampunk fiction.

{{quote |text = I called it Gaslamp Fantasy because, around the time we were bringing Girl Genius out, there was a comic called Steampunk on the shelves and I didn't want any confusion. Plus, I've never liked the term steampunk much for our work, it's derived from cyberpunk  (a term which I think actually fits its genre well) but we have no punk, and we have more than just steam, and using a different name seemed appropriate. I mis-remembered a term that I had come across in the foreword to an H. Rider Haggard book, where the author was talking about Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, Rider Haggard and that sort of pre-pulp adventure material, and came up with "Gaslamp Fantasy." I felt a bit foolish when I discovered that I had made up my own term, but it works and I like it.|author=Kaja Foglio, author of ''Girl Genius''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kajafoglio.livejournal.com/60562.html |title=Dirt, Collection Vol. 5, Furniture and Gaslamp Fantasy |last=Foglio |first=Kaja |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313103808/http://kajafoglio.livejournal.com/60562.html |archivedate=2007-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Girl Genius'', although science fiction set in nineteenth-century Europe, does not have a firm emphasis on fantastic [[Industrial Revolution]] technology. Elements of other types of fiction are featured, including magic and mythical creatures, and the scientific element of it is less prominent. It also includes steampunk takes on contemporary sci-fi biology elements, like clockwork cyborgs, mass-produced Frankenstein-type creatures, and other monsters.

Generally, the term refers to fiction based in a Victorian-style setting, similar to steampunk, but with a broader emphasis. The stories are usually not so focused on machinery of the period (or, often, any machinery at all), take more liberties with the actual time period, and may contain elements of other genres.

Since the term's coining, gaslamp fantasy has been retroactively applied to other fiction written in the Victorian Age, such as the works of [[Bram Stoker]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6504">[[File:Hamartolus.jpg|thumb|"George the Monk at work", an early 14th-century miniature from [[Tver]]]]
'''George Hamartolos''' or '''Hamartolus''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Γεώργιος Ἁμαρτωλός}}}}) was a [[monk]] at [[Constantinople]] under [[Michael III]] (842–867) and the author of a chronicle of some importance. Hamartolus is not his name but the epithet he gives to himself in the title of his work: "A compendious chronicle from various chroniclers and interpreters, gathered together and arranged by George, a sinner ({{lang|grc|ὐπὸ Γεωργίου ἁμαρτωλοῦ}})". It is a common form among Byzantine monks. [[Krumbacher]] (''Byz. Litt.'', 358) protests against the use of this epithet as a name and proposes (and uses) the form '''Georgios Monachos''' (Γεώργιος Μοναχός "George the Monk").

Nothing is known about him except from the internal evidence of his work, which establishes his period (in the preface he speaks of Michael III as the reigning emperor) and his calling (he refers to himself several times as a monk).

==Chronicle==
The chronicle consists of four books. The first treats of profane history from [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] to [[Alexander the Great]]; the second, of the history of the [[Old Testament]]; the third, of [[Roman history]] from [[Julius Caesar]] to [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]; and the fourth down to the author's own time, to the death of the emperor [[Theophilus (emperor)|Theophilus]] (842), whose widow [[Theodora (9th century)|Theodora]] restored the veneration of [[icon]]s in the same year. The chronicle is the only original contemporary authority for the years 813–842, and therefore so far indispensable. As usually in the case of such medieval chronicles, the only part to be taken seriously is the account of more or less contemporary events. The rest is interesting as an example of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ideas on the subjects, and of the questions that most interested Byzantine monks.

George describes his ideal and principles in the preface. He has used ancient Greek and modern Greek sources, has especially consulted edifying works, and has striven to relate such things as were useful and necessary, with a strict adherence to truth, rather than to please the reader by artistic writing or pretensions to literary style. But of so great a mass of material he has chosen only what is most useful and necessary. In effect, the questions that seemed most useful and necessary to ecclesiastical persons at Constantinople in the ninth century are those that are discussed. There are copious pious reflections and theological excursuses. He writes of how idols were invented, the origin of monks, the religion of the [[Saracens]], and especially of the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclast]] controversy that had just ended. Like all monks he hates iconoclasts. The violence with which he speaks of them shows how recent the storm had been and how the memory of iconoclast persecutions was still fresh when he wrote. He writes out long extracts from [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]].

The first book treats of an astonishingly miscellaneous collection of persons — Adam, [[Nimrod]], the [[Persia]]ns, [[Chaldees]], [[Brahmins]], [[Amazons]], etc. In the second book, too, although it professes to deal with Bible history only, he has much to say about [[Plato]] and philosophers in general. Hamartolus ended his chronicle with the year 842, as a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] in most manuscripts attests. Various people, among them notably "[[Symeon Logothetes]]", who is probably [[Symeon Metaphrastes]], the famous writer of saints' lives (tenth century, see Krumbacher, 358), continued his history to later dates — the longest continuation reaches to 948. In these additions, religious questions are relegated to the background, more attention is devoted to political history, and the language is more popular. Still further continuations of little value go down to 1143.

In spite of his crude ideas and the violent hatred of iconoclasts that makes him always unjust towards them, his work has considerable value for the history of the last years before the schism of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. It was soon translated into [[Church Slavonic]] and also in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] by [[Arsen of Iqalto]]. In these versions it became a sort of fountain-head for all early Slavonic historians, most notably [[Nestor (chronicler)|Nestor]]. As a very popular and widely consulted book of large circulation it has been constantly re-edited, corrected, and rearranged by anonymous scribes, so that the reconstruction of the original work is "one of the most difficult problems of Byzantine philology" (Krumbacher, 355).

==Editions==

St. Petersburg, 1859. The first edition of the whole work.  It does not represent the original text, but one of the many modified versions (from a [[Moscow]] twelfth-century [[manuscript]]), and is in many ways deficient and misleading (see Krumbacher's criticism in ''Byz. Litt.'', p.&amp;nbsp;357).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1244">'''Global Cosmopolitans''' refers to "a talented population of highly educated [[multilingual]] people that have lived, worked and studied for extensive periods in different cultures. While their international identities have diverse starting points and experiences, their views of the world and themselves are profoundly affected by both the realities of living in different cultures and their manner of coping with the challenges that emerge.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brimm|first1=Linda|title=Global Cosmopolitans, The Creative Edge of Difference|date=2010|publisher=Insead Business Press Series, Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0230230781|pages=4|url=https://www.amazon.com/Global-Cosmopolitans-Creative-Difference-Business/dp/0230230784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was developed by Linda Brimm, Professor of [[Organizational Behavior]] at [[INSEAD]] and further explored in her book ''[https://www.amazon.com/Global-Cosmopolitans-Creative-Difference-Business/dp/0230230784 Global Cosmopolitans: The Creative Edge of Difference]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">'''Günter Oskar Dyhrenfurth''' (November 12, 1886 – April 14, 1975) was a German-born, [[Germany|German]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mountaineer]], geologist and [[Himalaya]]n explorer.  

== Biography ==
He led the International Himalaya Expedition (IHE) 1930 to [[Kangchenjunga]], and another one, IHE 1934, to the [[Baltoro Glacier|Baltoro]]-region in the [[Karakoram]]s, especially to explore the [[Gasherbrum]]-Group. This expedition made the first ascent of [[Sia Kangri]] and some of its sub-peaks and provided detailed information about the accessibility of the [[8000er]]s [[Gasherbrum I]] and [[Gasherbrum II|II]]. The first ascent of Gasherbrum I in 1958 was accomplished via the route proposed by Dyhrenfurth following the so-called IHE-spur and the SE-ridge.

Dyrenfurth was a very influential alpinist, expedition leader and chronicler of mountaineering.&lt;ref name=thin-air&gt;[[Jon Krakauer]] (1997). ''[[Into Thin Air]]''.

[[File:Harvard Classics.jpg|thumb|320px|right|The first 10 volumes of ''The Harvard Classics''.]]

[[Image:Charles William Eliot.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Charles William Eliot, compiler and editor of ''The Harvard Classics'' anthology.]]

The '''''Harvard Universal Classics,''''' originally known as '''Dr. Eliot's Five Foot Shelf,''' is a 51-volume [[anthology]] of classic works from world literature, compiled and edited by [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles W. Eliot]] and first published in 1909.&lt;ref name=kirsch&gt;Adam Kirsch, [http://harvardmagazine.com/2001/11/the-five-foot-shelf-reco.html The "Five-foot Shelf" Reconsidered], ''Harvard Magazine'', Volume 103, Number 2. November–December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliot had stated in speeches that the elements of a [[liberal education]] could be obtained by spending 15 minutes a day reading from a collection of books that could fit on a five-foot shelf. (Originally he had said a three-foot shelf.)  The publisher [[Peter Fenelon Collier|P. F. Collier and Son]] saw an opportunity and challenged Eliot to make good on this statement by selecting an appropriate collection of works, and the ''Harvard Classics'' was the result.

Eliot worked for one year with [[William Allen Neilson|William A. Neilson]], a professor of English; Eliot determined the works to be included and Neilson selected the specific editions and wrote introductory notes.&lt;ref name=kirsch/&gt; Each volume had 400–450 pages, and the included texts are "so far as possible, entire works or complete segments of the world's written legacies."&lt;ref name="findarticles"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3708/is_200604/ai_n17178495 Dr. Eliot's Five-Foot Shelf of Books: Toward a Centennial of The Harvard Classics, ''Papers on Language and Literature'' - Find Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection was widely advertised by Collier and Son, in ''[[Collier's Magazine|Collier's]]'' and elsewhere, with great success.

==Enduring success==
As [[Adam Kirsch]], writing for [[Harvard Magazine|''Harvard'' magazine]] in 2001, notes, "It is surprisingly easy, even today, to find a complete set of the Harvard Classics in good condition. At least one is usually for sale on eBay, the Internet auction site, for $300 or so, a bargain at $6 a book. The supply, from attics or private libraries around the country, seems endless &amp;mdash; a tribute to the success of the publisher, P.F. Collier, who sold some 350,000 sets within 20 years of the series' initial publication".&lt;ref name=kirsch/&gt;

==Similar compendia==
* The concept of education through systematic reading of seminal works themselves (rather than textbooks), was carried on by [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] at [[Columbia University]], and, in the 1930s, [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]] at the University of Chicago, carried this idea further with the concepts of education through study of the "[[Great Books|great books]]" and "great ideas" of Western civilization. This led to the publication in 1952 of ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'', which is still in print and actively marketed. In 1937, under [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] introduced a curriculum based on the direct study of "great books".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11177">'''Herodian coinage''' are coins minted and issued by the [[Herodian Dynasty]], [[Jew]]s of [[Edom|Idumean]] descent who ruled the [[Iudaea Province|province of Judaea]] between 37 BC&amp;ndash;92 AD. The dynasty was founded by [[Herod the Great]] who was the son of [[Antipater the Idumaean|Antipater]], a powerful official under the [[Hasmonean]] King [[Hyrcanus II]].

==Herod the Great 37&amp;ndash;4 BC==

[[Image:Herod coin.jpg|thumb|right|Largest coin of Herod the Great]]
[[Image:HerodObverseChiDiadem.jpg|thumb|left|(Obverse) Second largest coin of Herod. [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Chi (letter)|letter Chi]] within a [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]]]]
[[Image:HerodReverseTripod.jpg|thumb|left|(Reverse) coin of Herod. Ceremonial bowl on a [[tripod]]]]

The coinage of [[Herod the Great]] continued the [[Jew]]ish tradition of not depicting a [[you shall not make for yourself an idol|graven image]]. However, a [[prutah]] of Herod was the first coin since the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] period to depict a living creature - an eagle, which may have been an allusion to the golden eagle that Herod erected over the entrance to the [[Second Temple]], and which caused such great offence to the Jews.

Other objects depicted on coins of Herod include a winged [[caduceus]] and [[pomegranate]] ('rimmôn'), one of the [[seven species]] mentioned in the [[Bible]] as blessings to the [[Land of Israel]], a plumed helmet and shield, a ship's [[stern]] and a palm branch. The largest denomination coin issued by Herod, bears a year, "year 3", and displays a series of unusual designs, such as  a helmet with long cheek pieces, surmounted by a star. The second largest denomination features a crested helmet and a shield, as well as the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Chi (letter)|letter Chi]] within a [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]] and a [[tripod]] holding a ceremonial bowl. These designs are surrounded by the [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription {{lang-grc-gre|'ΉΡΩΔΟΥ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ'}} (of Herod [[Basileus]], Of King Herod). 

The Greek letter Chi representing the "crown of [[Kohen Gadol|''Kehunah'']] (High Priest)" and the diadem representing the "crown of [[King|''Malchus'']] (Kingness)" ([[Babylonian Talmud|BT:]] [[Horayot]], [[Keritot]]) are taken to mean that Herod claimed both offices for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Jewish Coinage, [[Ya'akov Meshorer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common [[prutah]] issued by Herod the Great is similar in design to that of the [[Hashmonean coinage]], an anchor with Greek inscription "ΉΡωΔ ΒΆCΙ" (King Herod), and a caduceus between double [[cornucopia]]e,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amuseum.org/book/page9.html ''Handbook of Biblical Numismatics'' pg 9]&lt;/ref&gt; which was meant as a continuation of the Hashmonean coinage as well as a continuation of the [[Hasmonean|Hasmonean dynasty]]. However, Herod used only the Greek script on his coins, not the dual Greek and Hebrew method of the Hasmoneans.&lt;ref&gt;Reifenberg, A.  ''Ancient Jewish Coins'' 1965  p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Herod Archelaus.jpg|right|thumb|Coin of Herod Archelaus]]

==Herod Archelaus 4 BC&amp;ndash;6 AD==

The most common coins of [[Herod Archelaus]] are small [[prutah (coin)|prutot]] depicting a bunch of grapes, also one of the seven species, and a crested helmet with his name (Herod) and title ([[Ethnarch]]) in Greek (ΉΡΩΔ ΕΘΝ ), and a ship's prow and wreath with his name and title abbreviated. Grapes were commonly depicted on [[Jew]]ish coins, serving as s reminder of the fertility of the country. Other coins of Archelaus showed the bow of a ship and a laurel wreath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodians/herod_archelaus.htm Article on King Herod Archelaus]&lt;/ref&gt;

A rare double prutah of Herod Archelaus depicts a [[galley]] and conjoined double [[cornucopia]]e, also inscribed in Greek with his name and title.&lt;ref name=pg10&gt;[http://www.amuseum.org/book/page10.html ''Handbook of Biblical Numismatics'' pg 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Herod Antipas.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of Herod Antipas]]

==Herod Antipas 4 BC&amp;ndash;39 AD==

The coinage of [[Herod Antipas]] is rather rare, and can be divided into four categories: i) coins dated 'year 24' with the inscription 'ΤΙΒΕΡΙΆC' ([[Tiberias]]), where the coins were minted, contained within a wreath on the reverse; ii) coins from the years 33, 34 or 37, which also have the inscription 'ΤΙΒΕΡΙΆC' on the reverse; iii) coins dated 'year 43' with the inscription ΓΆΙΩ ΚΆΙCΆΡΙ ΓΕΡΜΆΝΙΚΩ ([[Gaius Caesar Germanicus]]) on the reverse; iv) only one known example of a coin dated 'year 4' with the inscription ΤΕΤ ΡΆ—ΉCΔ, ΉΡ W.&lt;ref&gt;Morten Hørning Jensen, 'Herod Antipas in Galilee' Pub.by Mohr Siebeck (2006) pg203&lt;/ref&gt; 

The coinage of Herod Antipas was minted in four denominations, with the inscription 'ΤΙΒΕΡΙΆC' on the reverse within a wreath. The [[obverse]] has the [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription "Herod the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|Tetrarch]]" (ΗΡωΔΌΎ ΤΕΤΡΆΡΧΌΎ) with an upright palm branch.&lt;ref&gt;Morten Hørning Jensen, 'Herod Antipas in Galilee' Pub.by Mohr Siebeck (2006) pg204&lt;/ref&gt; A variant type depicted an upright reed.

==Herod Philip II 4 BC&amp;ndash;34 AD==

The coins of [[Herod Philip II]] are mostly bronze of middle-size. He was the first [[Jew]]ish ruler to put portraits of himself and the [[Roman Emperor]]s on his coinage. An early issue has a portrait of the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Augustus]], with the [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription 'KAICAPI CEBACTΩ' on the obverse, and 'ΦΙΛΙΠΠΌΎ ΤΕΤΡΆΡΧΌΎ' on the reverse. Later coins depicted [[Tiberius]] on the obverse, with the inscription 'TIBEPIOΣ ΣEBAΣ', and 'ΦΙΛΙΠΠΌΎ ΤΕΤΡΆΡΧΌΎ' on the reverse. Both types had the facade of a four-columned temple on the reverse, possibly the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The coins are dated according to the year of the Emperor's reign.&lt;ref name=pg10/&gt;

==Herod Agrippa I 37&amp;ndash;44 AD==

[[Image:AgrippaPrutahObverse.jpg|thumb|left|100 px|Most common [[prutah]] of Agrippa I (Obverse). Inscription "of king Agrippa"]]
[[Image:AgrippaPrutahReverse.jpg|thumb|left|100 px|Prutah of Agrippa I (Reverse), inscription "year 5"]]
[[Agrippa I]] was the son of [[Aristobulus IV|Aristobulus]] and [[Berenice (daughter of Salome)|Berenice]], and was a grandson of [[Herod the Great]]. Agrippa spent much of his boyhood at the [[Court (royal)|Imperial court]] in [[Rome]]. His friend, the Emperor [[Caligula]], granted him the former territories of his uncles [[Herod Philip II]] and [[Herod Antipas]]. The Emperor [[Claudius]] later also added  [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]]. The most common prutah issued by Agrippa I shows a royal fringed umbrella-like canopy on the obverse, with the inscription 'ΆΓΡΙΠΆ BACIΛEWC' ('King Agrippa') in [[Greek language|Greek]], while the reverse shows three ears of barley between two leaves with the year. Another coin of Agrippa was issued in the name of [[Claudia Augusta|Claudia]], the daughter of [[Nero]].

These coins show a temple with a seated figure within and the inscription 'DIVA POPPAEA AUG' on the obverse, while the reverse shows a round temple with a figure standing within and the Greek inscription 'DIVA CLAVD NER F'. All the other coins of Herod Agrippa I contain graven images, with portraits of the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] or even of Agrippa himself. A very rare issue has a portrait of Agrippa with his son [[Agrippa II]] on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amuseum.org/book/page11.html ''Handbook of Biblical Numismatics'' pg 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herod Agrippa II 55&amp;ndash;92 AD==

[[Agrippa II]] was the last ruler of the [[Herodian Dynasty]]. His coins include both [[Jew]]ish and [[pagan]] symbolism. A Jewish type, for example, depicts a palm branch on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] with the inscription 'ΚΛΆΎΔΙΌΥ KAICAPOC' (Claudius Caesar) in [[Greek language|Greek]], and a wreath on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] surrounding the inscription 'TIBERIAC' ('Tiberias'), also in Greek. In 66 AD he issued a [[prutah]] showing his own bust on the obverse with the Greek inscription 'ΒΆΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΆΓΡΙΠΠΌΎ' (King Agrippa). The coin's reverse depicts an anchor with the letters L and I on either side, giving the tenth year of the king's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Joseph Kreitzer, 'Striking New Images: Roman Imperial Coinage and the New Testament World' Pub. by Continuum International Publishing Group (1996) pg 22&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippa II also minted a '[[Judaea Capta coinage|Judaea Capta' coin]]. This large bronze coin was minted at [[Tiberias]] and shows a portrait of [[Titus]] on the obverse with the Greek inscription ' KAICAP CEBAC AVTOKP TITOC', while the reverse depicts  the goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] advancing right holding a wreath and palm branch over her shoulder, with a star in upper right field and the inscription 'ETO - KS BA  AGRI-PPA'.

==Salome==

[[Image:Salome coin.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Coin of Salome]] Although not a ruler of Judaea, [[Salome]] is included here because she was a granddaughter of [[Herod the Great]] and therefore was a member of the [[Herodian Dynasty]]. As the queen of [[Kingdom of Chalcis|Chalcis]] and [[Armenian Kingdom|Armenia Minor]] she appeared on the reverse of coinage issued by her husband, [[Aristobulus of Chalcis]]. Minted in 56-57 AD, only three copies of this coin, all quite worn, have been discovered to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jerusalemperspective.com/%5Cdefault.aspx?tabid=27&amp;ArticleID=1474 New Portrait of Salome 1 January 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004213641/http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/default.aspx?tabid=27&amp;ArticleID=1474 |date=4 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The obverse depicts Aristobulus with the Greek inscription 'BACIΛEWC APIΣΤΌΒΥΛΟΎ' (King Aristobulus), while the reverse shows Salome and, on one example, the Greek inscription 'BACIΛIC ΣΆΛΩΜΉ' (Queen Salome).

The '''History of Tenrikyo''' concerns the social and institutional development of [[Tenrikyo]], from the day the teachings were founded by [[Miki Nakayama]] in October 26, 1838, to the present day.

==Confraternities==
Since the early 1860s, Miki Nakayama had asked her followers to form confraternities (''ko'' 講). One of the earliest examples was the Shinmei confraternity, formed sometime in April 1878.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obtaining government authorization==
From the 1870s, Miki Nakayama and her followers were constantly being persecuted by local government authorities and from members of established religions for expressing their beliefs and performing the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]]. To put an end to the persecution, various followers sought for recognition from different religious and state authorities, even though this was against the wishes of Nakayama. Tenrikyo could not apply as a completely independent religion because [[Meiji Constitution|Japanese law during the Meiji period]] did not grant civil authorization to churches outside of the established traditions, which at the time were [[Shinto]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department. ''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo.'' Translation of ''Oyasama Nensai to Tomoni.'' Tenri, 1990. p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Nakayama's eldest son, Shuji traveled to the Jifuku Temple at the foot of [[Mount Kongō]], a [[Buddhist]] temple belonging to the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon sect]]. The Jifuku Temple agreed to Shuji's request to establish a church, and on September 22, 1880, the "Tenrin-O-Kosha" church was formally inaugurated with a Buddhist fire rite and sermons by Buddhist priests.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.110-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meisei confraternity spread Nakayama's teachings as moral philosophy and thus escaped persecution. Following this example, a petition was submitted on May 9, 1884 to establish an organization named, "Tenrin-O-Sha: Institute for the Study of Practical Ethics." Thought the office denied the request because of the lack authority to grant the request, an office called "Tenrin-O-Sha" was nevertheless opened in [[Osaka]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and April 1885, the followers approached the Shinto Headquarters for the appointment of Shinnosuke Nakayama (Nakayama's grandson) and nine others as religious instructors. On May 22, Shinnosuke was appointed as a religious instructor, and the next day, May 23, the other religious instructors were also appointed, and permission was granted for the establishment of a sixth-degree church to be directly supervised by the Shinto Headquarters. On June 2, a letter accepting these appointments was sent to the Shinto authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to obtain civil authorization happened on April 29, 1885, when the followers filed a petition to the governor of [[Osaka]] for permission to form the Tenrikyo Church. Attached with the petition were four texts – [[Mikagura-uta|The Twelve Songs]], [[Ofudesaki]] Part IV, Ofudesaki Part X, and the Story of Creation. The request was denied. On July 3, the followers filed a second petition to the governor of [[Osaka]], which read, "Request to Establish the Shinto Tenrikyo Church." Again, the request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.202-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Nakayama Miki===
[[File:Nakayama Miki mausoleum.jpg|thumb|Cemetery of Nakayama Miki.]]
On January 26, 1887 by the lunar calendar (February 18 by the Gregorian calendar), the foundress of Tenrikyo, [[Nakayama Miki]], died at around two o'clock in the afternoon, after a performance of the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo Overseas Department. ''An Anthology of Osashizu Translations.'' Tenri, 2007. p.20-1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On February 25, 1887, a funeral for Nakayama Miki was conducted, with over 10,000 people in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, she was buried in the graveyard at Zenpuku-ji (a Buddhist temple in modern-day Tenri City), along with other members of the Nakayama family. However, in 1892, Tenrikyo followers, led by Nakayama Shinnosuke, constructed a new cemetery on Mount Toyoda, and the ceremony for her reburial was held on December 13th. The reburial ceremony was attended by over a hundred thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Shinto Main Bureau==
A petition for the legal recognition of a church was sent to the government office of [[Tokyo]] prefecture. On April 10, 1888, the governor of Tokyo approved this petition, establishing Tenrikyo Church Headquarters as a "sixth class" church belonging to the [[Shinto Taikyo|Shinto Main Bureau]] (神道本局 ''Shinto Honkyoku'').&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal authorization removed the threat of suppression and allowed followers to seek permission to establish branch churches and to gain official recognition for [[missionary]] work.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1888, Koriyama and Yamana were established as the first two branch churches under Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 1891, the Shinto Main Bureau changed Tenrikyo's designation from a "sixth class" church to a "first class" church.&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise in membership===
The membership rose sharply in the first decade of the Headquarters' existence. In 1892, the number of Tenrikyo followers had allegedly reached over one million, a thirty-fold increase in membership in five years. By December 1896, Tenrikyo had 3,137,113 members belonging to 1,078 churches, and there were 19,061 ministers. This growth invited negative reactions from Buddhist institutions, which were concerned about losing adherents, and from newspapers such as ''Chuo Shinbun'', ''Yorozu Chouho'', and ''Ni-Roku Shinbun'', who labeled the religion as "anti-social."&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home Ministry's directive===
On April 6, 1896, the [[Home Ministry]] (内務省 ''Naimu-shō'') issued "Directive No. 12," which ordered strict and secretive surveillance over Tenrikyo Church Headquarters under the pretense of maintaining and strengthening the [[kokutai|state polity]] of Japan. Issues raised by authorities were the congregation of both men and women together (which could potentially lead to disgrace), the obstruction of medical treatment, and the alleged policy of enforced donations.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tenrikyo leaders complied to the state demands in several ways. They changed several aspects of their prayer ritual, known to adherents as the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]].&lt;ref&gt;As for the exact changes made in the prayer ritual: "Only the second and third sections of the Service were allowed to be performed; only male performers could perform the Service; only men's instruments could be played; and the ''[[kagura]]'' masks were to be placed in front of the Service performers instead of being worn by them" (''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 61).&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the Tenrikyo deity [[Tenri-O-no-Mikoto]] was changed to "Tenri-no-Okami."&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; Tenrikyo Church Headquarters' conformity with the state demands resulted in a dual structure of the Tenrikyo faith, where on the surface, Tenrikyo complied with the state demands, while adherents disregarded those changes and maintained the teachings and rites as initially taught by [[Miki Nakayama]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 61-63.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drive toward sectarian independence==
In 1899 the Shinto Main Bureau advised the Tenrikyo Church Headquarters officials about the possibility of official recognition as an independent religion (independent meaning to be classified directly under the [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]], which upheld State Shinto ideology). Tenrikyo leaders worked to systemize the Tenrikyo doctrine and institutionalize the organization so that the petition for independence would pass. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters made a total of five attempts before it finally achieved independence in 1908.

On April 1, 1900, [[Tenri Seminary]], Tenrikyo’s first educational institution, was founded as a training school for ministers. In 1902, Tenrikyo arranged its mission administration system in Japan, which divided the country into ten dioceses and appointed superintendents to supervise regional missionary activities.

In 1903,&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; a edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was compiled (known today as the ''Meiji kyoten'', or the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] version of Tenrikyo's doctrine). This edition of the doctrine differs significantly from the present edition&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the ''Meiji kyoten'' contained ten chapters: 'Revering God,' 'Respecting the Emperor,' 'Loving the Nation,' 'Morality,' 'Accumulating Virtues,' 'Cleansing of Impurities,' 'Founding of the Teachings,' 'Repayment to God,' 'the Kagura', and 'Peace of Mind.' See ''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness,'' p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; because the teachings of State Shinto were incorporated in order to gain the Home Ministry's approval. Although Tenrikyo Church Headquarters complied with many of the state's requests, it did not compromise on the request to completely eliminate the ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'' ("The Songs for the Service"), one of Tenrikyo's main scriptures.

Around this time, Tenrikyo began to open its first churches overseas in [[Taiwan]] (1897) and [[Korea]] (1904).

==Sect Shinto==
The fifth petition for independence was submitted to the Home Ministry on March 20, 1908 and accepted later that year in November 27. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters set up its Administrative Headquarters, formally appointed Shinnosuke Nakayama as the first ''shinbashira'', the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo, and established its constitution. On February 25, 1912, the Home Ministry invited representatives from seventy-three religious groups to the [[:ja:三教会同|Three Religions Conference]] (三教会同 ''Sankyokaido'') including a Tenrikyo representative (the three religions represented were Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity, and Tenrikyo was categorized under Shinto). This conference initiated a program of national edification, and with the support of the government, Tenrikyo was able to hold lectures at 2,074 places through Japan, drawing nearly a quarter million listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 64-7&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the relative relaxation of state control on Tenrikyo rituals, the performance of [[Mikagura-uta#Section One|section one of the Mikagura-uta]] was restored in 1916, after two decades of prohibition under the Home Ministry’s directive.  

In 1925, a school of foreign languages was established for missionaries, including what would become [[Tenri Central Library]]. The same year saw the establishment of a printing office, a department for researching of doctrinal and biographical materials, and a major expansion of the church's education system, including a new girls’ school, nursery, kindergarten, and elementary school. 

In 1928, the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' was published. Three years later, in 1931, the publication of the ''[[Osashizu]]'' was completed, making the three main scriptures of Tenrikyo available to all followers for the first time. 

On the occasion of the completion of the South Worship Hall of the Main Sanctuary in 1934, the [[Mikagura-uta#Songs for the Kagura Service|Kagura Service]] was restored for the first time since it had been prohibited in 1896.

During this period, churches were opened in [[Manchuria]] (1911), the [[United States|U.S.]] (San Francisco Church, 1927),&lt;ref&gt;The Headquarters of Tenrikyo Church. ''The Short History of Tenrikyo Church.'' Nara, 1956. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]], and [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian]] countries. In 1910, missionaries were sent to England to propagate the Tenrikyo teachings, but they were not able to establish themselves permanently there.&lt;ref&gt;''The Short History of Tenrikyo Church.'' p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only a number of decades later, in 2000, that a mission center (Tenrikyo UK Centre) was established in England.

==Wartime Japan==
As the war between Japan and China grew from the [[Mukden Incident]] to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], state control of religious and secular thought intensified. For example, in December 1935, state authorities destroyed the buildings of [[Ōmoto|Omotokyo]] Headquarters and arrested the organization's leaders. One week later, on December 16, 1935, around four hundred policemen were sent to investigate Tenrikyo Church Headquarters on suspicion of tax evasion, even though there were no grounds for that accusation.

After the [[National Mobilization Law]] was passed in 1938, Japan’s wartime polity strengthened. In 1939, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters announced that it would reform its doctrine and ritual, under threat of forced disbanding of the organization by state authorities. Under the reformation, copies of the ''Ofudesaki'' and ''Osashizu'' were recalled, certain chapters were deleted from the ''Mikagura-uta'',&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, Yorozuyo, Song Three, and Song Five. See ''[[Mikagura-uta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Kagura Service, an important Tenrikyo ritual, was not allowed to be performed. All preaching, rites, and events were to follow the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine from 1903. The 1940 [[Religious Organizations Law]] further increased state surveillance and oppression in Japan.

==After World War II==
[[File:Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters viewed from the south gate.]]
In its own historical account, Tenrikyo refers to the years following the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender of Japan]] and the conclusion of [[World War II]] as ''fukugen'', or "restoration."&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 77.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the significant aspects of the "restoration" was the republishing and reissuing of the three scriptures of Tenrikyo in their entirety: the ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'' in 1946, the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' in 1948, and the ''[[Osashizu]]'' in 1949. In addition, the doctrine, which for decades had been colored by State Shinto ideology, was revised to reflect the teachings conveyed in the main scriptures and authorized in 1949.

Another aspect of the "restoration" was the construction of the [[Oyasato-yakata]], begun in 1954. As of 1998, twenty four wings have been completed and are used for various purposes, such as educational facilities, medicinal facilities, institutes for doctrinal studies and religious training, and followers' dormitories. The construction continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue," a symposium cosponsored by [[Tenri University]] and [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], was held in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] from March 9–11, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;The Organizing Committee of Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue. ''Tenrikyo Christian Dialogue.'' Tenri University Press, 1999, Tenri, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the universities cosponsored another symposium, "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue II," held at [[Tenri, Nara|Tenri, Japan]] from September 28–30, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;The Organizing Committee of Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue II. ''Tenrikyo Christian Dialogue.'' Tenri University Press, 2005, Tenri, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Duncan Mackie''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Military Cross|MC]] (1887&amp;ndash;1978) was a distinguished Scottish historian who wrote a one-volume history of Scotland as well as several works on [[Scotland in the Early Modern Era|early modern Scotland]].

Born in [[Edinburgh]], Mackie was educated at [[Middlesbrough High School]] and [[Jesus College, Oxford]], where he took a first-class degree in history and won the [[Lothian Essay Prize]]. He was appointed as a lecturer in history at the [[University of St. Andrews]] in 1909, aged only twenty-two. While at St. Andrews he introduced the subject of Scottish history into the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Scotland'', revised ed., Penguin, 1977 {{ISBN|0-14-020671-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] and was awarded a [[Military Cross]]. He was wounded in both the stomach and in the shoulder. In both cases he received innovative treatment. For the stomach wound (caused by a machine-gun) he was treated at a [[military hospital]] in [[Rouen]]. Sterilised water was dripped right through his stomach and he recovered well. The shoulder wound was received in the last days of the war. He nearly had to have his arm amputated but he opted for a new treatment in which the nerve was knotted. However, he never regained full use of his left hand and suffered considerable pain for the remainder of his life. He returned to St. Andrews after the war, before being appointed professor of modern history at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], [[University of London]], in 1926.

He was [[Professor of Scottish History and Literature, Glasgow|Professor of Scottish History and Literature]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1930 to 1957. It was during these years that he wrote ''The Earlier Tudors 1485-1558'' (Oxford University Press). An influential volume, ''The Earlier Tudors'' was a new analysis of Tudor administration – the business of government. In 1957 he retired, and was appointed [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Historiographer Royal]] for Scotland.

Mackie returned to the Glasgow University lecture hall in 1961 in the capacity of emeritus professor.

He died in [[Haslemere]] in 1978 and was buried at [[Grayswood]] church. His medals are in the regimental museum of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] at [[Stirling Castle]]. The Letters Patent appointing him Historiographer Royal were sent to the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] at Glasgow University.

[[File:John Tradescant the elder.jpg|right|thumb|250px|John Tradescant the Elder (portrait attributed to [[Cornelis de Neve]])]]
'''John Tradescant''' the Elder ({{IPAc-en|pron|t|r|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|s|k|ə|n|t|}}; c. 1570s – 15&amp;ndash;16 April 1638), father of [[John Tradescant the younger]], was an English naturalist, gardener, collector and traveller, probably born in Suffolk, England.  He began his career as head gardener to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] at [[Hatfield House]], who initiated Tradescant in travelling by sending him to the [[Low Countries]] for fruit trees in 1610/11. He was kept on by Robert's son [[William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|William]], to produce gardens at the family's London house, [[Cecil House|Salisbury House]]. He then designed gardens on the site of [[St Augustine's Abbey]] for [[Edward Wotton, 1st Baron Wotton|Edward Lord Wotton]] in 1615-23.

Later, Tradescant was gardener to the royal favourite [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], remodelling his gardens at [[New Hall, Essex]] and at [[Burley-on-the-Hill]]. John Tradescant travelled to the [[Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery]] in Arctic [[Russia]] in 1618 (his own account of the expedition survives in his collection), to the [[Levant]] and to [[Algiers]] during an expedition against the [[Barbary pirates]] in 1620, returned to the Low Countries on Buckingham's behalf in 1624, and finally went to [[Paris]] and (as an engineer for the ill-fated siege of [[La Rochelle]]) the [[Ile de Rhé]] with Buckingham. After Buckingham's assassination in 1628, he was then engaged in 1630 by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to be Keeper of his Majesty's Gardens, Vines, and Silkworms at his queen's minor palace, [[Oatlands Palace]] in Surrey.

[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - John Tradescant the elder.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Engraving of John Tradescant the Elder by [[Wenceslas Hollar]]]]
On all his trips he collected seeds and bulbs everywhere and assembled a collection of curiosities of natural history and ethnography which he housed in a large house, "The Ark", in Lambeth, London.  The Ark was the prototypical "[[Cabinet of curiosities|Cabinet of Curiosity]]", a collection of rare and strange objects, that became the first [[museum]] open to the public in England, the [[Musaeum Tradescantianum]]. He also gathered specimens through American colonists, including his personal friend [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], who bequeathed Tradescant a quarter of his library. From their [[botanical garden]] in [[Lambeth]], on the south bank of the [[River Thames|Thames]], he and his son, [[John Tradescant the younger|John]], introduced many plants into English gardens that have become part of the modern gardener's repertory. A genus of flowering plants (''[[Tradescantia]]'') is named to honour him.  Tradescant Road, off South Lambeth Road in Vauxhall, marks the former boundary of the Tradescant estate.

He was buried in the churchyard of St-Mary-at-Lambeth, as was his son; the churchyard is now established as the [[Garden Museum]].

He is the subject of the novel ''Earthly Joys'' by [[Philippa Gregory]].

==Education==
Kelly Dixon attended the [[University of Minnesota Duluth|University of Minnesota]] at [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], majoring in [[anthropology]].  She went on to receive her Master of Science in Industrial Archaeology at [[Michigan Technological University]] in 1995 and her Doctorate in Anthropology at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]].  While at the University of Nevada she worked on her dissertation based on the archaeology of an African American [[Western saloon|saloon]] with [[Donald Hardesty]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Research==
Dixon's particular field of interest is the historical archaeology of the American West and in other settings where cultures from various parts of the world came into contact. Between 1997 and 2002 she conducted projects in [[Virginia City, Nevada]] and the [[Comstock Lode|Comstock Mining District]] while working for the [[Nevada State Historic Preservation Office]] at the Comstock Archaeology Center.

Dixon has also done extensive work on the [[Donner Party]] site,&lt;ref name=donner_team&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthro.umt.edu/donner/team.htm |title=Donner Party Archaeology Research Team 2004-2005 |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207113720/http://www.anthro.umt.edu/donner/team.htm |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; continuing the work done by Hardesty in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 2003, in conjunction with researchers from the [[University of Oregon]], a production company affiliated with the [[Discovery Channel]] sponsored work there.&lt;ref name=natl_geo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/07/0722_040722_donnerparty.html|title="Donner Party" Hearth Yields Bones; DNA Analysis Planned|accessdate=2009-02-12|date=2004-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=waddle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waddle.uoregon.edu/gallery/album01/Discovery_crew_with_julie_and_kelly |title=Donner Photos |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914120040/http://waddle.uoregon.edu/gallery/album01/Discovery_crew_with_julie_and_kelly |archivedate=2007-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the show ''Unsolved History: The Donner Party''. Her team found numerous artifacts including ceramics, pieces of a lantern, writing slate, mirror fragments, glass from a medicine bottle, and musket balls. She returned in the summer of 2004 for five weeks to carry an excavation with her colleagues that was funded by various universities, a local foundation, and eventually, for part of the lab analysis, a production company affiliated with the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].&lt;ref name=eureka /&gt;&lt;ref name=donner_blog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donnerblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/unsolved-history-episode-available.html|title="Unsolved History" episode available|accessdate=2009-02-12|date=2008-12-07|first=Kristin|last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon and colleagues were not just concerned with the topic of cannibalism and whether it may have occurred at the Donner Party's Alder Creek camp, but what the individuals living in that camp endured and what, in general, humans do, or how they adapt, when faced desperate circumstances.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424fa_fact_goodyear|title=American Chronicles: What Happened At Alder Creek?, The New Yorker (abstract)|accessdate=2009-02-12|date=2006-04-24|last=Goodyear|first=Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined historical and archaeological evidence indicated that cannibalism did take place but not until the last few weeks. The History Channel aired the thirty-minute segment on the Donner Party in the spring of 2006 as part of a documentary on [[cannibalism]].

Dixon is currently developing student-oriented multidisciplinary archaeological research at the mining ghost town of [[Coloma, Montana]].&lt;ref name=coloma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthro.umt.edu/field/Coloma.pdf |title=Coloma Flyer |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612034807/http://www.anthro.umt.edu/field/Coloma.pdf |archivedate=June 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at isolated Chinese mining communities in Western Montana &lt;ref name=cas_faculty /&gt; She currently serves as the editor for the [[Society for Historical Archaeology]]&lt;ref name=sha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sha.org/about/whoweare.htm |title=The Society for Historical Archeology: About |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006185035/http://www.sha.org/about/whoweare.htm |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; website.

'''Mahmud Beg Tarzi''' ({{lang-ps|'''محمود طرزۍ'''}}, [[Dari language|Dari Persian]]: محمود بیگ طرزی; August 23, 1865 – November 22, 1933) was a [[Politics of Afghanistan|politician]] and one of [[Afghanistan]]'s greatest [[intellectual]]s.&lt;ref name=MahmudTarzi/&gt; He is known as the father of Afghan [[journalism]]. As a prominent modern thinker, he became a key figure in the [[history of Afghanistan]], following the lead of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in Turkey by working for modernization and secularization, and strongly opposing religious extremism and obscurantism. Tarzi emulated the [[Young Turks]] coalition.&lt;ref name="Adamec"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Adamec |first=Ludwig W. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|title=ḤABIB-ALLĀH|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/habib-allah|accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps to the point of the emulation [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun nationalism]].

==Early years==
[[File:Mahmud Tarzi and his wife Asma Rasmiya.jpg|thumb|Mahmud Tarzi and his wife Asma Rasmiya]]
Tarzi was born on 23 August 1865 in [[Ghazni]], Afghanistan. An ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], his father was Sardar [[Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi]], leader of the [[Mohammadzai]] royal house of [[Kandahar]] and a well-known poet. His mother belonged to [[Popalzai]] tribe.&lt;ref name="Schinasi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schinasi |first=May |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|title=ṬARZI, MAḤMUD|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tarzi-mahmud|accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, shortly after [[Emir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] came to power. Mahmud's father and the rest of the Tarzi family were expelled from Afghanistan. They first travelled to [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], where they lived from January 1882 to March 1885. They then moved to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Mahmud began to explore the Middle East, he made pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], visited [[Paris]], and toured the eastern Mediterranean. He also encountered [[Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani]] in Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Schinasi"/&gt; On a second trip to [[Damascus]], Syria, in 1891, Tarzi married the daughter of Sheikh [[Saleh Al-Mossadiah]], a [[muezzin]] of the Umayyad mosque. She became his second wife, the first was an Afghan who had died in Damascus. Tarzi stayed in Turkey until the age of 35, where he became fluent in a number of languages, including his native tongue [[Pashto language|Pashto]] as well as [[Dari language|Dari]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Arabic]], and [[Urdu]].&lt;ref name="afghanmagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=An Afghan Intellect: Mahmoud Tarzi |url=http://www.afghanmagazine.com/articles/tarzi.html 
|work=Afghan Magazine Article: July – Sept. 1997, by Yama Atta &amp; Hashmat Haidari 
|editor=Farhad Azad 
|accessdate=2013-04-07 
|publisher=afghanmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after Emir Abdur Rahman Khan's death in 1901, [[Habibullah Khan]] invited the Tarzi family back to Afghanistan. Mahmud Tarzi was given a post in the government. There he began to introduce Western ideas in Afghanistan. If there is a single person responsible for the modernization of Afghanistan in the first two decades of the twentieth century it was Tarzi. Tarzi's daughter, [[Soraya Tarzi]], married King [[Amanullah Khan]] and become Queen of Afghanistan. Mahmud Tarzi took up a critical role in the history of Afghanistan, from famed poet to progressive leader.&lt;ref name="afghanmagazine.com"/&gt;

==Journalism and poetry==
One of Tarzi's earliest works was known as the ''Account of a Journey'' (Sayahat-Namah-e Manzum), which was published in [[Lahore]], [[British Raj|British India]] (now [[Pakistan]]). However, Tarzi's most influential work – and the foundation of journalism in Afghanistan – was his publishing of [[Seraj al Akhbar|''Seraj-al-Akhbar'']]. This [[newspaper]] was published bi-weekly from October 1911 to January 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/collections/afghan/chronology1881to1919.html Chronology: the reigns of Abdur Rahman Khan and Habibullah, 1881–1919] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715124008/http://www.bl.uk/collections/afghan/chronology1881to1919.html |date=2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It played an important role in the development of an Afghan modernist movement, serving as a forum for a small, enlightened group of young Afghans, who provided the ethical justification and basic tenets of Afghan nationalism and modernism. Tarzi also published ''Seraj-al-Atfal'' (Children's Lamp), the first Afghan publication aimed at a juvenile audience.&lt;ref name="afghanmagazine.com"/&gt;

Tarzi was the first who introduced the [[novel]] in Afghanistan and translated many English and French novels to Dari and Pashto. He also contributed in editing, translations, and modernization of the Afghan press. He translated into Dari and Pashto many major works of European authors, such as ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (novel)|Around the World in Eighty Days]], [[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]], [[The Mysterious Island]], [[International Law]]'' (from Turkish), and the History of the Russo-Japanese War. When he lived in Turkey and Syria, he immersed himself in reading and research, using Western literary and scientific sources. In [[Damascus]], Tarzi wrote ''The Garden of Learning'', containing choice articles about literary, artistic, travel and scientific matters. Another book entitled ''The Garden of Knowledge'' (later published in Kabul), concludes with an article "My beloved country, Afghanistan", in which he tells his Afghan countrymen how much he longs for his native land and recalls with nostalgia the virtues of its climate, mountains and deserts. In 1914, his novel ''Travel Across Three Continents in Twenty-Nine Days'' published. In the preface, he makes an apt comment about travel and history:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Although age has its normal limits, it may be extended by two things-the study of history and by travel. Reading history broadens one's perception of the creation of the world, while travel extends one's field of vision."''&lt;ref name=MahmudTarzi&gt;[http://www.mahmudtarzi.com/MahmudTarzi/Biography.asp Biography of Mahmud Tarzi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006153801/http://www.mahmudtarzi.com/MahmudTarzi/Biography.asp |date=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was instrumental in developing a modern literary community his last two decades in Afghanistan. Many of Tarzi's writings would be published after his death.

==Politics==
{{Further|Politics of Afghanistan}}
Like most other Afghan leaders, Tarzi was an Afghan nationalist who held many government positions in his life. He was a reform-minded individual amongst his extended family members whom ruled Afghanistan at the beginning of the 20th century and not unlike his father [[Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi|Sardar Ghulam Muhammad Khan Tarzi]]. After King Amanullah ascended the throne, Tarzi became [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Afghan Foreign Minister]] in 1919. Shortly thereafter, the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] began. After the national independence from the British in 1919, Tarzi established Afghan Embassies in [[London]], [[Paris]], and other capitals of the world. Tarzi would also go on to play a large role in the declaration of Afghanistan's independence. From 1922 to 1924, he served as [[Ambassador]] in [[Paris, France]]. He was then again placed as Foreign Minister from 1924 to 1927. Throughout his tenure in Afghanistan, Tarzi was a high government official during the reigns of King [[Habibullah Khan|Habibullah]] and his son King Amanullah Khan.&lt;ref name=MahmudTarzi/&gt;

===Afghanistan's 1919 Independence===

Tarzi effectively guided the second movement of the young constitutionalists called ''Mashroota Khwah''. This led to reviving the first suppressed movement of the constitutionalists in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="afghanmagazine.com"/&gt; Tarzi served as high counsel and advisor during this event.

During the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, when Tarzi served as Foreign Minister, [[British Raj|British India]] bombarded [[Kabul]] and [[Jalalabad]], over a ton of munitions rained down to Jalalabad in a single day.&lt;ref name=MahmudTarzi/&gt; Tarzi was appointed head of the Afghan Delegation at the peace conferences at Mussoorie 1920 and Kabul 1921. The British, who had dealt with Tarzi before, attempted to reduced Tarzi's energy to get more than they were supposed to. After four months the talks broke up because of the [[Durand Line]]. Sir [[Henry Dobbs]] led the British delegation to Kabul in January, 1921 – Mahmud Tarzi headed the Afghan group. After 11 months of discussions, the British and Afghans signed a peace treaty normalizing their relations. Although Afghanistan was the winner of the conference – as the British accepted Afghanistan's independence – Tarzi's diplomacy was shown as the British sent a message afterwards to Tarzi, giving their good will toward all tribes.&lt;ref name=MahmudTarzi/&gt;

==Social justice and equality==
{{Main|Reforms of Amānullāh Khān and civil war}}
Politically, he held important government positions during the reigns of King Habibullah and son Amanullah. He reached the highest points of government as a chief adviser and Foreign Minister. He was a main force behind Habibullah Khan's social reforms, especially with regard to education. These reforms included changing the medieval schools and madrasah systems, allow publication of books and journals, and lift all restrictions that ban girls and women from the rest of society. He led the charge for modernization – doing so as a strong opponent of religious obscuring. Although very religious, he was strongly against the state establishing a religion, even if it were his own. Early in his career, he was in favour of a united nation that would stretch from modern-day Pakistan to Syria, not to unify a Muslim nation but to stop inner-conflict and tribal wars that were common during that time in history. Tarzi's daughter, Queen [[Soraya Tarzi]], would play a bigger role for social justice, being one of the first and only major feminists in power in Afghanistan's history.

==Final years==
Many of Tarzi's plans and projects were never started, as the royal house of King Amanullah came to an end by a [[Coup d'état|coup]] in 1929. Tarzi and his family left Afghanistan and settled in Turkey. He died on November 22, 1933 at the age of 68 in [[Istanbul]], Turkey.

==Mahmud Tarzi Cultural Foundation==
In September 2005, the Mahmud Tarzi Cultural Foundation (MTCF) was established in Kabul, Afghanistan, with its head office in [[Mahmud Tarzi High School]]. The foundation is serving, according to NGO rules as a whole, briefly as, increasing the life quality of children at the educational level, helping their education, building schools, training &amp; health centers, running these facilities and to complete the mentioned services written in the Deed of Foundation by creating financial aid for Afghan students.

A major project that the cultural foundation is starting in 2007 is the Mahmud Tarzi Compound in Afghanistan. This project contains a library and a museum for Tarzi's works, a street children care center in memory of Asma Rasmia (wife of Tarzi) and a women's care center in memory of Queen Soraya (daughter of Tarzi and [[Queen consort|Queen]] of Afghanistan).

In order to get necessary funding for the foundation, a business center and a hotel will be built together with the compound. With any profit, the foundation will organize scholarship programmes, publish old and new works of Tarzi, and make contributions to the young authors and litterateurs to whom work for Mahmud Tarzi's ideas.

[[File:Marcus Bains Line.png|thumb|Marcus Bains line showing in [[KDE]]'s calendar application [[Kontact]].]]
The '''Marcus Bains line''' is a line that shows the current time in many calendar applications and [[Personal information manager|PIM]] suites. Usually, it is a red horizontal line showing at the location of the current time in the "day" or "week" views of a calendar, sometimes complemented with the current time.

==History==
From at least September 2000 on, there has been a patch for [[ical (Unix)|ical]] to show the Marcus Bains line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keysduplicated.com/~ali/marcus-bains-line/ Marcus Bains Line: A Necessary Feature for Every Calendar Program] by Ali Rahimi (Oct 20, 2000. Last Updated Oct 3, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually other programs such as [[Korganizer]], [[Evolution (software)|Evolution]] and [[Google Calendar]] started supporting the line, either through patches, third-party scripts or natively. Many commercial programs implementing it kept the red colour or the name.

'''Mariano Abril y Ostalo''' (1861−1935) was a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] [[politician]]. He served as a member of the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]] from 1917 to 1920.

==Early years and work==

Mariano Abril y Ostalo was born on May 25, 1861 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]].

During his youth, he worked as a notary clerk while writing for ''El Palenque de la Juventud'' under the [[pseudonym]] of "Florete". In 1888, he founded ''La Linterna'', a magazine that was [[censorship|censored]] by the government. He then worked for ''El Clamor del País'', a San Juan political newspaper. He also collaborated for ''La Democracia'', another newspaper which he ended up directing in 1895.

==Exile in Europe==

In 1896, after attacking the government in his newspaper, he was convicted to prison by a War Council. However, he fled to [[France]] where he stayed for a while. He then moved to [[Madrid]], where he was detained and jailed for several months. After receiving a pardon from the Ministry of Overseas, Don Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, he remained in Madrid for three years collaborating for the newspapers ''[[El Globo]]'', ''El Heraldo'', and ''[[El Liberal]]''.

==Return to Puerto Rico and political career==

Abril y Ostalo then moved to [[Venezuela]] and then to [[United States]]. When the [[Spanish–American War]] ended in 1898, he returned to Puerto Rico and joined [[Luis Muñoz Rivera]] in his political fight. He became a member of the [[Puerto Rico House of Representatives]] in 1904, and then of the [[1st Puerto Rican Senate|first Senate of Puerto Rico]] in 1917, representing the [[Puerto Rico Senatorial district VI|District of Guayama]]. He was again reelected in 1920, this time as a [[At-large|Senator at-large]].

==Writings and later years==

Abril continued to collaborate with newspapers and magazines like ''Revista de las Antillas'', ''Puerto Rico Ilustrado'', and ''[[El Mundo (Puerto Rico)|El Mundo]]'', as well as the Cuban publication ''Las Antillas''. He also wrote poems which were compiled in the 1900 book ''Amorosas''. Other of his books were ''Sensaciones de un cronista'' (1903) and ''[[Antonio Valero de Bernabé|Un héroe de la independencia de España y América: Antonio Valero de Bernabé]]'' (1929).

Abril y Ostalo was the first president of the Puerto Rican Academy of History and since 1931 served as [[Official Historian of Puerto Rico]], until his death on December 5, 1935. He is buried at [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Abril&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=375347&amp;GRid=122198377&amp; Puerto Rico Memorial Cemetery].

'''Michael Grant Ignatieff''' {{post-nominals|PC|CM|country=CAN}} ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ɡ|ˈ|n|æ|t|i|ɛ|f}}; born May 12, 1947) is a Canadian author, academic and former politician. He was the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Official Opposition]] from 2008 until 2011. Known for his work as a historian, Ignatieff has held senior academic posts at the universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[University of Toronto|Toronto]].

While living in the United Kingdom from 1978 to 2000, Ignatieff became well known as a television and radio broadcaster and as an editorial columnist for ''[[The Observer]]''. His documentary series ''Blood and Belonging: Journeys into the New Nationalism'' aired on [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in 1993, and won a Canadian [[Gemini Award]]. His book of the same name, based on the series, won the Gordon Montador Award for Best Canadian Book on Social Issues and the University of Toronto's [[Lionel Gelber Prize]].&lt;ref name="The Lionel Gelber Prize"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://munkschool.utoronto.ca/gelber/|accessdate= 24 May 2015|title=The Lionel Gelber Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt; His memoir, ''The Russian Album'', won Canada's [[Governor General's Literary Award]] and the British [[Royal Society of Literature]]'s Heinemann Prize in 1988. His novel, ''Scar Tissue'', was short-listed for the [[Booker Prize]] in 1994. In 2000, he delivered the [[Massey Lectures]], entitled ''The Rights Revolution,'' which was released in print later that year.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], Ignatieff was elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] as the [[Member of the Canadian House of Commons|Member of Parliament]] for [[Etobicoke—Lakeshore]]. That same year, he ran for the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006|leadership of the Liberal Party]], ultimately losing to [[Stéphane Dion]]. He served as the party's deputy leader under Dion. After Dion's resignation in the wake of the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 election]], Ignatieff served as [[Interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]] from December 2008 until he was elected leader at the party's [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2009|May 2009 convention]].&lt;ref name="interim"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/10/ignatieff-caucus.html |title= Ignatieff named interim Liberal leader |publisher=CBC News| date= December 10, 2008| accessdate=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]], Ignatieff lost his own seat in the Liberal Party's worst showing in its history. Winning only 34 seats, the party placed a distant third behind the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|NDP]], and thus lost its position as the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2011/2011-03-28-x1/html/si-tr34-eng.html Proclamation Summoning Parliament to Meet on May 30, 2011].

Following his electoral defeat, Ignatieff taught at the [[University of Toronto]]. In 2013, he returned to the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] part-time, splitting his time between Harvard and Toronto. On July 1, 2014, he returned to Harvard full-time.&lt;ref name=murrow/&gt; In 2016, he left Harvard to become president and rector of the [[Central European University]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/michael-ignatieffs-journey-from-politician-to-academic-freedom-fighter/article31943341|title=Michael Ignatieff’s journey from politician to academic freedom fighter|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=May 9, 2018|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelignatieff.ca/biography/] "Between 2014 and 2016 he was Edward R.

In December 2016, Ignatieff was named a [[Member of the Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/order-canada-newest-appointees-2016-150-1.3916634 "Order of Canada's newest appointees include Paralympian, Supreme Court judge and astrophysicist"]. [[CBC News]], December 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Ignatieff was born on May 12, 1947 in [[Toronto]], the elder son of Russian-born Canadian [[Rhodes Scholar]] and diplomat [[George Ignatieff]], and his Canadian-born wife, Jessie Alison (née Grant). Ignatieff's family moved abroad regularly in his early childhood as his father rose in the diplomatic ranks. George Ignatieff was a diplomat and [[chief of staff to the prime minister]] under [[Lester Bowles Pearson]]. He also worked for Pearson's leadership campaigns.

At the age of 11, Ignatieff was sent back to Toronto to attend [[Upper Canada College]] as a boarder in 1959. At UCC, Ignatieff was elected a [[Upper Canada College Board of Stewards|school prefect]] as Head of [[Upper Canada College houses#Wedd's|Wedd's House]], was the captain of the varsity soccer team, and served as editor-in-chief of the school's yearbook.&lt;ref name="beingignatieff"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/being-michael-ignatieff/article4325078/?page=all | accessdate = 24 May 2015 | work = The Globe and Mail | date = August 26, 2006 | title = Being Michael Ignatieff | first = Michael | last=Valpy | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As well, Ignatieff volunteered for the Liberal Party during the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 federal election]] by canvassing the York South riding. He resumed his work for the Liberal Party in 1968, as a national youth organizer and party delegate for the [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]] party leadership campaign.

After high school, Ignatieff studied history at the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] (B.A., 1969).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danzarella.com/browse.php?u=Oi8vYm9va3MuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9ib29rcz9pZD1ZS2ZScHJ3WERib0MmcGc9UEE2MjkmbHBnPVBBNjMwJmRxPW94Zm9yZCslMjJtaWNoYWVsK2lnbmF0aWVmZiUyMitpbnRpdGxlOndobyZscj0mYXNfZHJyYl9pcz1xJmFzX21pbm1faXM9MCZhc19taW55X2lzPSZhc19tYXhtX2lzPTAmYXNfbWF4eV9pcz0mbnVtPTEwMCZhc19icnI9MA==&amp;b=61|title=HugeDomains.com - DanZarElla.com is for sale (Dan Zar Ella)|author=|date=|website=www.danzarella.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There, he met fellow student [[Bob Rae]], from [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]], who was a [[debating]] opponent and fourth-year roommate. After completing his undergraduate degree, Ignatieff took up his studies at the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied under, and was influenced by, the famous liberal philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin|Sir Isaiah Berlin]], whom he would later write about. While an undergraduate at the University of Toronto, he was a part-time reporter for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' in 1964–65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/2001/jan/24we.html |title=January 24, 2001 |publisher=Bulletin.uwaterloo.ca |date=January 24, 2001 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1976, Ignatieff completed his PhD in History at Harvard University. He was granted a Cambridge M.A. by incorporation in 1978 on taking up a fellowship at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] there.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

== University professor, writer, broadcaster ==

=== Early career ===
Ignatieff was an assistant professor of history at the [[University of British Columbia]] from 1976 to 1978. In 1978 he moved to the United Kingdom, where he held a senior research fellowship at [[King's College, Cambridge]], until 1984. He then left Cambridge for London, where he began to focus on his career as a writer and journalist. His book ''The Russian Album'' documented a history of his family's experiences in nineteenth-century Russia (and subsequent exile), and won the [[1987 Governor General's Awards|1987 Governor General's Award for Non-Fiction]] and the British [[Royal Society of Literature]]'s Heinemann Prize in Canada.

During this time, he traveled extensively. He also continued to lecture at universities in Europe and North America, and held teaching posts at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], the [[University of London]], the [[London School of Economics]], the [[University of California]] and in France. While living in Britain, Ignatieff became well known as a broadcaster on radio and television. His best-known television work has been ''Voices'' on [[Channel 4]], the [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] discussion programme ''Thinking Aloud'' and [[BBC Two|BBC 2]]'s arts programme, ''[[The Late Show (BBC2)|The Late Show]]''.  He was also an editorial columnist for ''[[The Observer]]'' from 1990 to 1993.

His documentary series ''Blood and Belonging: Journeys into the New Nationalism'' aired on [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in 1993, winning a Canadian [[Gemini Award]]. He later adapted this series into a book, ''Blood and Belonging: Journeys into the New Nationalism'', detailing the dangers of [[ethnic nationalism]] in the post-Cold War period. This book won the Gordon Montador Award for Best Canadian Book on Social Issues and the University of Toronto's [[Lionel Gelber Prize]].&lt;ref name="The Lionel Gelber Prize"/&gt; Ignatieff also wrote the novel, ''Scar Tissue'', which was short-listed for the [[Booker Prize]] in 1994.

In 1998, he was on the first panel of the long-running [[BBC Radio]] discussion series ''[[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]]''. Around this time, his 1998 biography of [[Isaiah Berlin]] was shortlisted for both the Jewish Quarterly Literary Prize for Non-Fiction and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

=== Human rights policy ===
In 2000, Ignatieff accepted a position as the director of the [[Carr Center for Human Rights Policy]] at the [[Kennedy School of Government|John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cceia.org/people/data/michael_ignatieff.html |title=Michael Ignatieff |publisher=[[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatieff's influence on policy continued to grow, helping to prepare the report ''The Responsibility to Protect'' for the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]]. This report examined the role of international involvement in Kosovo and [[Rwanda]], and advocated a framework for 'humanitarian' intervention in future humanitarian crises. He delivered the [[Massey Lectures]] in 2000, entitled ''The Rights Revolution,'' which was released in print later that year. He would eventually become a participant and panel leader at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Geneva.

2001 marked the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, renewing academic interest in issues of foreign policy and nation building. Ignatieff's text on Western [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] policies and nation building, ''Virtual War: Kosovo and Beyond,'' won the Orwell Prize for political non-fiction in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/the-award/winners-books.aspx?year%3D277 |accessdate=13 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707223605/http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/the-award/winners-books.aspx?year=277 |archivedate=July 7, 2009 |title=Winners: 2001 |publisher=The Orwell Prize. theorwellprize.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a journalist, Ignatieff observed that the United States had established "an [[empire lite]], a global hegemony whose grace notes are free markets, human rights and democracy, enforced by the most awesome military power the world has ever known."&lt;ref name="burden"/&gt; This became the subject of his 2003 book ''Empire Lite: Nation-Building in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan'', which argued that America had a responsibility to create a "humanitarian empire" through nation-building and, if necessary, military force.&lt;ref name="empirelite"/&gt; This would become a frequent topic in his lectures. At the Amnesty 2005 Lecture in Dublin, he offered evidence to show that "we wouldn't have international human rights without the leadership of the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio4all.net/index.php/program/10935 |title=Program Information, Amnesty Lecture 2005: Michael Ignatieff at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland |publisher=Radio4all.net |date=January 13, 2005 |accessdate= 28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignatieff's interventionist approach led him to support the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name="living dangerously"/&gt; According to Ignatieff, the United States had a duty to expend itself unseating Iraqi president [[Saddam Hussein]] in the interests of international security and human rights. Ignatieff initially accepted the argument of [[George W. Bush]] administration that containment through sanctions and threats would not prevent Hussein from selling [[weapons of mass destruction]] to [[terrorism|international terrorists]]. Ignatieff wrongly believed that those [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons were still being developed in Iraq]].&lt;ref name="burden"&gt;{{cite news  | first = Michael | last = Ignatieff |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E6DA143FF936A35752C0A9659C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=The%20Burden%20Ignatieff&amp;st=cse | title = The Burden |work = The New York Times Magazine |date = January 5, 2003 |accessdate = 11 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he published ''[[The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror]],'' a philosophical work analyzing human rights in the post-9/11 world. Ignatieff argued that there may be circumstances where [[sentence (law)|indefinite]] [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] or coercive [[interrogation]]s may need to be used on terror suspects to combat terrorism.&lt;ref name="McQuaig 2007"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://thetyee.ca/Books/2007/05/01/McQuaig | title = Sidekicks to American Empire | first = Linda | last=McQuaig| publisher=Random House|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worldbeaters: Michael Ignatieff"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.newint.org/issue385/worldbeaters.htm | title = Worldbeaters: Michael Ignatieff | publisher = New Internationalist Magazine | year = 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091006210425/http://www.newint.org/issue385/worldbeaters.htm | archivedate = October 6, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic institutions would need to evolve to protect human rights, finding a way to keep these necessary evils from offending democracy as much as the evils they are meant to prevent.&lt;ref name="lesser evils"/&gt; The book attracted considerable attention. It was a finalist for the [[Lionel Gelber Prize]], but also earned him some criticism. In 2005, he was criticized by his peers on the editorial board for the ''[[Index on Censorship]]'', where human rights advocate Conor Gearty said Ignatieff fell into a category of "hand-wringing, apologetic apologists for human-rights abuses". Ignatieff responded by resigning from the editorial board for the ''Index'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ft.com/content/5204b8d0-88b1-11da-94a6-0000779e2340 | title = The great bright hope | work = Financial Times | author = Craig Offman | date = January 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has maintained that he supports a complete ban on torture.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/iftortureworks | title = If torture works... | first = Michael | last = Ignatieff | work = Prospect |date=April 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, Ignatieff's writings on human rights and foreign affairs earned him the 37th rank on a list of most influential public intellectuals prepared by ''Prospect'' and ''Foreign Policy'' magazines.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt;

=== Return to Canadian academia ===
{{See also|#Political career}}
Around 2005, Ignatieff became more frequently mentioned as a possible Liberal candidate for the next federal election, and rumors swirled about the beginnings of a [[#Political career|political career]]. At this time, he left Harvard to become the Chancellor Jackman Professor in Human Rights Policy at the [[University of Toronto]] and a senior fellow of the university's [[Munk Centre for International Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/9/16/ignatieff-to-leave-for-canadian-professorship/ |title=Ignatieff To Leave For Canadian Professorship |publisher=[[Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to write about the subject of Iraq, reiterating his support, if not the method in which it was conducted.
According to Ignatieff, "what Saddam Hussein had done to the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurds]] and the [[Shi'a Islam|Shia]]" in Iraq was sufficient justification for the invasion.&lt;ref name="canworld"&gt;{{cite news  | first = Michael | last = Ignatieff |url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/text-of-ignatieff-speech/article23004198/ | title = Canada and the World |work = The Globe and Mail |date = March 30, 2006 |accessdate = 24 May 2015 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asithappens"&gt;{{cite news | first = Mary Lou | last = Finlay |author2=Budd, Barbara | url = http://www.cbc.ca/radioshows/AS_IT_HAPPENS/20060407.shtml| title = As it Happens | publisher = CBC Radio |date = April 7, 2006 |accessdate = 11 August 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070222003607/http://www.cbc.ca/radioshows/AS_IT_HAPPENS/20060407.shtml |archivedate = February 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His support for the war began to wane as time passed. "I supported an administration whose intentions I didn't trust," he averred, "believing that the consequences would repay the gamble. Now I realize that intentions do shape consequences."&lt;ref name="living dangerously"/&gt; He eventually recanted his support for the war entirely. In a 2007 ''[[New York Times]] Magazine'' article, he wrote: "The unfolding catastrophe in Iraq has condemned the political judgment of a president, but it has also condemned the judgment of many others, myself included, who as commentators supported the invasion." Ignatieff partly interpreted what he now saw as his particular errors of judgment, by presenting them as typical of academics and intellectuals in general, whom he characterised as "generalizing and interpreting particular facts as instances of some big idea". In politics, by contrast, "Specifics matter more than generalities".&lt;ref name="RecantingIraqStance"&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Ignatieff | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/magazine/05iraq-t.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1343966400&amp;en=13354304 | title = Getting Iraq Wrong | work = The New York Times |date = April 5, 2007 |accessdate = 9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Moyn]], Harvard University historian of human rights and humanitarian intervention, asserts that Ignatieff is among those whose who "soiled their reputations" through their defence of the Iraq war, and labelled his later public apology "embarrassingly vacuous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moyn|first=Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Moyn|title=Human Rights and the Uses of History|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/human-rights-and-the-uses-of-history/oclc/892893476|year=2014|publisher=Verso|location=New York|isbn=1781682631|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post politics academic career and return to Harvard===
In mid-2011, following his electoral defeat, Ignatieff became a senior resident with the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[Massey College]], where he taught courses in law and political science for the [[Munk School of Global Affairs]], the [[University of Toronto School of Public Policy and Governance|School of Public Policy and Governance]], and the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/michael-ignatieff-jumps-to-university-of-toronto/article2011390/ "Michael Ignatieff jumps to University of Toronto"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', May 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, Ignatieff rejoined the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] and divided his time between Toronto and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunn|first=Marj|title=Michael Ignatieff returns to Harvard|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/09/07/michael-ignatieff-returns-to-harvard|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=Toronto Sun|date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Ignatieff returned to Harvard full-time, and left the University of Toronto, to become Edward R. Murrow Chair of Press, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School effective July 1, 2014.&lt;ref name=murrow&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Ignatieff gets full-time Harvard job|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/michael-ignatieff-gets-full-time-harvard-job/article19305712/|accessdate=June 24, 2014|work=The Globe and Mail|date=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President and Rector of Central European University===

On May 5, 2016, it was announced that Michael Ignatieff would succeed [[John Shattuck]] to become the fifth president and rector of the [[Central European University]] (CEU) in [[Budapest, Hungary]].&lt;ref name=IgnatieffRector&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Michael Ignatieff Elected 5th President and Rector of CEU |url=https://www.ceu.edu/article/2016-05-05/michael-ignatieff-elected-5th-president-and-rector-ceu |newspaper=Central European University Newsroom |date=May 5, 2016 |access-date=May 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, he was appointed the rector with the term ending on August 31, 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ceu.edu/article/2016-09-02/ignatieff-appointed-rector-ceu|title=Ignatieff Appointed Rector of CEU|date=September 2, 2016|publisher=Central European University|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatieff is overseeing a tumultuous period in the university's history, during which it has accused the Hungarian government of challenging its legal right to continue to operate in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Liberal Hungarian university warns Viktor Orbán could force it abroad"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/central-european-university-ready-to-move-out-of-hungary|title=Liberal Hungarian university warns Viktor Orbán could force it abroad|date=May 15, 2018|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of Ignatieff and CEU is that the intervention from the Hungarian government is part of a wider vendetta on the part of prime minister [[Viktor Orbán]] against wealthy financier [[George Soros]], the university's chief benefactor.&lt;ref name="Liberal Hungarian university warns Viktor Orbán could force it abroad" /&gt; Ignatieff's personal position is that the strain between the Hungarian government and CEU is part of a wider tension in Europe between democratic ideals and authoritarian tendencies within the European conservative right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/michael-ignatieff-warns-europe-future-viktor-orban-hungary-budapest-university|title=Europe’s future hangs in balance, says head of a Budapest university|date=September 9, 2018|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fictional works ===
His fictional works, ''Asya'', ''Scar Tissue'', and ''Charlie Johnson in the Flames'' cover, respectively, the life and travels of a Russian girl, the disintegration of one's mother due to neurological disease, and the haunting memories of a journalist in Kosovo. The works are to some extent autobiographical; for instance, Ignatieff travelled to the Balkans and [[Kurdistan]] while working as a journalist, witnessing first hand the consequences of modern ethnic warfare.

=== Historian and biographer ===
A historian by training, he wrote ''A Just Measure of Pain,'' a history of prisons during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. His biography of [[Isaiah Berlin]] reveals the strong impression the celebrated philosopher made on Ignatieff. Philosophical writings by Ignatieff include ''The Needs of Strangers'' and ''The Rights Revolution.'' The latter work explores social welfare and community, and shows Berlin's influence on Ignatieff. These tie closely to Ignatieff's political writings on national self-determination and the imperatives of democratic self-government. Ignatieff has also written extensively on international affairs.&lt;ref name="CW"/&gt; His historical memoir, ''The Russian Album,'' traces his family's life in Russia and their troubles and subsequent emigration as a result of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]].

=== Canadian studies ===
In ''The Rights Revolution'', Ignatieff identifies three aspects of Canada's approach to human rights that give the country its distinctive culture: 1) On moral issues, Canadian law is secular and liberal, approximating European standards more closely than American ones; 2) Canadian political culture is [[social democratic]], and Canadians take it for granted that citizens have the right to free health care and public assistance; 3) Canadians place a particular emphasis on group rights, expressed in Quebec's language laws and in treaty agreements that recognize collective aboriginal rights. "Apart from New Zealand, no other country has given such recognition to the idea of group rights," he writes.&lt;ref name="rights"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Ignatieff  | first = Michael  | title = The Rights Revolution  | publisher = [[House of Anansi Press]]  | year = 2000  | isbn = 0-88784-656-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignatieff states that despite its admirable commitment to equality and group rights, Canadian society still places an unjust burden on women and gays and lesbians, and he says it is still difficult for newcomers of non-British or French descent to form an enduring sense of citizenship. Ignatieff attributes this to the "patch-work quilt of distinctive societies," emphasizing that civic bonds will only be easier when the understanding of Canada as a multinational community is more widely shared.

=== International studies ===
Ignatieff has written extensively on international development, peacekeeping and the international responsibilities of Western nations. ''Blood and Belonging'', a 1993 work, explores the duality of nationalism, from [[Yugoslavia]] to [[Northern Ireland]]. It is the first of a trilogy of books that explore modern conflicts. ''The Warrior's Honour'', published in 1998, deals with ethnically motivated conflicts, including the conflicts in Afghanistan and Rwanda. The final book, ''Virtual War'', describes the problems of modern peacekeeping, with special reference to the [[Kosovo Force|NATO presence in Kosovo]].

His 2003 book ''Empire Lite'' attracted considerable attention for suggesting that America, the world's last remaining superpower, should create a "humanitarian empire". This book continued his criticism of the limited-risk approach practiced by [[NATO]] in conflicts like the [[Kosovo War]] and the [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref name="empirelite"/&gt; Ignatieff became an advocate for more active involvement and larger scale deployment of land forces by Western nations in future conflicts in the [[developing country|developing world]]. Ignatieff was originally a prominent supporter of the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name="living dangerously"&gt;{{cite news  | first = Michael |last = Ignatieff |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/14/magazine/14WWLN.html?ex=1155441600&amp;en=702afeea45f58a4f&amp;ei=5070 | title = The Year of Living Dangerously |work = The New York Times Magazine |date = March 14, 2004 |accessdate = 24 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ignatieff attempts to distinguish the [[empire lite]] approach from [[neo-conservativism]] because the motives of the [[Interventionism (politics)|foreign engagement]] he advocates are essentially altruistic rather than self-serving.&lt;ref name="empirelite"&gt;''Empire Lite: Nation-Building in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan'', Minerva, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignatieff's 2004 book ''[[The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror]]'',&lt;ref name="lesserevilbook"&gt;Princeton University Press, 2004 (2003 [[Gifford Lectures]]; [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPEVIL&amp;Cover=TRUE sample chapters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416173331/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPEVIL&amp;Cover=TRUE |date=April 16, 2008 }})&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Western democracies may have to resort to "[[lesser evil]]s" like [[sentence (law)|indefinite]] [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] of suspects, coercive [[interrogation]]s,&lt;ref name="McQuaig 2007"/&gt; assassinations, and [[pre-emptive war]]s in order to combat the greater evil of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Worldbeaters: Michael Ignatieff"/&gt; He states that as a result, societies should strengthen their democratic institutions to keep these necessary evils from becoming as offensive to freedom and democracy as the threats they are meant to prevent.&lt;ref name="lesser evils"&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Ignatieff |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E6DA1F3AF931A35756C0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=lesser%20evils%20Ignatieff&amp;st=cse | title = Lesser Evils (Op-Ed)| publisher = New York Times Magazine | date = May 2, 2004 |accessdate = 24 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Lesser Evil' approach has been criticized by some prominent human rights advocates, like [[Conor Gearty]], for incorporating a problematic form of moral [[language]] that can be used to legitimize forms of torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.indexonline.org/en/news/articles/2005/1/international-legitimising-torture-with-a-li.shtml | first = Conor | last = Gearty | publisher = Index on Censorship: Torture&amp;nbsp;– A User's Manual | date = January 2005 | title = Legitimising torture&amp;nbsp;– with a little help | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051204024926/http://www.indexonline.org/en/news/articles/2005/1/international-legitimising-torture-with-a-li.shtml | archivedate = December 4, 2005 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
But other human rights advocates, like [[Human Rights Watch]]'s Kenneth Roth, have defended Ignatieff, saying his work "cannot fairly be equated with support for torture or 'torture lite'."&lt;ref name="Usborne"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-ignatieff-under-siege-6111092.html | first = David | last = Usborne | title = Michael Ignatieff: Under siege | date = January 21, 2006 |work=The Independent | location=London |accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the context of this "lesser evil" analysis, Ignatieff has discussed whether or not liberal democracies should employ coercive interrogation and [[torture]]. Ignatieff has adamantly maintained that he supports a complete ban on torture.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff"/&gt;
His definition of torture, according to his 2004 Op-ed in ''The New York Times'', does not include "forms of [[sleep deprivation]] that do not result in lasting harm to mental or physical health, together with disinformation and disorientation (like keeping prisoners in hoods)."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Ignatieff |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/magazine/lesser-evils.html?pagewanted=all | title = Lesser Evils (Op-Ed)| publisher = New York Times Magazine | date = May 2, 2004 |accessdate = 24 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of [[lesser evil]] received some criticism by the side of scholars because it implicitly attempts to legalize torture.&lt;ref&gt;Skoll, G. (2008).

In 2004, three Liberal organizers, former Liberal candidate [[Alfred Apps]], Ian Davey (son of Senator [[Keith Davey]]) and lawyer Daniel Brock, travelled to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to convince Ignatieff to move back to Canada and run for the [[House of Commons of Canada]], and to consider a possible bid for the Liberal leadership should Paul Martin retire.&lt;ref&gt;Global TV News (2008).[http://election.globaltv.com/leaders/michaelignatieff.aspx "Election2008 Key Candidates Michael Ignatieff." Global.Retrieved on: March 17,2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423050631/http://election.globaltv.com/leaders/michaelignatieff.aspx |date=April 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rocco Rossi]], who was at that time a key Liberal Party organizer, had previously mentioned to Davey that Davey's father had said that Ignatieff had "the makings of a prime minister".&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, John (September 4, 2006). [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quotrainmakersquot-son-backs-ignatieff/ "Rainmaker's" Son Backs Ignatieff."] ''Maclean's''. Retrieved May 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, as a result of the efforts of Apps, Brock and Davey, press speculation that Ignatieff could be a [[star candidate]] for the Liberals in the next election, and possibly a candidate to eventually succeed Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]], the leader of the governing [[Liberal Party of Canada]].

After months of rumours and several denials, Ignatieff confirmed in November 2005 that he would run for a seat in the House of Commons in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|winter 2006 election]]. It was announced that Ignatieff would seek the Liberal nomination in the Toronto riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore.

Some [[Ukrainian-Canadian]] members of the [[riding association]] objected to the nomination, citing a perceived anti-Ukrainian sentiment in ''Blood and Belonging'', where Ignatieff said: "I have reasons to take the Ukraine seriously indeed. But, to be honest, I'm having trouble. Ukrainian independence conjures up images of peasants in embroidered shirts, the nasal whine of ethnic instruments, phony Cossacks in cloaks and boots..."&lt;ref name="Usborne"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20051127/ignatieff_election_051127/20051127/?hub=TorontoHome|accessdate=20 April 2006|title=Toronto group opposes Ignatieff's election bid|date=November 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics also questioned his commitment to Canada, pointing out that Ignatieff had lived outside of Canada for more than 30 years and had referred to himself as an American many times. When asked about it by [[Peter C. Newman|Peter Newman]] in a ''[[Maclean's]]'' interview published on April 6, 2006, Ignatieff said: "Sometimes you want to increase your influence over your audience by appropriating their voice, but it was a mistake. Every single one of the students from 85 countries who took my courses at Harvard knew one thing about me: I was that funny Canadian."&lt;ref name="macleans"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/politics/article.jsp?content=20060410_124769_124769 | accessdate=20 April 2006 | work=Maclean's | date=April 6, 2006 | title = Q&amp;A with Liberal leadership contender Michael Ignatieff|first=Peter C.|last=Newman |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060415025347/http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/politics/article.jsp?content=20060410_124769_124769 |archivedate = April 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two other candidates filed for the nomination but were disqualified (one, because he was not a member of the party and the second because he had failed to resign from his position on the [[riding association]] executive). Ignatieff went on to defeat the Conservative candidate by a margin of roughly 5,000 votes to win the [[constituency|seat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/scripts/OVR2006/default.html |title=Ovr / Ros |publisher=Elections.ca |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership bid ===
After the Liberal government was defeated in the January 2006 federal election, [[Paul Martin]] resigned the party leadership in March that same year. On April 7, 2006, Ignatieff announced his candidacy in the upcoming [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006|Liberal leadership race]], joining several others who had already declared their candidacy.

Ignatieff received [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006#Michael Ignatieff|several high-profile endorsements]] of his candidacy. His campaign was headed by [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] [[David Paul Smith|David Smith]], who had been a [[Jean Chrétien|Chrétien]] organizer, along with [[Ian Davey]], [[Daniel Brock]], [[Alfred Apps]] and [[Paul Lalonde]], a Toronto lawyer and son of [[Marc Lalonde]].&lt;ref name="macleans2"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/politics/article.jsp?content=20060403_124360_124360|first=John|last=Geddes|title=Bill Graham's big job|date=March 29, 2006|accessdate=11 August 2006 | work=Maclean's |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060415063915/http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/politics/article.jsp?content=20060403_124360_124360 |archivedate = April 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An impressive team of policy advisors was assembled, led by Toronto lawyer Brad Davis, and including Brock, fellow lawyers Mark Sakamoto, Sachin Aggarwal, Jason Rosychuck, Jon Penney, Nigel Marshman, Alex Mazer, Will Amos, and Alix Dostal, former Ignatieff student Jeff Anders, banker Clint Davis, economists Blair Stransky, Leslie Church and Ellis Westwood, and Liberal operatives Alexis Levine, Marc Gendron, Mike Pal, [[Julie Dzerowicz]], Patrice Ryan, Taylor Owen and Jamie Macdonald.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff Policy"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politiquebec.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=20984&amp;sid=d9beef2e4b316dd9e935103900d8e2ec| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309084426/http://politiquebec.com/forum/viewtopic.php?&amp;t=20984| dead-url=yes| archive-date=March 9, 2016| title=A Liberal Revolution| date=September 26, 2006| accessdate=11 October 2006| work=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the selection of delegates in the party's "Super Weekend" exercise on the last weekend of September, Ignatieff gained more support from delegates than other candidates with 30% voting for him.

In August 2006, Ignatieff said he was "not losing any sleep" over dozens of civilian deaths caused by [[Israel]]'s attack on [[Qana]] during its military actions in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060810/ignatieff_mideast_060810?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |title=Ignatieff admits gaffe over Mideast conflict |publisher=CTV |date=August 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075602/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060810/ignatieff_mideast_060810?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |archivedate=June 20, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ignatieff recanted those words the following week. Then, on October 11, 2006, Ignatieff described the Qana attack as a war crime (committed by Israel). [[Susan Kadis]], who had previously been Ignatieff's campaign co-chair, withdrew her support following the comment. Other Liberal leadership candidates have also criticized Ignatieff's comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=80789bca-0e55-4e09-a027-9766b4deb520&amp;k=3758 |title=Campaign organizer abandons Ignatieff over war crimes comment |first=Joan |last=Bryden |work=The Gazette|location=Montreal |date=October 12, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313175041/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=80789bca-0e55-4e09-a027-9766b4deb520&amp;k=3758 |archivedate=March 13, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ariela Cotler, a Jewish community leader and the wife of prominent Liberal MP [[Irwin Cotler]], left the party following Ignatieff's comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cotler's wife quits Liberals over Ignatieff comments|agency=The Canadian Press|date=October 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ignatieff later qualified his statement, saying "Whether war crimes were committed in the attack on Qana is for international bodies to determine.  That doesn't change the fact that Qana was a terrible tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Wattie and Allan Woods, "Ignatieff fights back over Mideast", ''Calgary Herald'', October 14, 2006, A13.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, Ignatieff announced that he would visit [[Israel]], to meet with Israeli and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] leaders and "learn first-hand their view of the situation". He noted that [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and Israel's own [[B'Tselem]] have stated that war crimes were committed in Qana, describing the suggestion as "a serious matter precisely because Israel has a record of compliance, concern and respect for the laws of war and human rights".&lt;ref&gt;Louise Brown, "Ignatieff set to visit Israel", ''Toronto Star'', October 14, 2006, A20.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ignatieff added that he would not meet with Palestinian leaders who did not recognize Israel. However, the Jewish organization sponsoring the trip subsequently cancelled it, because of too much media attention.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==== Montreal Convention ====
At the leadership convention in [[Montreal]], taking place at [[Palais des congrès de Montréal|Palais des Congrès]], Ignatieff entered as the apparent front-runner, having elected more delegates to the convention than any other contender. However, polls consistently showed he had weak second-ballot support, and those delegates not already tied to him would be unlikely to support him later.

On December 1, 2006, Michael Ignatieff led the leadership candidates on the first ballot, garnering 29% support. The subsequent ballots were cast the following day, and Ignatieff managed a small increase, to 31% on the second ballot, good enough to maintain his lead over [[Bob Rae]], who had attracted 24% support, and [[Stéphane Dion]], who garnered 20%. However, due to massive movement towards [[Stéphane Dion]] by delegates who supported [[Gerard Kennedy]], Ignatieff dropped to second on the third ballot. Shortly before voting for the third ballot was completed, with the realization that there was a Dion-Kennedy pact, Ignatieff campaign co-chair [[Denis Coderre]] made an appeal to [[Bob Rae]] to join forces and prevent Dion from winning the Liberal Party leadership (on the basis that Stephane Dion's ardent federalism would alienate Quebecers), but Rae turned down the offer and opted to release his delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061202/liberal_balloting_061202/20061202?hub=TopStories |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205095949/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061202/liberal_balloting_061202/20061202?hub=TopStories |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 5, 2006 |agency=The Canadian Press |date=December 2, 2006 |title='Gesture' might have helped trigger Dion win |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of the Kennedy delegates, Dion jumped up to 37% support on the third ballot, in contrast to Ignatieff's 34% and Rae's 29%. [[Bob Rae]] was eliminated and the bulk of his delegates opted to vote for Dion rather than Ignatieff. In the fourth and final round of voting, Ignatieff took 2084 votes and lost the contest to [[Stéphane Dion]], who won with 2,521 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061202.wlibsfinalballot1202/BNStory/LiberalBackgrounder/home|work=The Globe and Mail|title=Dion surges to victory, defeating Ignatieff| first=Clark| last=Campbell|date=December 2, 2006|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignatieff confirmed that he would run as the Liberal MP for Etobicoke—Lakeshore in the next federal election.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ignatieff-rae-indicate-they-ll-run-in-next-election-1.624538|title=Ignatieff, Rae indicate they'll run in next election|date=December 4, 2006| accessdate= 13 April 2014 | publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deputy leadership ===
On December 18, 2006, new Liberal leader [[Stéphane Dion]] named Ignatieff his deputy leader, in line with Dion's plan to give high-ranking positions to each of his former leadership rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ignatieff-tapped-as-liberal-deputy-leader-1.584410|title=Ignatieff tapped as Liberal deputy leader|publisher=CBC News|date=December 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During three by-elections held on September 18, 2007, the ''Halifax Chronicle-Herald'' reported that unidentified Dion supporters were accusing Ignatieff's supporters of undermining by-election efforts, with the goal of showing that Dion could not hold on to the party's Quebec base.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Delacourt (September 18, 2007).

=== Interim leadership of the Liberal Party ===
[[File:Obama and Ignatieff in Ottawa 2009.jpg|thumb|right|295px|Ignatieff with US President [[Barack Obama]] in Ottawa on February 19, 2009]]
Dion announced that he would schedule his departure as Liberal leader for the next party convention, after the Liberals lost seats and support in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]]. Ignatieff held a news conference on November 13, 2008, to once again announce his candidacy for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington, Les (2008) [https://www.thestar.com/article/536753 Ignatieff vows a new course], Toronto Star, November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[2008 Canadian parliamentary dispute|Liberals reached an accord]] with the other opposition parties to form a coalition and defeat the government, Ignatieff reluctantly endorsed it. He was reportedly uncomfortable with a coalition with the NDP and support from the Bloc Québécois, and has been described as one of the last Liberals to sign on.&lt;ref&gt;Ivison, John (2008) [https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/politics/story.html?id=1016916 Ignatieff touted to lead Liberal-NDP coalition] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081204064015/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/politics/story.html?id=1016916 |date=December 4, 2008 }} National Post, December 1, 2008

After the announcement to [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute|prorogue]] Parliament, delaying the non-confidence motion until January 2009, Dion announced his intention to stay on as leader until the party selected a new one.&lt;ref name="english.people.com.cn"/&gt;

Leadership contender [[Dominic LeBlanc]] dropped out and threw his support behind Ignatieff. On December 9, the other remaining opponent for the Liberal Party leadership, [[Bob Rae]], withdrew from the race, leaving Ignatieff as the presumptive winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rae-bows-out-offers-unqualified-support-for-ignatieff-as-liberal-leader-1.732354|title=Rae bows out, offers 'unqualified' support for Ignatieff as Liberal leader|date=December 9, 2008|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 10, he was formally declared the interim leader in a caucus meeting, and his position was ratified at the May 2009 convention.&lt;ref name="interim"/&gt;

On February 19, 2009, during U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s election visit to [[Ottawa]] to meet Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], which was the President's first foreign trip since taking office, Obama also met with Ignatieff as per parliamentary protocol where the leader of the opposition meets foreign dignitaries. Their discussion included climate change, Afghanistan and human rights.

=== Leadership ===
On May 2, 2009, Ignatieff was officially endorsed as the leader of the Liberal Party by 97% of delegates at the party convention in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ignatieff-slams-harper-for-failure-to-unite-canada-1.775666|title=Ignatieff slams Harper for 'failure to unite Canada'|date=May 2, 2009|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The vote was mostly a formality as the other candidates had stepped down.

On August 31, 2009, Ignatieff announced that the Liberal Party would withdraw support for the government of Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]. However, the NDP under [[Jack Layton]] abstained and the Conservatives survived the confidence motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCATRE58T4BE20091001 |title=Canada's government survives non-confidence motion &amp;#124; Canada |agency=Reuters |date=October 1, 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ignatieff's attempt to force a September 2009 election was reported as a miscalculation, as polls showed that most Canadians did not want another election. Ignatieff's popularity as well as that of the Liberals dropped off considerably immediately afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=2221709 Ignatieff closing in on Dion territory]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} National Post:November 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 2011, Ignatieff introduced a motion of [[Motion of no confidence|non-confidence]] against the Harper government to attempt to force a [[Canadian federal election, 2011|May 2011 federal election]] after the government was found to be in [[contempt of Parliament]], the first such occurrence in [[Contempt of Parliament#Contempt citation cases for governments|Commonwealth history]]. The House of Commons passed the motion by 156–145.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/canada-watches-its-democracy-erode/story-e6frg6ux-1226030310248 |title=Canada watches its democracy erode'|date=March 30, 2011|work=The Australian|accessdate=30 March 2011|first=Ramesh|last=Thakur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberals had considerable momentum when the writ was dropped, and Ignatieff successfully squeezed NDP leader [[Jack Layton]] out of media attention, by issuing challenges to Harper for one-on-one debates. In the first couple weeks of the campaign, Ignatieff kept his party in second place in the polls, and his personal ratings exceeded that of Layton for the first time. However opponents frequently criticized Ignatieff's perceived political opportunism, particularly during the [[leaders debate]]s when Layton criticized Ignatieff for having a poor attendance record for Commons votes saying "You know, most Canadians, if they don't show up for work, they don't get a promotion". Ignatieff failed to defend himself against these charges, and the debates were said to be a turning point for his party's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ignatieff-s-liberals-lose-official-opposition-status-1.1055540 |title=Ignatieff's Liberals lose Official Opposition status |publisher=CBC News |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the campaign, a late surge in support for Layton and the NDP relegated Ignatieff and the Liberals to third in the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wells |first=Paul |url=http://www.macleans.ca/authors/paul-wells/politics-turned-over/|title=The untold story of the 2011 election: Introduction and Chapter 1|work=Maclean's |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Canadian federal election, 2011|May 2, 2011]], Ignatieff's Liberals lost 43 seats only winning 34 and thus slipped to third party status behind the NDP and the Conservatives, who gained a majority in Parliament. It was the worst result in the history of the Liberal Party, the worst result in Canadian history for an incumbent Official Opposition party, and the first time since Confederation the Liberals failed to finish first or second. Ignatieff himself was defeated by Conservative challenger [[Bernard Trottier]], being the first incumbent Leader of the Official Opposition to lose his own seat since [[Charles Tupper]]'s defeat in Cape Breton in 1900, as well as the first sitting Liberal leader since [[Mackenzie King]] lost his riding in the 1945 election. Reports suggested that Ignatieff had initially promised to move into a home inside his riding, but instead he resided in the downtown Toronto neighbourhood of Yorkville, which rankled Etobicoke–Lakeshore residents and reinforced perceptions of Ignatieff's political opportunism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosh |first=Colby |url=http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-giant-killer/ |title=How Bernard Trottier upset Michael Ignatieff |work=Maclean's |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2011 Ignatieff announced that he would be resigning as leader of the party pending the appointment of an [[Interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]]; his resignation went into effect on May 25 when Bob Rae was appointed as Ignatieff's interim replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3106543 Ignatieff resigns as Liberal leader].

In 2013 Ignatieff published a book about his political career called ''Fire and Ashes: Success and Failure in Politics''. The British reviewer [[David Runciman]] commented in a book review, "for a clear-eyed, sharply observed, mordant but ultimately hopeful account of contemporary politics this memoir is hard to beat. After his defeat, a friend tries to comfort him by telling him that at least he'll get a book out of it. Ignatieff reacts with understandable fury. He didn't go into politics and through all that followed just to write a book. Still, it's some book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Runciman|first=David|title=Fire and Ashes: Success and Failure in Politics by Michael Ignatieff – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/27/michael-ignatieff-fire-ashes-review|accessdate=March 10, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable political stances ==

=== International affairs ===
In October 2006, Ignatieff indicated that he personally would not support ballistic missile defence nor the weaponization of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=f56c529c-c7c8-4133-8f9f-69be8ed7f3d0&amp;k=65028 |work=Ottawa Citizen |title=Ignatieff against Canadian role in U.S. missile defence plan |date=October 17, 2006 |first=Juliet |last=O'Neill |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111249/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=f56c529c-c7c8-4133-8f9f-69be8ed7f3d0&amp;k=65028 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to the likelihood of America developing a Missile Defense System in his book ''Virtual War'', but did not voice support for Canadian participation in such a scheme.&lt;ref name="peacemag"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.peacemagazine.org/archive/v16n4p26.htm | accessdate = 11 August 2006 | work = Peace Magazine | date = October–December 2000 | title = Review: Virtual War | first = Derek | last=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2008, and on March 30, 2009, Michael Ignatieff voted in support of ''non-binding'' motions in the House of Commons calling on the government to "allow [[conscientious objectors]]...to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations.....[(including [[Canada and Iraq War resisters|Iraq war resisters]])]...to...remain in Canada..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, on September 29, 2010, [[Canada and Iraq War resisters#Bill C-440 introduced in Parliament|when those motions were proposed as a ''binding'' private member's bill]] from Liberal MP [[Gerard Kennedy]], [[CTV News]] reported that Ignatieff "walked out during the vote."&lt;ref name="outlast"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101016/war-deserters-101016/20101016/?hub=OttawaHome| title= Outlast Harper, likely stay in Canada Chow tells war deserters|author=[[The Canadian Press]]; republished online by [[CTV Television Network]] |date= October 16, 2010|publisher=[[CTV Television Network]] online |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill then failed to pass this second reading vote by seven votes.

=== Extension of Canada's Afghanistan mission ===

Since his election to Parliament, Ignatieff has been one of the few opposition members supporting the minority Conservative government's commitment to [[Canada's role in the Afghanistan War|Canadian military activity in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=Hansard&amp;doc=25&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1#T1800 |title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 025 (Official Version) |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] called a vote in the House of Commons for May 17, 2006, on extending the Canadian Forces current deployment in [[Afghanistan]] until February 2009. During the debate, Ignatieff expressed his "unequivocal support for the troops in Afghanistan, for the mission, and also for the renewal of the mission." He argued that the Afghanistan mission tests the success of Canada's shift from "the peacekeeping paradigm to the peace-enforcement paradigm," the latter combining "military, reconstruction and humanitarian efforts together."&lt;ref name="vote divides"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/vote-divides-liberal-hawks-from-doves/article18163214/ | first = Campbell | last = Clark | title = Vote divides Liberal hawks from doves | date = May 19, 2006 | accessdate=24 May 2015 | work=The Globe and Mail | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="narrow vote"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060517/nato_afghan_060517/20060517?hub=CTVNewsAt11 | title = MPs narrowly vote to extend Afghanistan mission | date = May 17, 2006 | accessdate=11 August 2006 | publisher=CTV.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition Liberal caucus of 102 MPs was divided, with 24 MPs supporting the extension, 66 voting against, and 12 abstentions. Among Liberal leadership candidates, Ignatieff and [[Scott Brison]] voted for the extension. Ignatieff led the largest Liberal contingent of votes in favour, with at least five of his caucus supporters voting along with him to extend the mission.&lt;ref name="flat footed"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hilltimes.com/news/2006/05/22/afghanistan-vote-leaves-federal-liberals-flat-footed/16801 |url-access=subscription | first = F.

The vote was 149–145 for extending the military deployment.&lt;ref name="narrow vote" /&gt; Following the vote, Harper shook Ignatieff's hand.&lt;ref name="Harper shake"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=07a874aa-4e70-488e-b622-ab611d640a09&amp;k=26718 |first=John |last=Bryden |title=Harper may have used Afghan vote to ensare Ignatieff |date=May 18, 2006 |accessdate=11 August 2006 |work=National Post |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827061906/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=07a874aa-4e70-488e-b622-ab611d640a09&amp;k=26718 |archivedate=August 27, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent campaign appearance, Ignatieff reiterated his view of the mission in Afghanistan. He stated: "the thing that Canadians have to understand about Afghanistan is that we are well past the era of [[Lester Pearson|Pearsonian]] peacekeeping."&lt;ref name="challenges"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/National/2006/05/20/1589327-sun.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20070929090702/http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/National/2006/05/20/1589327-sun.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = September 29, 2007 | first = Kate | last = Dubinski | title = Challenges to unity many, Ignatieff says| date = May 20, 2006 | accessdate=11 August 2006 | publisher = The London Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate change policy ===
In the 2006 Liberal leadership race, Ignatieff advocated for measures to address [[climate change]], including a [[carbon tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=O'Neil, P. |date=August 21, 2006 |url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=ed009175-7814-44f0-aa99-327a4209a259 |title=Ignatieff calls for 'carbon tax' to aid climate |work=The Vancouver Sun |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624220456/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=ed009175-7814-44f0-aa99-327a4209a259 |archivedate=June 24, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2008 federal election Dion's key policy plank was his Green Shift plan, a revenue neutral carbon tax which would put a price on greenhouse gas emissions while reducing income taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dion's Green Shift Plan|url=http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/dions-green-shift-plan/|accessdate=August 27, 2012|newspaper=Money Sense|date=July 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Shift had been heavily criticized by the Conservatives and it was believed to have been a significant factor in the party's poor showing in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dion to resign after Liberals choose new leader|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/dion-to-resign-after-liberals-choose-new-leader-1.703676|accessdate=May 16, 2018|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=October 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election Ignatieff announced he would not campaign on Dion's Green Shift. In a speech to the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce in February 2009, he said; "You can't win elections if you're adding to the input costs of a farmer putting diesel into his tractor, or you're adding to the input costs of a fisherman putting diesel into his fishing boat, or a trucker transporting goods". He went onto say that; "You've got to work with the grain of Canadians and not against them. I think we learned a lesson in the last election."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whittington|first=Les|title=Dion's carbon tax plan was a vote loser, Ignatieff says|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/594543|accessdate=August 27, 2012|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, he announced that a Liberal government would implement an industrial cap-and-trade system to combat climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taber|first=Jane|title=Liberals ditch carbon tax in favour of cap-and-trade climate policy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/liberals-ditch-carbon-tax-in-favour-of-cap-and-trade-climate-policy/article1346212/|accessdate=August 27, 2012|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forming of a potential coalition government ===
During the [[Canadian general election, 2011|Spring 2011 federal election]], Ignatieff clearly ruled out the formation of a coalition government with the NDP and Bloc parties.  Contrary to the suggestion from the Conservative party that he was planning to form a government with the other opposition parties, Ignatieff issued a statement on March 26, 2011, stating that "[t]he party that wins the most seats on election day will form the government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ignatieff-rules-out-coalition/article1958015/ |title=Ignatieff rules out coalition |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=March 26, 2011| accessdate=March 29, 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Jane |last=Taber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/962267--ignatieff-swears-off-post-election-coalition?bn=1 |title=Ignatieff swears off post-election coalition|work=[[Toronto Star]]| accessdate= March 29, 2011|first=Les|last=Whittington|date=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10148">The Nile River is a major resource for the people living along it, especially thousands of years ago. The El Salha Archaeological Project discovered an abundance of evidence of an ancient boat that traveled the Nile River dating back to 3,000 years ago. Pictographs and pebble carvings were uncovered, indicating a boat more advanced than a simple canoe. This evidence of a progressed Nile boat includes a steering system which may have been used in the Nile for fishing and transportation.
==Discovery==
The earliest evidence for an ancient boat on the [[Nile]] is a [[rock art]] [[pictograph]] that dates to the [[Mesolithic]]. The El Salha Archaeological  Project  of the Italian Institute for African and Oriental Studies has been working in the central [[Sudan]] since the fall of 2000. The project's priority is the archeology of the Mesolithic and [[Neolithic]] cultures of this region of the Nile Valley. Of great interest to [[maritime archeology]] is an elongated [[burial mound]] on the west bank of the Nile, 25&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Omdurman]]. Beneath this Post-Meriotic burial and disturbed deposits was a compact, homogeneous layer of the [[Khartoum]] Mesolithic. Diagnostic gastropods were in this layer and radiocarbon dating delineates a time span of 7050 to 6820 BC.

An important artifact that speaks to the early history of boat design and [[ship]] building was found in the Khartoum Mesolithic layer. A recognizable outline of Nile boat had been cut into a granite pebble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/usai/index.html The oldest representation of a Nile boat] by D. Usai &amp; S. Salvatori, Antiquity Vol 81 issue 314 December 2007, retrieved July 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the oldest known representation of a Nile boat, and the oldest depiction of a boat that is more advanced in design than a [[canoe]]. The dating of this pictograph pushes back the earliest evidence for Nile boats by 3,000 years.

==Boat design / steering==
Some detail and aspects of boat construction can be inferred from the image on the granite pebble, as first reported by D. Usai and S. Salvatori in December, 2007. The back half of the boat image is in the best state of preservation. A steering system and cabin are situated at the approximate center of the boat. A composite steering system can be discerned with a tiller placed at a greater than 45° angle with a long pole ending in an ovoid blade. Tiller and pole with blade are fixed to the top of a vertical yoke. Boat and steering system design resemble those painted on the walls of [[Badarian]] huts and pottery jars. There are similarities with some boats  depicted in rock engravings in Nubia (Sudan); and those painted on walls and pottery in the Gerzan and [[Nagada]] cultures of [[Predynastic Egypt]].

[[File:Predynastic boat vase opt451x456 Edgerton-1927 AJSLp121-c.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Predynastic boat |Predynastic boat, pebble petroglyph &lt;3200 B.C.]]

“In particular the image of a steering gear fixed to a vertical pole inserted in the stern upper hull can be found in  boat rock engravings from the Abka region in Sudanese Nubia; and from Akkad which is south of  the third Cataract on the left  bank of the Nile in the Northern Dongola Reach. The blade strongly resembled those of the boat of El Khab. This kind of composite helm was still in use on Egyptian ships  built during the New Kingdom. The dome-like cabin on the upper hull is also a well known feature on boat representations dating to the Gerzean and Predynastic periods in Egypt and Nubia.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/usai/index.html The oldest representation of a Nile boat] by D. Usai &amp; S. Salvatori, Antiquity Vol 81 issue 314 December 2007, retrieved July 11, 2008. Additional references, see Aksamit, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The Khartoum Mesolithic boat may be said to represent the end of important, coordinated developments in boat design. The  specific features of the boat depicted on the rock from the 16 D-5 site must have been designed earlier in the Nubian Mesolithic. As this approach to hull design, cabin layout and steering mechanism are found on boats thousands of years later, it had been judged the best possible architecture for small and medium size Nile boats during the Khartoum Mesolithic. As the first and best choice in Nile boat nautical architecture, this design persisted in boat building tradition for several thousand years. Slight modifications would produce either a fishing or cargo boat.

==Mesolithic fishing boats==
Use of boats on the Nile in the Mesolithic had been proposed by W. Van Neerand in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Van Neerand, W. Fishing along the Prehistoric Nile, in: L. Krzyýaniak &amp; M. Kobusiewicz (ed.) Late Prehistory of the Nile Basin and the Sahara (Studies in African Archaeology Vol. 2): 49-56. Poznan: Poznan Archaeological Museum, 1991. Retrieved March 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Peters in 1991 &lt;ref&gt;Mesolithic Fishing along the Central Sudanese Nile and the Lower Atbara, Sahara 4: 33-40, 1991. Retrieved March 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Mesolithic Fishing along the Central Sudanese Nile and the Lower Atbara, by J. Peters, Sahara 4: 33-40. 1993. Animal exploitation between the fifth and the sixth Cataract c. 8500-7000 BP: a preliminary report on the faunas from El Damer, Abu Darbein and Aneibis, in L.Krzyýaniak, M. Kobusiewicz &amp; J. Alexander (ed.) Environmental Change and Human Culture in the Nile Basin and Northern Africa until the Second Millennium BC (Studies in African Archaeology Vol. 4): 413-9. Poznan: Poznan Archaeological Museum. Retrieved March 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the ichthyo-fauna in Mesolithic sites in Central Sudan and lower Atbara published in 1993 led Peters to postulate that well designed Nile boats were used to fish for adults of the open water species Synodotis, [[Bagrus]] and [[Lates]] on a regular basis as opposed to fortuitous situations that occur in seasonal flood pools. Lates is the infamous Nile Perch that can grow to 6'7” (2m) in length and 200&amp;nbsp;kg (440&amp;nbsp;lb) in weight.  An aggressive fish of this size requires a boat of minimum weight and maneuverability and therefore provides an indirect estimate for the dimensions and weight of Mesolithic fishing boats that plied the Central Sudanese Nile and Lower Atbara. The design of the boat depicted on the rock from the 16 D-5 site, and contextual inference for fishing, also implies a minimal level of navigation skill.

A very important question arises about hull construction. Only two options are known to be available: a hull formed from a large log (tree trunk) or built up as with a papyrus reed boat. True planked hull construction cannot be documented earlier than the 1st Dynasty with the discoveries at Tarkhan of planked hull boards that were re-used as coffin and  roof timbers &lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/Theses/abstracts/vinson.html Boats of Egypt Before the Old Kingdom] by Steve Vinson, 1987, p.39-81. Retrieved March 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However the architectural features of the Khartoum Mesolithic boat were refined and executed, they received broad acceptance among Egyptian ship builders and were widely utilized in nautical architecture during the next periods of Egyptian history. The limited opportunities provided by the [[Papyrus]] reed raft had been transcended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/majesticmoose/2425279698/ Papyrus reed boat or "tankwa", Lake Tana] by Majestic Moose. Flikr, April 2008, retrieved March 26, 2010. The use of papyrus reed rafts continued and they are still made by fishermen in Ethiopia.&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind's ability to utilize the resource opportunities provided by the broad [[Greater Upper Nile (region)|Upper Nile]] basin, and the large [[Nile delta]] of Upper Egypt had taken a quantum leap forward with this 'new' boat design as depicted on the Khartoum Mesolithic pebble.

==Naqada II==
[[File:SabuJeddi5.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Sabu-Jaddi]] Rock Art site: Nile boats]]
In [[Naqada]] II (3500-3200 BC), there are features of boat design that hearken back to Khartoum Mesolithic boat. A steering system and cabin are situated at the approximate center of the boat. A composite steering system can be discerned with a tiller placed at a greater than 45° angle with a long pole ending in an ovoid blade. Tiller and pole with blade are fixed to the top of a vertical yoke. The tall stem with leaves in the bow of these ships has long puzzled historians of ancient shipbuilding. This structure may be: a) a large branch from a tree species with large leaves; or b) the frond from a large palm tree. Either choice would catch the wind and provide important capability for steering and tacking along the Nile. The [[Palm branch (symbol)]] represented long life in ancient Egypt, and the god [[Huh (god)|Huh]] who deified eternity sometimes carried a palm frond in either hand. 

In the Predynastic and Naqada boats, cabins amidships are depicted, indeed appear to be a ubiquitous feature of Egyptian boat building for a long many centuries. The steering system with tiller positioned at a 45° angle can be identified in the stylized art style that abstracts essential features of boat design. On some boats, as depicted on the [[Sabu-Jaddi]] rock art site, a pilot stands on the roof of the ship's cabin, apparently to be better positioned to adjust the tall tiller.&lt;ref&gt; Léone Allard-Huard: Nil-Sahara.Dialogues rupestres.II.L’homme innovateur, 2000, pp.383-405.&lt;/ref&gt; This portrayal also implies that a larger boat design was an option to Naqada boat builders.

'''Nurhaci''' (8 April 1559 – 30 September 1626) was a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] chieftain who rose to prominence in the late 16th century in [[Manchuria]]. Nurhaci was part of the [[Aisin Gioro]] clan, and reigned from 1616 to his death in September 1626.

Nurhaci reorganised and united various Jurchen tribes (the later "[[Manchu people|Manchu]]"), consolidated the [[Eight Banners]] military system, and eventually launched attacks on [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] and [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]]. His conquest of [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] China's northeastern [[Liaodong]] province laid the groundwork for the [[Qing conquest of the Ming|conquest of the rest of China]] by his descendants, who founded the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1644. He is also generally credited with ordering the creation of a new written script for the [[Manchu language]] based on the [[Mongolian script|Mongolian vertical script]].

==Name and titles==
Nurhaci is written as {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠨᡠᡵᡤᠠᠴᡳ}} in [[Manchu language]]. Some suggests that the meaning of the name in the Manchu language is "the skin of a wild boar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tak-sing, Kam|title=The Romanization of Early Manchu Regnal Names|journal=Studia Orientalia|volume=87|year=1999|pages=133–148|url=https://journal.fi/store/article/view/45155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarded as the founding father of the Qing dynasty, he is given the customary [[temple name]] of ''Taizu'', which is traditionally assigned to founders of dynasties. His name is also alternatively spelled ''Nurgaci'', ''Nurhachi'', or ''Nu-er-ha-chi'' (the last of these simply the transcription of the Chinese characters used to write his name).

Nurhaci was the last chieftain of the [[Jianzhou Jurchens|Jianzhou]] [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] and [[Khan (title)|First Khan]] of the [[Qing dynasty|Later Jin dynasty]]. His title in Manchu as Khan was {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡤᡝᡵᡝᠨ&lt;br /&gt;ᡤᡠᡵᡠᠨ ᠪᡝ&lt;br /&gt;ᡠᠵᡳᡵᡝ&lt;br /&gt;ᡤᡝᠩᡤᡳᠶᡝᠨ&lt;br /&gt;ᡥᠠᠨ}} ''Geren Gurun-be Ujire Genggiyen Han'' ("Brilliant Khan Who Benefits All Nations"). His [[Chinese era name|regnal name]] was '''Tianming''' ({{zh|c=天命|w=T'ien-ming}}; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]:{{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ&lt;br /&gt;ᡶᡠᠯᡳᠩᡤᠠ }}''Abkai Fulingga''), in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] Тэнгэрийн сүлдэт '''Tengri-yin Süldetü'''. It means "The Emperor of [[Mandate of Heaven|Heaven's Mandate]]." He was given a [[posthumous name]] in 1736 (see infobox), the shortened form of which was "Emperor Gao" (Wade–Giles: Emperor Kao; {{zh|c=高皇帝}}, [[Manchu language|Manchu]]:{{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ&lt;br /&gt;ᡶᡠᠯᡳᠩᡤᠠ }}''Dergi Hūwangdi'')

==Early life==
Nurhaci was born on 8 April 1559. Being a member of the Gioro clan of the Suksuhu River tribe, Nurhaci also claimed descent from [[Mentemu]], a Jurchen headman who lived some two centuries earlier. According to Chinese sources{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, the young man grew up as a soldier in the household of the Ming dynasty general [[Li Chengliang]] in Fushun, where he learned Chinese. He named his clan [[Aisin Gioro]] around 1612, when he formally ascended the throne as the Khan of the Later Jin dynasty.

In 1582, Nurhaci's father [[Taksi]] and grandfather [[Giocangga]] were killed in an attack on Gure (now a village in [[Xinbin Manchu Autonomous County]]) by a rival Jurchen chieftain, [[Nikan Wailan]] ("Nikan Wailan" means "secretary of [[Han Chinese]]" in the [[Jurchen language]], thus his existence is suspected by some historians.) while being led by Li Chengliang. The following year, Nurhaci began to unify the Jurchen bands around his area.

In 1584, when Nurhaci was 25, he attacked Nikan Wailan at Turun (today a village in Xinbin too) to avenge the deaths of his father and grandfather, who are said to have left him nothing but thirteen suits of armor. Nikan Wailan fled away to Erhun, which Nurhaci attacked again in 1587. Nikan Wailan this time fled to Li Chengliang's territory. Later, as a way to build relationship, Li gave Nikan Wailan to Nurhaci, who beheaded Nikan Wailan immediately. With Li's support, Nurhaci gradually grew his strength in the following years.

==Unifying the Jurchen tribes==
{{see also|Timeline of the Jurchens}}
In 1593, the [[Clan Nara|Yehe]] called upon a coalition of nine tribes: the Hada, Ula, Hoifa, [[Khorchin Mongols]], [[Sibe people|Sibe]], Guwalca, Jušeri, Neyen, and the Yehe themselves to attack the Jianzhou Jurchens. They were defeated at the [[Battle of Gure]] and Nurhaci emerged victorious.{{sfn|Narangoa|2014|p=24}}

From 1599 to 1618, Nurhaci set out on a campaign against the four [[Hulun (alliance)|Hulun]] tribes. He began by attacking the Hada in 1599 and conquering them in 1603. Then in 1607, Hoifa was also conquered with the death of its beile [[Baindari]], followed by an expedition against Ula and its ''beile'' [[Bujantai]] in 1613, and finally the Yehe and its beile [[Gintaisi]] at the [[Battle of Sarhu]] in 1619.

In 1599, Nurhaci gave two of his translators, Erdeni Baksi ('Jewel Teacher' in Mongolian) and Dahai Jargūci,&lt;ref&gt;Matsumura Jun, p.131 ''A Re-examinations of the Story of the Founding of the Ch'ing Dynasty 『清朝開国説話再考』(in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; the task of creating a [[Manchu alphabet]] by adapting the [[Mongolian script]].

In 1606, he was granted the title of Kundulun Khan by the Mongols.
[[File:Minggunbattle.jpg|300px|thumb|At the [[Battle of Sarhu]] Nurhaci defeated a four-pronged Chinese offensive intended to capture his capital of Hetu Ala by concentrating his forces in one column at a time.]]

In 1616, Nurhaci declared himself [[Khan (title)|Khan]] and founded the Jin dynasty (''aisin gurun''), often called the Later Jin in reference to the legacy of the ''earlier'' Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] of the 12th century. He constructed a palace at Mukden (present-day [[Shenyang]], [[Liaoning]]). The "Later Jin" was renamed to "Qing" by his son [[Hong Taiji]] after his death in 1626, however Nurhaci is usually referred to as the founder of the Qing dynasty.

In order to help with the newly organized administration, five of his trusted companions were appointed as his chief councilors, [[Anfiyanggū]], [[Eidu]], [[Hūrhan]], [[Fiongdon]], and [[Hohori]].

[[File:Battle of Liaoyang1621.jpg|thumb|300px|Nurhaci captured Liaoyang in 1621 and made it the capital of his empire until 1625.]]

Only after he became Khan did he finally unify the Ula (clan of his consort [[Lady Abahai]], mentioned below) and the Yehe, the clan of his consort [[Empress Xiaocigao (Qing dynasty)|Monggo]].

Nurhaci chose to variously emphasize either differences or similarities in lifestyles with other peoples like the Mongols for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perdue|first=Peter C|title=China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&amp;pg=PA127|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04202-5|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurhaci said to the Mongols that "The languages of the Chinese and Koreans are different, but their clothing and way of life is the same. It is the same with us Manchus (Jurchen) and Mongols. Our languages are different, but our clothing and way of life is the same." Later Nurhaci indicated that the bond with the Mongols was not based in any real shared culture, rather it was for pragmatic reasons of "mutual opportunism", when he said to the Mongols: "You Mongols raise livestock, eat meat and wear pelts. My people till the fields and live on grain. We two are not one country and we have different languages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of China: Pt. 1 ; The Ch'ing Empire to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hi2THl2FUZ4C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24334-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenging Ming China==
{{see also|Qing conquest of the Ming}}

In 1618, Nurhaci commissioned a document entitled the [[Seven Grievances]] in which he enumerated seven problems with Ming rule and began to rebel against the domination of the [[Ming dynasty]]. A majority of the grievances dealt with conflicts against Yehe, and Ming favouritism of Yehe.
[[Image:Mukden palace Dazheng Hall.jpg|thumb|300px|In 1621, Nurhaci started the construction of a new palace, the [[Mukden Palace]], for his Later Jin dynasty's capital of Mukden (now [[Shenyang]]).]]

Nurhaci led many successful engagements against the Ming Chinese, the Koreans, the Mongols, and other Jurchen clans, greatly enlarging the territory under his control.

The first capitals of the state established by Nurhaci were Fe Ala and Hetu Ala.&lt;ref name="Wakeman1985 3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic E.

Defectors from the Ming side played a massive role in the [[Qing conquest of the Ming]]. Ming generals who defected to the Manchus were often married to women from the Aisin Gioro clan while lower-ranked defectors were given non-imperial Manchu women as wives. Nurhaci arranged for a marriage between one of his granddaughters and the Ming general [[Li Yongfang]] ([[w:zh:李永芳|李永芳]]) after Li surrendered [[Fushun]] in [[Liaoning]] to the Manchus in 1618 as the result of the [[Battle of Fushun]].&lt;ref name="Walthall2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Walthall|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QXHbhsfaJAYC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=To+win+the+support+and+cooperation+of+Ming+generals+in+Liaodong,+Nurhaci+gave+them+Aisin+Gioro+women+as+wives.+In+1618,+before+he+attacked+Fushun+city,+he+promised+the+Ming+general+defending+the+city+a+woman+from+the+Aisin+Gioro+clan#v=onepage&amp;q=To%20win%20the%20support%20and%20cooperation%20of%20Ming%20generals%20in%20Liaodong%2C%20Nurhaci%20gave%20them%20Aisin%20Gioro%20women%20as%20wives.%20In%201618%2C%20before%20he%20attacked%20Fushun%20city%2C%20he%20promised%20the%20Ming%20general%20defending%20the%20city%20a%20woman%20from%20the%20Aisin%20Gioro%20clan&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25444-2|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wakeman1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic Wakeman|title=Fall of Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ORBmFSFcJKoC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=Li+was+made+a+banner+general,+was+given+gifts+of+slaves+and+serfs,+and+was+betrothed+to+a+young+woman+of+the+Aisin+Gioro+clan.+Although+Li%27s+surrender+at+the+time+was+exceptional,+his+integration+into+the+Manchu+elite+was+only+the+first#v=onepage&amp;q=Li%20was%20made%20a%20banner%20general%2C%20was%20given%20gifts%20of%20slaves%20and%20serfs%2C%20and%20was%20betrothed%20to%20a%20young%20woman%20of%20the%20Aisin%20Gioro%20clan.%20Although%20Li%27s%20surrender%20at%20the%20time%20was%20exceptional%2C%20his%20integration%20into%20the%20Manchu%20elite%20was%20only%20the%20first&amp;f=false|date=1 January 1977|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-02-933680-9|pages=79–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swope2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth M.

The Han prisoner of war Gong Zhenglu (Onoi) was appointed to instruct Nurhaci's sons and received gifts of slaves, wives, and a domicile from Nurhaci after Nurhaci rejected offers of payment to release him back to his relatives.&lt;ref name="Crossley2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Kyle Crossley|title=A Translucent Mirror: History and Identity in Qing Imperial Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn4iv_RJv8oC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=15 February 2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92884-8|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted and enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong.

By May 1621, Nurhaci had conquered the cities of [[Liaoyang]] and [[Shenyang]]. In April 1625, he designated Shenyang the new capital city, which would hold that status until the Qing conquest of the Ming in 1644.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur W. Hummel, ''Eminent Chinese of the Ch’ing Period'', (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1943), p. 597&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Battle of Ningyuan.png|thumb|280px|left|Battle of Ningyuan in which Nurhaci was wounded and died]]
Finally in 1626, Nurhaci suffered the first serious military defeat of his life at the hands of the Ming general [[Yuan Chonghuan]].  Nurhaci was wounded by the Portuguese-made cannons in Yuan's army at the [[Battle of Ningyuan]]. Unable to recover either physically or mentally, he died two days later in Aiji Fort (靉雞堡; in present-day Da'aijinbao Village, Dijia Township, [[Yuhong District]], [[Shenyang]]) on 30 September at the age of 67. His tomb, [[Fuling Mausoleum|Fu Mausoleum]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|福|陵}}|p={{linktext|Fú|líng}}}}), is located east of Shenyang.

==Legacy==
Among the most lasting contributions Nurhaci left his descendants was the establishment of the [[Eight Banners]], which would eventually form the backbone of the military that dominated the Qing Empire. The status of Banners did not change much over the course of Nurhaci's lifetime, nor in subsequent reigns, remaining mostly under the control of the royal family. The two elite Yellow Banners were consistently under Nurhaci's control. The two Blue Banners were controlled by Nurhaci's brother [[Šurhaci]] until he died, at which point the Blue Banners were given to Šurhaci's two sons, Chiurhala and Amin. Nurhaci's eldest son, [[Cuyen]], controlled the White Banner for most of his father's reign until he rebelled. Then the Bordered White Banner was given to Nurhaci's grandson and the Plain White was given to his eighth son and heir, [[Hong Taiji]]. However, by the end of Nurhaci's reign, Hong Taiji controlled both White Banners. Finally, the Red Banner was run by Nurhaci's second son [[Daišan]]. Later in Nurhaci's reign, the Bordered Red Banner was handed down to his son. Daišan and his son would continue holding the two Red Banners well into the end of Hong Taiji's reign.

[[File:Ningyuan battle.jpg|thumb|300px|Nurhaci watching his army storm the walls of [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]], 1626.]]

The details of Hong Taiji's succession as the Khan of the Later Jin dynasty are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When he died in late 1626, Nurhaci did not designate an heir; instead he encouraged his sons to rule collegially.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of his sons and a nephew were the "four senior beiles": [[Daišan]] (43 years old), [[Amin (Qing dynasty)|Amin]] (son of Nurhaci's brother [[Šurhaci]]; 40 or 41), [[Manggūltai]] (38 or 39), and Hong Taiji himself (33).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day after Nurhaci's death, they coerced his primary consort [[Lady Abahai]] (1590&amp;ndash;1626)&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;who had borne him three sons: [[Ajige]], [[Dorgon]], and [[Dodo, Prince Yu|Dodo]]&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;to commit suicide to accompany him in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This gesture has made some historians suspect that Nurhaci had in fact named the fifteen-year-old Dorgon as a successor, with Daišan as regent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=52}}, note 127, citing {{harvnb|Fuchs|1935}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By forcing Dorgon's mother to kill herself, the princes removed a strong base of support for Dorgon. The reason such intrigue was necessary is that Nurhaci had left the two elite Yellow Banners to Dorgon and Dodo, who were the sons of Lady Abahai. Hong Taiji exchanged control of his two White Banners for that of the two Yellow Banners, shifting their influence and power from his young brothers onto himself.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

According to Hong Taiji's later recollections, Amin and the other ''beile'' were willing to accept Hong Taiji as Khan, but Amin then would have wanted to leave with his Bordered Blue Banner, threatening to dissolve Nurhaci's unification of the Jurchens.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pp=158–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the older Daišan worked out a compromise that allowed Hong Taiji as the Khan, but almost equal to the other three senior beiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Taiji would eventually find ways to become the undisputed leader.

==Primary sources==
Information concerning Nurhaci can be found in later, propagandistic works such as the ''Manchu Veritable Records'' ({{zh|p=Mǎnzhōu Shílù|c=滿洲實錄}}; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]:{{ManchuSibeUnicode|ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ  ᡳ&lt;br&gt;ᠶᠠᡵᡤᡳᠶᠠᠨ&lt;br&gt;ᡴᠣᠣᠯᡳ}}, [[Transliterations of Manchu|Mölendroff]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;: manju-i yargiyan kooli). Good contemporary sources are also available. For instance, much material concerning Nurhaci's rise is preserved within Korean sources such as the ''[[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty]]'' ({{zh|c=朝鮮王朝實錄}}), especially the ''[[Seonjo of Joseon|Seonjo]] Sillok'' and the ''[[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghaegun]] Ilgi''. Indeed, the record of Sin Chung-il's trip to Jianzhou is preserved in the ''Seonjo Sillok''.

The ''[[Jiu Manzhou Dang]]'' from Nurhaci's reign also survives. A revised transcription of these records (with the dots and circles added to the script) was commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]]. This has been translated into Japanese under the title ''Manbun roto'', and Chinese, under the title ''[[Manwen Laodang]]'' ({{zh|c=满文老檔}}). A project is currently under way at [[Harvard University]] to translate them into English, as ''The Old Manchu Chronicles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchu Studies at Harvard|url=http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~mnch210a/index.cgi?t=TOMCIndex|website=sites.fas.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pontifical vestments''', also referred to as '''episcopal vestments''' or '''pontificals''', are the liturgical [[vestment]]s worn by [[bishop]]s (and by concession some other [[prelates]]) in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, in addition to the usual priestly vestments for the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the other [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]]. The pontifical vestments are only worn when celebrating or presiding over liturgical functions. As such, the garments should not be confused with [[choir dress]], which are worn when attending liturgical functions but not celebrating or presiding.

==Western Christianity==
[[File:Bischof-GL-Müller.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Roman Catholic]] [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] with the [[mitre]], [[crosier]], [[pectoral cross]], and [[episcopal ring]].]]
[[File:Tunic-pont-bianca-2.jpg|thumb|Pontifical tunic.]]
[[File:Sandali-ric-rossi-2.jpg|thumb|Pontifical sandals]]
The pontifical accoutrements include the:
*[[mitre]]
*[[pectoral cross]]
*[[ecclesiastical ring]]
*[[chasuble]]
*[[dalmatic|pontifical dalmatic]]
*[[crosier]] (carried)
*[[zucchetto]]

A [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan archbishop]] also wears a [[pallium]] within his own ecclesiastical province, once he has received it from the [[Pope]]. After receiving it, he is entitled to have an archiepiscopal cross (with two cross-bars instead of one) carried before him.&lt;ref&gt;''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 62 and 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Today bishops rarely use the following accoutrements, unless celebrating [[Solemn Pontifical Mass]] in its pre-1970 form:
*[[liturgical stockings]] (also known as [[buskins]])
*[[episcopal sandals]]
*[[episcopal gloves]]
*bugia - from the Italian word for a candle, especially used (in various languages) as the name for an additional candle carried by a server standing beside a bishop at some Christian (particularly Roman Catholic) liturgical celebrations.

These items are no longer even mentioned in the [[Caeremoniale Episcoporum]], which has also omitted the description that earlier editions gave of the accoutrements of the bishop's horse.

When celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], the bishop wears [[alb]], [[stole (vestment)|stole]] and [[chasuble]], in the manner done by priests. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations he should also wear a [[dalmatic]], which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of [[holy orders]], blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar.&lt;ref&gt;''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 56&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tunicle]] was also worn until the apostolic letter [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P6MINORS.HTM ''Ministeria quaedam''] of 15 August 1972 decreed that, with effect from 1 January 1973, the functions that in the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]] had been assigned to the subdeacon should thenceforth be carried out by the instituted ministers (not members of the clergy) known as [[reader (liturgy)|lector]]s and [[acolyte]]s.

When attending solemnly (often referred to as "presiding") at [[Solemn Pontifical Mass]] celebrated by another bishop, when presiding at [[Vespers|Solemn Pontifical Vespers]], and when celebrating the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] of [[baptism]], [[marriage]], and [[confirmation]] outside of Mass, a bishop may wear a [[cope]]. A cope may be worn also by priests or deacons for liturgical celebrations outside of Mass.

At any liturgical celebration, whether wearing chasuble (for Mass) or cope, the bishop may also wear a mitre, pectoral cross, ecclesiastical ring and zucchetto. He may also carry the crosier if the celebration is within his own diocese or if he is celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local bishop.&lt;ref name="CaeremonialeEpiscoporum"&gt;''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 59&lt;/ref&gt; If several bishops take part in the same celebration, only the presiding bishop carries the crosier.&lt;ref name="CaeremonialeEpiscoporum" /&gt;

Latin Rite clergy other than bishops, in particular any who are [[abbot]]s or [[apostolic prefect]]s or ordinary of a personal ordinariate, may wear pontifical items. Mitre, crosier and ring are bestowed on an abbot at his blessing and the pectoral cross is a customary part of an abbatial habit. There are limitations as to where and when abbots may wear pontificalia, for example only within his monastery. The practice of granting other clergy (e.g. the highest level of monsignor) special permission to wear such items as a mark of honour has almost disappeared; is still practiced however for ordinaries of a [[personal ordinariate]].

==Eastern Christianity==
[[File:Kanjirappally Bishop Mar Mathew Arackal at Tomb of Mar Varghese Payyappilly Palakkappilly.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Eastern Catholic]] bishop of the [[Syro-Malabar|Syro-Malabar Church]] along with other priests]]
[[Image:Jan Babjak SJ.jpg|right|thumb|[[Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Catholic]] [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] celebrating the [[Divine Liturgy]] wearing their proper pontifical vestments.]]
The pontifical vestments in [[Eastern Christianity]] are somewhat similar, although Greek terms are used instead of the mainly Latinate forms used in the West. There are also certain vestments which are unique to the Christian East.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], bishops use the following vestments (worn over the priestly [[sticharion]], [[epimanikia]] and [[epitrachelion]]) and implements:

*[[Mitre]]
*[[Omophorion]]
*[[Sakkos]]
*Jewelled [[Pectoral cross]]
*[[Panagia]]
*[[Engolpion]] 
*[[Crosier]]
*[[Epigonation]] 
*[[Nabedrennik]] (Russian church only)

The distinctive vestment of a bishop is the omophorion. There are two types of omophoria, the "Great Omophorion" which is worn at certain moments during the [[Divine Liturgy]] and at the [[Great Doxology]] at the [[All-Night Vigil]], and the "Little Omophorion" which is worn at other times (note that the sticharion is worn only at Liturgy, while the epimanikia and epitrachelion are always worn when vesting).

The Sakkos is normally worn only when the bishop is celebrating the Divine Liturgy, or during the Great Doxology at the All-Night Vigil. At other services, or when he is "presiding" but not serving at Liturgy, he will wear the [[Mantya]], a cape with a long train and red and white ribbons ("rivers") running along the sides.

Whenever he [[blessing|blesses]], the bishop stands on an [[orletz]] ("eagle rug"), and at certain times he blesses using [[dikirion and trikirion]]. The dikirion is a candlestick with two candles symbolising the [[dogma]] of the [[two natures of Christ]] and trikirion has three candles symbolising the [[Trinity]].

Eastern bishops do not normally make use of an ecclesiastical ring; instead, the lower clergy and faithful kiss the bishop's right hand as a sign of respect.

As in the Latin Rite, an [[hegumen]] (abbot) is presented with his crosier by the local bishop. The abbot usually wears a gold pectoral cross, and may be granted the right to wear a mitre. An [[archpriest]] may also be granted a gold pectoral cross. [[Archimandrite]]s and [[protopresbyter]]s wear jewelled pectoral crosses and mitres. The epigonation and/or nabrednnik may be worn by these members of the clergy, or may even be granted on their own as marks of honour to distinguished priests. The right to wear a pectoral cross or mitre may be bestowed upon other (lower) clergy as a sign of honour due to some outstanding achievement or dedication.

'''Samuil Micu Klein''' (September 1745 – 13 May 1806) was a [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic]] theologian, historian, philologist and philosopher, a member of the Enlightenment-era movement of [[Transylvanian School]] (Şcoala Ardeleană).

==Biography==

Born as ''Maniu Micu'' in the [[Transylvania]]n village of [[Sadu]], in the [[Austrian Empire]] (now in [[Sibiu County]], [[Romania]]), he was the son of a [[Greek-Catholic]] [[protopope]] and the nephew of bishop [[Inocenţiu Micu-Klein]].&lt;ref name="Hitchins, p. 667"&gt;Hitchins, p. 667.&lt;/ref&gt;

He began to study at the Seminary of [[Blaj]] and he joined the [[Order of Saint Basil]] in 1762. Micu received a scholarship in 1762 and began studying at the Catholic [[Pázmáneum]] University of [[Vienna]]. There is little known about his life in Vienna, but it is known he was attracted to science, studying experimental physics, mechanics and mathematics, in addition to theology and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Hitchins, p. 667"/&gt;

In 1772, returning to Blaj to teach ethics and mathematics at the Seminary, Klein met and befriended bishop [[Grigorie Maior]], whom he accompanied in visits throughout his diocese, trying to win converts to Greek-Catholicism. These trips proved to be useful in his study of the [[Romanian language]], especially of the language spoken by the peasants, gathering materials for a future grammar. Klein was also interested in Romanian folklore, his writings being one of the earliest works on it.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 667-668.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, he finished writing a work of history named ''De ortu progressu conversione valachorum episcopis item archiepiscopis et metropolitis eorum'', which talked about the Roman origins of the Romanians and the origins of their faith in the Roman Christian Church in ancient [[Dacia]]. Apparently, his goal was to make the bishopric become a metropolis, so it would no longer belong to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest|Archdiocese of Esztergom]].&lt;ref name="Hitchins, p. 668"&gt;Hitchins, p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to Vienna in 1779 to become a [[prefect of studies]] at the [[Saint Barbara College]], he published in 1780, together with [[Gheorghe Sincai]] the first Romanian grammar, ''Elementa linguae daco-romanae sive valachicae''.&lt;ref name="Hitchins, p. 668"/&gt;

Klein returned to Blaj, and between 1782 and 1804, he was very productive both in his translations and in writing original works:&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 668-669&lt;/ref&gt;
* translation of textbooks for Blaj schools
* translation of over seventy-seven titles and 7,500 pages from the [[Church Fathers]]
* a history of Romania entitled ''Scurtă cunoştinţă a istoriei Românilor'' (1792)
* a translation of ''The Granite Matrix'' (1794)
* a translation of the bible (''[[Biblia de la Blaj]]'', 1795)
* a four-volume Latin draft of ''Istoria, lucrurile şi întâmplările Românilor'' (1800, though only an 1805 translation to Romanian survived)

Klein moved to [[Buda]] in 1804 to become the editor at the University of Buda press for the Romanian-language books, hoping that this would allow him to publish his historical works, a project which did not materialise because of his death just two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 669.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6971">[[File:Sigebert de Gembloux.JPG|thumb|Statue of Sigebert of Gembloux in [[Gembloux]]]]

'''Sigebert of Gembloux''' ('''Sigebertus Gemblacensis'''; {{circa}} 1030 – 5 October 1112) was a medieval author, known mainly as a pro-Imperial historian of a [[universal chronicle]], opposed to the expansive papacy of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] and [[Pope Pascal II|Pascal II]]. Early in his life he became a monk in the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey of Gembloux]].

==Biography==
He was born near Gembloux which is now in the [[Namur (province)|Province of Namur]], Belgium, about 1030. He was apparently not of Germanic background, but seems to have been of Latin descent. He received his education at the [[Gembloux Abbey|Abbey of Gembloux]], where at an early age he became a monk. Later he was for a long time a teacher at the Abbey of St. Vincent at [[Metz]]; about 1070 he returned to Gembloux. He was universally admired and venerated, and had charge there of the abbey school until his death, occupied in teaching and writing.

After his return from Metz he became a violent imperial partisan in the great struggle between the empire and the papacy that culminated in the [[Investiture Controversy]]. He was an enemy of the papal pretensions and he took part in the momentous contest between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and the [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]]. Of his three treatises on this question, being very serviceable to the imperial cause to the contest, one is [[Lost works|lost]]; this was an answer to the letter of Gregory VII, written in 1081 to Bishop [[Hermann of Metz]], in which Gregory asserted that the popes have the right to [[excommunicate]] kings and to release subjects from the oath of loyalty. In the second treatise Sigebert defended the masses said by married priests, the hearing of which had been forbidden by the pope in 1074. When [[Paschal II]] in 1103 ordered the Count of Flanders to punish the citizens of [[Liège]] for their adherence to the emperor and to take up arms against him, Sigebert attacked the proceeding of the pope as unchristian and contrary to Scripture.

He died at Gembloux on 5 November 1112.

==Works==
Sigebert's most celebrated work is a ''Chronicon sive Chronographia'', or [[universal chronicle]], that [[Auguste Molinier]] found to be the best work of its kind. It contains many errors and but little original information. He desired probably merely to give a chronological survey; consequently, there is only a bare list of events even for the era in which he lived, though the last years, including 1105–1111, are treated in more detail. It covers the period between 381 and 1111, and its author was evidently a man of much learning. The first of many printed editions was published in 1513; the best is in ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]. Scriptores'' vol. VI, with introduction by Ludwig Conrad Bethmann. After Sigebert's death his chronicle was continued by [[Anselm of Gembloux]].

The chronicle was very popular during the later [[Middle Ages]]; it gained a very high reputation, was circulated in numberless copies, and was used by many writers and found numerous continuators, serving as the basis of many later works of history. Notwithstanding various oversights and mistakes, the industry and wide reading of Sigebert deserve honorable mention. The original autograph manuscript is in the [[Royal Library of Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;''L'Historiographie en Belgique'', exhibition catalogue (Brussels, 1935), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Sigebert are a life of the Frankish king [[Sigebert III]] (''Vita Sigeberti III regis Austrasiae''), founder of the monastery of St. Martin at Metz. While at Metz he wrote the biography of Bishop [[Theodoric I of Metz]] (964–985), and also a long poem on the martyrdom of [[St. Lucy]], whose relics were venerated at the Abbey of St. Vincent. After his return to Gembloux he also wrote similar works for this abbey, namely a long poem on the martyrdom of the [[Theban Legion]]—as Gembloux had relics of its reputed leader [[Exuperius (Theban Legion)|St. Exuperius]] (d. 262)—and a history of the early abbots of Gembloux to 1048 (''Gesta abbatum Gemblacensium'').

He also made a catalogue of one hundred and seventy-one ecclesiastical writers and their works from [[Gennadius of Massilia|Gennadius]] to his own time, ''De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis'', which mentions his own work.

Sigebert was also a hagiographer. Among his writings in this connexion may be mentioned revisions of the biographies of [[St. Maclovius]] and the two early [[bishops of Liège]], [[Theodard of Maastricht]] and [[Lambert of Maastricht]]; further the ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of [[Dietrich, bishop of Metz]] (d. 984) who was the founder of the abbey of St Vincent in that city (''Vita Deoderici, Mettensis episcopi'')&lt;ref&gt;It is published in ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'', iv.&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Wicbert]] or Guibert (d. 962) who founded the [[abbey of Gembloux]] (''Vita Wicberti'').&lt;ref&gt;It is published in ''Monumenta'', iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] reset attack''', also known as "forged TCP resets", "spoofed TCP reset packets" or "TCP reset attacks", is a way to tamper and terminate the Internet connection by sending forged TCP reset packet. This tampering technique can be used by a firewall in goodwill, or abused by a malicious attacker to interrupt Internet connections.

[[The Great Firewall of China]] is known to use TCP reset attack to interfere with and block connections, as a major method to carry out Internet censorship.

== Technical Background ==
The Internet is, in essence, a system for individual computers to exchange electronic messages, or packets of IP data. This system includes hardware to carry the messages (such as copper and [[fiber optics]] cables) and a formalized system for formatting the messages, called "protocols". The basic protocol used on the Internet is the [[IP protocol]], which is usually coupled with additional protocols such as TCP ([[Transmission Control Protocol]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0793.txt TCP specification]&lt;/ref&gt;) or UDP ([[User Datagram Protocol]]). [[TCP/IP]] is the protocol set used for email and web browsing. Each protocol has a block of information, called a header, included near the front of each packet. Headers contain information about which computer sent the packet, which computer should receive it, the packet size, etc.

TCP is used with IP when a two-way virtual connection is required between two computers. (UDP on the other hand is a connectionless IP protocol.)
TCP software on the two machines which will communicate (for example a workstation with a browser and a web server) by exchanging a stream of packets. Using a TCP connection gives the computers an easy way to exchange data items too big for a single packet, such as video clips, email attachments, or music files. Although some web pages are small enough for a single packet, they are sent over TCP connections for convenience.

== TCP resets ==
In a stream of packets of a TCP connection, each packet contains a TCP header. Each of these headers contains a bit known as the "reset" (RST) flag. In most packets this bit is set to 0 and has no effect; however, if this bit is set to 1, it indicates to the receiving computer that the computer should immediately stop using the TCP connection; it should not send any more packets using the connection's identifying numbers, called ports, and discard any further packets it receives with headers indicating they belong to that connection. A TCP reset basically kills a TCP connection instantly.

When used as designed, this can be a useful tool. One common application is the scenario where a computer (computer A) crashes while a TCP connection is in progress. The computer on the other end (computer B) will continue to send TCP packets since it does not know that computer A has crashed. When computer A reboots, it will then receive packets from the old pre-crash connection. Computer A has no context for these packets and no way of knowing what to do with them, so it might send a TCP reset to computer B. This reset lets computer B know that the connection is no longer working. The user on computer B can now try another connection or take other action.

== Forging TCP resets ==

In the scenario above, the TCP reset bit was sent by a computer that was one of the connection endpoints. It is possible for a 3rd computer to monitor the TCP packets on the connection and then send a "forged" packet containing a TCP reset to one or both endpoints. The headers in the forged packet must indicate, falsely, that it came from an endpoint, not the forger. This information includes the endpoint IP addresses and port numbers. Every field in the IP and TCP headers must be set to a convincing forged value for the fake reset to trick the endpoint into closing the TCP connection. Properly formatted forged TCP resets can be a very effective way to disrupt any TCP connection that the forger can monitor.

== Legitimate use of TCP reset injection ==

One obvious application of a forged TCP reset is to maliciously disrupt TCP connections without the consent of the two parties which own the endpoints. However, [[network security]] systems using forged TCP resets have been designed as well. A prototype "Buster" software package was demonstrated in 1995 that would send forged resets to any TCP connection which used port numbers in a short list. Linux volunteers proposed doing something similar with Linux firewalls in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.netfilter.org/pipermail/netfilter/2000-May/003971.html May 2000 Linux discussion archives]&lt;/ref&gt; and the open source [[Snort (software)|Snort]] used TCP resets to disrupt suspicious connections as early as 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marc.info/?l=snort-users&amp;m=107792974908563&amp;w=2 SNORT discussion archive: TCP resets]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IETF considered TCP resets by firewalls, load-balancers and web-servers harmful in RFC3360.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3360 Inappropriate TCP Resets Considered Harmful]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comcast Controversy ==

By late 2007, [[Comcast]] began using forged TCP resets to cripple peer-to-peer and certain groupware applications on their customers' computers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Comcast#Network neutrality|Section of Wikipedia Comcast article]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21376597/ Associated Press, Comcast Blocks Some Internet Traffic]&lt;/ref&gt; This started a controversy, which was followed by the creation of the Network Neutrality Squad (NNSquad) by [[Lauren Weinstein (technologist)|Lauren Weinstein]], [[Vint Cerf]], [[David Farber]], [[Craig Newmark]] and other well-known founders of and champions of openness on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnsquad.org/ NNSquad home page]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the NNSquad released the NNSquad Network Measurement Agent, a Windows software program written by [[John Bartas]], which could detect Comcast's forged TCP resets and distinguish them from real endpoint-generated resets. The technology to detect the resets was developed from the earlier open-source "Buster" software which used forged resets to block [[malware]] and ads in web pages.

In January 2008, the FCC announced it would investigate Comcast's use of forged resets, and, on August 21, 2008, it ordered Comcast to terminate the practice. &lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-284286A1.pdf Commission Orders Comcast To End Discriminatory Network Management Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==

=== IPsec ===
{{main article|IPsec}}

Internet Protocol Security ([[IPsec]]) is a [[protocol suite]] for secure [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) communications that works by [[authentication|authenticating]] and [[encryption|encrypting]] each [[packet (information technology)#Example: IP packets|IP packet]] of a communication session. IPsec includes protocols for establishing [[mutual authentication]] between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]]s to be used during the session. IPsec can be used in protecting data flows between a pair of hosts (''host-to-host''), between a pair of security gateways (''network-to-network''), or between a security gateway and a host (''network-to-host'').
Internet Protocol security (IPsec) uses cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IPsec supports network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2749">'''Tatomir P. Vukanović''' (1907–1997) was a [[Serbia]]n ethnologist of the [[Balkans]] region of south-eastern [[Europe]].

Born in [[Vranje]], [[Southern and Eastern Serbia|Southern Serbia]], he concentrated on the history, folklore and culture of the [[Serbs|Serb]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsy) inhabitants of [[Yugoslavia]] in general and the southern province of [[Kosovo]] in particular, as well as in [[gender]] issues, most specifically of [[sworn virgin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. a text about [https://archive.is/20120801224435/www.galva108.org/thirdgender.html "Third gender"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''“Sexual tendencies toward females seem to be present in [some cases], albeit in a rather limited and repressed way. Although I found no trace of liaisons with women, cohabitation of masculine ‘sworn virgins’ with female partners is not completely unknown. I know of three such couples, in two of which a sexual relationship is actually indicated. At least two of these three couples were bound by ‘blood-sisterhood,’ a kind of ritual or spiritual kinship that, however, does not usually include living together. '''According to Tatomir Vukanovic, sworn virgins were in some places ill reputed for ‘certain abnormal sexual relations’ with their blood-sisters.'''”  '' (From the chapter “Woman Becomes Man in the Balkans” by Rene Gremaux; of “Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History” Edited by Gilbert Herdt.)&lt;/ref&gt; the latter due to the fact that he himself was gay&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by [[Dejan Medaković]] in [http://www.27march.org/images/File/Dejan%20Medakovic%20%20EFEMERIS%20_lat_.pdf ''Efemeris'']&lt;/ref&gt; which in [[homophobia|homophobic]] [[Socialist]] [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] led to his marginalisation as a scholar and demise from positions of authority to which he had aspired as a [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s partisan [[guerilla]] [[petty officer]].

'''Thomas C. O'Connor''' (October 9, 1927 – January 16, 2001) was a one term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[List of mayors of Norwalk, Connecticut|mayor]] of [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] from 1981 to 1983. He had previously served a term in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]] from the [[Connecticut's 140th assembly district|140th District]]. He was a junior high school history teacher in the Norwalk public schools for 35 years.

== Early life and family ==
He was the son of Dorothy Page O'Connor&lt;ref name="cthr"/&gt; of Norwalk. O'Connor attended St. Mary School, Center Junior High School, and [[Norwalk High School (Connecticut)|Norwalk High School]] where he played football.&lt;ref name="cthr"/&gt; He was a graduate of Fairfield University in its first graduating class.&lt;ref name="cthr"/&gt; He served two tours of duty with the [[United States Navy|U. S. Navy Air Force]], first in [[World War II]] and then in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="cthr"/&gt; He was a history teacher in the junior high school and middle school levels in the Norwalk school system for more than thirty-five years, and also worked nights and weekends for many years as a new car salesperson in Norwalk.&lt;ref name="cthr"/&gt;

== Political career ==
O' Connor served as a member of the Norwalk Common Council.&lt;ref name="cthr"/&gt; In 1974, he was defeated in his race for the seat representing the 140th district in the Connecticut House of Representatives to Democrat William Collins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&amp;dat=19991028&amp;id=WAlJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bgUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5004,4756567 The Way We Were]&lt;/ref&gt; When Collins resigned his house seat in 1977 to take office as mayor, O'Connor won the seat in a special election over Democrat Alberta Hawkins and took office on February 2, 1978.&lt;ref name="cthr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hour2"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&amp;dat=19780125&amp;id=jukgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NG4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1439,3684081 Absentee Ballots To Be Available for 140th Race]&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the Committees on General Law and Public Personnel and Military Affairs.&lt;ref name="cthr"/&gt; O'Connor was a candidate for mayor in 1979, but lost to Collins.

Higgins.&lt;ref name="pg"&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/CT/ofc/norwalk.html Political Graveyard]&lt;/ref&gt; He took office in 1982.

== Post mayoral activity ==
O'Connor was a major force in resurrecting a World War II Honor Roll in Norwalk, and bringing it up to date four decades after it had been dismantled, and in revitalizing a memorial to a Vietnam War of Honor recipients in the city of Norwalk.&lt;ref name="cthr"/&gt; In 1988, the Honor Roll of veterans from World War II, Korea and Vietnam was completed. It lists the names of 6,687 World War II members, 340 from Korea and 429 from Vietnam.

*'''1913''': U.S. Navy nurses (all women) serve on the transports ''USS Mayflower'' and ''USS Dolphin''.&lt;ref name="public.navy.mil"/&gt;

===World War I===
{{Details|Women in World War I}}
*'''United States''': During America's involvement from 1917–1918, 21,480 U.S. Army nurses (military nurses are all women) serve in military hospitals in the United States and overseas. Eighteen African-American Army nurses serve at home, caring for German prisoners of war and African-American soldiers. The first female members of the military killed in the line of duty are Edith Ayres and Helen Wood, who die on May 20, 1917 at Base Hospital #12 aboard the USS Mongolia en route to France. The U.S. Army recruits and trains 233 female bilingual telephone operators to work at switchboards near the front in France, and sends 50 skilled stenographers to France to work with the Quartermaster Corps. On 19 March 1917, the U.S. Navy authorizes the enlistment of women. Designated as "Yeoman (F)," they unofficially become known as "Yeomanettes.” The U.S. Navy enlists 11,880 women as Yeomen (F), to serve in shore billets and release sailors for sea duty. On 21 March 1917, YNC [[Loretta Perfectus Walsh]] becomes the first female Chief Petty Officer in the U.S. Navy. More than 1,476 U.S. Navy nurses serve in military hospitals. The U.S. Marine Corps enlists 305 female Marine Reservists (F) to "free men to fight" by filling positions (such as clerks and telephone operators) on the home front. In 1918, Pvt. [[Opha May Johnson]] becomes the first woman to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. More than 400 U.S. military nurses die in the line of duty during World War I, the vast majority from the pandemic [[Spanish Flu]]. In 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve become the first uniformed women to serve in the U.S. Coast Guard. At the time of the [[Armistice with Germany|armistice]] on November 11, 1918 there are 11,275 Yeomanettes in naval service, with some 300 female Marines in the Marine Corps. The women, "no longer needed", are asked to resign. The final pass in review down Pennsylvania Avenue is in July.&lt;ref name="womensmemorial.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="public.navy.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/H&amp;C/Resources/hfaq.html|title=Resources—Historical Frequently Asked Questions|website=Women In Military Service For America Memorial|accessdate=June 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZXQsuPG?url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/H%26C/Resources/hfaq.html|archivedate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/WomenChronology.asp|title=Women's History Chronology|website=United States Coast Guard|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="womenmarines.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenmarines.org/wm_history.aspx|title=History of the Women Marines|website=Women Marines Association|accessdate=June 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812080527/http://www.womenmarines.org/wm_history.aspx|archivedate=August 12, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Naval Reserve Act of 1916 permits the enlistment of qualified "persons" for service. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels asks, "Is there any law that says a Yeoman must be a man?" and is told there is not.&lt;ref name="public.navy.mil"/&gt;

==1920s==
*'''1920''': A provision of the Army Reorganization Act grants U.S. military nurses the status of officers, with "relative rank" from second lieutenant to major (but not full rights and privileges).

* 1948: On June 12, President Harry Truman signed Public Law 625, the [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act]], which allowed women to become permanent, regular members of the U.S. armed forces in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and the recently formed Air Force. Prior to this act, women, with the exception of nurses, served in the military only in times of war. However, the act limited service of women by excluding them from Air Force and Navy vessels and aircraft that might engage in combat. On July 7, 1948, Kay Langdon, Wilma Marchal, Edna Young, Frances Devaney, Doris Robertson, and Ruth Flora became the first six enlisted women to be sworn into the regular U.S. Navy. Esther McGowin Blake was the first woman to enlist in the regular U.S. Air Force; she enlisted in the first minute of the first hour of the first day regular Air Force duty was authorized for women on July 8, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130409222841/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123336575]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, 1948, the first eight women to be commissioned in the regular U.S. Navy, [[Joy Bright Hancock]], [[Winifred Collins|Winifred Quick Collins]], Ann King, Frances Willoughby, Ellen Ford, Doris Cranmore, Doris Defenderfer, and Betty Rae Tennant took their oaths as naval officers.&lt;ref&gt;Ebbert, Jean; and Hall, Marie-Beth; Crossed Currents: Navy Women from WWI to Tailhook [Revised]'': Brassey's; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:WAVES recruitment poster.jpg|thumb|350px|WAVES recruitment poster]]

{{Special characters}}

A '''veil''' is an article of clothing or hanging cloth that is intended to cover some part of the [[human head|head]] or [[face]], or an object of some significance. Veiling has a long history in European, Asian, and African societies. The practice has been prominent in different forms in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The practice of veiling is especially associated with women and sacred objects, though in some cultures it is men rather than women who are expected to wear a veil. Besides its enduring religious significance, veiling continues to play a role in some modern secular contexts, such as wedding customs.

=== Antiquity ===

Elite women in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and in the [[Rise of Macedon|Greek]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian empires]] wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status.&lt;ref name="Ahmed 1992 15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested reference to veiling is found a [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Middle Assyrian]] law code dating from between 1400 and 1100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Graeber |first= David |authorlink= David Graeber |year= 2011 |title= Debt: The First 5000 Years |place= Brooklyn, NY |publisher= Melville House |isbn= 9781933633862 |lccn= 2012462122 |oclc=  |page= 184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assyria had explicit [[sumptuary laws]] detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society.&lt;ref name="Ahmed 1992 15"/&gt; Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"&gt;{{Cite book|last=El Guindi|first=Fadwa|title=Hijab|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|author2=Sherifa Zahur|year= 2009|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001|isbn=9780195305135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Assyrian law code states:&lt;blockquote&gt;§ 40.

Whoever sees a veiled prostitute shall seize her, secure witnesses, and bring her to the palace entrance. They shall not take her jewelry; he who has seized her shall take her clothing; they shall strike her 50 blows with rods; they shall pour hot pitch over her head. And if a man should see a veiled prostitute and release her and not bring her to the palace entrance: they shall strike that man 50 blows with rods; the one who informs against him shall take his clothing; they shall pierce his ears, thread (them) on a cord, tie (it) at his back; he shall perform the king’s service for one full month. Slave-women shall not veil themselves, and he who should see a veiled slave-woman shall seize her and bring her to the palace entrance: they shall cut off her ears; he who seizes her shall take her clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in the Ancient Near East|last=Stol|first=Marten|publisher=De Gruyter|others=Richardson, Helen,, Richardson, M.

Classical Greek and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] statues sometimes depict Greek women with both their head and face covered by a veil. Caroline Galt and Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones have both argued from such representations and literary references that it was commonplace for women (at least those of higher status) in ancient Greece to cover their hair and face in public. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] women were expected to wear veils as a symbol of the husband's authority over his wife; a married woman who omitted the veil was seen as withdrawing herself from marriage. In 166 BC, consul [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus|Sulpicius Gallus]] divorced his wife because she had left the house unveiled, thus allowing all to see, as he said, what only he should see. Unmarried girls normally didn't veil their heads, but matrons did so to show their modesty and chastity, their ''pudicitia''. Veils also protected women against the evil eye, it was thought.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, Judith Lynn. "Symbolism in the Costume of the Roman Woman", pp. 46-53  in Judith Lynn Sebesta &amp; Larissa Bonfante, ''The World of Roman Costume'', University of Wisconsin Press 2001, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

A veil called ''flammeum'' was the most prominent feature of the costume worn by the bride at [[Marriage in ancient Rome|Roman weddings]]. The veil was a deep yellow color reminiscent of a candle flame. The ''flammeum'' also evoked the veil of the [[Flamen Dialis|Flaminica Dialis]], the Roman priestess who could not divorce her husband, the [[Flamen Dialis|high priest of Jupiter]], and thus was seen as a good omen for lifelong fidelity to one man. The Romans apparently thought of the bride as being "clouded over with a veil" and connected the verb ''nubere'' (to be married) with ''nubes'', the word for cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxGPLju4KEkC&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=flammeum&amp;pg=PA55|pages=55–56|title=The World of Roman Costume|editors=Judith Lynn Sebesta, Larissa Bonfante|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=2001|chapter=The Costume of the Roman Bridge|author=Laetitia La Follette|isbn=9780299138547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermixing of populations resulted in a convergence of the cultural practices of Greek, Persian, and Mesopotamian empires and the [[Semitic people|Semitic peoples]] of the Middle East.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; Veiling and seclusion of women appear to have established themselves among Jews and Christians, before spreading to urban Arabs of the upper classes and eventually among the urban masses.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; In the rural areas it was common to cover the hair, but not the face.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt;

=== Later history ===

[[File:Veils bavaria ncd 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], queen of France, wearing veiling]]

For many centuries, until around 1175, [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and then [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] women, with the exception of young unmarried girls, wore veils that entirely covered their hair, and often their necks up to their chins (see [[wimple]]). Only in the [[Tudor period]] (1485), when [[hood (headgear)|hood]]s became increasingly popular, did veils of this type become less common. This depended greatly from one country to the other. In Italy, veils, including face veils, were worn in some regions until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Doni, Elena &amp; Manuela Fulgenz, Il secolo delle donne. L’Italia del novecento al femminile'', (The Women’s Century. Italian Women in the 20th Century), Laterza 2001, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in southern Italy often covered their heads to show that they were modest, well-behaved and pious. They generally wore a ''cuffia'' (cap), then the ''fazzoletto'' (kerchief/head scarves) a long triangular or rectangular piece of cloth that could be tied in various way, and sometimes covered the whole face except the eyes, sometimes ''bende (lit. swaddles, bandages)'' or a wimple underneath too.&lt;ref&gt;See: Storia del costume sardo (A History of Sardinian Clothing – female headcoverings.) &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ladonnasarda.it/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1066%3Astoria-del-costume-sardo-su-muccadore-il-copricapo&amp;Itemid=691#.VU-VcY5_Oko{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, European women have worn sheer veils, but only under certain circumstances.  Sometimes a veil of this type was draped over and pinned to the [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] or hat of a woman in [[mourning]], especially at the [[funeral]] and during the subsequent period of "high mourning".  They would also have been used, as an alternative to a [[mask]], as a simple method of hiding the identity of a woman who was traveling to meet a lover, or doing anything she didn't want other people to find out about.  More pragmatically, veils were also sometimes worn to protect the complexion from sun and wind damage (when un-tanned skin was fashionable), or to keep dust out of a woman's face, much as the [[keffiyeh]] is used today.

[[File:A_Coptic_woman_of_the_Poorer_Class._(1918)_-_TIMEA.jpg|thumb|[[Copts|Coptic]] Christian woman wearing a veil (1918)]]

In [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] the concept of covering the head is or was associated with propriety and modesty. Most traditional depictions of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], the mother of [[Christ]], show her veiled. During the [[Middle Ages]] most European married women covered their hair rather than their face, with a variety of styles of [[wimple]], kerchiefs and headscarfs. Veiling, covering the hair, rather than the face, was a common practice with church-going women until the 1960s, Catholic women typically using [[lace]], and a number of very traditional churches retain the custom. Bonnets were the rule in non-Catholic churches. Lace face-veils are still often worn by female relatives at funerals in some Catholic countries. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], married women cover their hair for reasons of modesty; many Orthodox Jewish women wear headscarves ([[tichel]]) for that purpose.

Christian Byzantine literature expressed rigid norms pertaining to veiling of women, which have been influenced by Persian traditions, although there is evidence to suggest that they differed significantly from actual practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Islam identified with the monotheistic religions practiced in the Byzantine and [[Sassanian]] empires, in the aftermath of the [[early Muslim conquests]] veiling of women was adopted as an appropriate expression of Qur'anic ideals regarding modesty and piety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veiling gradually spread to upper-class Arab women, and eventually, it became widespread among Muslim women in cities throughout the Middle East. Veiling of Arab Muslim women became especially pervasive under Ottoman rule as a mark of rank and exclusive lifestyle, and Istanbul of the 17th century witnessed differentiated dress styles that reflected geographical and occupational identities.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; Women in rural areas were much slower to adopt veiling because the garments interfered with their work in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John|title=Islam: The Straight Path|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=99|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since wearing a veil was impractical for working women, "a veiled woman silently announced that her husband was rich enough to keep her idle."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Jonathan; Blair, Sheila (2002). Islam: A Thousand Years of Faith and Power. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-09422-1}}., p.47&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, upper-class urban Muslim and Christian women in Egypt wore a garment which included a head cover and a ''burqa'' ([[muslin]] cloth that covered the lower nose and the mouth).&lt;ref name="El Guindi"&gt;{{Cite book|last=El Guindi|first=Fadwa|title=Hijab|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|author2=Sherifa Zahur|year= 2009|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001|isbn=9780195305135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the first half of the twentieth century, rural women in the Maghreb and Egypt put on a face veil when they visited urban areas, "as a sign of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=be7sCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276|page=276|title=Religion in Public Spaces: A European Perspective|editors=Silvio Ferrari, Sabrina Pastorelli|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|author=Sara Silverstri|chapter=Comparing Burqa Debates in Europe|isbn=9781317067542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of veiling gradually declined in much of the Muslim world during the 20th century before making a comeback in recent decades.

Although religion is a common reason for choosing to veil, the practice also reflects political and personal conviction, so that it can serve as a medium through which personal character can be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Secor, A. (2002). The Veil and Urban Space in Istanbul: Women’s Dress, Mobility and Islamic Knowledge. Gender, Place and Culture, Vol. 9, No. 1, pp. 5–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]], and [[Fulani]] of [[West Africa]], women do not traditionally wear the veil, while men do. Male veiling was also common among the Berber [[Sanhaja]] tribes.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; The North African male veil, which covers the mouth and sometimes part of the nose, is called ''[[litham]]'' is Arabic and ''[[tagelmust]]'' by the Tuareg.&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Björkman, W. | year= 2012 | title=Lit̲h̲ām |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P.

Ancient African rock engravings depicting human faces with eyes but no mouth or nose suggest that the origins of litham are not only pre-Islamic but even pre-historic.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Wearing of the litham is not viewed as a religious requirement, although it was apparently believed to provide magical protection against evil forces.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; In practice, the litham has served as protection from the dust and extremes of temperature characterizing the desert environment.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Its use by the [[Almoravids]] gave it a political significance during their conquests.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; 

In some parts of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Nepal]], men wear a ''[[sehra (headdress)|sehra]]'' on their wedding day. This is a male veil covering the whole face and neck. The sehra is made from either flowers, beads, tinsel, dry leaves, or coconuts. The most common sehra is made from fresh marigolds. The groom wears this throughout the day concealing his face even during the wedding ceremony. In Northern India today you can see the groom arriving on a horse with the sehra wrapped around his head.

===Biblical references===
Biblical references include:

* Hebrew ''mitpachat'' ([[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 3:15; marg., "sheet" or "apron;" R.V., "mantle"). In [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 3:22 this word is plural, rendered "wimples;" R.V., "shawls" i.e. wraps.book of Isaiah 3:23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.
* ''Massekah'' (Isaiah 25:7; in Isa. 28:20 rendered "covering").  The word denotes something spread out and covering or concealing something else (comp. 2 Cor. 3:13–15).
* ''Masveh'' ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:33, 35), the veil on the face of [[Moses]].  This verse should be read, "And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face," as in the [[Revised Version]]. When Moses spoke to them he was without the veil; only when he ceased speaking he put on the veil (comp. 2 Cor. 3:13, etc.).
* ''Parochet'' (Ex. 26:31–35), the veil of the [[tabernacle]] and the [[temple]], which hung between the holy place and the most holy (2 Chr. 3:14). In the temple a partition wall separated these two places. In it were two folding doors, which are supposed to have been always open, the entrance being concealed by the veil which the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] lifted when he entered into the sanctuary on the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]]. This veil was rent when [[crucifixion|Christ died on the cross]] (Matt. 27:51; [[Gospel of Mark]] 15:38; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:45).
* ''Tza'iph'' ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 24:65). [[Rebecca|Rebekah]] "took a veil and covered herself." (See also 38:14, 19.) [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] women generally appeared in public with the face visible (12:14; 24:16; 29:10; 1 Sam. 1:12).
* ''Radhidh'' ([[Song of Songs|Cant.]] 5:7, R.V. "mantle;" Isaiah 3:23). The word probably denotes some kind of cloak or wrapper.
* ''Masak'', the veil which hung before the entrance to the holy place (Ex. 26:36, 37).
Note: {{bibleverse||Genesis|20:16}}, which the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]] renders as: "And unto [[Sarah]] [[Abimelech|he]] said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a [[covering of the eyes]], unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved" has been interpreted in one source as implied advice to Sarah to conform to a supposed custom of married women, and wear a complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the face,&lt;ref name="Eastons Covering"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Covering%20of%20the%20eyes#c-p445 |title=Covering of the eyes |work=[[Easton's Bible Dictionary|The Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Third Edition]], by [[Matthew George Easton]] M.A., D.D, 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the phrase is generally taken to refer not to Sarah's eyes, but to the eyes of others, and to be merely a metaphorical expression concerning vindication of Sarah ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]], [[Russian Synodal Bible|RSV]]), silencing criticism ([[God's Word (Bible translation)|GWT]]), allaying suspicions ([[New Jerusalem Bible|NJB]]), righting a wrong ([[Bible in Basic English|BBE]], [[New Living Translation|NLT]]), covering or recompensing the problem caused her ([[New International Version|NIV]], New Life Version, [[NIRV]], [[Today's New International Version|TNIV]], [[Jerusalem Bible|JB]]), a sign of her innocence ([[English Standard Version|ESV]], [[Contemporary English Version|CEV]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible|HCSB]]). The final phrase in the verse, which KJV takes to mean "she was reproved", is taken by almost all other versions to mean instead "she was vindicated", and the word "הוא", which KJV interprets as "he" (Abraham), is interpreted as "it" (the money). Thus, the general view is that this passage has nothing to do with material veils.

After the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]], the [[synagogue]]s that were established took the design of the [[Tabernacle]] as their plan. The [[Ark (synagogue)|Ark of the Law]], which contains the [[scroll]]s of the [[Torah]], is covered with an embroidered curtain or veil called a ''[[parochet|parokhet]]''. (See also [[Wedding veil|below]] regarding the veiling&amp;nbsp;– and unveiling&amp;nbsp;– of the bride.)

==== Veiling of objects ====

Among [[Christian Church|Christian churches]] which have a [[liturgy|liturgical]] tradition, several different types of veils are used. These veils are often symbolically tied to the veils in the [[Tabernacle]] in the wilderness and in [[Solomon's Temple]]. The purpose of these veils was not so much to obscure as to shield the most sacred things from the eyes of sinful men. In [[Solomon's Temple]] the veil was placed between the "Inner Sanctuary" and the "[[Holy of Holies]]". According to the New Testament, this veil was torn when [[Jesus Christ]] died on the cross. 

*Tabernacle veil
: Used to cover the [[church tabernacle]], particularly in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition but in some others as well, when the [[Eucharist]] is actually stored in it. The veil is used to remind worshipers that the (usually metal) tabernacle cabinet echoes the tabernacle tent of the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]], and it signals that the tabernacle is actually in use. It may be of any liturgical color, but is most often white (always appropriate for the Eucharist), [[cloth of gold]] or silver (which may substitute for any liturgical color aside from violet), or the liturgical color of the day (red, green or violet). It may be simple, unadorned linen or silk, or it may be fringed or otherwise decorated.  It is often designed to match the [[vestment]]s of the [[Priest|celebrant]]s.

*Ciborium veil
: The [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]] is a goblet-like metal vessel with a cover, used in the Roman Catholic Church and some others to hold the consecrated [[Sacramental bread|hosts]] of the Eucharist when, for instance, it is stored in the tabernacle or when [[Eucharist|communion]] is to be distributed. It may be veiled with a white cloth, usually silk. This veiling was formerly required but is now optional. In part, it signals that the ciborium actually contains the [[Consecration|consecrated]] Eucharist at the moment.

*Chalice veil
: During Eucharist celebrations, a veil is often used to cover the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] and [[paten]] to keep dust and flying insects away from the bread and wine. Often made of rich material, the chalice veils have not only a practical purpose, but are also intended to show honor to vessels used for the [[sacrament]].
:In the West, a single chalice veil is normally used. The veil will usually be the same material and color as the priest's vestments, though it may also be white. It covers the chalice and paten when not actually in use on the altar.
:In the East, three veils are used: one for the chalice, one for the [[Paten|diskos]] (paten), and a third one (the [[Aër]]) is used to cover both. The veils for the chalice and diskos are usually square with four [[lappet]]s hanging down the sides, so that when the veil is laid out flat it will be shaped like a cross. The Aër is rectangular and usually larger than the chalice veil used in the West. The Aër also figures prominently in other liturgical respects.

*Humeral veil
: The [[humeral veil]] is used in both Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches during the liturgy of Exposition and [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]], and on some other occasions when special respect is shown to the Eucharist. From the [[Latin]] for "shoulders," it is an oblong piece of cloth worn as a sort of [[shawl]], used to symbolize a more profound awareness of the respect due to the Eucharist by shielding the celebrant's hands from actually contacting the vessel holding the Eucharist, either a [[monstrance]] or [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]], or in some cases to shield the vessel itself from the eyes of participants. It is worn only by [[bishop]]s, [[priest]]s or [[deacon]]s.

*Vimpa
:A [[vimpa]] is a veil or shawl worn over the shoulders of servers who carry the [[mitre|miter]] and [[crosier]] in Roman Catholic liturgical functions when they are not being used by the bishop.

*Chancel veil
:In the early liturgies, there was often a veil that separated the sanctuary from the rest of the church (again, based upon the biblical description of the Tabernacle). In the Byzantine liturgy this veil developed into the [[iconostasis]], but a veil or curtain is still used behind the [[Royal Doors]] (the main doors leading into the sanctuary), and is opened and closed at specific times during the liturgy. In the West, it developed into the Rood Veil, and later the [[Rood screen|Rood Screen]], and finally the [[chancel]] rail, the low sanctuary railing in those churches that still have this. In some of the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]] (for instance, the [[East Syrian Rite|Syrian liturgy]]) the use of a veil across the entire sanctuary has been retained.

*Lenten veiling
: Some churches veil their crosses during [[Passiontide]] with a fine semi-transparent mesh. The color of the veil may be black, red, purple, or white, depending upon the liturgical day and practice of the church. In traditional churches, there will sometimes be curtains placed to either side of the altar.

The '''[[The Protection of the Mother of God|Veil of our Lady]]''' is a liturgical feast celebrating the protection afforded by the [[intercession]]s of the Virgin Mary.

==== Veiling by women ====

Traditionally, in Christianity, women were enjoined to cover their heads in church, just as it was (and still is) customary for men to remove their hat as a sign of respect. This practice is based on {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:4–16}}, where [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame upon his head. But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled brings shame upon her head, for it is one and the same thing as if she had had her head shaved. For if a woman does not have her head veiled, she may as well have her hair cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should wear a veil. A man, on the other hand, should not cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; nor was man created for woman, but woman for man; for this reason a woman should have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. Woman is not independent of man or man of woman in the Lord. For just as woman came from man, so man is born of woman; but all things are from God. Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head unveiled? Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears his hair long it is a disgrace to him, whereas if a woman has long hair it is her glory, because long hair has been given (her) for a covering? But if anyone is inclined to be argumentative, we do not have such a custom, nor do the churches of God ([[New American Bible]] translation)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many traditional [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, and in some very conservative [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches as well, the custom continues of women covering their heads in church (or even when praying privately at home).

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], it was customary in most places before the 1960s for women to wear a headcovering in the form of a scarf, cap, veil or hat when entering a church. The practice now continues in isolated parishes where it is seen as a matter of etiquette, courtesy, tradition or fashionable elegance.  The Declaration Inter-Insigniores by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has made it clear that the practice of headcovering for women was a matter of ecclesiastical discipline and not of Divine law.

The wearing of a headcovering was for the first time mandated as a universal rule for the [[Latin Rite]] by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law of 1917]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jgray.org/codes/cic17lat.html |title=1917 Codex Iuris Canonici |work= Canon 1262, Section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which code was abrogated by the advent of the present (1983) Code of Canon Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2.HTM |title=Canon 6 §1 of the Code of Canon Law }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalist Catholics still follow it, generally as a matter of custom and biblically approved aptness; some also suppose that St. Paul's directive is in full force today as an ordinance of its own right, despite the teaching of the Congregation for Doctrine of the Faith's pronouncement on the matter.  

A veil over the hair rather than the face forms part of the headdress of some [[Catholic religious order|order]]s of [[nun]]s or [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] sisters; this is why a woman who becomes a nun is said "to take the veil". In medieval times married women normally covered their hair outside the house, and a nun's veil is based on secular medieval styles, often reflecting the fashion of widows in their attire.  In many institutes, a white veil is used as the "veil of probation" during [[novitiate]], and a dark veil for the "veil of profession" once religious vows are taken; the color scheme varies with the color scheme of the habit of the order. A veil of [[consecration]], longer and fuller, is used by some orders for final profession of [[solemn vow]]s.

Nuns are the female counterparts of [[monk]]s, and many [[monasticism|monastic orders]] of women have retained the veil. Regarding other institutes of religious sisters who are not [[cloister]]ed but who work as teachers, nurses or in other "active" apostolates outside of a nunnery or monastery, some wear the veil, while some others have abolished the use of the veil, and a few never had a veil to start with, but used a bonnet-style headdress as in the case of [[St. Elizabeth Ann Seton]].

The fullest versions of the nun's veil cover the top of the head and flow down around and over the shoulders.  In western Christianity, it does not wrap around the neck or face. In those orders that retain one, the starched white covering about the face neck and shoulders is known as a [[wimple]] and is a separate garment.

The Catholic Church has revived the ancient practice of allowing women to be consecrated by their bishop as a [[consecrated virgin]]. These women are set aside as sacred persons who belong only to Christ and the service of the church. The veil is a bridal one, because the velatio virginum primarily signified the newly consecrated virgin as the Bride of Christ.  At one point this veil was called the flammeum because it was supposed to remind the virgin of the indissoluble nuptial bond she was contracting with Christ.  The wearing of the flammeum for the sacred virgin Bride of Christ arose from the bridal attire of the strictest pagan marriage which did not permit of divorce at the time. The flammeum was a visible reminder that divorce was not possible with Christ, their Divine Spouse. Consecrated virgins are under the direct care of the local [[bishop (Catholic church)|bishop]], without belonging to a particular order, and they receive the veil as a bridal sign of [[consecration]].  

There has also been renewed interest in the last half century in the ancient practice of women and men dedicating themselves as [[anchorite]]s or [[hermit]]s, and there is a formal process whereby such persons can seek recognition of their vows by the local bishop; a veil for these women would be traditional.

Some [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] women's religious orders also wear a veil, differing according to the traditions of each order.

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rites]] of the Catholic Church, a veil called an ''[[epanokamelavkion]]'' is used by both nuns and monks, in both cases covering completely the ''[[kamilavka|kamilavkion]]'', a cylindrical hat they both wear. In [[Church Slavonic language|Slavic]] practice, when the veil is worn over the hat, the entire [[headgear|headdress]] is referred to as a ''[[klobuk]]''. Nuns wear an additional veil under the ''klobuk'', called an ''[[apostolnik]]'', which is drawn together to cover the neck and shoulders as well as the head, leaving the face itself open.

===Islam===
{{Main|Hijab}}
[[File:N°3 HAÏK alt version.jpg|thumbnail|Women in the predominantly Islamic country of Algeria wearing a [[haïk]], a type of veil.]]

A variety of headdresses worn by [[Women in Islam|Muslim women]] and girls in accordance with ''[[hijab]]'' (the principle of dressing modestly) are sometimes referred to as veils.  The principal aim of the Muslim veil is to cover the [[Intimate parts in Islam|''Awrah'']] (parts of the body that are considered private). Many of these garments cover the hair, ears and throat, but do not cover the face. 

Depending on geography and culture, the veil is referenced and worn in different ways. The ''[[Hijab|khimar]]'' is a type of [[headscarf]].  The ''[[niqāb]]'' and ''[[burqa]]'' are two kinds of veils that cover most of the face except for a slit or hole for the eyes. In [[Algeria]], a larger veil called the ''[[haïk]]'' includes a triangular panel to cover the lower part of the face.&lt;ref&gt;Kellou, Dorothée Myriam. [http://observers.france24.com/en/20150316-algeria-women-haik-veil-march Algerian women take to streets to bring back traditional veil]. ''The Observers''. 16 March 2015. Accessed on 5 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arabian Peninsula and parts of North Africa (specifically Saudi Arabia), the abaya is worn constructed like a loose robe covering everything but the face itself. In another location, such as Iran, the chador is worn as the semicircles of fabric are draped over the head like a shawl and held in place under the neck by hand. The two terms for veiling that are directly mentioned in the Quran is the jilbab and the khimar. In these references, the veiling is meant to promote modesty by covering the genitals and breasts of women. 

The [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] burqa covers the entire body, obscuring the face completely, except for a grille or netting over the eyes to allow the wearer to see. The ''[[boshiya]]'' is a veil that may be worn over a headscarf; it covers the entire face and is made of a sheer fabric so the wearer is able to see through it. It has been suggested that [[Byzantine dress|the practice of wearing a veil]]&amp;nbsp;– uncommon among the [[Arab]] tribes prior to the rise of [[Islam]]&amp;nbsp;– originated in the [[Byzantine Empire]], and then spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://medievalnews.blogspot.com/2007/09/review-of-byzantium-surprising-life-of.html |title=Review of Herrin book and Michael Angold |work=Church and Society in Byzantium Under the Comneni, 1081–1261 |pages= 426–7 &amp; ff;1995 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-521-26986-5 |date=2000-09-21 }} see also {{cite book |author=[[John Esposito]] |title=Islam: The Straight Path |pages=98, 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year= 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indian religions ===



{{Further|Ghoonghat|Purdah}}

In [[Indian subcontinent]], from 1st century B.C. societies advocated the use of the veil for married [[Hindu]] women which came to be known as [[Ghoonghat]].&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar(1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.174&lt;/ref&gt;  Buddhists attempted to counter this growing practice around 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Kelen 1967 "Gautama Buddha: In Life and Legend" chapter 1, p. 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; Rational opposition against veiling and seclusion from spirited ladies resulted in system not becoming popular for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar(1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.171&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Medieval [[Islamic]] [[Mughal Empire]], various aspects of veiling and seclusion of women was adopted, such as the concept of [[Purdah]] and [[Zenana]], partly as an additional protection for women.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Purdah]] became common in the 15th and 16th century, as both ''Vidyāpati'' and ''Chaitanya'' mention it.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhism was highly critical of all forms of strict veiling, Guru Amar Das condemned it and rejected seclusion and veiling of women, which saw decline of veiling among some classes during late medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Sardar Harjeet Singh(2009) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.259&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bridal veils ==

In the 19th century, wedding veils came to symbolize the woman's [[virginity]] and [[modesty]].  The tradition of a veiled bride's face continues even today wherein, a virgin bride, especially in Christian or Jewish culture, enters the marriage ritual with a veiled face and head, and remains fully veiled, both head and face, until the ceremony concludes.  After the full conclusion of the wedding ceremony, either the bride's father lifts the veil giving the bride to the groom who then kisses her, or the new groom lifts her face veil in order to kiss her, which symbolizes the groom's right to enter into conjugal relations with his bride.&lt;ref name=Ingrassia&gt;{{cite book |author= Ingrassia, Catherine |editor= Curran, Colleen |title= Altared: bridezillas, bewilderment, big love, breakups, and what women really think about contemporary weddings |publisher= Vintage Books |location= New York |year= 2007 |chapter= Diana, Martha and Me |pages= 24–30 |isbn= 978-0-307-27763-3 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===



In Judaism, the tradition of wearing a veil dates back to biblical times. According to the Torah in {{bibleverse||Genesis|24:65|HE}}, Isaac is brought Rebekah to marry by his father Abraham's servant.  It is important to note that Rebekah did not veil herself when traveling with her lady attendants and Abraham's servant and his men to meet Isaac, but she only did so when Isaac was approaching.  Just before the wedding ceremony the [[badeken]] or bedeken is held.  The groom places the veil over the bride's face, and either he or the officiating Rabbi gives her a blessing. The veil stays on her face until just before the end of the wedding ceremony&amp;nbsp;– when they are legally married according to Jewish law&amp;nbsp;– then the groom helps lift the veil from off her face.

The most often cited interpretation for the [[badeken]] is that, according to {{bibleverse||Genesis|29|HE}}, when Jacob went to marry Rachel, his father in law Laban tricked him into marrying Leah, Rachel's older and homlier sister. Many say that the veiling ceremony takes place to make sure that the groom is marrying the right bride.  Some say that as the groom places the veil over his bride, he makes an implicit promise to clothe and protect her.  Finally, by covering her face, the groom recognizes that he his marrying the bride for her inner beauty; while looks will fade with time, his love will be everlasting. In some ultra-orthodox traditions the bride wears an opaque veil as she is escorted down the aisle to meet her groom.  This shows her complete willingness to enter into the marriage and her absolute trust that she is marrying the right man.  In Judaism, a wedding is not considered valid unless the bride willingly consents to it.

In ancient [[Judaism]] the lifting of the veil took place just prior to the consummation of the marriage in sexual union.  The uncovering or unveiling that takes place in the [[wedding ceremony]] is a symbol of what will take place in the marriage bed.  Just as the two become one through their words spoken in wedding vows, so these words are a sign of the physical oneness that they will consummate later on.  The lifting of the veil is a symbol and an anticipation of this.

=== Christianity ===

[[File:Memchu wedding.jpg|thumb|300px|A Christian minister marries a groom and bride, the latter who is wearing a wedding veil in the church]]

In Christian theology, [[Saint Paul|St. Paul's]] words concerning how marriage symbolizes the union of Christ and His Church may underlie part of the tradition of veiling in the marriage ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;(cf. ''Letter to the Ephesians'', chapter 5)&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, veiling may signify the waters of [[baptism]], with the wedding dress (and veil) being but a larger version of the [[First Communion]] dress (and veil), which in turn is but a larger version of a baby's baptismal garment,&lt;ref&gt;[[Baptismal garment#Roman Catholic tradition]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is the distinguishing garment of all Christians, signifying the presence of Sanctifying Grace and the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 7:13&amp;ndash;14, 22:14, Matt. 22:11&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt;

At an even deeper level, the waters of baptism themselves symbolize the waters of death,&lt;ref&gt;Rom. 6:3-4ff&lt;/ref&gt; which must be accepted in faith, and passed through, before truly complete joy can be experienced in [[Heaven]].  In this respect, the religious veil is a reminder to the bride that she is dying to her previous life, and being admitted to a new kind of life, symbolic of eternal life in Heaven.  For this reason, nuns are veiled—often with a black veil—with the veil not merely signifying the veil of death, but actually—in some real way—being that veil, since they will one day be buried in it. 

The wedding veil is also a symbol of the veil of faith&lt;ref&gt;II Cor. 5:7&lt;/ref&gt; in Jesus Christ, the Heavenly bridegroom, that He will one day come and redeem our mortal bodies, by the lifting of that veil, so that we shall see Him face to face in Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Rom. 8:11, I Cor. 13:12&lt;/ref&gt;  Sacred virgins receive not the religious veil&amp;mdash;unless they are also nuns&amp;mdash;but a bridal veil because they are espoused to Christ in the solemn rite of Consecration of Virgins.  The consecrated virgins' veil has always symbolized being a bride of Christ and the indissoluble nuptial bond the sacred virgin enjoys with Christ.  Lastly, the wedding dress, either with, or even without a veil, may be a symbol of the radiance of the resurrected body in Heaven, which will not be a mortal body, but which will have been changed "in the twinkling of an eye" into something new that we cannot now even imagine.&lt;ref&gt;I Cor. 15:44, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern customs ===

[[File:Bride with bouquet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A bride wearing a typical wedding veil]]

An occasion on which a Western woman is likely to wear a veil is on her [[white wedding]] day. [[Bride]]s once used to wear their hair flowing down their back at their wedding to symbolize their virginity. Veils covering the hair and face became a symbolic reference to the virginity of the bride thereafter. A bride may wear the face veil through the ceremony. Then either her father lifts the veil, presenting the bride to her groom, or the groom lifts the veil to symbolically consummate the marriage. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Brides may make use of the veil to symbolize and emphasize their status of purity during their wedding however, and if they do, the lifting of the veil may be ceremonially recognized as the crowning event of the wedding, when the beauty of the bride is finally revealed to the groom and the guests.

In modern weddings, the ceremony of removing a face veil after the wedding to present the groom with the bride may not occur, since couples may have entered into conjugal relations prior to the wedding and it may also be considered sexist for the bride to have her face covered whether or not the veil is a sign of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remedies for Sexism in Christian Weddings by Tory Paez|url=http://www.lipstickandpolitics.com/play-2/the-meaning-of-wedding-traditions-and-what-to-watch-for-friday|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022215031/http://www.lipstickandpolitics.com/play-2/the-meaning-of-wedding-traditions-and-what-to-watch-for-friday|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 October 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scandinavia, brides wear a veil usually under a traditional crown but do not have their face covered (instead the veil is attached to and hangs from the back).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridal Crown History from Sweden|url=https://www.ingebretsens.com/culture/weddings/bridal-crowns|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mourning veils ==

Veils remained a part of Western mourning dress customs into the modern times. The tradition of widow's veiling has its roots in nun's attire, which symbolized modesty and chastity. The mourning veil was commonly seen as a means of shielding the mourner and hiding her grief, and, on the contrary, seen by some women as a means of publicly expressing their emotions. Mourning veils have also been sometimes perceived as expressions of elegance or even sex appeal. In a 19th-century American etiquette book one finds: "Black is becoming, and young widows, fair, plump, and smiling, with their roguish eyes sparkling under their black veils are very seducing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC - Culture|title=Mourning Glory|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20141103-mourning-glory-funeral-style|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==

One view is that as a religious item, it is intended to honor a person, object or space. The actual sociocultural, psychological, and sociosexual functions of veils have not been studied extensively but most likely include the maintenance of social distance and the communication of social status and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, R.F. (1964). Social Distance and the Veil. American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 66, No. 6, Part 1, pp. 1257–1274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, S. (1996). Reconstructing Self and Society: Javanese Muslim Women and "The Veil". American Ethnologist, Vol. 23, No. 4, pp. 673–697&lt;/ref&gt;

A veil also has symbolic interpretations, as something partially concealing, disguising, or obscuring.

==Etymology==
The English word [[wikt:veil|''veil'']] ultimately originates from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:velum#Latin|vēlum]]'', which also means "[[sail]]," from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*wegʰslom'', from the verbal root ''*wegʰ-'' "to drive, to move or ride in a vehicle" (compare ''way'' and ''[[wikt:wain|wain]]'') and the tool/instrument suffix ''*-slo-'', because the sail makes the ship move. Compare the [[diminutive]] form ''[[wikt:vexillum|vexillum]]'', and the Slavic cognate ''[[wikt:veslo|veslo]]'' "oar, paddle", attested in Czech and Serbo-Croatian.
