An '''adventure park''' is a place which can contain a wide variety of elements, such as rope climbing exercises, obstacle courses and zip-lines. They are usually intended for recreation.

"Recreational-oriented" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: ''Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in the Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.''

== History ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 2.jpg|thumb|Treetop Adventure Park in Bali|]]
[[File:Adventure Park, Ashramam, Kollam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adventure Park, Kollam|Asramam Adventure Park]], [[Kollam]], [[Kerala]]]]
It is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military.

In the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States.

In recent years, specifically recreation-oriented Adventure Parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe &amp; Asian countries.

== Related Outdoor Activities ==
As already mentioned, a [[ropes course]] is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section.

A [[canopy tour]] is a specific type of [[ziplining]] where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.

== Facts &amp; Figures Adventure Parks ==
The category Adventure Parks can be broken down into a huge variety of specific types. They differ according to the following main criteria:
* Type of parks: 	 	        stationary / mobile
* Structural System:                  trees / poles / buildings / metallic structure
* Target visitors:                       all / kids from 4 years old / disabled
* Height of the lifeline: 	        "mid-height", "out of reach"
* Belay system: 		        self / permanent / continuous
* Locations:			        touristic / urban

[[File:Indoor-Kletterpark.jpg|thumb|Indoor Adventure Park in Shopping Mall]]Forest Adventure Parks are very popular. They take advantage of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent rubbing from the ropes.

Depending on how they are used and where they are located, parks on poles are an excellent alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees at the edge of a forest has the potential to work well.
 
Indoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New parks on wood poles have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.

Adventure Parks can be found in a multitude of places/locations. Examples of trends:
*	Close to large tourist destinations
*	In Ski Resorts as an attraction during summer months (a boom in Switzerland and several European countries)
*	In Amusement Parks, Holiday Clubs/Villages, Hotel Club and Resorts, etc.
*	Urban parks or close to conglomerations (e.g. the park in the center of Lyon, France)
*	Close to a significant pool of potential customers, such as a large Shopping Mall, Zoo, Campsite, etc.
*	Small (kids) parks for shopping malls (as indoor), city events, etc.

Large Adventure Parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements).

The majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or “green trail” and progresses to a very challenging level or “black trail”. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20-30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled.

Most kids love Adventure Parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play.

The acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and [[zip-line]]s increases the diversity and interest of parks – People love zip-lines.

There are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak.

[[File:Capture d’écran 2012-06-12 à 14.09.01.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park with lifeline "out of reach"]]
There are 2 schools concerning the height of the lifeline:
*The more traditional approach, frequently seen on continental Europe, is the lifeline at mid-height. This height at {{convert|1.40|-|1.60|m|ft|abbr=on}} is well adapted for carabiners.
*The lifeline out of reach, at {{convert|2|-|2.30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, possible with continuous belay system, is more frequent in UK and shows several advantages:  (1) ''Higher throughput by peaks'' - up to 20% more (No manipulation on platforms and therefore gains of time - No need to install additional trolley for the ziplines).  (2) ''More impressive and challenging elements''  (No "mid-heigh" cables to help the visitors - Impressive and when necessary, the visitor can anytime help himself with the lanyard - Impressive and without risk of numerous rescues).  (3) ''Higher convenience for the park visitors''  (Platforms are free of any "mid-heigh" cable, ease for the visitors - Fun &amp; thrills on elements while relaxing on platforms).  (4) ''Much lower risk of injury''  (No contact with safety device - As the lanyard is already tighter, the distance of possible fall will be shorter)

Concerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.

== Safety systems ==
[[image:Seilpark Gantrisch - 03.jpg|thumb|Self belay with carabiners]]
[[File:Rheinfall Seilpark 4.jpg|thumb|Continuous Belay for Kids Trails from 4 years old]]
The safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails – relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used.

There are distinctions between the following main four belay systems:
* Self belay with carabiners
* Permanent belay with carabiners
* Continuous belay on rail
* Continuous belay on cable (with a hook or a trolley)

The traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.

The permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a "communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.

The continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application – it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe).

With a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail – in term of safety, no specific further action is required. 
For the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be “out of reach” which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)

== Adventure Parks Operation ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 3.jpg|thumb|Round Platform]]
Recreational-oriented Adventure Parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations).

The key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level &amp; risk management, needs of training &amp; supervision and flexible operation.

In order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential. The new technologies in safety systems bring Adventure Parks into a new era by dramatically reducing the risk of accident (permanent and continuous systems) and reducing the needs of training and supervision (continuous systems).

The EN 15567-1 and -2 standards regulate the construction and operation of high ropes Courses / Adventure Parks. The various associations as ERCA and IAPA in Europe or ACCT and PRCA in the USA are acting towards professionalization of the industry.

The legal [[age of consent]] for sexual activity varies by jurisdiction across Asia, from age 12 to 21 years of age. The specific activity engaged in or the gender of its participants can also be affected by the law. Below is a discussion of the various laws dealing with this subject. The highlighted age refers to an age at or above which an individual can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age. Other variables, such as homosexual relations or close in age exceptions, may exist, and are noted when relevant, for example in Indonesia.

The below is a list of all jurisdictions in Asia as listed in [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia]].

==East Timor==
The age of consent in [[East Timor]] is 14 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, per Article 177. However, sex acts with an adolescent aged 14–15 years are illegal if an adult practices them with the adolescent by "taking advantage of the inexperience" of that adolescent. (Article 178).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id%3D243617 |title=WIPO Intellectual Property Laws and Treaties Database (WIPO Lex) |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065054/http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=243617 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }} ([[WIPO Lex]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 177. Sexual abuse of a minor:&lt;br /&gt;
# Any person who practices vaginal, anal or oral coitus with a minor aged less than 14 years is punishable with 5 to 20 years' imprisonment. 
# Any person who practices any act of sexual relief with a minor aged less than 14 years is punishable with 5 to 15 years' imprisonment.

Article 178. Sexual acts with an adolescent:&lt;br /&gt;
# Any person who, being an adult and apart from situations provided in this section, practices any relevant sexual act with a minor aged between 14 and 16 years, taking advantage of the inexperience of the same, is punishable with up to 5 years' imprisonment.

==Hong Kong==
In [[Hong Kong]] the age of consent for sexual activity is 16 regardless of gender or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=s&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/200/s124.html |title=Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) s.124 |publisher=HKLII |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the age of consent for a female receiving anal sex is 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118D.html |title=Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) s.118D |publisher=HKLII |accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under s.124 of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap.200),&lt;ref name=s/&gt; a man who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. Under s.123 of the Crimes Ordinance,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/200/s123.html |title=Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) s.123 |publisher=HKLII |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a man who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13 shall be liable to [[imprisonment for life]].

Hence, a woman who has sexual activity with a boy or a girl under 16 will be prosecuted under this section.

The previous position regarding homosexual couples is contained in s.118C which provides that a man who commits or suffers to commit buggery with a man under the age of 21 is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/200/s118c.html |title=Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) s.118C |publisher=HKLII |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this section was struck down as unconstitutional in ''[[Leung TC William Roy v Secretary for Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk/lrs/common/search/search_result_detail_frame.jsp?DIS=54227&amp;QS=%2B&amp;TP=JU&amp;currpage=T |title=CACV No. 317 of 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the age of consent between two males have been effectively equalized with that between a male and a female, which is 16.

Prior to 2012 there was a presumption that a male minor under 14 could not consent to sexual intercourse under any circumstances. The law was changed after a 13-year-old boy attacked a 5-year-old girl at a [[Chai Wan]] hospital ward; the prosecution was unable to convict him of rape, instead only able to do so for indecent assault. In 2015 an 11-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy were arrested after they were found having sex with an 11-year-old girl. Under the new laws they have the possibility of having the maximum sentence of life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Lo, Clifford and Lana Lam.

[[India]]'s age of consent for sex is 18 under the ''[[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]]''.&lt;ref name="2013 rape law"&gt;{{cite news|title=New anti-rape law comes into force|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/New-anti-rape-law-comes-into-force/articleshow/19359543.cms?referral=PM|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, the [[marital rape]] and subsequent death of a 10-year-old girl, [[Phulmoni Dasi rape case|Phulmoni Dasi]], caused the age of consent to be raised from 10 to 12. In 1949, it was raised to 16 after agitation from women groups about the adverse effect of early pregnancy. In 1982, it was again raised to 16.&lt;ref name=confusion&gt;{{cite news|title=Age of Confusion |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/age-of-consent-sex-parliament-debate/1/259007.html|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=[[India Today]]|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 2014 the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]] came into effect which raised the legal permissible age for sexual consent from 16 to 18.

=== Legal action on Marital Rape ===
 Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 disallows any such sexual relationships and puts such crimes within marriages as an aggravated offense. A Public Interest Litigation filled by Independent Thought, an organization working on child rights law, was heard in the Supreme Court of India for declaring the exception allowing marital rape within prohibited child marriages as unconstitutional: ''Independent Thought vs. Union of India [W.P(civil) 382 of 2013]''. In the judgment, delivered on October 11, the Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Madan B. Lokur and Deepak Gupta read down Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to hold that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife if she is below 18 years of age would amount to rape.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]], an old British-era law, bans "carnal intercourse against the order of nature". It was used to prosecute people for having anal or oral sex, although prosecutions are rare. The law was constitutionally challenged at the [[Delhi High Court]] in 2009 for violating the human rights of sexual minorities. But, after the Delhi High Court declared some parts of the law unconstitutional on the issue, the age of consent for consensual homosexual sex was set at 18.&lt;ref name="homo_sex"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/delhi-high-court-legalises-gay-sex/484039/ |title=Delhi HC invokes Nehru, legalises gay sex |newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]   |date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indonesia==
According to the Indonesian Penal Code article 287, the age of consent in [[Indonesia]] is 15 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana|last=Kejaksaan Negeri|publisher=Kejaksaan Negeri|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of consent is the minimum age at which an individual is considered legally old enough to consent to participation in sexual activity. Individuals aged 14 or younger in Indonesia are not legally able to consent to sexual activity, and such activity may result in prosecution for statutory rape or the equivalent local law.

Even though the age of consent is 15 years old, the offender can only be charged and prosecuted if a legal complaint is lodged to the law enforcement. Exception to this law is when the age of the victim is under 12 years old, or under certain circumstances such as bodily injury or incest.

However, under the Child Protection Act, the age of consent could be raised to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law of The Republic Of Indonesia Number 35 Year 2014 Concerning Amendment To Law Number 23 Year 2002 Regarding Child Protection|last=Kejaksaan Negeri|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument used is that sexual acts with a child could result in bodily and mental injury, while the definition of a child is anyone who is under 18 years old. A reported court verdict using the Child Protection Act was done in 2009 against an Australian national.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/australian-gets-eight-years-in-bali-jail-for-underage-sex-20090226-8jaf.html|title=Australian gets eight years in Bali jail for under-age sex|last=Jakarta|first=Tom Allard in|date=2009-02-27|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
According to the Israeli Penal Code of 1977 the age of consent in [[Israel]] is 16 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, for any form of sexual relations involving penetration (unless the person above 16 is the one being penetrated - in that case the age of consent is 14). In all cases that don't involve penetration, the age of consent is 14 (for both heterosexual and homosexual activities ). A special case arises when a person aged 14 or 15 had sexual relations with an older partner; in this case the older partner would be exempt of criminal liability if three conditions are met: the age difference between the partners was less than three years, the younger partner gave consent and the act was done out of "regular friendly relations" and without the abuse of power.

The statutory rape law criminalizes sex with minors under age 18 and sex with a child under age 18 involving force, threat, or intimidation. The maximum penalty for child rape is 40 years in prison plus a lifetime bar from political office. As of August the PNP reported 2,750 cases of child rape. The production, possession, and distribution of child pornography are illegal, and penalties range from one month to life in prison plus fines from 50,000 to five million pesos ($1,000 to $100,000), depending on the gravity of the offense.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

In regard to children under the age of 18, as described earlier in the act as an individual under the age of 18, the law reads:

''Article 141. Sexual Intercourse And Other Actions of Sexual Character With an Individual Under 16 Years of Age''

"(1) Sexual intercourse, homosexuality or lesbianism committed by an individual at the age of 18 years with an individual under 16 years of age when there are no elements of the crime stipulated by Article 138 and Article 139 of the present Code, is punishable by deprivation of freedom for a period of 2 to 5 years."

It should be noted, however, that articles 138 and 139 provide harsher penalties for Rape and Forcible sex against minors, including the possible death penalty for rape of a girl under 14.

==Thailand==
The age of consent in [[Thailand]] is 15 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, as specified by article 279 of the Thai Criminal Code. The current legislation applies to all regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

However, parts of the [http://www.thailawonline.com/images/documents/Criminal%20Code%20of%20Thailand.pdf''Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act''], which disallow any sexual contact with prostitutes under the age of 18, are widely interpreted by some local authorities to cover sexual acts classed as "obscenity for personal gratification". Also, from the [http://www.thailawonline.com/images/documents/Criminal%20Code%20of%20Thailand.pdf''Penal Code Amendment Act''of 1997 Section 283bis], having sex with an adolescent under 18 is a compoundable offense even with the consent of that person. The parent or the adolescent may file charges against the other side if they later regret their own action. This ostensibly makes the Thai unfettered age of consent 18.

A high-profile example of this application of the law was a [[statutory rape]] charge filed against the lead singer of the Thai band ''[[Big Ass]]'' for allegedly having had sex with a (then) 16-year-old girl. The charge was filed by the girl after the singer refused to take responsibility for her baby. The singer has since been cleared of being the baby's father due to the results of a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity test]] and he received 2 years [[suspended sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/20/national/national_30004480.php |title=DNA test clears 'Dag' |date=20 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30029866 |title=Popular rocker given suspended jail term for having sex with underage girl |date=30 March 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090612143232/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30029866|archivedate=12 June 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yemen==
Any kind of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal in [[Yemen]]. Until recently, Yemeni law set the age of consent at 15. But tribal customs often trump the law. In practice, "Yemeni law allows girls of any age to wed, but it forbids sex with them until the indefinite time they’re 'suitable for sexual intercourse.'"&lt;ref name=Power2009&gt;{{Citation|last=Power |first=Carla |title=Nujood Ali &amp; Shada Nasser win "Women of the Year Fund 2008 Glamour Award" |publisher=Yemen Times |date=12 August 2009 |url=http://www.yementimes.com/DefaultDET.aspx?i=1207&amp;p=report&amp;a=1 |accessdate=16 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405190616/http://www.yementimes.com/DefaultDET.aspx?i=1207&amp;p=report&amp;a=1 |archivedate=5 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[Marriageable age#Asia|minimum marriage age]] of fifteen for women, rarely enforced, was abolished; the onset of puberty, interpreted by [[ulama]] to be at the age of nine, was set as a requirement for consummation of marriage.&lt;ref name=HRWYemenReport2001&gt;{{Citation|author =Human Rights Watch| title= World Report 2001|chapter= Yemen: Human Rights Developments | publisher= Human Rights Watch | year=2001 | url= https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/yemen.html | accessdate=8 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100615214816/http://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/yemen.html| archivedate=15 June 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Agnes Nestor was born on June 24, 1880, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] to Thomas and Anna (McEwen) Nestor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44573291|title=Women building Chicago 1790-1990 : a biographical dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Schultz, Rima Lunin, 1943-, Hast, Adele., Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0253338522|location=Bloomington|oclc=44573291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father owned a grocery store there, but due to the depression of the 1890s he returned to his old trade as a [[machinist]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring of 1897 Agnes and the rest of her family followed after their father and headed to Chicago;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44573291|title=Women building Chicago 1790-1990 : a biographical dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Schultz, Rima Lunin, 1943-, Hast, Adele., Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0253338522|location=Bloomington|oclc=44573291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnes, still in her teens, found work in Chicago's Eisendrath Glove Company (a non-union shop).&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; In her autobiography ''Woman's Labor Leader'',  Nestor discusses the company's unjust practices such as: the company charged workers fifty cents a week for machine rental, workers had to provide their own needles (and if somebody was to break a needle they were charged for a new one to replace it), and also workers had to purchase their own machine oil, however, these unjust practices would not go unchallenged. In 1902 Nestor stepped forward as leader in a strike of women workers at the Eisendrath Glove Company (encouraged and supported by the [[Trade union|unionised]] men), which lasted ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2814907|title=The roads they made : women in Illinois history|last=Mitchell.|first=Wheeler, Adade|date=1977|publisher=C.H. Kerr Pub. Co|others=Wortman, Marlene Stein,|isbn=0882860208|location=Chicago|oclc=2814907}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was successful, all the women's demands were met; workers received a raise in pay, no longer had to pay rent for their machines, and the Eisendrath company took greater responsibility for their machinery, its greatest outcome being the implementation of a union shop.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt;

==Activism==
[[File:Agnes Nestor, 1912.jpg|thumb|Agnes Nestor, 1912]]

===International Glove Workers Union and the Women's Trade Union League===
Following the success of the strike, Nestor took on more leadership roles. In 1902, the same small organization of women who took part in the Eisendrath Glove Company strike formed Glove Makers Local 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44573291|title=Women building Chicago 1790-1990 : a biographical dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Schultz, Rima Lunin, 1943-, Hast, Adele., Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0253338522|location=Bloomington|oclc=44573291}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Agnes Nestor as a founder and leader. Nestor was the national vice president of the International Glove Workers Union from 1903 to 1906, secretary-treasurer from 1906 to 1913, general president from 1913 to 1915, vice-president, again, from 1915 to 1938, and director of research and education from 1938 until her death in 1948.&lt;ref name="Mcmillan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mcmillan |first=Peter |title=Agnes Nestor |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAWnestor.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational Publishers Ltd |accessdate=3 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603122309/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAWnestor.htm |archivedate=3 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a leader in the International Glove Workers Union, Nestor gained prominence among labor leaders and earned access to network with notable women in Chicago society, many of whom she met through her involvement with [[Women's club (United States)|women's clubs]].&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; Though there were differences between "club women" and "working women," particularly in terms of class, domestic roles, and educational attainment, the relationship and outreach efforts Nestor built with club women were to further the agenda of the International Glove Workers Union.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt;

Nestor was also an active member of the [[Women's Trade Union League]] (WTUL) of Chicago beginning in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44573291|title=Women building Chicago 1790-1990 : a biographical dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Schultz, Rima Lunin, 1943-, Hast, Adele., Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0253338522|location=Bloomington|oclc=44573291}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as its president from 1913 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5728/ |title=Working Her Fingers to the Bone: Agnes Nestor's Story |accessdate=2010-09-17 |quote= |publisher= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100817092630/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5728/| archivedate= 17 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other women's clubs, the Women's Trade Union League admitted women regardless of class,&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; the club's aim was to secure the organization of all women workers of the U.S. into [[trade unions]] in the hopes of gaining better working conditions, a reduced work day, a living wage, and full citizenship of women.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; At the Women's Trade Union League, Nestor worked alongside prominent women labor leaders [[Mary Kenney O'Sullivan]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Mary McDowell]], [[Margaret Haley]], [[Helen Marot]], [[Florence Kelley]], and [[Sophonisba Breckinridge]], together they were able to lobby, organize, fundraise, and create the WTUL into an influential and transformative organization.&lt;ref name="Mcmillan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt;

The Women's Trade Union League seal exhibits the phrases "The Eight Hour Day," "A Living Wage," and "To Guard the Home," thereby conveying the message that the WTUL believed that in advocating for reduced work hours, and raising wages, women workers would be able to better attend domestic responsibilities at home.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; They would come to work diligently to achieve the status they longed for displayed on their seal. For many years attempts were made by various labor groups to enact legislation to protect women workers from overlong working hours, from the dangers of unprotected machinery, and sweatshop conditions.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; The WTUL took action in composing a bill that would make the previous goals attainable, the bill called for an [[eight-hour day]]. They worked for three years gathering reports on conditions under which women were working, including unorganized women who did factory work in their own homes (these women had no standard wages, and payments ranged, the poorer the woman the worse the tragedies).&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; The reports were presented in the Women's Trade Union League's first exhibit, which was called "Exhibit of Dyanamic Sweatshops," they presented the eight-hour day bill as a health measure, because it was on those grounds that the Oregon ten-hour day was passed.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; The bill did not pass, Senator Jones suggested they exclude hotel and restaurant workers from the protection of the proposed law, and accept a ten-hour day, the WTUL refused to exclude any working women but did accept the ten-hour day, thus, in 1909 passed the Illinois ten-hour day (their proposed eight-hour day would be reached in 1937).&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; 
The topic of education for working women was just as crucial to the WTUL, they created an education program for working girls, in hopes of providing them with opportunities to explore cultural avenues which they had been denied from.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; In 1917, they worked out a plan with the Chicago Board of Education for the use of the classrooms of public schools (when they were not in use) to hold classes for the working women, Nestor particularly helped work out a course in the history of the trade-union movement.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt; In 1918, Nestor joined a group organized by [[Samuel Gompers]] to travel on a Labor mission to [[Europe]], the purpose of the mission was to cultivate international relationships between labor groups in the United States and in Europe and to demonstrate the readiness to help war-stricken Europe and cooperate once [[World War I]] ended.&lt;ref name="Nestor 1954"/&gt;

When Nestor returned to Chicago, she formed the Cooperative Glove Association of Chicago in 1921 to compete against non-union shops, but it failed in 1925 because it could not compete effectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She became involved in politics, running unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for state legislature in 1928,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; serving on the Chicago Recreation Commission (1934), the Board of Trustees of Chicago's [[Century of Progress]] Exposition (1933-1934), and the Advisory Committee of the Chicago Planning Commission (1939).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She opposed the [[National Woman's Party]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], arguing that they would not protect working women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] would have effected both the WTUL and the IGWU financially, the latter suffered greater than the former.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; Even with such setback, Nestor continued her work as a labor leader and spent a lot of time fundraising for the unions.&lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt; In the last decade of her life Nestor never retired, rather she spent her remaining years recruiting unorganized glove workers, and preventing the relaxation of labor laws during [[World War II]] &lt;ref name="Grivois-Shah"/&gt;

This means that all else being equal, males have to fertilize twice as many eggs or ovules as hermaphrodites to make up for the lack of female reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lloyd | first1 = DG | year = 1975 | title = The maintenance of gynodioecy and androdioecy in angiosperms | url = | journal = Genetica | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 325–339 | doi=10.1007/bf01508307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = B | last2 = Charlesworth | first2 = D | year = 1978 | title = A Model for the Evolution of Dioecy and Gynodioecy | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 112 | issue = 988| pages = 975–997 | doi=10.1086/283342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Androdioecy can evolve either from dioecious ancestors through the invasion of hermaphrodites or from hermaphroditic ancestors through the invasion of males. The ancestral state is important because conditions under which androdioecy can evolve differ significantly.

===Androdioecy with dioecious ancestry===
In roundworms, clam shrimp, tadpole shrimp and cancrid shrimps, androdioecy has evolved from dioecy. In these systems, hermaphrodites can only fertilize their own eggs (self-fertilize) and do not mate with other hermaphrodites. Males are the only means of [[outcrossing]]. Hermaphrodites may be beneficial in colonizing new habitats, because a single hermaphrodite can generate many other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pannell | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = A hypothesis for the evolution of androdioecy: the joint influence of reproductive assurance and local mate competition in a metapopulation | doi = 10.1023/A:1011082827809 | journal = Evolutionary Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 195–211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the well-studied [[roundworm]] [[Caenorhabditis elegans]], males are very rare and only occur in populations that are in bad condition or stressed.&lt;ref name="stewart2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = AD | last2 = Phillips | first2 = PC | year = 2002 | title = Selection and maintenance of androdioecy in Caenorhabditis elegans | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 160 | issue = 3| pages = 975–982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Androdioecy with hermaphroditic ancestry===
In animals, corals (phyla Cnidaria) and barnacles (Subphyla Crustacea), androdioecy has evolved from hermaphroditism. Many plants self-fertilize, and males may be sustained in a population when [[inbreeding depression]] is severe because males guarantee outcrossing.

==Androdioecious species==
Despite their unlikely evolution, 115 androdioecious animal and about 50 androdioecious plant species are known.&lt;ref name="weeks2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weeks | first1 = SC | last2 = Benvenuto | first2 = C | last3 = Reed | first3 = SK | year = 2006 | title = When males and hermaphrodites coexist: a review of androdioecy in animals | url = | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 449–464 | doi=10.1093/icb/icj048}}&lt;/ref&gt; These species include

'''[[Archangel Michael]]''' may be depicted in [[Christian art]] alone or with other [[angels]] such as [[Gabriel]] or saints. Some depictions with Gabriel date back to the 8th century, e.g. the stone casket at [[Mortain|Notre Dame de Mortain]] church in France.&lt;ref name=rich141 /&gt;  He is very often present in scenes of the [[Last Judgement]], but few other specific scenes, so most images including him are devotional rather than narrative.  The angel who rescues [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] from the "fiery furnace" in the Book of {{Bibleref2|Daniel|3|NIV|Daniel Chapter 3}} is usually regarded in Christian tradition as Michael; this is sometimes represented in [[Early Christian art]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s, but rarely in later art of the Western church. 

In most depictions Michael is represented as an angelic warrior, fully armed with helmet, sword, and shield,&lt;ref name=Cathenc /&gt; in the style of a Byzantine officer, which is typically found even in Western depictions, though some late-medieval ones have him in contemporary knightly armour.  Like other angels, in late-medieval Western art he may have what are known as [[feather tights]], with large feathers over most of his body, as on the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]].  He may be standing over a serpent, a dragon, or the defeated figure of Satan, whom he sometimes pierces with a lance.&lt;ref name=Cathenc /&gt; The iconography of Michael slaying a serpent goes back to the early 4th century, when [[Emperor Constantine]] defeated [[Licinius]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 324 AD, not far from the ''[[Michaelion]]'', a church dedicated to Archangel Michael.&lt;ref name=Richard &gt;''Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend'' by Richard Freeman Johnson 2005 {{ISBN|1843831287}} pages 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constantine felt that Licinius was an agent of Satan, and associated him with the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] described in the [[Book of Revelation]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#12:9|12:9]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine and the Christian empire'' by Charles Matson Odahl 2004 {{ISBN|0415174856}} page 315&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory, Constantine commissioned a depiction of himself and his sons slaying Licinius represented as a serpent - a symbolism borrowed from the Christian teachings on the Archangel to whom he attributed the victory. A similar painting, this time with the Archangel Michael himself slaying a serpent then became a major art piece at the Michaelion and eventually lead to the standard [[iconography]] of Archangel Michael as a [[warrior saint]].&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

In other depictions Michael may be holding a pair of scales in which he weighs the [[souls]] of the departed and may hold the [[book of Life]] (as in the [[Book of Revelation]]), to show that he takes part in the [[Last judgment|judgment]].&lt;ref name=rich141 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cathenc &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10275b.htm |title=Catholic encyclopedia: '&amp;#39;St. Michael the Archangel'&amp;#39; |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this form of depiction is less common than the slaying of the dragon.&lt;ref name=rich141 &gt;''Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend'' by Richard Freeman Johnson 2005 {{ISBN|1843831287}} pages 141-147&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelangelo]] depicted this scene on the altar wall of the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Monuments/The_Vatican_Museums/Sistine_Chapel--p--5.htm |title=Vatican website: Sistine Chapel |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526031746/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Monuments/The_Vatican_Museums/Sistine_Chapel--p--5.htm |archivedate=2010-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield may bears the Latin inscription ''[[Quis ut Deus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|087973910X}} page 520&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art]] Michael was often shown wearing the formal court robes and ''[[loros]]'' that were worn by the Emperor and his bodyguard on special occasions, rather than as a normal warrior who battled Satan or with scales for weighing souls on the [[Day of Judgement]].&lt;ref&gt;''Saints in art'' by Rosa Giorgi, Stefano Zuffi 2003 {{ISBN|0892367172}} pages 274-276&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely reproduced image of ''[[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]'', an icon of the [[Cretan school]], depicts Michael on the left carrying the lance and sponge of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], with [[Gabriel]] on the right side of [[Madonna and Child|Mary and Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Icons and saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church'' by Alfredo Tradigo 2006 {{ISBN|0892368454}} page 188&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] depictions, there are three icons of the Archangel Michael in whose composition he is said to have personally intervened: Archangel Michael of Mantamados in [[Mytilene]], Archangel Michael of [[Panormitis]] and Archangel Michael of [[Nenita (Greece)|Nenita]]. Each of these icons is different.

&lt;!--More typically, he is represented as the Chief Commander of the [[Heavenly hosts]], holding a sword in one hand; in the other he often carries either a shield, a date-tree branch, a spear, or a white banner (possibly with a scarlet cross). Some icons show him holding an orb in one hand and a staff in the other. Inside the orb are often the superimposed Greek letters ΧΡ, the [[ChiRho]] symbol for Christ.

Michael is also represented in icons as standing on a horizontal body and with his left arm held high, holding a small image of a "baby". The body represents a human being at the time of his death and the image of the "baby" represents the soul of the deceased. This icon came about since the belief that the Archangel Michael takes the souls of the dead to [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. This is typical of the miraculous and wonder-working Archangel Michael of Panormitis, in Symi of Greece.

In Russian iconography he is most likely to be wearing red. In many instances, Michael tramples the devil under his feet, which may be depicted as a dragon. This comes from the tradition that Michael was the main opponent of Satan in the [[War in Heaven|battle for Heaven]]. Satan, previously called Samael, was always looking to discredit [[Israelites|Israel]], while Michael was its main protector. In the end, Satan attempted to drag Michael down in his [[Fallen Angels|fall from the heights]], but Michael was rescued by God. --&gt;

[[File:Gaz bar maine.jpg|thumbnail|A [[gas station]] in [[Estcourt Station, Maine|Estcourt Station]], [[Maine]], caters to border shoppers from across the [[Canada–United States border|border]] with [[Canada]], where gasoline is significantly more expensive.]]
'''Border trade''', in general, refers to the flow of goods and services across the
international borders between jurisdictions. In this sense, it is a part of normal legal trade
that flows through standard export/import frameworks of nations. However border trade specifically refers to the ''increase'' in trade in areas where crossing borders is relatively easy and where products are significantly cheaper in one place than another, often because of significant variations in taxation levels on goods such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]].

As well as border trade across land or sea borders, air travel with a [[low-cost carrier]] can be worthwhile for a short international trip to the same purpose, although baggage restrictions can limit worthwhile savings to those for small high-value goods.

Where border trade is done for [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]] it forms part of the [[underground economy]] of both jurisdictions.

==By region==

===Europe===
Typical examples of this are the borders between [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]], between [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]]/[[Sweden]]/[[Finland]]/[[Russia]]/[[Estonia]] and between [[Denmark]]/[[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. For instance, the excise tax on alcohol is lower in Estonia than in Finland and much lower than in Sweden, thus it is common to buy large volumes of alcohol when returning from Estonia: there are shops in the Tallinn harbour that cater specifically to tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.err.ee/v/economy/0759bc45-5728-41c2-9f0a-b229a4724b2a|title=Third of Estonia's Alcohol Sales Attributed to Finnish Tourists|date= 22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland, the best-selling [[Alko]] shops in proportion to local population is on the border to Norway, since even if the alcohol tax is high in Finland, it is lower than the one in Norway.

Border trading exists between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]; during the [[Global Financial Crisis]], when the [[Euro]] rose against the [[British pound]], so many from the Republic visited [[Newry]]—with lines of traffic four miles long—that the phenomenon became known as the "Newry effect". One in four households in the Republic in counties as far as [[County Galway|Galway]], four hours away from the border, shopped for groceries in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="quinn20081218"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/world/europe/18ireland.html | title=A Northern Ireland Town Is a Shoppers’ Paradise | work=The New York Times | date=2008-12-18 | accessdate=5 May 2015 | author=Quinn, Eamon | pages=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrol is cheaper in the Republic, and groceries, furniture and clothing are cheaper in Northern Ireland.

Between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]/[[Belgium]], the [[booze cruise]] is a trip made specifically, or at least largely, to purchase cheaper alcohol and tobacco, and also goods offering different rates of VAT: [[laundry detergent]], perhaps surprisingly, is a common purchase. Similarly, there is an important number of French purchasers buying tobacco and alcohol in Spanish border towns such as [[Le Perthus]]. In [[Spain]], these products are a third cheaper than in France. During summer, around 70,000 visitors cross the Spanish border daily to buy such products, occasioning severe traffic jams. Nearby [[Andorra]], with a low VAT (4%), is also extremely popular with French customers residing in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/02/cross-border-buying-shopping-bargains-globalisation|title=Shop frontiers: the rise of cross-border buying around the world|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant amount of border trade in [[marijuana]] between the [[Netherlands]], [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|where cannabis is essentially legal]], and surrounding countries such as [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2013/09/24/weed-ghettos-for-tourists-anger-netherlands-neighbors/ | title=Marijuana For Tourists, Discord for the Netherlands | work=Forbes | date=2013-09-13 | accessdate=28 December 2015 | author=Rodriguez, Cecilia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more legal example of the Netherlands is the [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] province, where citizens occasionally take trips to Germany and Belgium to buy commodities like: medicinal products, handcrafted furniture, fresh produce, alcoholic beverages or home appliances for far lower prices due to the VAT. This is very easy as there are no border controls due to the [[Schengen Agreement]].

Residents of Switzlerland and Liechtenstein who are non-EU residents can purchase many items in nearby Germany from anything from two to seven times the price they would pay for the same products in their own countries. Austria is also somewhat cheaper than Switzerland. Residents of Switzerland usually qualify for a tax refund on purchases made in all of the surrounding [[EU]] countries making cross border shopping even more attractive, particularly in Germany where there is no minimum-purchase requirement for claiming the tax back.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/einkaufstourismus-ist-im-schweizer-detailhandel-eine-feste-groesse-ld.1345912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/einkaufstourismus-ld.1382332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/keine-mauer-wider-den-einkaufstourismus-ld.1317360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.foodaktuell.ch/einkaufstourismus-keine-entwarnung/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/wirtschaft/grenzgemeinden-erhoehen-druck_aerger-mit-einkaufstouristen--ein-politischer-dauerbrenner/43732754&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagblatt.ch/ostschweiz/einkaufstourismus-einkaeufe-im-netz-und-ennet-der-grenze-setzen-ostschweizer-gewerbe-weiter-zu-ld.1011904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unisg.ch/de#!/lightbox/https://www.unisg.ch/de/wissen/newsroom/aktuell/rssnews/forschung-lehre/2017/studie-einkaufstourismus-06dezember2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
Cross-border shopping between three countries in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]] is robust. The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) has reduced barriers and tariffs, facilitating cross-border trade. Each day 2008, $2 billion of cross-border trade was conducted between Canada and the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/release-communique/2008/2008-07-02-eng.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317141123/http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/release-communique/2008/2008-07-02-eng.html |archivedate=2010-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers take part in cross-border trading to broaden their product selection, gain access to a larger market place, or take advantage of currency volatility. Online commerce has taken on a more prominent role in recent years and gives consumers a convenient platform for cross-border shopping. However, additional border costs such as [[duties]], [[brokerage]] and shipping are not always disclosed up front or even known to the retailer, leading to a situation where the final cost of an item can greatly exceed expectations. Dedicated cross-border shopping solutions such as [[Wishabi]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wishabi.ca/cross_border_shopping&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada Post’s Borderfree exist to mitigate these problems with varied success. In the end, caution is necessary to determine the final cost of goods before purchase.

===Asia===
Many [[Singapore]]ans also travel to [[Johor Bahru]] in [[Malaysia]] or [[Batam]] in [[Indonesia]], to take advantage of price differences and differing product availability. The Singaporean government has a law that requires a car leaving Singapore to have the fuel tank filled by at least 75 percent, to prevent it from being filled with fuel from outside Singapore.

[[Shenzhen]], on the border of [[China|"mainland China"]] with the special region of [[Hong Kong]], also benefits from border trade.

A '''bumblebee''' (or '''bumble bee''',  '''bumble-bee''' or '''humble-bee''') is any of over 250 species in the [[genus]] '''''Bombus''''', part of [[Apidae]], one of the [[bee]] families. This genus is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] group in the tribe [[Bombini]], though a few extinct related genera (e.g., ''[[Calyptapis]]'') are known from [[fossil]]s. They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], although they are also found in [[South America]] where a few lowland tropical species have been identified. European bumblebees have also been introduced to [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]]. Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals. 

Most&lt;!--but not the cuckoo bumblebees--&gt; bumblebees are [[eusociality|social]] [[insect]]s that form [[colony (biology)|colonies]] with a single queen. The colonies are smaller than those of [[honey bee]]s, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. [[Psithyrus|Cuckoo bumblebees]] are [[brood parasite|brood parasitic]] and do not make nests; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers. Cuckoo bumblebees were previously classified as a separate genus, but are now usually treated as members of ''Bombus''.

Bumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair (long branched [[seta]]e) called ''pile'', making them appear and feel fuzzy. They have [[aposematism|aposematic (warning) coloration]], often consisting of contrasting bands of colour, and different species of bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective [[Müllerian mimicry]]. Harmless insects such as [[Hoverfly|hoverflies]] often derive protection from resembling bumblebees, in [[Batesian mimicry]], and may be confused with them.  Nest-making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large, fuzzy cuckoo bees by the form of the female hind leg. In nesting bumblebees, it is modified to form a [[pollen basket]], a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport [[pollen]], whereas in cuckoo bees, the hind leg is hairy all round, and pollen grains are wedged among the hairs for transport.

Like their relatives the honeybees, bumblebees feed on [[nectar]], using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the [[proboscis]] is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar to add to the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees [[nectar robbing|steal nectar]], making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural [[pollinator]]s, so [[Pollinator decline|their decline]] in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]], the [[mechanisation]] of [[agriculture]], and [[pesticide]]s.

==Etymology and common names==
[[File:Mrs tittlemouse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Beatrix Potter]] called Babbity Bumble a {{nowrap|"bumble bee"}} in ''[[The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse]]'', 1910.]]
The word "bumblebee" is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of "bumble" + "bee"—"bumble" meaning to hum, buzz, drone, or move ineptly or flounderingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Brown, Lesley |author2=Stevenson, Angus |title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2007 |page=309 |isbn=978-0-19-923325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[genus|generic]] name ''Bombus'', assigned by [[Pierre André Latreille]] in 1802, is derived from the Latin word for a buzzing or humming sound.&lt;ref&gt;[[:wiktionary:bombus#Latin|Wiktionary entry for "bombus"]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=77|year=1855|issue=6|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED), the term "bumblebee" was first recorded as having been used in the English language in the 1530 work ''Lesclarcissement'' by [[John Palsgrave]], "I bomme, as a bombyll bee dothe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=bumble-bee, n |url=http://www.oed.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/view/Entry/24660?redirectedFrom=bumblebee#eid |work=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the OED also states that the term "'''humblebee'''" predates it, having first been used in 1450 in ''Fysshynge wyth Angle'', "In Juyll the greshop &amp; the humbylbee in the medow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=humble-bee, n |url=http://www.oed.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/view/Entry/89303?redirectedFrom=humblebee#eid |work=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter term was used in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (''circa'' 1600) by [[William Shakespeare]], "The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shakespeare, William |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2242 |title=A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare – Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=1 July 2000 |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An old provincial name, "dumbledor", also denoted a buzzing insect such as a bumblebee or [[cockchafer]], "dumble" probably imitating the sound of these insects, while "[[Geotrupidae|dor]]" meant "beetle".&lt;ref name=WebsterDumbledor&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=dumbledor |title=Dumbledor |encyclopedia=Merriam–Webster |year=1913 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017052743/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=dumbledor |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] speculated about "humble-bees" and their interactions with other species:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1228 |title=On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection, or, the Preservation of – Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=1 March 1998 |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I have [...] reason to believe that humble-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease (''[[Viola tricolor]]''), for other bees do not visit this flower. From experiments which I have tried, I have found that the visits of bees, if not indispensable, are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers; but humble-bees alone visit the common red clover (''[[Trifolium pratense]]''), as other bees cannot reach the nectar.}}

However, "bumblebee" remained in use, for example in ''[[The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse]]'' (1910) by [[Beatrix Potter]], "Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--"Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!" said the bumble bee." Since [[World War II]] "humblebee" has fallen into near-total disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the humblebee became the bumblebee |author=Jones, Richard |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/01/humblebee-bumblebee-darwin |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 1 August 2010 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phylogeny==
The bumblebee tribe [[Bombini]] is one of four groups of corbiculate bees (those with pollen baskets) in the [[Apidae]], the others being the Apini (honeybees), Euglossini ([[Euglossini|orchid bees]]), and [[Meliponini]] (stingless bees). The corbiculate bees are a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] group. Advanced [[eusociality|eusocial behaviour]] appears to have evolved twice in the group, giving rise to controversy, now largely settled, as to the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] origins of the four tribes; it had been supposed that eusocial behaviour had evolved only once, requiring the Apini to be close to the Meliponini, which they do not resemble. It is now thought that the Apini (with advanced societies) and Euglossini are closely related, while the primitively eusocial Bombini are close to the Meliponini, which have somewhat more advanced eusocial behaviour. Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth comment that "While remarkable, a hypothesis of dual origins of advanced eusociality is congruent with early studies on corbiculate morphology and social behavior."&lt;ref name=Cardinal&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cardinal |first1=Sophie |last2=Danforth |first2=Bryan N. |title=The Antiquity and Evolutionary History of Social Behavior in Bees |journal=PLOS ONE |date=June 2011 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e21086 |pmc=3113908 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021086 |pmid=21695157 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...621086C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis, combining [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[ethology|behavioural]] data, gives the following [[cladogram]]:&lt;ref name=Cardinal/&gt;

On this hypothesis, the molecular data suggest that the Bombini are 25 to 40 million years old, while the Meliponini (and thus the clade that includes the Bombini and Meliponini) are 81 to 96 million years old, about the same age as the corbiculate group.&lt;ref name=Cardinal/&gt;

However, a more recent phylogeny using transcriptome data from 3,647 genes of ten corbiculate bee species supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis in the corbiculate bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J.|last=Romiguier|first2=S.A.|last2=Cameron|first3=S.H.|last3=Woodard|first4=B.J.|last4=Fischman|first5=L.|last5=Keller|first6=C.J.|last6=Praz|date=2015|title=Phylogenomics controlling for base compositional bias reveals a single origin of eusociality in corbiculate bees|url=|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=33|pages=670–678}}&lt;/ref&gt; They find that Bombini is in fact sister to Meliponini, corroborating that previous finding from Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth (2011). However, Romiguier et al. (2015) shows that Bombini, Meliponini, and Apini form a monophyletic group, where Apini shares a most recent common ancestor with the Bombini and Meliponini clade, while Euglossini is most distantly related to all three, since it does not share the same most recent common ancestor as Bombini, Meliponini, and Apini. Thus, their analysis supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis within the corbiculate bees, where eusociality evolved in the common ancestor of Bombini, Apini, and Meliponini. 

The fossil record for bees is incomplete. Around 11 specimens that might possibly be Bombini, some poorly documented, had been described by 2011; some (such as ''[[Calyptapis florissantensis]]'' from [[Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument|Florissant]], USA, and ''[[Oligoapis beskonakensis]]'' from [[:tr:Beşkonak, Bucak|Beskonak]], Turkey) dated from the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref name="Wappler" /&gt; In 2012 a fossil bumblebee, ''[[Bombus randeckensis|Bombus (Bombus) randeckensis]]'' was described from the [[Miocene]] Randeck Maar in southwestern Germany and confidently placed in the subgenus ''Bombus''.&lt;ref name="Wappler"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wappler |first1=Torsten |last2=De Meulemeester |first2=Thibaut |last3=Aytekin |first3=A.

==General description==
{{further|Characteristics of common wasps and bees}}

Bumblebees vary in appearance, but are generally plump and densely furry. They are larger, broader and stouter-bodied than honeybees, and their abdomen tip is more rounded. Many species have broad bands of colour, the patterns helping to distinguish different species. Whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly pollinate open flowers, some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed into a tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The differences between bumblebees and honeybees |url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/faqs/honeybees-vs-bumblebees/ |publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust |accessdate=23 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228004017/http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/faqs/honeybees-vs-bumblebees |archive-date=28 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bumblebees have fewer stripes (or none), and usually have part of the body covered in black fur, while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on the abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wild |first1=Alex |title=How to tell the difference between honey bees and bumble bees |url=http://www.myrmecos.net/2011/10/11/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-honey-bees-and-bumble-bees/ |publisher=Myrmecos |accessdate=23 February 2015|date=2011-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizes are very variable even within species; the largest British species, ''B. terrestris'', has queens up to {{cvt|22|mm|1}} long, males up to {{cvt|16|mm|1}} long, and workers between {{cvt|11|and(-)|17|mm|1}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bumblebee species|url=http://www.bumblebee.org/key.htm |publisher=Bumblebee.org |accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest bumblebee species in the world is ''[[Bombus dahlbomii|B. dahlbomii]]'' of Chile, up to about {{cvt|40|mm|1}} long, and described as "flying mice" and "a monstrous fluffy ginger beast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnston |first1=Ian |title=Bye bye big bee: In South America, the world's largest bumblebee is at risk from imported rivals |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/bye-bye-big-bee-in-south-america-the-worlds-largest-bumblebee-is-at-risk-from-imported-rivals-9587240.html |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=23 February 2015 |date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Distribution and habitat==

Bumblebees are typically found in [[temperate climate]]s, and are often found at higher [[latitude]]s and [[altitude]]s than other bees, although a few lowland [[tropics|tropical]] species exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Map at: Bumblebees of the world |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/projects/bombus/introduction.html |accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few species (''[[Bombus polaris|B. polaris]]'' and ''[[Bombus alpinus|B. alpinus]]'') range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found; ''B. polaris'' occurs in northern [[Ellesmere Island]] in the high Arctic, along with another bumblebee ''[[Bombus hyperboreus|B. hyperboreus]]'', which parasitises its nest. This is the most northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Milliron, H. E. |author2=Oliver, D. R. |year=1966 |title=Bumblebees from northern Ellesmere Island, with observations on usurpation by ''Megabombus hyperboreus'' (Schönh.) |journal=Canadian Entomologist |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=207–213 |doi=10.4039/Ent98207-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]], via [[sunlight|solar radiation]], internal mechanisms of "shivering" and radiative cooling from the abdomen (called [[heterothermy]]). Other bees have similar [[physiology]], but the mechanisms seem best developed and have been most studied in bumblebees.&lt;ref name=Heinrich&gt;{{cite book |author=Heinrich, B. |year=1981 |title=Insect Thermoregulation |publisher=Krieger Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-471-05144-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dillon |first=Michael E |author2=Dudley, Robert |title=Surpassing Mt.

==Biology==
[[File:Bumblebee heuchera.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A common carder bumblebee ''[[Bombus pascuorum]]'' extending its tongue towards a ''[[Heuchera]]'' [[inflorescence]]]]

===Feeding===
The bumblebee tongue (the [[proboscis]]) is a long, hairy structure that extends from a sheath-like modified maxilla. The primary action of the tongue is lapping, that is, repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00377639 | pmid = 28311376 | author = Harder, L.D. | year = 1986 | title = Effects of nectar concentration and flower depth on flower handling efficiency of bumble bees | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 69 | issue = 2| pages = 309–315 | bibcode = 1986Oecol..69..309H }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The tip of the tongue probably acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by [[capillary action]]. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinrich, Bernd |title=Bumblebee Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73yeOpls5qsC&amp;pg=PA152|year=2004 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-01639-2 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bees with shorter proboscides, like [[Bombus bifarius]], have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, which resulted in a small reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor= 3548471|title = Effects of nectar robbing on nectar dynamics and bumblebee foraging strategies in Linaria vulgaris (Scrophulariaceae)|last = Newman|first = Daniel A.|year= 2005|journal = Okies|doi =10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13884.x |last2 = Thomson|first2 = James D.|last3 = Ranta|first3 = Esa|volume = 10|issue = 2|pages = 309–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wax production===
The exoskeleton of the [[abdomen]] is divided into plates called dorsal [[tergum|tergites]] and ventral [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternites]]. Wax is secreted from [[gland]]s on the abdomen and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of [[dandruff]]. It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs, moulded until malleable and used in the construction of honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.&lt;ref name=body&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bumblebee.org/body.htm |title=The bumblebee body |publisher=Bumblebee.org |accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coloration===
[[File:Bombus.barbutellus.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|upright|Cuckoo bumblebees, like this ''[[Bombus barbutellus]]'', have similar [[aposematic]] (warning) coloration to nest-making bumblebees, and may also [[mimicry|mimic]] their host species.]]
{{further|aposematism|mimicry}}

The brightly coloured pile of the bumblebee is an [[aposematism|aposematic]] (warning) signal, given that females can inflict a painful sting. Depending on the species and [[polymorphism (biology)|morph]], the warning colours range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink.&lt;ref name=Williams2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, Paul H. |year=2007 |title=The distribution of bumblebee colour patterns world-wide: possible significance for thermoregulation, crypsis, and warning mimicry |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=97–118 |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/projects/bombus/colour.html |accessdate=9 July 2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00878.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diptera]]n flies in the families [[Syrphidae]] (hoverflies), [[Asilidae]] (robber flies), [[Tabanidae]] (horseflies), [[Oestridae]] (bot or warble flies) and [[Bombyliidae]] (bee flies) all include [[Batesian mimics]] of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.&lt;ref name="ThorpHorning1983"/&gt;

Many  species of ''Bombus'', including the group sometimes called ''Psithyrus'' (cuckoo bumblebees), have evolved [[Müllerian mimicry]], where the different bumblebees in a region resemble each other, so that a young predator need only learn to avoid any of them once. For example, in California a group of bumblebees consists of largely black species including ''[[Bombus californicus|B. californicus]]'', ''[[Bombus caliginosus|B. caliginosus]]'', ''[[Bombus vandykeei|B. vandykei]]'', ''[[Bombus vosnesenskii|B. vosnesenskii]]'', ''[[Bombus insularis|B. insularis]]'' and ''[[Bombus fernaldae|B. fernaldae]]''. Other bees in California include a group of species all banded black and yellow. In each case, Müllerian mimicry provides the bees in the group with a selective advantage.&lt;ref name="ThorpHorning1983"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorp |first1=Robbin W. |last2=Horning |first2=Donald S. |last3=Dunning |first3=Lorry L. |title=Bumble Bees and Cuckoo Bumble Bees of California (Hymenoptera, Apidae) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1eJ3fWwshIC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=1983 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-09645-5 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parasitic (cuckoo) bumblebees resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance, at least in areas like Europe where parasite-host co-speciation is common; but this too may be explained as Müllerian mimicry, rather than requiring the parasite's coloration to deceive the host ([[aggressive mimicry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Paul H. |title=Do the parasitic Psithyrus resemble their host bumblebees in colour pattern? |journal=Apidologie |date=2008 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=637–649 |doi=10.1051/apido:2008048 |url=http://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/2008/06/m08010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature control===
Bumblebees are active in conditions when honeybees stay at home, and can readily absorb heat from even weak sunshine.&lt;ref name="Macdonald, 2003. p. 6"&gt;Macdonald, 2003. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The thick pile created by long [[seta]]e (bristles) acts as insulation to keep bumblebees warm in cold weather; species from cold climates have longer setae (and thus thicker insulation) than those from the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peat, J. |author2=Darvill, B. |author3=Ellis, J. |author4=Goulson, D. |title=Effects of climate on intra- and interspecific size variation in bumble-bees |journal=Ecology |date=2005 |volume=19 |pages=145–151 |url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=peat-et-al-funct-ecol-2005.pdf&amp;site=411 |doi=10.1111/j.0269-8463.2005.00946.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature of the flight muscles, which occupy much of the thorax, needs to be at least {{convert|30|°C}} before flight can take place. The muscle temperature can be raised by shivering. It takes about five minutes for the muscles to reach this temperature at an air temperature of {{convert|13|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bumblebee.org/bodyWing.htm |title=Bumblebee wings |publisher=Bumblebee.org |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chill-coma temperature ====
The chill-coma temperature in relation to flying insects is the temperature at which flight muscles cannot be activated. Compared to honey bees and carpenter bees, bumblebees have the lowest chill-coma temperature. Of the bumblebees ''[[Two-spotted bumble bee|Bombus bimaculatus]]'' has the lowest at {{convert|7|°C}}. However, bumblebees have been seen to fly in colder ambient temperatures. This discrepancy is likely because the chill-coma temperature was determined by tests done in a laboratory setting. However, bumblebees live in insulated shelters and can shiver to warm up before venturing into the cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Comparative Study of Chill-Coma Temperatures and Muscle Potentials in Insect Flight Muscles|url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/150/1/221|journal = Journal of Experimental Biology|date = May 1990|issn = 0022-0949|pages = 221–231|volume = 150|issue = 1|first = Franz|last = Goller|first2 = Harald|last2 = Esch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication and social learning===
Bumblebees do not have ears, and it is not known whether or how well they can hear. However, they are sensitive to the vibrations made by sound travelling through wood or other materials.&lt;ref name=body/&gt;

Bumblebees do not exhibit the "[[Waggle dance|bee dances]]" used by honeybees to tell other workers the locations of food sources. Instead, when they return from a successful foraging expedition, they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more. These bees may be offering some form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made by their wings, which may stimulate other bees to start foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dornhaus, Anna |author2=Chittka, Lars |year=2001 |title=Food alert in bumblebees (''Bombus terrestris''): possible mechanisms and evolutionary implications |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=570–576 |doi=10.1007/s002650100395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another stimulant to foraging activity is the level of food reserves in the colony. Bees monitor the amount of honey in the honeypots, and when little is left or when high quality food is added, they are more likely to go out to forage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dornhaus, Anna |author2=Chittka, Lars |year=2005 |title=Bumble bees (''Bombus terrestris'') store both food and information in honeypots |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=661–666 |doi= 10.1093/beheco/ari040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumblebees have been observed to partake in [[social learning in animals|social learning]]. In a 2017 study involving ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward. Bees that first observed another bee complete the task were significantly more successful in learning the task than bees that observed the same action performed by a magnet, indicating the importance of social information. The bees did not copy each other exactly: in fact, the study suggested that the bees were instead attempting to [[Emulation (observational learning)|emulate each other's goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loukola|first1=Olli J.|last2=Perry|first2=Clint J.|last3=Coscos|first3=Louie|last4=Chittka|first4=Lars|title=Bumblebees show cognitive flexibility by improving on an observed complex behavior|journal=Science|date=24 February 2017|volume=355|issue=6327|pages=833–836|doi=10.1126/science.aag2360|pmid=28232576|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6327/833|language=en|issn=0036-8075|bibcode=2017Sci...355..833L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Traci|title=Bees learn football from their buddies|url=http://www.nature.com/news/bees-learn-football-from-their-buddies-1.21540|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21540|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and nesting===

Nest size depends on species of bumblebee. Most form [[colony (biology)|colonies]] of between 50 and 400 individuals,&lt;ref name="BBCT-nest"/&gt; but colonies have been documented as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cueva del Castillo|first1=R|last2=Sanabria-Urbán|first2=S.|last3=Serrano-Meneses|first3=M.

Many species nest underground, choosing old [[rodent]] burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight that could result in overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.&lt;ref name="BBCT-nest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bumblebee nests|url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/habitats/bumblebee-nests/|publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust|accessdate=13 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922230805/https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/habitats/bumblebee-nests/|archive-date=22 September 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early spring, the queen comes out of [[diapause]] and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In [[Temperate climate|temperate zone]]s, young queens ([[gyne]]s) leave the nest in the autumn and [[mating|mate]], often more than once, with males ([[drone (bee)|drone]]s) that are forcibly driven out of the colony.&lt;ref name="Goulson-cycle"/&gt; The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the [[early bumblebee]] being the species that is among the first to emerge.&lt;ref name="Goulson-cycle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Using citizen science to monitor Bombus populations in the UK: nesting ecology and relative abundance in the urban environment|journal = Journal of Insect Conservation|date=November 2011|issn = 1366-638X|pages = 697–707|volume = 16|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s10841-011-9450-3|first = Gillian C.|last = Lye|first2 = Juliet L.|last2 = Osborne|first3 = Kirsty J.|last3 = Park|first4 = Dave|last4 = Goulson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCT-lifecycle"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bumblebee Lifecycle |url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/lifecycle/ |publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year.

In fertilised queens, the ovaries only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the [[oviduct]] to the vagina where there is a chamber called the [[spermatheca]], in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become [[haploid]] males; fertilised eggs grow into [[diploid]] females and queens.&lt;ref name="NZ-bees"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biology |url=http://www.biobees.co.nz/biology.html |publisher=Biobees Bumblebee Pollination |accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hormone]]s that stimulate the development of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.&lt;ref name="Goulson-cycle"/&gt;

To develop, the [[larva]]e must be fed both nectar for [[carbohydrate]]s and pollen for [[protein]]. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing a small hole in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen in one of two ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen at the base of the brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book |title=Befriending Bumble Bees |author1=Evans, Elaine |author2=Burns, Ian |author3=Spivak, Marla |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |location=St. Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the emergence of the first or second group of offspring, workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae. The colony grows progressively larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens.&lt;ref name="Goulson-cycle"&gt;Goulson, 2013. pp. 16–24&lt;/ref&gt;
Bumblebee workers can lay unfertilised haploid eggs (with only a single set of [[chromosome]]s) that develop into viable male bumblebees. Only fertilised queens can lay diploid eggs (one set of chromosomes from a drone, one from the queen) that mature into workers and new queens.&lt;ref&gt;Goulson, 2013. pp. 108–114&lt;/ref&gt;

In a young colony, the queen minimises reproductive competition from workers by suppressing their egg-laying through physical aggression and [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="Honk"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Honk |first1=C.

Although a large majority of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen, some select Bombus species (such as ''[[Bombus atratus]]'') will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase (have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny).&lt;ref name=three&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cameron|first1=S.D|title=Mediators of dominance and   reproductive success  among queens in the cyclically polygynous neotropical bumble bee Bombus atratus Franklin|journal=Insectes Sociaux|year=1998|volume=45|issue=2|pages=135–149|url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/scameron/pdfs/Mediators%20of%20dominance%20and%20reproductive%20success.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 September 2015|doi=10.1007/s000400050075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollen is removed from flowers deliberately or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees come in contact with the [[stamen|anthers]] of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the [[Pollen basket|corbiculae]] (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bumblebee.org/bodyLegs.htm |title=Bumblebee legs |publisher=Bumblebee.org |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bumblebees are also capable of [[buzz pollination]], in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a [[resonance|resonant vibration]] with their flight muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buzz Pollination | author=Leonard, Anne |url=http://www.anneleonard.com/buzz-pollination |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asynchronous flight muscles===

Bees beat their wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not contract on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second.&lt;ref name="Book of Insect Records"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scherer|first1=C.W.|title=Fastest Wing Beat|url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_09.shtml|website=Book of Insect Records|publisher=University of Florida|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of muscles are called [[asynchronous muscles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/asynchronous-muscle | title = Definition of Asynchronous muscle in the Entomologists' glossary |accessdate = 19 April 2013| publisher = Department of Entomology, North Carolina State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are found in the [[insect wing]] systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, [[Coleoptera]], and [[Hemiptera]].&lt;ref name="Book of Insect Records"/&gt; Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures.

===Sting===
Queen and worker bumblebees can [[bee sting|sting]]. Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's sting lacks barbs, so the bee can sting repeatedly without injuring itself; by the same token, the sting is not left in the wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mbeesting.htm |title=Do bumblebees sting?

===Agricultural use===
{{further|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}

Bumblebees are important [[pollinator]]s of both [[crop]]s and [[wildflower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Modelling bee pollination: enter the 'flight arena' |url=http://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/research/current/modelling-bee-pollination.html |website=Global Food Security |publisher=Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony, they do not stockpile honey, and therefore are not useful as honey producers. Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators, among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as [[tomato]] in [[greenhouse]]s by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/OnEarth/06sum/bees3.asp |title=NRDC: OnEarth Magazine, Summer 2006 – The Vanishing |accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial production began in 1987, when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company; in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of [[tomato]]es. The industry grew quickly, starting with other companies in the Netherlands. Bumblebee nests, mainly of buff-tailed bumblebees, are produced in at least 30 factories around the world; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe; Turkey is a major producer.&lt;ref&gt;Goulson, 2013. pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumblebees are [[Northern Hemisphere]] animals. When [[red clover]] was introduced as a crop to [[New Zealand]] in the nineteenth century, it was found to have no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed.&lt;ref name="Macdonald, 2003. p. 6"/&gt; Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in [[greenhouse]]s.&lt;ref name="NZ-bees"/&gt; The New Zealand population of [[buff-tailed bumblebee]]s naturally colonised [[Tasmania]], 1,500 miles away, in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Goulson, 2013. pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population decline===
&lt;!--this is very close to a COATRACK, should maybe become a separate article--&gt;

Bumblebee species are declining in Europe, North America, and Asia due to a number of factors, including land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus&lt;!--source says ''sensu stricto'', "in the narrow sense"--&gt; ''Bombus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2009 |journal=Apidologie |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=367–387 |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/bombus/Williams&amp;Osborne09_review.pdf| doi=10.1051/apido/2009025 |title=Bumblebee vulnerability and conservation world-wide |first1=Paul H. |last1=Williams |first2=Juliet L. |last2=Osborne}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Goulson, 2013. pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the genus ''Bombus''. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species ''[[Bombus hortorum]]'' in particular has been found to be impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Newly Recorded Neogregarine (Protozoa, Apicomplexa), Parasite in Honey Bees (Apis Mellifera) and Bumble Bees (Bombus Spp)|last = Lipa|first = JJ|date = 1992|journal = Adipologie|doi = 10.1051/apido:19920605|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Triggiani|first2 = O.|issue = 6|volume = 23|pages = 533–536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumblebees are in danger in many developed countries due to [[habitat destruction]] and collateral [[pesticide]] damage. The [[European Food Safety Authority]] ruled that three [[neonicotinoid]] pesticides ([[clothianidin]], [[imidacloprid]], and [[thiamethoxam]]) presented [[Imidacloprid effects on bee population|a high risk for bees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Pesticides : un risque enfin admis pour les abeilles |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2013/01/16/pesticides-un-risque-enfin-admis-pour-les-abeilles_1817630_3244.html |newspaper=Le Monde |accessdate=23 December 2013 |date=16 January 2013 |first=Stéphane |last= Foucart}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees, a study on ''B. terrestris'' showed that "field-realistic" levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85%, implying a "considerable negative effect" on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world.&lt;ref name=Whitehorn&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitehorn |first1=Penelope R.|last2=O'Connor |first2=Stephanie |last3=Wackers |first3=Felix L. |last4=Goulson |first4=Dave |title=Neonicotinoid Pesticide Reduces Bumble Bee Colony Growth and Queen Production |journal=Science |date=20 April 2012 |volume=336 |issue=6079 |pages=351–352 |doi=10.1126/science.1215025 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6079/351|bibcode = 2012Sci...336..351W |pmid=22461500}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in another study, following chronic exposure to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam, colony weight gain was not affected, nor were the number or mass of sexuals produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=Dara A.|last2=Raine|first2=Nigel E.|title=Bumblebee colony development following chronic exposure to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam under laboratory conditions|journal=Scientific Reports|date=2017|page=8005|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-08752-x|pmid=28808317|pmc=5556064|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08752-x|volume=7|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low levels of neonicotinoids can reduce the number of bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55%, and cause dysfunction in the bumblebees' brains.

In 2006 the bumblebee researcher [[Dave Goulson]] founded a registered charity, the [[Bumblebee Conservation Trust]], to prevent the extinction "of any of the UK's bumblebees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-us/ | title=About us | publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust | accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barkham |first1=Patrick |title=A Sting in the Tale by Dave Goulson – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/18/sting-tale-dave-goulson-review |accessdate=26 June 2014|work=The Guardian |issue=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 and 2010, the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee, ''[[Bombus subterraneus]]'', which had become extinct in Britain, from the British-derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Goulson, 2013. pp. 1–14, 227–241&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011 the Trust, in partnership with [[Natural England]], Hymettus and the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|RSPB]], has reintroduced short-haired bumblebee queens from [[Skåne]] in southern Sweden to restored flower-rich meadows at Dungeness in Kent. The queens were checked for [[mites]] and [[American foulbrood]] disease. Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of [[Romney Marsh]] have been set up to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees. By the summer of 2013, workers of the species were found near the release zone, proving that nests had been established. The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five "Schedule 41 priority" species: the ruderal bumblebee, ''[[Bombus ruderatus]]'';  the red-shanked carder bee, ''[[Bombus ruderarius]]''; the shrill carder bee, ''[[Bombus sylvarum]]''; the brown-banded carder bee, ''[[Bombus humilis]]'' and the moss carder bee,  ''[[Bombus muscorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Short-haired bumblebee reintroduction |url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-us/case-study/short-haired-bumblebee-reintroduction/ |publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust |accessdate=19 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216002921/http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-us/case-study/short-haired-bumblebee-reintroduction/ |archivedate=16 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumblebee conservation is in its infancy in many parts of the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.&lt;ref name="Goulson, 2013. pp. 169–172"/&gt;

===Misconception about flight===
{{anchor|Flight}}
[[File:AD2009Aug08 Bombus pratorum.jpg|thumb|right|A widely believed falsehood holds that scientists proved bumblebees to be incapable of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/5400/title/Math_Trek__Flight_of_the_Bumblebee|title=Flight of the Bumblebee |author=Ivars Peterson |date=11 September 2004 |work=[[Science News]] |accessdate=29 May 2012}} "the venerable line about scientists having proved that a bumblebee can't fly appears regularly in magazine and newspaper stories. It's also the kind of item that can come up in a cocktail party conversation when the subject turns to science or technology. [...] Often, the statement is made in a distinctly disparaging tone aimed at putting down those know-it-all scientists and engineers who are so smart yet can't manage to understand something that's apparent to everyone else. [...] the story has had remarkable staying power, and the myth persists that science says a bumblebee can't fly. Indeed, this myth has taken on a new life of its own as a piece of "[[urban legend|urban folklore]]" on the Internet."&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=A bumblebee landing on a purple flower]]
{{further|Insect flight}}

According to 20th-century [[folklore]], the laws of [[aerodynamics]] prove the bumblebee should be incapable of [[flight]], as it does not have the capacity (in terms of wing size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree of [[wing loading]] necessary.&lt;ref name=Physics/&gt;

{{quote|'Supposedly someone did a back of the envelope calculation, taking the weight of a bumblebee and its wing area into account, and worked out that if it only flies at a couple of metres per second, the wings wouldn't produce enough lift to hold the bee up,' explains Charlie Ellington, Professor of Animal Mechanics at Cambridge University.&lt;ref name=Physics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.org/featuredetail.asp?id=32 |title=The secrets of bee flight |accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The origin of this claim has been difficult to pin down with any certainty. [[John H. McMasters]] recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded, presumably in jest, that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McMasters, John H. |title=The flight of the bumblebee and related myths of entomological engineering |journal=American Scientist |volume=77 |issue=2 |date=March–April 1989 |pages=146–169 |bibcode=1989AmSci..77..164M}} cited in {{cite book |author=Jay Ingram |title=The Barmaid's Brain |publisher=[[Aurum Press]] |year=2001 |pages=91–92 |isbn=978-1-85410-633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, McMasters backed away from this origin, suggesting there could be multiple sources, and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book ''{{lang|fr|Le Vol des Insectes}}'' by French entomologist [[Antoine Magnan]] (1881–1938); they had applied the equations of [[drag (physics)|air resistance]] to insects and found  their flight was impossible, but  "One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jay Ingram |title=The Barmaid's Brain |publisher=[[Aurum Press]] |year=2001 |pages=91–92 |isbn=978-1-85410-633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following passage appears in the introduction to ''Le Vol des Insectes'':&lt;ref name=Magnan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magnan |first1=Antoine |title=Le Vol des Insectes |date=1934 |publisher=Hermann |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Le_vol_des_insectes.html?id=RoXgOgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''{{lang|fr|Tout d'abord poussé par ce qui se fait en aviation, j'ai appliqué aux insectes les lois de la résistance de l'air, et je suis arrivé avec M. Sainte-Laguë à cette conclusion que leur vol est impossible.}}''}}

This translates to:

{{quote|''First prompted by what is done in aviation, I applied the laws of air resistance to insects, and I arrived, with Mr. Sainte-Laguë, at this conclusion that their flight is impossible.''}}

Magnan refers to his assistant [[André Sainte-Laguë]].&lt;ref&gt;"The bumblebee story can be traced back to a 1934 book by entomologist Antoine Magnan, who refers to a calculation by his assistant André Sainte-Laguë, who was an engineer. The conclusion was presumably based on the fact that the maximum possible lift produced by aircraft wings as small as a bumblebee's wings and traveling as slowly as a bee in flight would be much less than the weight of a bee."{{Cite journal

[[File:Bumble Bee in flight.JPG|thumb|left|Bumblebee in flight. It has its tongue extended and a laden pollen basket.]]

The calculations that purported to show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of [[oscillating]] [[airfoil|aerofoils]]. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of [[Stall (flight)#Dynamic stall|dynamic stall]] (an airflow separation inducing a large [[vortex]] above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every [[oscillation|oscillation cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bumblebees finally cleared for takeoff |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/March00/APS_Wang.hrs.html |publisher=Cornell Chronicle |date=20 March 2000 |accessdate=26 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[John Maynard Smith]], a noted biologist with a strong background in aeronautics, has pointed out that bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that [[viscosity]] at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/84 |title=Flight in Birds and Aeroplanes – Science Video |author=[[John Maynard Smith]] |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumblebees appear as characters, often eponymously, in children's books. The surname [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] in the [[Harry Potter]] series (1997–2007) is an old name for bumblebee.&lt;ref name=WebsterDumbledor/&gt; [[J. K.

Went Bumble-bee'' by Colin West (1997); ''Bumble Bee'' by Margaret Wise Brown (2000); ''How the Bumble Came to Bee'' by Paul and Ella Quarry (2012); ''The Adventures of Professor Bumble and the Bumble Bees'' by Stephen Brailovsky (2010). Among [[Beatrix Potter]]'s "little books", Babbity Bumble and other members of her nest appear in ''[[The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse]]''&lt;!--overlinks, these seem sensible here--&gt; (1910).

[[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] is the name of a prominent character in the [[Transformers]] franchise. His name denotes his black-on-yellow vehicle paint job, directly referencing the bee genus because of its black and yellow stripes. ''Bumblebee'' is also the name of an automotive [[racing stripe]] that wraps around the grill instead of down the centre of the vehicle; it can be found mainly on [[Chevrolet Camaro]]s (which happens to be the Transformers Autobot's most popular vehicle mode).

'''Bush tucker''', also called '''bushfood''', is any food native to Australia and used as sustenance by the original inhabitants, the [[Aboriginal Australians]], but it can also describe any native fauna or flora used for culinary and/or medicinal purposes, regardless of the continent or culture. Examples of Australian native animal foods (meats) include [[Kangaroo (meat)|kangaroo]], [[emu]] and [[crocodile]]. In particular, kangaroo is quite common and can be found in Australian supermarkets, often cheaper than beef. Other animals, for example [[goanna]] and [[witchetty grub]]s, were eaten by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] Australians. Fish and [[shellfish]] are culinary features of the Australian coastal communities.

Examples of Australian native plant foods include the fruits [[Santalum acuminatum|quandong]], [[Solanum centrale|kutjera]], [[muntries]], [[riberry]], [[Davidsonia|Davidson's plum]], and [[finger lime]]. Native spices include [[lemon myrtle]], [[Tasmannia lanceolata|mountain pepper]], and [[aniseed myrtle]]. A popular leafy vegetable is [[warrigal greens]]. Nuts include [[bunya nut]], and the most identifiable bush tucker plant harvested and sold in large-scale commercial quantities is the [[macadamia]] nut. Knowledge of Aboriginal uses of fungi is meagre but [[Fistulina hepatica|beefsteak fungus]] and [[Laccocephalum mylittae|native "bread"]] (a fungus also), were certainly eaten.

[[Aboriginal Australians]] have eaten native animal and plant foods for an estimated 60,000 years{{cn|date=December 2016}} of human habitation on the Australian continent (''see [[Indigenous Australian food groups]], [[Australian Aboriginal sweet foods]])''. Various traditional methods of processing and cooking are used. Toxic seeds, such as [[Cycas|''Cycas media'']] and [[Castanospermum|Moreton Bay chestnut]], are processed to remove the toxins and render them safe to eat. Many foods are also baked in the hot campfire coals, or baked for several hours in ground ovens. "[[Paperbark]]", the bark of ''[[Melaleuca]]'' species, is widely used for wrapping food placed in ground ovens. [[Bush bread]] was made by males using many types of seeds, nuts and corns to process a flour or dough to make bread.

Aboriginal traditional native food use has been severely affected by non-indigenous immigration since 1788, especially in the more densely colonised areas of south-eastern Australia. There, the introduction of non-native foods to Aboriginals has resulted in an almost complete abandonment of native foods by Aboriginals. This impact on traditional foods has been further accentuated by the loss of traditional lands which has resulted in reduced access to native foods by Aboriginals and destruction of native habitat for agriculture.

The recent recognition of the nutritional and gourmet value of native foods by non-indigenous Australians is introducing native cuisine to many for the first time.

==Colonial use==
[[File:Billardiera scandens(cropped).jpg|thumb|''[[Billardiera scandens]]]]''
Bush tucker provided a source of nutrition to the non-indigenous colonial settlers, often supplementing meager rations.  However, bushfoods were often considered to be inferior by colonists unfamiliar with the new land's food ingredients, generally preferring familiar foods from their homelands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oldest Foods on Earth|last=Newton|first=John|publisher=NewSouth Publishing|year=2016|isbn=9781742234373|location=Sydney, Australia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colonial Kitchen|last=O'Brien|first=Charmaine|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2016|isbn=9781442249813|location=USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eat Your History, Stories and Recipes from Australian Kitchens|last=Newling|first=Jacqui|publisher=Sydney Living Museums and NewSouth Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781742234687|location=Sydney, Australia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century English botanist, [[J.D. Hooker]], writing of Australian plants in ''Flora of Tasmania'', remarked although "eatable," are not "fit to eat". In 1889, botanist [[Joseph Maiden]] reiterated this sentiment with the comment on native food plants "nothing to boast of as eatables."&lt;ref&gt;Maiden, J.H., ''The Useful Native Plants of Australia'', 1889, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The first monograph to be published on the [[flora of Australia]] reported the lack of edible plants on the first page, where it presented ''[[Billardiera scandens]]'' as, "... almost the only wild eatable fruit of the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first= J E |authorlink=James Edward Smith |author2= |editor= |others= |title= [[Spec. Bot. New Holland]]|year=1793 |month= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |publisher=[[James Sowerby]] |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=AMID all the beauty and variety which the vegetable productions of New Holland display in such profusion, there has not yet been discovered a proportionable degree of usefulness to mankind, at least with respect to food. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This became the accepted view of Australian native food plants until the late 20th century. It is thought that these early assessments were a result of encountering strong flavours not generally suitable for out-of-hand eating, but these strong flavours are now highly regarded for culinary use.

The only Australian native plant food developed and cropped on a large scale is the [[macadamia nut]], with the first small-scale commercial plantation being planted in Australia in the 1880s. Subsequently, Hawaii was where the macadamia was commercially developed to its greatest extent from stock imported from Australia.

==Modern use==
In the 1970s non-indigenous Australians began to recognise the previously overlooked native Australian foods. Textbooks like ''Wildfoods in Australia'' by the botanist couple Cribb &amp; Cribb were popular. In the late 1970s horticulturists started to assess native food-plants for commercial use and cultivation.

In 1980 [[South Australia]] legalised the sale of [[kangaroo meat]] for human consumption. Analysis showed that a variety of bushfoods were exceptionally nutritious.&lt;ref&gt;Low, T., ''Wild Food Plants of Australia'', Angus &amp; Robertson, 1992, pp 199–202 {{ISBN|0-207-16930-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s several Sydney restaurants began using native Australian ingredients in recipes more familiar to non-indigenous tastes – providing the first opportunity for bushfoods to be tried by non-indigenous Australians on a serious [[gourmet]] level. This led to the realisation that many strongly flavoured native food plants have spice-like qualities.

Following popular TV programs on "bush tucker", a surge in interest in the late 1980s saw the publication of books like ''Bushfood: Aboriginal Food and Herbal Medicine'' by Jennifer Isaacs, ''The Bushfood Handbook'' and ''Uniquely Australian'' by [[Vic Cherikoff]], and ''Wild Food Plants of Australia'' by [[Tim Low]].

Bush tucker ingredients were initially harvested from the wild, but cultivated sources have become increasingly important to provide sustainable supplies for a growing market, with some Aboriginal communities also involved in the supply chain. However, despite the industry being founded on Aboriginal knowledge of the plants, Aboriginal participation in the commercial sale of bush tucker is currently still marginal, and mostly at the supply end of value chains.  Organisations are working to increase Aboriginal participation in the bush tucker market.  Gourmet style [[processed food]] and [[dried food]] have been developed for the domestic and export markets.

The term "bushfood" is one of several terms describing native Australian food, evolving from the older-style "bush tucker" which was used in the 1970s and 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Media==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2017}}
TV shows made use of the bush tucker theme. [[Malcolm Douglas (documentary maker)|Malcolm Douglas]] was one of the first presenters to show how to 'live off the land' in the Australian Outback. Major [[Les Hiddins]], a retired [[Australian Army]] soldier popularised the idea of bush tucker as an interesting food resource. He presented a hit TV series called ''The Bush Tucker Man'' on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] TV network in the late 1980s. In the series, Hiddins demonstrated his research for [[NORFORCE]] in identifying foods which might sustain or augment army forces in the northern [[Australian Outback]]. 'NORFORCE' is a [[Regional Force Surveillance Unit]] of the [[Australian Army Reserve]].

In early 2003, the first cooking show featuring authentic Australian foods and called ''[[Dining Downunder]]'' was produced by Vic Cherikoff and Bailey Park Productions of [[Toronto]], Canada. This was followed by the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) production of [[Message Stick]] with Aboriginal chef, [[Mark Olive]].

[[Ray Mears]] recently made a survival television series called ''[[Ray Mears Goes Walkabout]]'' which focused on the history of survival in Australia, with a focus on bush tucker.  In the series, Les Hiddins was a guest in one episode, with the two men sharing their knowledge and discussing various aspects of bush tucker.

In the TV survival series "[[Survivorman]]" host and narrator, [[Les Stroud]], spent time in the Australian outback.  After successfully finding and eating a [[witchetty grub]] raw he found many more and cooked them, stating they were much better cooked.  After cooking in hot embers of his fire, he removed the head and the hind of the grub and squeezed out thick yellow liquid before eating.

{{for|clausula in medieval music|Clausula (music)}}

In Roman rhetoric, a '''clausula''' /'klɔːzi̯ʊlə/ (Latin "little close or conclusion"; plural ''clausulae'' /'klɔːzi̯ʊli/) was a [[Foot (prosody)|rhythmic figure]] used to add finesse and finality to the end of a sentence or phrase. There was a large range of popular clausulae. Most well known is the classically Ciceronian ''esse videatur'' type.

Every long sentence can be divided into rhythmical ''cola'' (singular ''colon''), in Latin ''membra'' (singular ''membrum''), and the last few syllables of every colon tend to conform to certain favourite rhythmic patterns, which are known as ''clausulae''.&lt;ref&gt;Habinek (1985), pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter ''cola'' were known as ''commata'' /ˈkɒmətə/ (singular ''comma''), in Latin ''incisa'' (singular ''incisum''), which also often display rhythmic endings.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham (1957), p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clausulae in Cicero's speeches==

The constant use of clausulae in Cicero's speeches was first thoroughly investigated by the Polish philologist [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński|Tadeusz Zieliński]] in a monumental work published in German in 1904, following an earlier dissertation by G. Wüst in 1881 and work by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Zieliński established that a Ciceronian clausula had two parts: a "base", generally a cretic | – u – | or a variation on it, and a "cadence", generally of a [[trochee|trochaic]] rhythm such as | – x |, | – u x |, or | – u – x |.&lt;ref name=Sre150&gt;Srebrny (1947 (2013)), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; (Here "–" indicates a long syllable, "u" a short syllable, and "x" a syllable which can be either long or short.)

The most common clausulae in Cicero are the following:&lt;ref&gt;Berry (1996), pp. 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*| – u – | – x | and variations (32.4% of Cicero's clausulae)
*| – x – | – u x | (24.4%)
*| – x – | – u – x | (30.1%)

Variations may include resolving one of the long syllables in the rhythm into two short ones, for example | – u uu | – x | (''esse videatur'') instead of | – u – | – x |. Another type of allowable variation is to substitute | – uu – | or | – u – – | for the base.&lt;ref name=Cla167&gt;Clark (1905), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above clausulae account for about 87% of Cicero's clausulae. Other clausulae are rarer. For example, the cadence may have five elements | – u – u – | or consist of two [[spondee]]s | – – – – |. This last type (commoner in Livy than in Cicero) is compared by Zieliński to the blows of a hammer.&lt;ref name=Cla167 /&gt; Certain clausulae, such as the [[hexameter]] ending | – u u | – x |, were avoided (it occurs in Cicero, but only in about 0.6% of cases, and often for a reason such a mock-heroic description).&lt;ref&gt;Berry (1996), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Zieliński noted that Cicero's preferences changed gradually over the years. For example, the rhythm | – – – | – u x | was more common in his earlier speeches, while from his consulate onwards he preferred the lighter | – u – | – u x |.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zieliński, it is a principle of clausulae that the word-accent tends to follow the ictus of the feet, that is, there is usually an accent on the first syllable of the base and on the penultimate long syllable of the cadence, e.g. ''ílla tempéstas'', ''egéstas audácia'', ''incéndium civitátis'', ''Cáesari d(e) eius áctis'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are often exceptions to this rule, and Cicero was not so strict as later writers such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Arnobius]].&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Dennison (1970), §16, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt that the skilful use of clausulae was one of the techniques which an orator used to excite an audience. Cicero writes of one occasion when the use of a certain clausula (a dichoreus or double [[trochee]] – u – x) by the orator [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo|Carbo the Younger]] was so effective that the audience all gave a shout.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Orator'' 214; cf. Adams (2013), p. 8; Cunningham (1957), p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples from Cicero==
An example of Cicero's use of clausulae in a speech is given below, with the two sentences divided into cola:&lt;ref&gt;Grillo (2015), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
::Ecce '''ílla tempéstas''', | – u – | – – | 
::cālīgo bonorum et subita atque impro'''vísa formído''', | – u – | – – | 
::téne'''brae rei públicae''', | – u – | – u – |
::ruina atque in'''céndium civitátis''', | – u – | – u – – | 
::terror iniectus '''Cáesari d(e) eius áctis''', | – u – | – u – – |
::metus cáe'''dis bonis ómnibus''', | – u – | – u – | 
::consulum scelus, cupiditas, e'''géstas, audácia'''! | – – – | – u – |
 
::Si non sum ad'''iútus, non débui'''; | – – – | – u – |
::si desertus, sibi for'''tásse provídit'''; | – u – | – – |
::si etiam oppugnatus, ut quid(am) '''áut putant áut volunt''', | – u – | – u – |
::vio'''lát(a) amicítia (e)st''', | – u – | uu – | 
::'''áccep(i) iniúriam'''; | – – – | – u – | 
::inimicus esse '''débui, nón nego'''. | – u – | – u – |&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Provinciis consularibus'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Behold that storm, the gloom of good men and a sudden and unforeseen fear, the darkness of the republic, the ruin and conflagration of the state, terror given to Caesar concerning his acts, fear of slaughter for all good men, the wickedness, greed, indigence, and audacity of the consuls! If I was not helped, I did not deserve it; if I was deserted, perhaps he was providing for his own safety; if I was even attacked, as certain people either think or wish, our friendship was violated, I received an injury; I should have been his enemy, I do not deny it."

The "heroic clausula" (– uu – x), which resembles a hexameter ending, is rare but can be used for comic effect, as in the following quotation from ''pro Caelio'':&lt;ref&gt;''pro Caelio'' §63; cf. Adams (2013), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
::In '''bálneis delituérunt''': | – u – | – uu – – |
::'''téstis egrégios'''! | – – – | uu – |
::'''Déin temerē prósiluérunt''': | – uu – | – uu – – |
::'''homines témperántis'''! | uu – | – u – – |

:"They hid in the baths. Outstanding witnesses! Then they rashly leapt out. Cool-headed men!"

As Adams points out, the passage is made even more funny by the pun on ''testes'', which can mean "testicles" as well as "witnesses".

The following passage from the 2nd Catilinarian oration shows some of the less commonly used cadences, including the five-syllable | – u – u – | and the "hammer-blow" spondaic | – – – – |:&lt;ref&gt;''in Catilinam'' 6; cf. Riggsby (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 
::Non est iam '''lénitatí locus'''; | – u – | – u – |
::severi'''tátem res ípsa flágitat'''. | – – – | – u – u – |
::'''Ún(um) etiam núnc concédam''': | – uu – | – – – – |
::exe'''ánt, proficiscántur'''; | – uu – | – – |
::ne patiantur desiderio sui Catilinam '''míserum tabéscere'''. | uu – – | – u – |
::Demons'''tráb(o) iter: Auréliā viā proféctus est'''; | – uu – | – u – u – u – u – |
::si accelerare volent, ad '''vésperam cónsequéntur'''. | – u – | – u – – |

:"There is no place for leniency any longer; the situation itself calls for severity. But one thing I will concede even now: let them go out, let them depart; let them not allow Catiline to pine away miserably with desire for them. I will show them the route: he departed by the Aurelian Way. If they are willing to hurry, by evening they will catch up with him."

It is characteristic of the emphatic spondaic ending (– – – –) that in Cicero there is always a word-break between the base and the cadence. With the clausula – u – – x on the other hand, as in ''illa tempestas'', the most usual place for a word-break is after the second syllable.&lt;ref name="Cla167"/&gt;

The following passage from the ''pro Scauro'' is analysed explicitly by Cicero himself into four ''incisa'' (commata), followed by two ''membra'' (cola), and then a long spondaic period ending in a ''dichoreus'' or double trochee:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Orator'' 222–26; analysed in Cunningham (1957), pp. 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt;
::do'''mús tibi déerat'''? at habébas. | u | – u – | – – || uu – – |
::pe'''cúnia superábat'''? at egébas. | u | – u uu | – – || uu – – |
::incur'''ríst(i) amens ín colúmnas''', | – – | – – – | – u – – |
::in alienos in'''sánus insanísti'''; | u u u – – – | – u – | – – – |
::depressam, cae'''cám, iacentém domum''' | – – – – | – u – | – u – |
::pluris quam t(e) et quam fortu'''nás tuas áestimásti'''. | – – – – – – – | – u – | – u – – |

:"Did you lack a house? No, you already had one. Did you have enough money? No, you didn't have any. You ran madly into the columns, you raged crazily against other people's slaves; you reckoned a decrepit, dark, fallen down house as worth more than yourself and your fortunes."

Cicero comments that the ''incisa'' (commata), because of their shortness, are rather freer in their rhythm, and should be used "like little daggers". The rhythmical period (''numerosa comprehensio''), he says, is a longer sentence composed of at least two cola, and is more sparingly used. The style which consists of a mixture of commata, cola, and the occasional longer period is particularly effective, he says, in passages arguing a case or refuting one.

==Clausulae in other writers==
Clausulae are found not only in Cicero but in many Roman (as well as Greek and medieval) writers, especially in oratory but also in other types of writing. Each writer has their own preferences and "rhythmic signature".&lt;ref name=Sre150 /&gt; For example, Livy avoids clausulae which are common in Cicero, such as | – u – | – x |, but frequently ends a sentence with a series of long syllables, for example ''legati Roman(i) occurrērunt''.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), pp. 167, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest orator to make extensive use of rhythmic prose in Greek is said to have been the sophist [[Thrasymachus]] of Chalcedon (the same person who appears as a speaker in book 1 of Plato's ''Republic'').&lt;ref name=Cla164&gt;Clark (1905), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] himself favoured the clausulae | – u – | – u x |, | – – – | – u x |, and | – u u | – u x |, among others. His preferences changed in the course of his life, and he used | u u u x | and | – u u u – x | more often in the later works.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysias]], [[Aeschines]], [[Isaeus]], [[Plutarch]] and others also had their own preferences. Clausulae are prominent in the orations of [[Demosthenes]], especially the ditrochaeus (– u – x), dispondaeus (– – – x), cretic + trochee (– u – – x), and choriamb + trochee (– uu – – x).&lt;ref name=Cla164 /&gt; But his most characteristic practice (known as "Blass's Law") is to avoid series of more than three short syllables anywhere in his sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §10.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers such as [[Thucydides]], wrote prose almost free of rhythmical influence, however.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin, rhythmical prose was characteristic of the so-called "Asiatic" style of oratory, whereas followers of the plainer "Attic" style avoided it.&lt;ref name="Cla164"/&gt; The younger [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Suetonius]], [[Apuleius]] and [[Tertullian]] more or less followed the Ciceronian pattern, though several writers avoided | – – – | – u x | and the famous ''esse videatur'' clausula, as being overly Ciceronian.&lt;ref name=Cla164 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §17f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval clausulae (''cursus'')==

In the medieval period, Latin ceased to be pronounced in a quantitative way, and clausulae tended to be accentual rather than based on quantity. Three end-of-sentence rhythms were especially favoured, the so called ''planus'' (– x x – x) (where – indicates an accented syllable and x an unaccented one), the ''tardus'' (– x x – x x), and the ''velox'' (– x x x x – x). These rhythms are found for example in the writings of [[Gregory of Tours]] (6th century), [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and [[Héloïse]] (12th century), and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] (13th-14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §21.&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to modern scholars (although apparently not to the medieval writers themselves) as ''cursus''. However, not all writers made use of them.&lt;ref&gt;Tunberg (1996), pp. 114-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The professors of the period specified that the last word of the sentence had to be of either three or four syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Tunberg (1996), pp. 115-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient writers on clausulae==
The first writer to mention rhythm in prose is [[Aristotle]] in his ''Ars Rhetorica''; he says that prose should not be entirely metrical, like poetry, but also not unrhythmical either.&lt;ref&gt;1408b; cf. Adams (2013), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero himself discusses the use of clausulae in his books on oratory, especially in ''[[de Oratore]]'' 173-198, and ''[[Orator]]'' 204-226.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), pp. 164-5; Adams (2013), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terentianus|Terentianus Maurus]] (c. 290 AD) also discusses clausulae in a work itself written in verse. He says of the cretic (– u –) that it is the best kind of foot, especially when used in penultimate position before a dactyl (– u x).&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher of rhetoric [[Quintilian]] treats clausulae at length, especially in books 5 and 9; like Terentianus, he approves of the double cretic | – u – | – u x |,&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 9.4.107; Clark (1905), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; but recommends avoiding the heroic clausula | – x – | – uu – x |, since it too much resembles the end of a line of verse.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 9.4.102; Clark (1905), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of clausula-study==
The analysis of a piece of Latin into cola and clausulae can not only of help the modern student to read the passage with authentic phrasing, but also is a useful tool in investigating an author's style. So, for example, Riggsby notes that the cola in the earlier part of the 2nd Catilinarian oration are shorter, and the clausulae more varied, than in the last paragraph. He takes this as an indication of Cicero's shift in emphasis from chaos and danger to peace and resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Riggsby (2010), pp. 101-102; cf. Adams (2013), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the clausulae will throw light on the writer's choice of word, tense or word order.&lt;ref name=Cla171&gt;Clark (1905), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''patent portae, proficiscere!''&lt;ref&gt;''In Catilinam'' 1.10.&lt;/ref&gt; "the gates are open; depart!" makes an effective clausula, whereas *''portae patent, proficiscere'' does not. Clausulae can also help editors decide which of two manuscript readings is the correct one, or whether an editor's conjecture is acceptable.&lt;ref name=Cla170&gt;Clark (1905), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clausulae have sometimes helped editors to decide on the authenticity or otherwise of a work. For example, the speech ''de domo sua'', whose authorship was once in doubt, has been shown to exhibit exactly the same proportions of clausulae as Cicero's other speeches.&lt;ref name=Cla171 /&gt; In the case of authors whose practice varied over the years, such as Plato, clausulae analysis can throw light on the date of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From examining the clausulae it is sometimes possible to uncover the exact pronunciation of individual words by a particular author. For example, it appears that Cicero pronounced ''redduco'' "I bring back" and ''relliquus'' "remaining" with a long first syllable, as did [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref name=Cla170 /&gt; ''Nōn modō'' "not only" was pronounced with the last vowel long. For ordinary nouns ending in ''-ium'' or ''-ius'', the genitive ''-i'' was preferred by Cicero (e.g. ''iudici'' "of the trial"), although in proper names such as ''Clodii'' "of Clodius" the ending "-ii" was often used. In ''nil'' and ''nihil'' "nothing" and ''periculum'' and ''periclum'' "danger" both forms occur.&lt;ref name=Cla170 /&gt; In the future perfect tense, as in ''fecerīmus'' "we'll have made", it appears that Cicero, contrary to the rule given in some grammars such as Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, B. ''Revised Latin Primer'', 1962 ed. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; pronounced the "i" long, as did his contemporary [[Catullus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce, C.J. (1961) ''Catullus: A commentary'', note on 5.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The artwork==

[[File:Pascale Marthine Tayou MG 7964.jpg|thumb|left]]La Colonne Pascale consisted of [[Marmite (cooking dish)|pots]] in [[Vitreous enamel]], which were used in the past by the housewives to protect the food and the drinks. La Colonne Pascale is a simple and uncluttered dynamic line rising in the sky, located in the heart of a roundabout in the extremely lively quarter New Bell of Douala.

It is {{convert|12|m|sp=us}} high and constituted of a pile of 76 marmites and 38 lids.

The intention of the artist was to pay homage to African women giving value to the [[Cameroonian cuisine|culinary culture of the Cameroonian tradition]]. Nevertheless, the artwork was the subject of debates and tensions from local residents. People's controversies depend both on the physical position of the Colonne Pascale, appealing to [[History of Cameroon|historical events]] (the square was the epicenter of the riots that led to the independence of the country), and for its symbolic interpretation, since according to many people the artwork recalls and highlights the poverty of New Bell.

The Colonne was renovated in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8002">'''Cultural relations''' are reciprocal, non-coercive transnational interactions between two or more [[culture]]s, encompassing a range of activities that are conducted both by state and non-state actors within the space of cultural and civil society. The overall outcomes of cultural relations are greater connectivity, better mutual understanding, more and deeper relationships, mutually beneficial transactions and enhanced sustainable dialogue between states, peoples, non-state actors and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Isar, Yudhishtir. Preparatory Action. ‘Culture in EU External Relations’ (European Union, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Tim. [https://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/sites/uscpublicdiplomacy.org/files/useruploads/u33041/Distinguishing%20Cultural%20Relations%20From%20Cultural%20Diplomacy%20-%20Full%20Version%20(1).pdf Distinguishing Cultural Relations From Cultural Diplomacy: The British Council’s Relationship with her Majesty’s Government] (Los Angeles: Figueroa Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Through public policy tools such as [[public diplomacy]] and [[cultural diplomacy]] (state to people relations), [[strategic communication]] and conditionality (including policies of mass persuasion and propaganda&lt;ref&gt;N.J. Cull; D. Culbert, D. Welch. Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present, (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;), countries and state sponsored institutions rely on non-state actors and culture with the aim of promoting and strengthening their foreign policy interests and influencing perceptions and preferences.

Cultural relations can be distinguished from state led activities such as public diplomacy; cultural diplomacy and [[nation branding]],&lt;ref&gt;Anholt, Simon. Brand New Justice: the upside of global branding (Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; in that they do not originate only from policies of state actors; through the range of institutions and non-state actors involved pursuing their own goals as transnational actors and by their reciprocity. They are, however, a tangible component of [[International relations|International Relations]] in the sense that they encompass the space in which a wide range of [[non-state actor]]s engage in the fostering of intercultural dialogue which can be either in favour of, or against, the national interests of [[state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Isar, Yudhishtir. Preparatory Action. ‘Culture in EU External Relations’ (European Union, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural relations and theory==

This definition follows Chrisine Silvester’s concept of critical imaginations (see the book Critical Imaginations in International Relations, 2016) as she argues that traditional International Relations imagines worlds mostly through the linking of concepts or data points, leaving the field with a certain social hollowness at the core of the canon, an emptiness where people, who are going about their lives experiencing and influencing international relations, should be. She argues that much of International Relations lacks the creativity necessary to place itself in the world of people.&lt;ref&gt;Silvester, Christine. Critical Imaginations in International Relations (New York: Routledge, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of cultural relations fills that void. As cultural relations are engaged in the shaping of preferences of others through appeal and attraction, this distinct field fits into [[Joseph Nye]]’s popular theoretical concept of [[soft power]] (see Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power, 1990) denoting the ability to attract and co-opt rather than coerce (using force or giving money as a means of persuasion).&lt;ref&gt;Nye, Joseph. Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power (New York: Basic Books, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

Consisting of both direct and indirect interactions between cultures, cultural relations do not fit as comfortably into an academic field as state actors do into International Relations, Economics and Politics. Direct cultural interactions denote both physical and virtual encounters with people and objects of another culture. Indirect cultural interactions involve ideas, values and beliefs proper to a specific culture and often featured in philosophy, literature, music, and art that are acting as cross-national tools, which can foster and strengthen intercultural dialogue. An understanding of cultural relations therefore requires an understanding of contemporary cultures, at both the global and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;Nederveen Pieterse, Jan. Global Mélange: Globalization and Culture (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; These cultures include the range of activities and practices of those engaged in cultural governance and policy, production, dissemination and economics. This includes the political, economic and social roles of culture in cultural markets, development, institutions and specific contexts.

==Cultural relations and digital communications media==

Due to the increasing pervasiveness of ongoing developments in digital communication and [[Social media|(social) media]] networks, which greatly facilitate these processes of global cultural production, participation and dialogue, the importance of direct and indirect cultural relations is growing and developing. Digital media enable cultural and [[Civic society|civic societies]] to engage in cultural relations beyond the boundaries of traditional non-hard state power, i.e. cultural and public diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Castells, Manuel. The Rise of the Network Society: The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture (Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The range of practitioners of cultural relations==

Cultural relations both produce and diffuse (soft) power, which varies depending on who is engaging with it. First and foremost, cultural relations are conducted through the enormous range of non-state actors engaged transnationally. The range includes cities, global civil society, educational institutions, cultural and arts organisations, research institutes, corporations and businesses, even down to individuals who can engage via the Internet. This does not mean, however, that state actors are excluded from the field of cultural relations. There is necessarily an ongoing interaction between the field of cultural relations and a state’s foreign policy, given the scale and importance of cultural relations activity, which dwarfs state driven policies in quantity, frequency, inclusiveness and speed.&lt;ref&gt;Mogherini, Federica. Putting Culture at the Heart of Europe’s External Action (speech at the Culture Forum IN Brussels, 20/04/2016).&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics of scale, the prominence of the digital, the range from formal to informal actors, generate a need for new forms of evidence, descriptions and theorisation.

[[File:Deconstruction (Dallas).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Deconstruction of a building.]]

In the context of physical [[construction]], '''deconstruction''' is the selective dismantlement of building components, specifically for [[re-use]], [[Repurposed building stone|repurposing]], [[recycling]], and [[waste management]]. It differs from [[demolition]] where a site is cleared of its building by the most expedient means. Deconstruction has also been defined as “construction in reverse”.  The process of dismantling structures is an ancient activity that has been revived by the growing field of [[sustainable]], [[green building|green method of building]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition Taisei Corporation's Tecorep reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 85%]&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings, like everything, have a life-cycle. Deconstruction focuses on giving the materials within a building a new life once the building as a whole can no longer continue.

When buildings reach the end of their useful life, they are typically demolished and hauled to [[landfill]]s. [[Building implosion]]s or ‘wrecking-ball’ style [[demolition]]s are relatively inexpensive and offer a quick method of clearing sites for new structures.  On the other hand, these methods create substantial amounts of waste. Components within old buildings may still be valuable, sometimes more valuable than at the time the building was constructed.  Deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered “[[waste]]” and reclaiming it into useful building material.

== Contribution to sustainability ==
Deconstruction has strong ties to environmental [[sustainability]]. In addition to giving materials a new life cycle, deconstructing buildings helps to lower the need for virgin resources. This in turn leads to [[energy]] and [[Air pollution|emissions]] reductions from the [[refining]] and [[manufacture]] of new materials. As deconstruction is often done on a local level, many times on-site, energy and emissions are also saved in the [[transportation]] of materials. Deconstruction can potentially support communities by providing local jobs and renovated structures.  Deconstruction work typically employs 3-6 workers for every one employed in a comparable demolition job.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  In addition, [[solid waste]] from conventional demolition is diverted from landfills.  This is a major benefit because [[construction and demolition waste]] accounts for approximately 20% of the solid waste stream.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Mark, and Dennis Livingston. ''Building A Deconstruction Company: A Training Guide For Facilitators and Entrepreneurs.'' Washington, DC: Institute For Local Self-Reliance, 2001. A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of avoiding wood waste==
In Canada, the CO2 Neutral Alliance has created a website&lt;ref&gt;[http://dontwastewood.com CO2 Neutral Alliance Don’t Waste Wood website]&lt;/ref&gt; with resources for regulators and municipalities, developers and contractors, business owners and operators, and individuals and households. Benefits for municipalities include:&lt;ref name="dontwastewood"/&gt;
* Reducing disposal costs where waste collection, hauling or disposal is supported by the tax base
* Establishing additional revenue streams
* Making existing landfills last longer
* Reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by the decomposition of wood waste into methane from landfills
* Stimulating local economies with new industries and employment
Improving the local environment and overall sustainability of your community 
For every three square feet of deconstruction, enough lumber can be salvaged to build one square foot of new construction. At this rate, if deconstruction replaced residential demolition, the United States could generate enough recovered wood to construct 120,000 new affordable homes each year. The deconstruction of a typical {{convert|2,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} wood frame home can yield 6,000 board feet of reusable lumber.&lt;ref name="dontwastewood"&gt;[http://dontwastewood.com/regulators-and-municipalities.asp CO2 Neutral Alliance Don’t Waste Wood website]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Every year the United States buries about 33 million tons of wood-related construction and demolition debris in landfills. As anaerobic microorganisms decompose this wood, it will release about five million tons of carbon equivalent in the form of methane gas.&lt;ref name="dontwastewood" /&gt;

== Typical methods of deconstruction ==
Deconstruction is commonly separated into two categories; [[structural]] and non-structural.  Non-structural deconstruction, also known as “soft-stripping”, consists of reclaiming non-structural components, [[home appliances|appliances]], [[door]]s, [[window]]s, and finish materials.  The reuse of these types of materials is commonplace and considered to be a mature market in many locales.

Structural deconstruction involves dismantling the structural components of a building. Traditionally this had only been performed to reclaim expensive or rare materials such as used [[brick]], [[dimension stone]], and extinct [[wood]]. In antiquity, it was common to raze stone buildings and reuse the stone; it was also common to steal stones from a building that was not being totally demolished: this is the literal meaning of the word ''[[wikt:dilapidated|dilapidated]].'' Used brick and dimension limestone in particular have a long tradition of reuse due to their durability and color changes over time. Recently, the rise of environmental awareness and sustainable building has made a much wider range of materials worthy of structural deconstruction.  Low-end, commonplace materials such as dimensional [[lumber]] have become part of this newly emerging market.

The [[United States military]] has utilized structural deconstruction in many of its bases. The construction methods of [[barracks]], among other base structures, are usually relatively simple.  They typically contained large amounts of lumber and used minimal [[adhesives]] and finish-work.  In addition, the buildings are often identical, making the process of deconstructing multiple buildings much easier.  Many barracks were built during the era prior to [[World War II|WWII]], and have aged to the point where they now need to be torn down. Deconstruction was deemed very practical due to the abundance of labor the military has access to and the value of the materials themselves.

[[Natural disasters]], such as [[hurricanes]], [[floods]], [[tsunamis]], and [[earthquakes]] often leave a vast amount of usable building materials in their wake. Structures that remain standing are often deconstructed to provide materials for rebuilding the [[region]].

== Economic potential ==
Deconstruction’s economic viability varies from project to project. The amount of time and cost of labor are the main drawbacks. Harvesting materials from a structure can take weeks, whereas demolition may be completed in roughly a day. However, some of the costs, if not all, can be recovered. Reusing the materials in a new on-site structure, selling reclaimed materials, donating materials for [[income tax]] write-offs, and avoiding landfill “tipping fees” are all ways in which the cost of deconstruction can be made comparable to demolition.

Reclaiming the materials for a new on-site structure is the most economically and environmentally efficient option. Tipping fees and the costs of new materials are avoided; in addition, the transportation of the materials is non-existent. Selling the used materials or donating them to [[non-profit organization]]s are another effective way of gaining capital. Donations to NPO’s such as [[Habitat for Humanity]]’s ReStore are tax deductible.  Many times it is possible to claim the value to be half of what that particular material would cost new.  When donating rare or [[antique]] components it is sometimes possible to claim a higher value than a comparable, brand-new material.

Value can also be added to new structures that are built by implementing reused materials.  The [[United States Green Building Council]]'s program entitled [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] ('''LEED''') offers seven credits relating to reusing materials.  (This accounts for seven out of a maximum sixty-nine credits)  These include credits for building-shell reuse, material reuse, and diverting waste from landfills.  Building shell-reuse is particularly appropriate for shells made of [[dimension stone]].

Deconstruction is well suited to job training for the construction trades. Taking down a building is an excellent way for a worker to learn how to put a building up. This is vital for the economic recovery of inner-city communities. Unskilled and low-skilled workers can receive on-the-job training in use of basic carpentry tools and techniques, as well as learning teamwork, problem-solving, critical thinking and good work habits.&lt;ref&gt;Seldman, Neil, and Kivi Leroux. ''Deconstruction: Salvaging Yesterday's Buildings for Tomorrow's Sustainable Communities.'' Washington, DC: Institute for Local Self-Reliance, 2000. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[Image:DBNYDemolition108.jpg|thumb|right|Dismantling the [[Deutsche Bank Building]] in January 2008.]]

When choosing to deconstruct a building there are some important aspects that need to be taken into consideration. Developing a list of local contacts that are able to take used materials is an essential first step. These might include commercial architectural salvage businesses, reclamation yards, not-for-profit and social enterprise salvage warehouses, and dismantling contractors. Materials that cannot be salvaged may be recycled on-site or off-site, or taken to landfills. The next step involves identifying which, if any, are [[hazardous material]]s. [[Lead paint]] and [[asbestos]] are two substances in particular that need to be handled extremely cautiously and disposed of properly.

It is common practice, and common sense, to “soft-strip” the structure first; remove all appliances, windows, doors, and other finishing materials. These will account for a large percentage of the marketable components. After the non-structural deconstruction, structural is the next step. It is best to start at the [[roof]] and work down to the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]].

Building components that are dismantled will need to be stored in a secure, dry location. This will protect them from [[water damage]] and theft. Once separated from the structure, materials can also be cleaned and/or refinished to increase value. Building an inventory list of the materials at hand will help determine where each item will be sent.

== Designing for deconstruction (DfD) ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
{{Tone|date=August 2008}}

"The end of the building’s useful life generates a stream of used materials that can be reprocessed for new construction. The selection of materials for reuse or recycling should not start at the end of the building’s life cycle, it should start at the design stage. Architects and engineers should keep the whole life cycle of the building in mind and select construction materials based on their capacity to be reused or recycled after the building has served its purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Abdol Chini, University of Florida, M.E. Rinker Sr. School of Building Construction&lt;/ref&gt;

An upstream approach to deconstruction can be implemented into buildings during their design process.  This is a current trend in sustainable [[architecture]]. Often, simple construction methods combined with high-grade, durable materials work best for DfD structures. Separating layers of a building’s infrastructure and making them visible can significantly simplify its deconstruction. Making components within systems separable also assists in being able to dismantle materials quickly and efficiently.  This can be achieved by using mechanical fasteners such as bolts to connect parts.  Allowing physical access to the fasteners is another needed aspect of this design. Also, it is important to use standardized materials and assemble them in a consistent manner throughout the project.

Some conventional construction methods and materials are difficult or impossible to deconstruct and should be avoided when designing for deconstruction. The use of nails and adhesives significantly slows down the deconstruction process and has a tendency to ruin otherwise reusable materials. Avoid hazardous materials altogether as they are detrimental to the natural environment and are non-reusable. Using mixed material grades makes the process of identifying pieces for resale difficult.

Deconstruction is important for more than just the end of a building’s life-cycle. Buildings that have been designed with deconstruction in mind are often easier to maintain and adapt to new uses.  Saving the shell of a building or adapting interior spaces to meet new needs ensures that new structures have a small environmental impact.

An alternative worth considering is [[modular building]], like the [[Habitat 67]] project in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. This was a residential structure consisting of separate, functional apartments that could be put together in a variety of ways. As people moved in or out, the units could be reconfigured as desired.

'''''Despicable Me''''' is a 2010 American 3D [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[comedy film]]&lt;!-- Any genre sources other than comedy will need reliable sourcing for inclusion --&gt; produced by [[Illumination (animation company)|Illumination Entertainment]] as its debut film and project and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film was animated by the French animation studio [[Mac Guff]], which was later acquired by Illumination.&lt;ref name="VarietyUniversalMacGuff" /&gt; Directed by [[Pierre Coffin]] and [[Chris Renaud (animator)|Chris Renaud]] in their [[list of directorial debuts|directorial debuts]] with a story by [[Sergio Pablos]], the title references the main character as he refers to himself and is accompanied by a song by [[Pharrell Williams]]. 

The film stars [[Steve Carell]], the [[Voice acting|voice]] of Gru, a supervillain who adopts three girls (voiced by [[Miranda Cosgrove]], [[Dana Gaier]], and [[Elsie Fisher]]) from an orphanage; and the voice of [[Jason Segel]] as Vector, a rival of Gru who steals the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. When Gru learns of Vector's [[Heist film|heist]], he plans an even greater heist: to shrink and steal the Earth's moon. However, despite Gru's villainous intentions, he grows increasingly touched by the girls' growing love for him and find himself changing for the better because of it.

Released theatrically on July 9, 2010 in the United States, ''Despicable Me'' grossed over $546 million worldwide against a budget of $69 million.&lt;ref name="box" /&gt; It launched the [[Despicable Me (franchise)|''Despicable Me'' franchise]] series of films, including the sequel ''[[Despicable Me 2]]'' in 2013, another sequel, ''[[Despicable Me 3]]'' in 2017,&lt;ref name="CSDM3Grinch2017" /&gt; and the prequel, ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]],'' released in 2015, which featured Gru's [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]] as the main characters.&lt;ref name="VarietyMoveMinions" /&gt;

== Plot ==
A supervillain named Gru has his pride injured when an unknown villain steals the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. With the assistance of his sidekick Dr. Nefario and his Minions, Gru resolves to one-up his mysterious rival by shrinking and stealing the Moon. Knowing this is extremely costly, Gru seeks a loan from the Bank of Evil. Mr. Perkins - the bank president - is impressed by the plan, but he will approve the loan only if Gru can obtain the necessary shrink ray first. Upon learning that an up-and-coming villain known as Vector was responsible for the Pyramid theft, Gru starts a rivalry with him.

Gru and the Minions steal the shrink ray from a secret base in East Asia, but Vector intercepts them and steals it for himself. Gru attempts to break into Vector's impregnable fortress to recover the shrink ray, only to be defeated by numerous kinds of traps. As nothing seems to work, he notices three orphan girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, who are able to easily enter the base because they are selling cookies. Gru disguises himself and adopts the girls, planning to use them to infiltrate Vector's base. However, Gru has trouble nurturing them properly due to their stubbornness, their ballet classes and his own ineptitude as a parent.

Eventually, Gru and the girls arrive at Vector's base, and Gru successfully steals the shrink ray. The girls then suggest a day at a theme park. Gru agrees, believing he can abandon the girls there, but instead he has fun with them. Later, Gru contacts Perkins via video chat, stating that he finally has the shrink ray. Margo, Edith, and Agnes interrupt the meeting, and Perkins announces that he has lost confidence in Gru and will no longer fund his operations. As Gru tells the Minions he can no longer pay them for their services, the girls offer the contents of their piggy bank. Inspired, Gru sells parts of his lair and the items he stole over the years to construct a spacecraft. Gru plans to steal the Moon when it is nearest to the Earth, but this is ironically the same day as the girls' ballet recital. As Gru becomes puzzled, Dr. Nefario arranges for the girls to be returned to the orphanage, thinking the recital may ruin the plan. At the same time, Perkins informs his son - Vector - of Gru's possession of the shrink ray and the adoption of the three girls, encouraging Vector to take action.

Gru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon. He rushes back to Earth to attend the recital, only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arriving at Vector's base, Gru surrenders the Moon. However, Vector reneges on the deal, flying off with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario has discovered that the effects of the shrink ray are temporary. The bigger the object is, the faster it recovers its original size. Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions execute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls, just before the Moon explodes Vector's spaceship and launches itself back into orbit, along with Vector on it.

Sometime later, Gru has returned the Great Pyramid and re-adopted the girls, writing them a bedtime storybook based on his own experience. The film ends with the girls performing their ballet recital for Gru, his mother Marlena, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions.

In [[mathematics]], the '''dual quaternions''' are an [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] isomorphic to a [[Clifford algebra#Examples: constructing quaternions and dual quaternions|Clifford algebra]] of a degenerate [[quadratic space]].

In [[ring theory]], dual quaternions are a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] constructed in the same way as the quaternions, except using [[dual number]]s instead of [[real number]]s as coefficients.  A dual quaternion can be represented in the form {{nowrap|''p'' + ε ''q''}}, where ''p'' and ''q'' are ordinary quaternions and ε is the dual unit (which satisfies {{nowrap|1=εε = 0}}) and commutes with every element of the algebra.  Unlike quaternions, they do not form a [[division ring]].

In [[mechanics]], the dual quaternions are applied as a [[number system]] to represent [[rigid transformation]]s in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;A.T. Yang, ''Application of Quaternion Algebra and Dual Numbers to the Analysis of Spatial Mechanisms'', Ph.D thesis, Columbia University, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;   A dual quaternion is an ordered pair of [[quaternion]]s {{nowrap|''Â'' {{=}} (''A'', ''B'')}}, constructed from eight real parameters.  Because rigid transformations have six real degrees of freedom, dual quaternions include two algebraic constraints for this application.

Similar to the way that rotations in 3D space can be represented by quaternions of unit length, rigid motions in 3D space can be represented by dual quaternions of unit length.  This fact is used in theoretical [[kinematics]] (see McCarthy&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt;), and in applications to 3D [[computer graphics]], [[robot]]ics and [[computer vision]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.unive.it/~rodola/cvpr11-dual.pdf A. Torsello, E. Rodolà and A. Albarelli, ''Multiview Registration via Graph Diffusion of Dual Quaternions'', Proc. of the XXIV IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2441-2448, June 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton, ''Elements of Quaternions, Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1843, and by 1873 [[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K.

Vol. 4 (1873) pp. 381–395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. K. Clifford, ''Mathematical Papers'', (ed. R. Tucker), London: Macmillan, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; which is an example of what is now called a [[Clifford algebra]].&lt;ref name="mccarthy"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=glOqQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22J.+M.+McCarthy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_QoMToDvMcfd0QGFh-mvDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6wEwAg J.

In 1898 [[Alexander McAulay]] used &amp;Omega; with &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 to generate the dual quaternion algebra.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander McAulay]] (1898) [https://archive.org/details/octonionsdevelop00mcaurich Octonions: a development of Clifford's Biquaternions], link from [[Internet Archive]]
&lt;/ref&gt; However, his terminology of "octonions" did not stick as today's [[octonion]]s are another algebra.

In Russia, [[Aleksandr Kotelnikov]]&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Kotelnikov (1895) ''Screw calculus and some applications to geometry and mechanics'', Annal. Imp. Univ. Kazan&lt;/ref&gt; developed dual vectors and dual quaternions for use in the study of mechanics.

In 1891 [[Eduard Study]] realized that this [[associative algebra]] was ideal for describing the group of motions of [[three-dimensional space]]. He further developed the idea in ''Geometrie der Dynamen'' in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Study]] (1901) ''Geometrie der Dynamen'', Teubner, Leipzig&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[B. L. van der Waerden]] called the structure "Study biquaternions", one of three eight-dimensional algebras referred to as [[biquaternion]]s.

==Formulas==
In order to describe operations with dual quaternions, it is helpful to first consider [[quaternion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f8I4yGVi9ocC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false O. Bottema and B. Roth, ''Theoretical Kinematics'', North Holland Publ. Co., 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;

A quaternion is a linear combination of the basis elements 1, ''i'', ''j'', and ''k''.  Hamilton's product rule for ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' is often written as
:&lt;math&gt; i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 .&lt;/math&gt;
Compute {{nowrap|''i'' ( ''i j k'' ) {{=}} −''j k'' {{=}} −''i''}}, to obtain {{nowrap|''j k'' {{=}} ''i''}}, and {{nowrap|( ''i j k'' ) ''k'' {{=}} −''i j'' {{=}} −''k''}} or {{nowrap|''i j'' {{=}} ''k''}}. Now because {{nowrap|''j'' ( ''j k'' ) {{=}} ''j i'' {{=}} −''k''}}, we see that this product yields {{nowrap|''i j'' {{=}} −''j i''}}, which links quaternions to the properties of determinants.

A convenient way to work with the quaternion product is to write a quaternion as the sum of a scalar and a vector, that is {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + '''A'''}}, where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a real number and {{nowrap|'''A''' {{=}} ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''i'' + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''j'' + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''k''}} is a three dimensional vector.  The vector dot and cross operations can now be used to define the quaternion product of {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + '''A'''}} and {{nowrap|''C'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + '''C'''}} as
&lt;!--reformatted this equation
:G = AC = (a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+'''A''')(c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+'''C''') = (a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − '''A'''·'''C''') + (c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''A''' + a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''C''' + '''A'''×'''C''').
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; G = AC = (a_0 + \mathbf{A})(c_0 + \mathbf{C}) = (a_0 c_0 - \mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{C}) + (c_0 \mathbf{A} + a_0 \mathbf{C} + \mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{C}).&lt;/math&gt;

A dual quaternion is usually described as a quaternion with dual numbers as coefficients.  A [[dual number]] is an ordered pair {{nowrap|''â'' {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' )}}.  Two dual numbers add componentwise and multiply by the rule {{nowrap|''â ĉ'' {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' ) ( ''c'', ''d'' ) {{=}} (''a c'', ''a d'' + ''b c'')}}.  Dual numbers are often written in the form {{nowrap|''â'' {{=}} ''a'' + ε''b''}}, where ε is the dual unit that commutes with ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' and has the property {{nowrap|ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

The result is that a dual quaternion is the ordered pair of quaternions {{nowrap|''Â'' {{=}} ( ''A'', ''B'' )}}.  Two dual quaternions add componentwise and multiply by the rule,
&lt;!-- reformatted this equation
:ÂĈ = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC).
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A}\hat{C} = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC).&lt;/math&gt;
It is convenient to write a dual quaternion as the sum of a dual scalar and a dual vector, {{nowrap|''Â'' {{=}} ''â''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''A''}}, where {{nowrap|''â''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' )}} and {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ( '''A''', '''B''' )}} is the dual vector that defines a [[screw theory|screw]].  This notation allows us to write the product of two dual quaternions as
&lt;!-- reformatted equation
:Ĝ = ÂĈ =(â&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + A)(ĉ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + C) = (â&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ĉ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - A•C) + (ĉ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;A + â&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;C + A×C).
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{G} = \hat{A}\hat{C} = (\hat{a}_0 + \mathsf{A})(\hat{c}_0 + \mathsf{C}) = (\hat{a}_0 \hat{c}_0 - \mathsf{A}\cdot \mathsf{C}) + (\hat{c}_0 \mathsf{A} + \hat{a}_0 \mathsf{C} + \mathsf{A}\times\mathsf{C}).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Addition ===
The addition of dual quaternions is defined componentwise so that given, 
&lt;!-- reformatted equation
:Â = (A, B) = a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;i + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;j + a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;k +  b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ε + b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;εi + b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;εj + b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;εk, and 
:Ĉ = (C, D) = c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;i + c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;j + c&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;k +  d&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ε + d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;εi + d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;εj + d&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;εk, 
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A} = (A, B) = a_0 + a_1 i + a_2 j + a_3 k + b_0 \epsilon + b_1 \epsilon i + b_2 \epsilon j + b_3 \epsilon k, &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{C} = (C, D) = c_0 + c_1 i + c_2 j + c_3 k + d_0 \epsilon + d_1 \epsilon i + d_2 \epsilon j + d_3 \epsilon k, &lt;/math&gt;
then
&lt;!-- reformatted equation
:Â + Ĉ = (a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) + (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)i + (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)j + (a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+c&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)k +  (b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+d&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)ε + (b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)εi + (b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)εj + (b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+d&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)εk.
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A} + \hat{C} = (A+C, B+D) = (a_0+c_0) + (a_1+c_1) i + (a_2+c_2) j + (a_3+c_3) k + (b_0+d_0) \epsilon + (b_1+d_1) \epsilon i + (b_2+d_2) \epsilon j + (b_3+d_3) \epsilon k, &lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplication===
Multiplication of two dual quaternion follows from the multiplication rules for the quaternion units i, j, k and commutative multiplication by the dual unit ε.  In particular, given
&lt;!-- :Â = (A, B) =  A + εB and Ĉ = (C, D) = C + εD, --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A} = (A, B) = A + \epsilon B, &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{C} = (C, D) = C + \epsilon D, &lt;/math&gt;
then
&lt;!-- :ÂĈ = AC + ε(AD+BC) --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A}\hat{C} = (A + \epsilon B)(C + \epsilon D) = AC + \epsilon (AD+BC). \!&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that there is no ''BD'' term, because the definition of dual numbers requires that {{nowrap|ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

This gives us the multiplication table (note the multiplication order is row times column):

===Conjugate===

The conjugate of a dual quaternion is the extension of the conjugate of a quaternion, that is
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A}^* = (A^*, B^*) = A^* + \epsilon B^*. \!&lt;/math&gt;

As with quaternions, the conjugate of the product of dual quaternions, {{nowrap|''Ĝ'' {{=}} ''ÂĈ''}}, is the product of their conjugates in reverse order,
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{G}^* = (\hat{A}\hat{C})^* = \hat{C}^*\hat{A}^*.\!&lt;/math&gt;

It is useful to introduce the functions Sc(∗) and Vec(∗) that select the scalar and vector parts of a quaternion, or the dual scalar and dual vector parts of a dual quaternion.  In particular, if {{nowrap|''Â'' {{=}} ''â''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''A''}}, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{Sc}(\hat{A}) = \hat{a}_0, \mbox{Vec}(\hat{A}) = \mathsf{A}.\!&lt;/math&gt;
This allows the definition of the conjugate of ''Â'' as
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A}^* = \mbox{Sc}(\hat{A}) - \mbox{Vec}(\hat{A}).\!&lt;/math&gt;
or, 
:&lt;math&gt; (\hat{a}_0+\mathsf{A})^* = \hat{a}_0 - \mathsf{A}.\!&lt;/math&gt;

The product of a dual quaternion with its conjugate yields
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{A}^* = (\hat{a}_0+\mathsf{A})(\hat{a}_0 - \mathsf{A}) = \hat{a}_0^2 + \mathsf{A}\cdot\mathsf{A}.\!&lt;/math&gt;
This is a dual scalar which is the ''magnitude squared'' of the dual quaternion.

===Dual Number Conjugate===

A second type of conjugate of a dual quaternion is given by taking the dual number conjugate, given by
:&lt;math&gt; \overline{\hat{A}} = (A, -B) = A - \epsilon B. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The quaternion and dual number conjugates can be combined into a third form of conjugate given by
:&lt;math&gt; \overline{\hat{A}^*} = (A^*, -B^*) = A^* - \epsilon B^*. \!&lt;/math&gt;

In the context of dual quaternions, the term "conjugate" can be used to mean the quaternion conjugate, dual number conjugate, or both.

=== Norm ===
The ''norm'' of a dual quaternion {{abs|''Â''}} is computed using the conjugate to compute {{nowrap|{{abs|''Â''}} {{=}} {{radic|''Â Â''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.  This is a dual number called the ''magnitude'' of the dual quaternion.  Dual quaternions with {{nowrap|{{abs|''Â''}} {{=}} 1}} are ''unit dual quaternions''.

Dual quaternions of magnitude 1 are used to represent spatial Euclidean displacements. Notice that the requirement that {{nowrap|''Â Â''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{=}} 1, introduces two algebraic constraints on the components of ''Â'', that is
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{A}\hat{A}^* = (A, B)(A^*, B^*) = (AA^*, AB^* + BA^*) = (1, 0).\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Inverse ===
If {{nowrap|''p'' + ε ''q''}} is a dual quaternion, and ''p'' is not zero, then the inverse dual quaternion is given by 
:''p''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (1 &amp;minus; ε ''q'' ''p''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;).
Thus the elements of the subspace {{nowrap|{ ε q : q ∈ H } }} do not have inverses. This subspace is called an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in ring theory. It happens to be the unique [[maximal ideal]] of the ring of dual numbers.

The [[group of units]] of the dual number ring then consists of numbers not in the ideal. The dual numbers form a [[local ring]] since there is a unique maximal ideal. The group of units is a [[Lie group]] and can be studied using the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential mapping]]. Dual quaternions have been used to exhibit transformations in the [[Euclidean group]]. A typical element can be written as a [[screw theory#Homography|screw transformation]].

== Dual quaternions and spatial displacements ==
A benefit of the dual quaternion formulation of the composition of two spatial displacements D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;=([R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;], '''b''') and D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;=([R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;],'''a''') is that the resulting dual quaternion yields directly the [[screw axis]] and dual angle of the composite displacement D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

In general, the dual quaternion associated with a spatial displacement D = ([A],'''d''') is constructed from its [[screw axis]] S=('''S''', '''V''') and the dual angle (φ, d) where φ is the rotation about and d the slide along this axis, which defines the displacement D.  The associated dual quaternion is given by,
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{S} = \cos\frac{\hat{\phi}}{2} + \sin\frac{\hat{\phi}}{2} \mathsf{S}. &lt;/math&gt;

Let the composition of the displacement D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; with D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; be the displacement D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.  The screw axis and dual angle of D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained from the product of the dual quaternions of D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, given by
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{A}=\cos(\hat{\alpha}/2)+ \sin(\hat{\alpha}/2)\mathsf{A}\quad
\text{and}\quad \hat{B}=\cos(\hat{\beta}/2)+ \sin(\hat{\beta}/2)\mathsf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;
That is, the composite displacement D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; has the associated dual quaternion given by
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{C}  = \cos\frac{\hat{\gamma}}{2}+\sin\frac{\hat{\gamma}}{2}\mathsf{C}
=
\Big(\cos\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}+\sin\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\mathsf{B}\Big) \Big(\cos\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2}+
\sin\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2}\mathsf{A}\Big).
&lt;/math&gt;

Expand this product in order to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\cos\frac{\hat{\gamma}}{2}+\sin\frac{\hat{\gamma}}{2} \mathsf{C}  =
\Big(\cos\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\cos\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2} - 
\sin\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\sin\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2} \mathsf{B}\cdot \mathsf{A}\Big)  +  \Big(\sin\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\cos\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2} \mathsf{B} + 
\sin\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2}\cos\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2} \mathsf{A} + 
\sin\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\sin\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2} \mathsf{B}\times \mathsf{A}\Big).
&lt;/math&gt;

Divide both sides of this equation by the identity
:&lt;math&gt; \cos\frac{\hat{\gamma}}{2} = \cos\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\cos\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2} - 
\sin\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\sin\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2} \mathsf{B}\cdot \mathsf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \tan\frac{\hat{\gamma}}{2} \mathsf{C}  = \frac{\tan\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\mathsf{B} + 
\tan\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2} \mathsf{A} + 
\tan\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\tan\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2} \mathsf{B}\times \mathsf{A}}{1 - 
\tan\frac{\hat{\beta}}{2}\tan\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{2} \mathsf{B}\cdot \mathsf{A}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This is [[Olinde Rodrigues|Rodrigues]]' formula for the screw axis of a composite displacement defined in terms of the screw axes of the two displacements.  He derived this formula in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, O. (1840), Des lois géométriques qui régissent les déplacements d’un système solide dans l’espace, et la variation des coordonnées provenant de ses déplacements considérés indépendamment des causes qui peuvent les produire, Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées de Liouville 5, 380–440.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three screw axes A, B, and C form a [https://books.google.com/books?id=f8I4yGVi9ocC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA64#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false spatial triangle] and the dual angles at these ''vertices'' between the common normals that form the sides of this triangle are directly related to the dual angles of the three spatial displacements.

== Matrix form of dual quaternion multiplication ==
The matrix representation of the quaternion product is convenient for programming quaternion computations using matrix algebra, which is true for dual quaternion operations as well.

The quaternion product AC is a linear transformation by the operator A of the components of the quaternion C, therefore there is a matrix representation of A operating on the vector formed from the components of C.

Assemble the components of the quaternion {{nowrap|1=C = c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + '''C'''}} into the array {{nowrap|1=C = (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.  Notice that the components of the vector part of the quaternion are listed first and the scalar is listed last.  This is an arbitrary choice, but once this convention is selected we must abide by it.

The quaternion product AC can now be represented as the matrix product
:&lt;math&gt; 
AC = [A^+] C =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_0 &amp; -A_3 &amp; A_2 &amp; A_1 \\
A_3 &amp; a_0 &amp; -A_1 &amp; A_2 \\
-A_2 &amp; A_1 &amp; a_0  &amp; A_3 \\
-A_1 &amp; -A_2 &amp; -A_3 &amp; a_0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{Bmatrix} C_1 \\ C_2 \\ C_3 \\ c_0 \end{Bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The product AC can also be viewed as an operation by C on the components of A, in which case we have
:&lt;math&gt;
AC = [C^-] A = \begin{bmatrix}
c_0 &amp; C_3 &amp; -C_2 &amp; C_1 \\
-C_3 &amp; c_0 &amp; C_1 &amp; C_2 \\
C_2 &amp; -C_1 &amp; c_0  &amp; C_3 \\
-C_1 &amp; -C_2 &amp; -C_3 &amp; c_0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{Bmatrix} A_1 \\ A_2 \\ A_3 \\ a_0 \end{Bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The dual quaternion product ÂĈ = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC) can be formulated as a matrix operation as follows.  Assemble the components of Ĉ into the eight dimensional array Ĉ = (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), then ÂĈ is given by the 8x8 matrix product
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{A}\hat{C} = [\hat{A}^+]\hat{C} = \begin{bmatrix} A^+ &amp; 0 \\ B^+ &amp; A^+ \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} C \\ D\end{Bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As we saw for quaternions, the product ÂĈ can be viewed as the operation of Ĉ on the coordinate vector Â, which means ÂĈ can also be formulated as,
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{A}\hat{C} = [\hat{C}^-]\hat{A} = \begin{bmatrix} C^- &amp; 0 \\ D^- &amp; C^- \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} A \\ B\end{Bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== More on spatial displacements ==
The dual quaternion of a displacement D=([A], '''d''') can be constructed from the quaternion S=cos(φ/2) + sin(φ/2)'''S''' that defines the rotation [A] and the vector quaternion constructed from the translation vector '''d''', given by D = d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;i + d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;j + d&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;k.   Using this notation, the dual quaternion for the displacement D=([A], '''d''') is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{S} = S + \varepsilon \frac{1}{2}DS. &lt;/math&gt;

Let the Plücker coordinates of a line in the direction '''x''' through a point '''p''' in a moving body and its coordinates in the fixed frame which is in the direction '''X''' through the point '''P''' be given by,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\mathbf{x} + \varepsilon \mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{x}\quad\text{and}\quad\hat{X}=\mathbf{X} + \varepsilon \mathbf{P}\times\mathbf{X}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the dual quaternion of the displacement of this body transforms Plücker coordinates in the moving frame to Plücker coordinates in the fixed frame by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{X} = \hat{S}\hat{x}\overline{\hat{S}^*}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the matrix form of the dual quaternion product this becomes,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{X} =[\hat{S}^+][\hat{S}^-]^*\hat{x}.&lt;/math&gt;
This calculation is easily managed using matrix operations.

== Dual quaternions and 4×4 homogeneous transforms ==
It might be helpful, especially in rigid body motion, to represent dual quaternions as [[homogeneous transformation matrix|homogeneous matrices]]. As given above a dual quaternion can be written as: &lt;math&gt;\hat q = r + d\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; where ''r'' and ''d'' are both quaternions. The ''r'' quaternion is known as the real or rotational part and the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; quaternion is known as the dual or displacement part.  

The rotation part can be given by
:&lt;math&gt;r = r_w + r_xi + r_yj + r_zk = \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) + \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \left( \vec{a} \cdot (i, j, k) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of rotation about the direction given by unit vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;. The displacement part can be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;d = 0 + \frac{\Delta x}{2}i + \frac{\Delta y}{2}j + \frac{\Delta z}{2}k&lt;/math&gt;.

The dual-quaternion equivalent of a 3D-vector is

:&lt;math&gt;\hat v := 1 + \varepsilon (v_x i + v_y j + v_z k)&lt;/math&gt;

and its transformation by &lt;math&gt;\hat q&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cs.utah.edu/~ladislav/kavan06dual/kavan06dual.pdf Dual Quaternions for Rigid Transformation Blending], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}' = \hat q \cdot \hat v \cdot \overline{\hat q^*}&lt;/math&gt;.

These dual quaternions (or actually their transformations on 3D-vectors) can be represented by the homogeneous transformation matrix
:&lt;math&gt; T = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  \\
\Delta x  &amp;   &amp;   &amp;  \\
\Delta y  &amp;   &amp; R &amp;  \\
\Delta z  &amp;   &amp;   &amp;  \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where the 3×3 [[orthogonal matrix]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;R =\begin{pmatrix}
r_w^2+r_x^2-r_y^2-r_z^2   &amp;2r_xr_y-2r_wr_z           &amp;2r_xr_z+2r_wr_y        \\
2r_xr_y+2r_wr_z           &amp;r_w^2-r_x^2+r_y^2-r_z^2 &amp;2r_yr_z-2r_wr_x        \\
2r_xr_z-2r_wr_y           &amp;2r_yr_z+2r_wr_x         &amp;r_w^2-r_x^2-r_y^2+r_z^2\\
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

For the 3D-vector
:&lt;math&gt; v = \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
v_x \\
v_y \\
v_z \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

the transformation by T is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}' =  T \cdot  \vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;

==Eponyms==
Since both  [[Eduard Study]] and [[William Kingdon Clifford]] used and wrote about dual quaternions, at times authors refer to dual quaternions as "Study biquaternions" or "Clifford biquaternions". The latter [[eponym]] has also been used to refer to [[split-biquaternion]]s. Read the article by Joe Rooney linked below for view of a supporter of W.K. Clifford’s claim. Since the claims of Clifford and Study are in contention, it is convenient to use the current designation ''dual quaternion'' to avoid conflict.

[[File:Rimmel's toilet vinegar.jpg|thumb|Advertising (1851) for Rimmel's "toilet vinegar".]]
'''Eugène Rimmel''' (1820–1887) was a French-born British [[perfumer]] and businessman, responsible for manufacturing and marketing some of the earliest commercially made [[cosmetics]].

==Early life and career==

Born in France, Rimmel moved with his family to London when his father accepted an invitation to manage a perfumery on [[Bond Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infomat.net/infomat/rd741/rd1/database/rimmel_london/index.asp Infomat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rimmel was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to his father. In 1834 he opened his own perfumery, the [[Rimmel|House of Rimmel]]. In the same year father and son produced their first [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] products. By the age of 24, Eugène Rimmel had become an immensely talented [[perfumer]] and [[cosmetics]] innovator. Considered by many beauty historians as a trail-blazer of the beauty and [[healthcare]] industries, Rimmel contributed greatly to the concept of hygiene and bathing. He was also among the first to develop scented [[pomade]]s, [[Mouthwash|mouth rinses]] and his signature "Toilet Vinegar".

His most innovative invention may well be the first commercial [[Toxicity|non-toxic]] [[mascara]], which became so popular that "rimmel" is to this day the word for "mascara" in several languages including French, Italian, Portuguese, Persian, Romanian, Spanish, Turkish and Arabic.

Rimmel was also considered an exceptional [[marketer]] and produced detailed [[mail order]] catalogues and advertising programmes with English theatres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/marketing-advertising-channels/6391521-1.html All Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 he published ''The Book of Perfume'', which appeared in 1870 in a French translation (''Le Livre des Parfums'') with a preface by [[Alphonse Karr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=detailsTab&amp;ct=display&amp;fn=search&amp;doc=oxfaleph013902843&amp;indx=2&amp;recIds=oxfaleph013902843&amp;recIdxs=1&amp;elementId=1&amp;renderMode=poppedOut&amp;displayMode=full&amp;frbrVersion=110&amp;dscnt=0&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28OX%29&amp;frbg=&amp;tab=local&amp;dstmp=1371682252917&amp;srt=rank&amp;mode=Basic&amp;dum=true&amp;vl%28254947567UI0%29=creator&amp;tb=t&amp;vl%281UIStartWith0%29=contains&amp;vl%28254947564UI1%29=books&amp;vl%28freeText0%29=rimmel&amp;vid=OXVU1 Bodleian Library online catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

Rimmel was so successful that he was granted ten [[Royal warrant of appointment|Royal Warrant]]s from heads of state all over Europe, including [[Queen Victoria]], for his perfumes and fragranced products.

With the headline "The Prince of Perfumers", ''[[The New York Times]]'' printed Rimmel's obituary on 15 March 1887. It stated that he was one of the founders of the French Hospital and Dispensary in London, and a constant advocate of its claims to the support of the public.

Rimmel married a woman from [[Seurre]], eastern France, Elisabeth ('Betsy') Letroublon with whom he had three children, Jules, Henry and Herminie.  The sons assumed control of the beauty company at Rimmel's death in 1887, though they delegated the management of the company, which passed out of Rimmel family hands.  After many difficulties Rimmel's cosmetics brand is now owned by [[Coty Inc.]]

The '''"finger of God"''' is a phrase used in the [[Bible]]. In Exodus 8:16–20 it is used during the [[plagues of Egypt]] by the Egyptian priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|8:16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Exodus 31:18 and Deuteronomy 9:10 it refers to the method by which the [[Ten Commandments]] were written on [[tablets of stone]] that were brought down from [[biblical Mount Sinai]] by [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|31:18|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|9:10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used once by [[Jesus]] in the [[Gospel of Luke]] to describe how he had cast out demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|11:20|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew Bible==
The first time the phrase "finger of God" appears is in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the eighth chapter, in the paragraph of verses sixteen through twenty of the [[Book of Exodus]], which reads
{{quote|Then the Lord said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.'" And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and gnats came on humans and animals alike; all the dust of the earth turned into gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt. The magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. There were gnats on both humans and animals. And the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God!" But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.|{{bibleref2|Exodus|8:16–20}}}}

The second time the phrase "finger of God" appears is at the last verse, verse eighteen of the thirty-first chapter of the same book, which reads "And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."

The third time the phrase appears, and the last time in the Hebrew Bible, is a second reference to the tablets of the [[Ten Commandments]], and is found in [[Deuteronomy]] 9:10, which says "And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly."

==New Testament==
{{seealso|Exorcising the blind and mute man}}
The phrase is also used by [[Jesus]] in the Christian [[New Testament]] during his proof that he did not cast out demons by the power of [[Beelzebub]]. He said, "But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|11:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament story of [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery]], Jesus writes in the dust of the earth with his finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|8:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] notes from [[St Augustine]] that this gesture can be seen as portraying Christ as the divine legislator; Jesus' actions in writing in the dust are redolent of the Finger of God writing the Law on tablets of stone.&lt;ref name=Angelus&gt;{{cite web | url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/angelus/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_ang_20100321.html | title=Angelus | date=21 March 2010 | accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Furlo Gorge.jpg|thumb|The gorge]]
The '''Furlo Pass''' (Italian: ''Gola del Furlo'' or ''Passo del Furlo'') is a [[Canyon|gorge]] on the ancient Roman road [[Via Flaminia]] in the [[Marche]] region of central [[Italy]], where it passes near the [[Candigliano]] river, a tributary of the [[Metauro]].

The gorge was formed between the Pietralata (889&amp;nbsp;m) and Paganuccio (976&amp;nbsp;m) mountains by the river Candigliano, which whooshed in full spate through the district until it was dammed in 1922. Since 2001 it has been included in a State Natural Reserve of the same name. It is often marketed to tourists in the region as the "Grand Canyon of Italy."

The Roman emperor [[Vespasian]] had a tunnel built here to facilitate passage on the Via Flaminia at the narrowest point of the gorge (hence the name, from the Latina ''forulum'', meaning "small hole"). Next to it is a similar but smaller tunnel dating from Etruscan times. The tunnel has a length of 38.30 meters and a height of 5.95 meters. During the [[Gothic Wars (6th century)]], the Ostrogoth King [[Totila]] had the pass fortified, but his troops were ousted by the Roman general [[Belisarius]]. The [[Lombards]] conquered the pass between 570 and 578, and destroyed the fortifications.

In the following centuries Via Flaminia was nearly abandoned. In 1502 Lucrezia Borgia used it on a journey to Ferrara and in 1506 Julius II took the road on his way to Bologna. In the beginning of the 18th century the transit remained difficult and dangerous, and only in 1776 was the tunnel and the road re-opened. Between May 23 and June 12, 1849, soldiers of the Roman Republic, commanded by Colonel L. Pianciani, fought a skirmish in the pass with the Austrian army.

During the Second World War, the Gorge experienced moments of tension, but it was not the scene of fierce clashes. The seventies saw increasing destruction of the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape, as well as the deterioration of the road, due to the intense activity in quarries located within the Gorge. 

In the 1930s, a profile of [[Benito Mussolini]] was sculpted on the slopes of Mount Pietralata by a local branch of the Guardia Forestale ([[State Forestry Corps]]), which was destroyed by partisans during [[World War II]]. In the 1980s, traffic in the Furlo tunnel was bypassed by the construction of two highway tunnels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20099">The '''Great Tew Circle''' was a group of clerics and literary figures who gathered in the 1630s at the [[manor house]] of [[Great Tew]], [[Oxfordshire]] in southern England, and in London.&lt;ref name="Remer2008"/&gt; [[Lord Clarendon]] referred to the Circle as "A college situate in a purer air", referring to its pursuit of truth away from the partisan passions of the town. The quote is referenced by [[John Buchan]] in his story "Fullcircle", though he misquotes it as "clearer air". The house was the property of the noble Cary family, and the circle was brought together by [[Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland|Lucius Cary]], who became 2nd Viscount Falkland on the death of his father in 1633. The most prominent of those taking part was [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], the future 1st Earl of Clarendon, who after 1660 would become known as a leading statesman, and then a historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Ted-Larry Pebworth|title=Literary circles and cultural communities in Renaissance England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih1sRzuOAhMC&amp;pg=PA174|accessdate=24 March 2012|year=2000|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1317-4|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the vexed religious climate of the time, the Circle was heterodox, inclining to sympathy with [[Socinianism]].&lt;ref name="Mortimer2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Mortimer|title=Reason and Religion in the English Revolution: The Challenge of Socinianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYeP_htzw14C&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=24 March 2012|date=4 March 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51704-1|pages=63–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The favoured approach of some of those involved has been defined as "[[Arminianism|Arminian humanism]]", and in any case opposed to rigid [[Calvinism]];&lt;ref&gt;See [[Arminianism in the Church of England]].&lt;/ref&gt; this approach fitted with political views that were essentially [[royalist]].&lt;ref name="Müller2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Müller|title=Latitudinarianism and didacticism in eighteenth century literature: moral theology in Fielding, Sterne, and Goldsmith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ArqOiaObh9UC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=24 March 2012|date=19 January 2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-631-59116-1|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central religious figure of the Circle was [[William Chillingworth]].&lt;ref name="Sorell1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Sorell|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hobbes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaHbJNClqjQC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=24 March 2012|date=26 January 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42244-4|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falkland himself had a Catholic convert, [[Elizabeth Cary, Lady Falkland]], for his mother, and found the tolerant approach of [[Erasmus]] attractive.&lt;ref name="Quantin2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean-Louis Quantin|title=The Church of England and Christian antiquity: the construction of a confessional identity in the 17th century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwNmY0UFfakC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=24 March 2012|date=25 April 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-955786-8|pages=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Major influences on the thinking of the circle were [[Hugo Grotius]]&lt;ref name="Remer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Remer|title=Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SyXardgwY6EC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=24 March 2012|date=31 January 2008|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-02811-8|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Hooker]] because of the place the latter made for the use of reason in Biblical interpretation and [[church polity]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brydon, ''The Evolving Reputation of Richard Hooker: An examination of responses 1600–1714'' (2006), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; These writers formed part of the broader Christian humanist tradition of [[Jacobus Acontius]], [[George Cassander]], [[Sebastian Castellio]], [[Bernardino Ochino]] and [[Faustus Socinus]].&lt;ref name="Remer2008"/&gt; The anti-[[patristic]] views of [[Jean Daillé]] were also significant.&lt;ref name="Packer1969"&gt;{{cite book|author=John William Packer|title=The transformation of Anglicanism, 1643-1660: with special reference to Henry Hammond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBwNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=24 March 2012|year=1969|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|pages=69|id=GGKEY:2UELGKR2ZUF}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writings of Hyde (as Lord Clarendon), the gatherings and discussions themselves were modelled on those of Cicero and Erasmus, with guests being welcome to differ on points of view. Discourse also took place around the dinner table, with Clarendon likening the "''Convivium Philosophicum'' or ''Convivium Theologicum'' ("philosophical-" or "theological feast") to Erasmus's ''Convivium Religiosum'' ("godly feast")."&lt;ref name="Remer2008"/&gt;

==Tolerance, eirenicism, latitude==
Chillingworth was influenced by Acontius, and the Circle read Acontius alongside [[Johannes Crellius]], a Socinian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Marshall|title=John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture: Religious Intolerance and Arguments for Religious Toleration in Early Modern and 'Early Enlightenment' Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRb-P3HRuvkC&amp;pg=PA324|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=30 March 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65114-1|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found greater relevance in the [[eirenicism]] of Acontius than in the theology ([[Unitarianism]]) of Socinus himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Mortimer|title=Reason and Religion in the English Revolution: The Challenge of Socinianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYeP_htzw14C&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=4 March 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51704-1|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The context, as explained by the historian [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], was that of the [[Thirty Years' War]] with its Protestant defeats of the 1620s and Catholic expansion; but also of the doctrines of the [[contra-Remonstrants]] in an environment of increasing [[skepticism]] on religious matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reid Barbour|title=Literature and Religious Culture in Seventeenth-Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKHhA2-u2pkC&amp;pg=PR80|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00664-4|pages=lxxx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falkland and Chillingworth had been seared by the "[[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] crisis" of skepticism rampant.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Trevor-Roper, ''From Counter-Reformation to Glorious Revolution'' (1992), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposed to [[fideism]], the Circle found in the use by Grotius of [[probabilism]] a more attractive option to deal with the challenge of skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Garber|author2=Michael Ayers|title=The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPlkkgIhUXIC|pages=1034 and 399|accessdate=26 March 2012|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53720-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trevor-Roper supported the claims of the Great Tew group to the eirenic moral high ground on [[religious toleration]] and a commitment to rational dialogue on religion. This analysis has been challenged from the direction of the Circle's political thought, with its commitment to [[sovereignty]]. It has also been argued that these are two sides to the understanding of the period of the term "Socinian".&lt;ref name="Mortimer2010"/&gt; The eirenic style was understood by Puritan opponents as Arminian rhetoric, and they moved away from compromise with it, to polemic and contemplation of war.&lt;ref name="Dodds2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory D. Dodds|title=Exploiting Erasmus: the Erasmian legacy and religious change in early modern England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sE70JHsZVakC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=9 April 2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9900-6|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major theologians of the circle (Chillingworth, Hales, Taylor) have regularly been claimed as precursors of the [[Latitudinarian]]s, a term anachronistic before 1660.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Edward Augustus George]], ''Seventeenth Century Men of Latitude; forerunners of the new theology'' (1908); [https://archive.org/details/seventeenthcentu00georialaarchive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; They are now considered to have paved the way for the [[Cambridge Platonists]], in the attitude that there is no single basis of essential and true beliefs.&lt;ref name="Haakonssen2006"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Knud Haakonssen|title=Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in Eighteenth-Century Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOY56Aqh77YC&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=2 November 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02987-2|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction now usual between the Cambridge Platonists and other Latitudinarians is a conventional one, introduced by [[John Tulloch]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Ignatius Joseph Griffin|author2=[[Richard Henry Popkin]]|author3=Lila Freedman|title=Latitudinarianism in the seventeenth-century Church of England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXGPCglRAxYC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=1992|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-09653-0|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
Participation in any actual dialogues as described by Hyde is problematic to establish; and the time scale has different points on it, though a beginning date of 1634 (Martinich) seems to be agreed widely. After about 1640 the troubled political situation overshadowed theoretical discussion and writing. The influence of the circle can be traced in theological production (especially Chillingworth's ''Religion of Protestants'', 1638),&lt;ref&gt;In full ''The Religion of Protestants, a safe way to salvation, or, An answer to a booke entitle Mercy and truth, or, Charity maintain'd by Catholiques, which pretends to prove the contrary'' (Oxford, 1638).&lt;/ref&gt; literary works and translation in a humanist vein, and the political line pursued by Falkland and Hyde in 1640–1, attempting to find a middle position between Puritan and Laudian extremes.
[[File:Falkland Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 1181172.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Falkland, who died at the [[first battle of Newbury]] of 1643, fighting recklessly on the royalist side, some 30 miles south of Great Tew]]

===Associations===
Since Great Tew was best known as an open house for Oxford scholars, and Falkland's contacts included a group centred on London and the court, it is artificial at best to assign membership in the circle to some who are known to have associated with the group.

*[[Thomas Hobbes]].&lt;ref name=PCary/&gt; Whether Hobbes actually visited Great Tew is unclear; he possibly did so in 1634. His associations with the circle through friendships are more certain in a London context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Sorell|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hobbes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaHbJNClqjQC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=26 January 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42244-4|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other groups==
Falkland himself is identified as one of the [[Tribe of Ben]], the followers of Jonson;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Brackett|title=The Facts On File Companion to British Poetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XTxs-X-gSwC&amp;pg=PA452|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0835-3|pages=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others of the Circle were also in the Tribe. Falkland also gave the first of the poetical tributes in the 1638 Oxford memorial volume ''Jonson Virbius'', and others of the Circle who contributed were [[Henry Coventry]], May and Digges.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barrett Wendell]], ''The Temper of the Seventeenth Century in English Literature (1904), p. 136;[https://archive.org/stream/temperseventeen00wendgoog#page/n150/mode/2up archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hales and Chillingworth have been identified with an "Oxford School of rational theology", containing also [[Christopher Potter]] and William Page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Tyacke|title=Aspects of English Protestantism, c. 1530-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McvcmiZ6h8gC&amp;pg=PA279|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=2001|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-5392-4|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that, despite the political difference over the defence of [[episcopacy]], there is no clear distinction between the Great Tew line and Laudianism in theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul D.

S. Morrill]], ''The Revolt of the Provinces: Conservatives and Radicals in the English Civil War 1630–1650'' (1980), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Katherine Jones was someone common to the Great Tew Circle and the [[Hartlib Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Shapin|title=A social history of truth: civility and science in seventeenth-century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9eI7TGxLCsC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-75018-7|pages=144 note 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Payne was a central figure in the so-called [[Welbeck Academy]], around the Cavendishes, with which Hobbes was more closely associated than with Great Tew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juhana Lemetti|title=Historical Dictionary of Hobbes's Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N_-lu-p7IoC&amp;pg=PA352|accessdate=3 April 2012|date=16 December 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5065-1|pages=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Letice Falkland.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Letice Cary, Viscountess Falkland, as a widow]]
The widowed Lady Falkland (Letice or Lettice) took in [[John Duncon]], brother of [[Eleazar Duncon]] and [[Edmund Duncon]], who had lost his Essex rectory during the Civil war. He later wrote her biography (1648, in the form of an exchange of letters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Duncon, Eleazar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Duncon|author2=Lettice Cary (viscountess Falkland.)|title=The holy life and death of the lady Letice, vi-countess Falkland, with the returnes of spiritual comfort and grief in a devout soul.

'''Hungarian''' ({{audio|Hu-magyar_nyelv.ogg|''magyar nyelv''}}) is a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] language spoken in [[Hungary]] and several neighbouring countries. It is the [[official language]] of  Hungary and one of the 24 official languages of the [[European Union]]. Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] in the countries that today make up [[Slovakia]], western [[Ukraine]] ([[Zakarpattia Oblast|Subcarpathia]]), central and western [[Romania]] ([[Transylvania]]), northern [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]), northern [[Croatia]], and northern [[Slovenia]] ([[Prekmurje|Mur region]]). It is also spoken by Hungarian [[diaspora]] communities worldwide, especially in [[North America]] (particularly the [[Hungarian Americans|United States]] and Canada) and in Israel. Like [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], Hungarian belongs to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]].

==Classification==
{{See also|Regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and other Uralic languages}}
Hungarian is a member of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family. Linguistic connections between Hungarian and other Uralic languages were noticed in the 1670s, and the family itself (then called Finno-Ugric) was established in 1717, but the classification of Hungarian as a Uralic/Finno-Ugric rather than Turkic language continued to be a matter of impassioned political controversy throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries. Hungarian has traditionally been assigned to an [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] branch within Uralic/Finno-Ugric, along with the [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Khanty language|Khanty]] languages of western [[Siberia]] ([[Khanty–Mansia]] region), but it is no longer clear that it is a valid group.  When the [[Samoyed languages]] were determined to be part of the family, it was thought at first that Finnic and Ugric (Finno-Ugric) were closer to each other than to the Samoyed branch of the family, but that now is frequently questioned.&lt;ref name="SalmTax"&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/kuzn.html Salminen, Tapani (2002): ''Problems in the taxonomy of the Uralic languages in the light of modern comparative studies'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michalove, Peter A. (2002) The Classification of the Uralic Languages: Lexical Evidence from Finno-Ugric. In: Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen, vol. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[name of Hungary]] could be a result of regular sound changes of ''Ungrian/Ugrian'', and the fact that the Eastern Slavs referred to Hungarians as ''Ǫgry/Ǫgrove'' (sg. ''Ǫgrinŭ'') seemed to confirm that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lebedynsky | first = Iaroslav | language = French | title = Les Nomades: Les peuples nomades de la steppe des origines aux invasions mongoles |trans-title=The Nomads: the steppe nomad people from origins to Mongol invasions | page = 191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Current literature favors the hypothesis that it comes from the name of the Turkic tribe [[Onogurs|Onogur]] (which means "ten arrows" or "ten tribes").&lt;ref&gt;Sugar, P.F..''A History of Hungary''. University Press, 1996: p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, A.''Magyarization,''' Language Planning and Whorf: The word Uhor as a Case Study in Linguistic Relativism''Multilingua 23: 319, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcantonio, Angela. ''The Uralic Language Family: Facts, Myths and Statistics''. Blackwell Publishing, 2002: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;'''

There are numerous regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and the other Ugric languages. For example, Hungarian {{IPA|/aː/}} corresponds to [[Khanty language|Khanty]] {{IPA|/o/}} in certain positions, and Hungarian {{IPA|/h/}} corresponds to Khanty {{IPA|/x/}}, while Hungarian final {{IPA|/z/}} corresponds to Khanty final {{IPA|/t/}}. For example, Hungarian ''ház'' {{IPA-hu|haːz|}} "house" vs. Khanty ''xot'' {{IPA|[xot]}} "house", and Hungarian ''száz'' {{IPA|[saːz]}} "hundred" vs. Khanty ''sot'' {{IPA|[sot]}} "hundred". The distance between the Ugric and Finnic languages is greater, but the correspondences are also regular.

=== Early classification ===
During the latter half of the 19th century, a competing hypothesis proposed a Turkic affinity of Hungarian. Following an academic debate known as ''Az ugor-török háború'' ("the Ugric-Turkic battle"), the Finno-Ugric hypothesis was concluded the sounder of the two, foremost based on work by the German [[linguist]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Josef Budenz|de}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Linguistica Uralica|issue=2/2001|author1-first=Angela|author1-last=Marcantonio|author2-first=Pirjo|author2-last=Nummenaho|author3-first=Michela|author3-last=Salvagni|url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/va_lu/l37-2-1.pdf|format=PDF|title=The "Ugric-Turkic Battle": A Critical Review|accessdate=8 October 2017|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article |History of the Hungarian language}}

===Prehistory===
====Scholarly consensus====
The traditional view holds that the Hungarian language diverged from its [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] relatives in the first half of the [[1st millennium BC|1st millennium {{smallcaps|b.c.}}]], in western [[Siberia]] east of the southern [[Ural mountains|Urals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Uralic Languages |last= Abondolo |first=Daniel |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |location=London |pages=1–42 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hungarians]] gradually changed their lifestyle from being settled hunters to being [[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralists]], probably as a result of early contacts with Iranian nomads ([[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]). In Hungarian, Iranian loanwords date back to the time immediately following the breakup of [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] and probably span well over a millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Uralic Languages |last=Abondolo |first=Daniel |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |location=London |pages=453 |chapter=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these include ''tehén'' ‘cow’ (cf. [[Avestan]] ''dhaénu''); ''tíz'' ‘ten’ (cf. Avestan ''dasa''); ''tej'' ‘milk’ (cf. Persian ''dáje'' ‘wet nurse’); and ''nád'' ‘reed’ (from late [[Middle Iranian]]; cf. [[Middle Persian]] ''nāy'').

Archaeological evidence from present day southern [[Bashkortostan]] confirms the existence of Hungarian settlements between the [[Volga River]] and [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Attila Türk, ''A magyar őstörténet és a szaltovói régészeti kultúrkör''. PhD, University of Szeged, 2011 [http://doktori.bibl.u-szeged.hu/1167/].&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Onogurs]] (and [[Bulgar]]s) later had a great influence on the language, especially between the 5th and 9th centuries. This layer of Turkic loans is large and varied (''e.g.'', ''szó'' ‘word’, from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]; ''daru'' ‘crane’, from the related [[Permic languages]]), and includes words borrowed from [[Oghur languages|Oghur Turkic]]; ''e.g.'', ''borjú'' ‘calf’ (cf. [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] ''păru'', ''părăv'' vs. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''buzağı'');&lt;ref&gt;András Róna-Tas &amp; Árpád Berta, ''West Old Turkic: Turkic Loanwords in Hungarian. Part 1: Introduction, A-K'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2011), 151-2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''dél'' ‘noon; south’ (cf. Chuvash ''tĕl'' vs. Turkish dial. ''düš'').&lt;ref&gt;Róna-Tas &amp; Berta, ''WOT'' 2011/1: 291-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Many words related to [[agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungary&amp;nbsp;– Early history|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html|work=[[Library of Congress]] (public domain)|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sovereign state|state]] administration and even [[family relationship]]s show evidence of such backgrounds.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Hungarian [[syntax (linguistics)|syntax]] and [[grammar]] were not influenced in a similarly dramatic way over these three centuries.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Hu-funeral sermon and prayer OSZK.jpg|thumb|[[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]], 12th century]]
[[File:Komjati sztpal.jpg|thumb|A page from the first book written completely in Hungarian, 1533]]

After the [[Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin|arrival of the Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin]], the language came into contact with a variety of [[Sprachbund|speech communities]], among them [[Slavic people|Slavic]], [[Turkic people|Turkic]], and [[German people|German]]. Turkic loans from this period come mainly from the [[Pechenegs]] and [[Cuman people|Cumanians]], who settled in Hungary during the 12th and 13th centuries; ''e.g.'', ''koboz'' ‘[[cobza]]’ (cf. Turkish ''kopuz'' ‘lute’); ''[[komondor]]'' ‘mop dog’ (&lt; *''kumandur'' &lt; ''Cuman''). Hungarian borrowed many words from neighbouring [[Slavic language]]s; ''e.g.'', ''tégla'' ‘brick’; ''mák'' ‘poppy’; ''karácsony'' ‘Christmas’&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Zaicz, ''Etimológiai szótár: Magyar szavak és toldalékok eredete'', s.v. “karácsony” (Tinta Könyvkiadó, 2006) [http://www.tankonyvtar.hu/hu/tartalom/tinta/TAMOP-4_2_5-09_Etimologiai_szotar/adatok.html]&lt;/ref&gt;). These languages in turn borrowed words from Hungarian; ''e.g.'', [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] ''ašov'' from Hung ''ásó'' ‘spade’. Approximately 1.6 percent of the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] [[lexicon]] is of Hungarian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Vocabularul reprezentativ al limbilor romanice |last=Sala |first=Marius |publisher=Editura Ştiinţifică şi Enciclopedică |year=1988 |location=Bucharest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim Schulte, "Loanwords in Romanian", ''Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook'' (Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton, 2009), 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative views====

Hungarian [[historian]] and [[archaeologist]] [[Gyula László]] claims that [[geology|geological]] data from [[pollen analysis]] seems to contradict the placing of the ancient Hungarian homeland near the Urals.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Gyula, ''The Magyars: Their Life and Civilization'', (1996). On p. 37 he states: “This seemed to be an impeccable conclusion until attention was paid to the actual testimony of tree-pollen analyses, and these showed that the linguists had failed to take into account changes in the vegetation zones over the millennia. After analysis of the plant pollens in the supposed homeland of the Magyars, which were preserved in the soil, it became clear to scientists that the [[taiga]] and [[deciduous forest]]s were only in contact during the second millennium B.C.E., which is much too late to affect Finno-Ugrian history. So the territory sought by the linguists as the location of the putative ‘ancient homeland’ never existed. At 5,000-6,000 B.C.E., the period at which the Uralic era has been dated, the taiga was still thousands of kilometres away from the Ural mountains and the mixed deciduous forest had only just begun its northward advance.”&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been attempts, dismissed by mainstream linguists as [[Pseudoscientific language comparison|pseudoscientific comparisons]], to show that Hungarian is related to other languages, such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[pelasgian language|Pelasgian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[English language|English]], [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Magar language|Magar]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and at least 40 other languages.&lt;ref name="zsirai"&gt;'''Miklós Zsirai''': ''Őstörténeti csodabogarak''. Budapest, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical Controversy over origins====
Today the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] among [[linguist]]s is that Hungarian is a member of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] family of languages.

For many years, however, it was a matter of dispute whether Hungarian was a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]]/[[Uralic language]] or more closely related to the [[Turkic languages]] (a controversy known as the "[[Ugric–Turkish war]]")&lt;ref&gt;elanguage.net/journals/pragmatics/article/download/205/144&lt;/ref&gt;—or whether indeed both the Uralic and the Turkic families formed part of a [[superfamily (linguistics)|superfamily]] of [[Ural–Altaic languages]]. Hungarians did in fact absorb some Turkic influences during several centuries of cohabitation. For example, the Hungarians appear to have learned [[animal husbandry]] techniques from the Turkic [[Chuvash people]], as a high proportion of words specific to [[agriculture]] and [[livestock]] are of Chuvash origin. A strong Chuvash influence was also apparent in Hungarian [[burial]] customs. Furthermore, all Ugric languages, not only Hungarian, feature Turkic [[loanword]]s related to [[horse riding]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Old Hungarian===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The first written accounts of Hungarian, mostly [[personal name]] and [[place name]]s, date to the 10th century. No significant texts written in [[Old Hungarian script]] have survived, as wood, the [[writing material|medium of writing]] in use at the time, was perishable.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was founded in 1000 by [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]]. The country became a [[Western culture|Western]]-styled [[Christian]] ([[Roman Catholic]]) state, with [[Latin script]] replacing Hungarian runes. The earliest remaining fragments of the language are found in the [[establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany]] from 1055, intermingled with [[Latin language|Latin]] text. The first extant text fully written in Hungarian is the [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]], which dates to the 1190s. Although the [[orthography]] of these early texts differed considerably from that used today, contemporary Hungarians can still understand a great deal of the reconstructed spoken language, despite changes in grammar and vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A more extensive body of [[Hungarian literature]] arose after 1300. The earliest known example of Hungarian [[Christian poetry|religious poetry]] is the 14th-century ''[[Lamentations of Mary]]''. The first [[Bible translation]] was the [[Hussite Bible]] in the 1430s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The standard language lost its [[diphthongs]], and several [[postposition]]s transformed into [[suffix]]es, including ''reá'' "onto" (the phrase ''utu '''rea''''' "onto the way" found in the 1055 text would later become ''út'''ra'''''). There were also changes in the system of [[vowel harmony]]. At one time, Hungarian used six [[verb]] [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]. Today, only two are commonly used (present and past); the future is formed with an [[auxiliary verb]] and is usually not counted as a separate tense.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Modern Hungarian===
[[File:Esztergom Jordánszky-kódex.JPG|thumb|The [[Bible]] in Hungarian]]

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

In 1533, [[Kraków]] [[printing press|printer]] [[Benedek Komjáti]] published the first Hungarian-language book set in [[movable type]], a translation of the [[Pauline letters|letters of Saint Paul]] entitled ''Az zenth Paal leueley magyar nyeluen'' (modern orthography: ''Az Szent Pál levelei magyar nyelven'').{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

By the 17th century, the language already closely resembled its present-day form, although two of the past tenses remained in use. [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] loans also began to appear. Further Turkish words were borrowed during the period of [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman rule]] (1541 to 1699).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the 18th century a group of writers, most notably [[Ferenc Kazinczy]], spearheaded a process of ''nyelvújítás'' ([[language revitalization]]). Some words were shortened (''győzedelem'' &gt; ''győzelem'', 'triumph' or 'victory'); a number of [[dialect]]al words spread nationally (''e.g.'', ''cselleng'' 'dawdle'); extinct words were reintroduced (''dísz'', 'décor'); a wide range of expressions were [[neologism|coined]] using the various derivative suffixes; and some other, less frequently used methods of expanding the language were utilized. This movement produced more than ten thousand words, most of which are used actively today.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The 19th and 20th centuries saw further [[Standard language#Standardization|standardization]] of the language, and differences between [[mutually comprehensible]] dialects gradually diminished.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 1920, Hungary signed the [[Treaty of Trianon]], losing 71 percent of its territory and one-third of the ethnic Hungarian population along with it.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Today the language holds [[official language|official]] status nationally in Hungary and regionally in [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Romania]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Serbia]], [[Hungarians in Austria|Austria]] and [[Slovenia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Official status===
[[File:Vojvodina hungarian map.png|thumb|upright=1.36|Official usage of Hungarian language in Vojvodina, Serbia]]
Hungarian is the [[official language]] of Hungary, and thus an official language of the [[European Union]]. Hungarian is also one of the official languages of [[Vojvodina]] and an official language of three municipalities in [[Slovenia]]: [[Hodoš]], [[Dobrovnik]] and [[Lendava]], along with [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Hungarian is officially recognized as a [[minority language|minority]] or [[regional language]] in [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]], [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]] in [[Ukraine]], and [[Slovakia]]. In [[Romania]] it is a recognized minority language used at local level in communes, towns and municipalities with an ethnic Hungarian population of over 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1096369.html|title=Romania: Law Allows Use Of Minority Languages In Public Administration|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects===
{{main article|Hungarian dialects}}
The [[dialects]] of Hungarian identified by [[Ethnologue]] are: Alföld, West Danube, Danube-Tisza, King's Pass Hungarian, Northeast Hungarian, Northwest Hungarian, Székely and West Hungarian.  These dialects are, for the most part, [[mutually intelligible]]. The Hungarian [[Csángó]] dialect, which is mentioned but not listed separately by Ethnologue, is spoken primarily in [[Bacău County]] in eastern Romania. The Csángó Hungarian group has been largely isolated from other [[Hungarian people]], and they therefore preserved features that closely resemble earlier forms of Hungarian.

==Phonology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Hungarian vowel chart with rounded short a.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Hungarian vowels]]
{{Main article|Hungarian phonology}}

Hungarian has 14 vowel phonemes and 25 consonant phonemes. The vowel phonemes can be grouped as pairs of short and long vowels such as ''o'' and ''ó''. Most of the pairs have a similar pronunciation and vary significantly only in their duration. However, pairs ''a''/''á'' and ''e''/''é'' differ both in closedness and length.

[[Consonant length]] is also distinctive in Hungarian. Most consonant phonemes can occur as [[Consonant length|geminates]].

The sound [[voiced palatal plosive]] {{IPA|/ɟ/}}, written {{angle bracket|gy}}, sounds similar to 'd' in [[British English]] 'duty' (in fact, it is more similar to the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] phoneme 'ѓ' as in 'ѓакон', "deacon", from ''diakon''). It occurs in the name of the country, "Magyarország" (Hungary), pronounced {{IPA|/ˈmɒɟɒrorsaːɡ/}}.

A single 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar tap]] (''akkora'' 'of that size'), but a double 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar trill]] (''akkorra'' 'by that time'), like in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Prosody===
Primary stress is always on the first [[syllable]] of a word, as in Finnish and the neighbouring [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language|Czech]]. There is a secondary stress on other syllables in compounds: ''viszontlátásra'' ("goodbye") is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈvisontˌlaːtaːʃrɒ/}}. Elongated vowels in non-initial syllables may seem to be stressed to an English-speaker, as length and stress correlate in English.

==Grammar==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
{{Main article |Hungarian grammar}}
Hungarian, an [[agglutinative language]], uses various [[affixes]], mainly [[suffixes]] but also some [[prefixes]] and a [[circumfix]], to change a word's meaning and its grammatical function.

===Vowel harmony===
Hungarian uses [[vowel harmony]] to attach suffixes to words. That means that most suffixes have two or three different forms, and the choice between them depends on the vowels of the head word. There are some minor and unpredictable exceptions to the rule.

===Nouns===
Nouns have a large number of [[Grammatical case|cases]] (between 18 and 35, depending on the definition), but they are generally formed regularly with suffixes. The nominative case is unmarked (''az alma'' 'the apple') and, for example, the accusative is marked with the suffix ''–t'' (''az almát'' '[I eat] the apple'). Half of the 18 cases express a combination of the source-location-target and surface-inside-proximity ternary distinctions (three times three cases); there is a separate case ending –''ból''/''–ből'' meaning a combination of source and insideness: 'from inside of'.

Possession is expressed by a possessive suffix on the possessed object, rather than the possessor as  in English (Peter's apple becomes ''Péter almája'', literally 'Peter apple-his'). Noun plurals are formed with''–k'' (''az almák'' ‘the apples’), but after a numeral, the singular is used (''két alma'' ‘two apples’, literally ‘two apple’; not ''*két almák'').

Unlike English, Hungarian uses case suffixes and mostly [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]], instead of prepositions.

There are two types of [[article (grammar)|articles]] in Hungarian, definite and indefinite, which roughly correspond to the equivalents in English.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives precede nouns (''a piros alma'' 'the red apple') and have three degrees: positive (''piros'' 'red'), comparative (''pirosabb'' 'redder') and superlative (''a legpirosabb'' 'the reddest').

If the noun takes the plural or a case, an attributive adjective is invariable: ''a piros almák'' 'the red apples'. However, a predicative adjective agrees with the noun:  ''az almák piros'''ak''''' 'the apples are red'. Adjectives by themselves can behave as nouns (and so can take case suffixes): ''Melyik almát kéred?&amp;nbsp;– A piros'''at'''.'' 'Which apple would you like?&amp;nbsp;– The red one'.

===Verbs===
{{See also|Hungarian verbs}}
Verbs are conjugated according to two tenses (past and present), three moods (indicative, conditional and imperative-subjunctive), two numbers (singular or plural), three persons (first, second and third) and definiteness.

The last feature is most characteristic: the definite conjugation is used with a [[transitive verb]] whose (direct) object is definite (''Péter eszi az almát''. "Peter eats the apple".), but the indefinite conjugation either for a verb with an indefinite direct object (''Péter eszik egy almát''. "Peter eats an apple".) or for a verb without an object. (''Péter eszik''. "Peter eats".){{Clarify|date=March 2015|reason=Does Hungarian also have the concept of indirect objects (equating in English to prepositional phrases); and if so, into which class would fall the conjugation of a verb with an indirect, definite object? (&amp;quot;Peter watches for the apple.&amp;quot;)}}
Since conjugation expresses the person and number, personal pronouns are usually omitted except for emphasis.&lt;!-- A definite object usually has the definite article before it (e.g. ''az alma'' ‘the apple’), while an indefinite has the indefinite article (''egy alma'' ‘an apple’), or does not have any articles (this is sometimes used for generalization.) --&gt;

The [[present tense]] is unmarked, and the past is formed by using the suffix&amp;nbsp;–t or –tt: ''hall'' 'hears'; ''hallott'' 'heard', past. Future may be expressed with the present tense (usually with a word defining the time of the event: ''holnap'' 'tomorrow') or by using the auxiliary verb ''fog'' (similar to the English 'will'), followed by the infinitive.

The [[indicative mood]] and the [[conditional mood]] are used both in the present and the past tenses. The conditional past is expressed by using the conjugated past form and the auxiliary word ''volna ''(''hallott volna'' 'would have heard')''.'' The [[imperative mood]] is used only in the present tense.

Verbs have [[verbal prefix]]es, which are also known as [[coverb]]s. Most of them define direction of movement: ''lemegy'' "goes down", ''felmegy'' "goes up". Some verbal prefixes give an [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] to the verb, such as the prefix ''meg-'', which generally marks [[telicity]].

Vowel harmony also plays a major role in verb conjugations.  All Hungarian verb conjugations (as well as postpositions and possessive suffixes, for that matter) can be thought of as 'templates' into which vowels are inserted. Based on the nature of a verb's infinitive, which always ends in '-ni', one can create a generic 'template', which has mostly consonants. The vowels are then inserted into the 'template' according to the rules of vowel harmony, based on the categorization of the vowel in the verb root (front, back, rounded, unrounded).

===Word order===
The neutral word order is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO). However, Hungarian, a [[topic-prominent language]], has a [[word order]] that depends not only on syntax but also on the [[topic-comment]] structure of the sentence (for example, what aspect is assumed to be known and what is emphasized).

A Hungarian sentence generally has the following order: topic, comment (or focus), verb and the rest.

The topic shows that the proposition is only for that particular thing or aspect, and it implies that the proposition is not true for some others. For example, in "''Az almát János látja".'' ('It is John who sees the apple'. Literally 'The apple John sees.'), the apple is in the topic, implying that other objects may be seen by not him but other people (the pear may be seen by Peter). The topic part may be empty.

The focus shows the new information for the listeners that may not have been known or that their knowledge must be corrected. For example, "Én vagyok az apád". ('I am your father'. Literally, 'It is I who am your father'.), from the movie ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', the pronoun I (''én'') is in the focus and implies that it is new information, and the listener thought that someone else is his father.

Although Hungarian is sometimes described as having free word order, different word orders are generally not interchangeable, and the neutral order is not always correct to use. Also, the intonation is also different with different topic-comment structures. The topic usually has a rising intonation, the focus having a falling intonation. In the following examples, the topic is marked with italics, and the focus (comment) is marked with boldface.
*János látja az almát. - 'John sees the apple'. Neutral sentence.
*''János'' '''látja''' az almát. - 'John '''sees''' the apple'. (Peter may not see the apple.)
*'''János''' látja az ''almát''. - 'It is John who sees the apple'. (The listener may have thought that it is Peter.)
*''János''''' az almát '''látja. - 'What John sees is the apple'. (It is the apple, not the pear, that John specifically sees. However, Peter may see the pear.)
*''Az almát''''' látja''' János. - 'It is the apple that is seen by John'. (The pear may not be seen by John, but it may be smelled, for example.)
*''Az almát''''' János''' látja. - 'It is by John that the apple is seen'. (It is not seen by Peter, but the pear may be seen by Peter, for example.)

==Politeness==
{{Main article|T–V distinction#Hungarian}}

Hungarian has a four-tiered system for expressing levels of politeness. From highest to lowest:

*''Ön'' (''önözés''): Use of this form in speech shows respect towards the person addressed, but it is also the common way of speaking in official texts and business communications. Here "you", the second person, is grammatically addressed in the third person.
*''Maga'' (''magázás'', ''magázódás''): Use of this form serves to show that the speakers wish to distance themselves from the person they address. A boss could also address a subordinate as ''maga''. Aside from the different [[pronoun]] it is grammatically the same as "''önözés''".
*''Néni/bácsi'' (''tetszikezés''): This is a somewhat affectionate way of expressing politeness and is grammatically the same as "''önözés''" or "''magázódás''", but adds a certain verb in auxiliary role "''tetszik''" ("like") to support the main verb of the sentence. For example, children are supposed to address adults who are not parent, close friends or close relatives by using "''tetszik''" ("you like"): "''Hogy vagy?''" ("How are you?") here becomes "''Hogy tetszik lenni?''" ("How do you like to be?"). The elderly, especially women, are generally addressed this way, even by adults.
*''Te'' (''tegezés'', ''tegeződés'' or ''pertu'', [[per tu]] from [[Latin]]): Used generally, i.e. with persons with whom none of the above forms of politeness is required, and, in religious contexts, to address [[God]]. The highest rank, the [[king]], was traditionally addressed "per tu" by all, peasants and noblemen alike, though with Hungary not having had any crowned king since 1918, this practice survives only in folk tales and children's stories. Use of "''tegezés''" in the media and advertisements has become more frequent since the early 1990s. It is informal and is normally used in families, among friends, colleagues, among young people, and adults speaking to children; it can be compared to addressing somebody by their first name in English. Perhaps prompted by the widespread use of English (a language without [[T–V distinction]] [[thou|in most contemporary dialects]]) on the Internet, "''tegezés''" is also becoming the standard way to address people over the Internet, regardless of politeness.

The four-tiered system has somewhat been eroded due to the recent expansion of "''tegeződés''".

Some anomalies emerged with the arrival of multinational companies who have addressed their customers in the ''te'' (least polite) form right from the beginning of their presence in Hungary. A typical example is the Swedish furniture shop [[IKEA]], whose web site and other publications address the customers in ''te'' form. When a news site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kanizsaujsag.hu/hirek/8351/miert-tegezik-a-magyarokat-a-multik/|title=Miért tegezik a magyarokat a multik? - Kanizsa Újság|first=Kanizsa|last=Ujsag|website=Kanizsaujsag.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked IKEA—using the ''te'' form—why they address their customers this way, IKEA's PR Manager explained in his answer—using the ''ön'' form—that their way of communication reflects IKEA's open-mindedness and the Swedish culture. However IKEA in France use the most polite (''vous'') form. Another example is the communication of Telenor (a mobile network operator) towards its customers. Telenor chose to communicate towards business customers in the polite ''ön'' form while all other customers are addressed in the less polite ''te'' form.

Giving an accurate estimate for the total word count is difficult, since it is hard to define what to call "a word" in [[agglutination|agglutinating]] languages, due to the existence of affixed words and compound words. To have a meaningful definition of compound words, we have to exclude such compounds whose meaning is the mere sum of its elements. The largest dictionaries from Hungarian to another language contain 120,000 words and phrases&lt;ref name="kenesei-p77"&gt;''A nyelv és a nyelvek'' ("Language and languages"), edited by István Kenesei. Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-05-7959-6}}, p. 77)&lt;/ref&gt; (but this may include redundant phrases as well, because of translation issues). The new desk lexicon of the Hungarian language contains 75,000 words&lt;ref name="kenesei-p77" /&gt; and the Comprehensive Dictionary of Hungarian Language (to be published in 18 volumes in the next twenty years) will contain 110,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-nyelv.hu/enyelv.php?page=hir_elem.php~id=41 The first two volumes of the 20-volume series were introduced on 13 November, 2006, at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417043907/http://www.e-nyelv.hu/enyelv.php?page=hir_elem.php~id=41 |date=2008-04-17 }} (in Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt; The default Hungarian lexicon is usually estimated to comprise 60,000 to 100,000 words.&lt;ref name="nadasdy-interview"&gt;[http://2000magyar.mindenkinet.hu/vendegszoba/tudomany/20031126amagyar.html?pIdx=3 "Hungarian is not difficult"] (interview with [[Ádám Nádasdy]])&lt;/ref&gt; (Independently of specific languages, speakers actively use at most 10,000 to 20,000 words,&lt;ref name="kenesei-p86"&gt;''A nyelv és a nyelvek'' ("Language and languages"), edited by István Kenesei. Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-05-7959-6}}, p. 86)&lt;/ref&gt; with an average intellectual using 25–30 thousand words.&lt;ref name="nadasdy-interview" /&gt;) However, all the Hungarian lexemes collected from technical texts, dialects etc. would all together add up to 1,000,000 words.&lt;ref name="kenesei-pp76-86"&gt;''A nyelv és a nyelvek'' ("Language and languages"), edited by István Kenesei. Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-05-7959-6}}, pp. 76 and 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of the Lexicon can be organized using [[word-bushes]]. (See an example on the right.) The words in these bushes share a common root, are related through inflection, derivation and compounding, and are usually broadly related in meaning.

The basic vocabulary shares some hundreds word roots with other [[Uralic languages]] like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Khanty language|Khanty]]. Examples of such include the verb ''él'' 'live' (Finnish ''elää''&lt;ref name=Helsinki&gt;{{cite web|title="Related words" in Finnish and Hungarian|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~jolaakso/f-h-ety.html|publisher=Helsinki University Bulletin|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the numbers ''kettő'' 'two', ''három'' 'three', ''négy'' 'four' (cf. [[Mansi language|Mansi]] китыг ''kitig'', хурум ''khurum'', нила ''nila'',
[[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''kaksi, kolme, neljä'',&lt;ref name=Helsinki/&gt; [[Estonian language|Estonian]] ''kaks, kolm, neli'', ), as well as ''víz'' 'water', ''kéz'' 'hand', ''vér'' 'blood', ''fej'' 'head' (cf. Finnish&lt;ref name=Helsinki/&gt; and Estonian ''vesi, käsi, veri'', Finnish ''pää'',&lt;ref name=Helsinki/&gt; Estonian ''pea'' or ''pää'').

Words for elementary kinship and nature are more Ugric, less [[Oghur languages|r-Turkic]] and less Slavic. Agricultural words are about 50% r-Turkic and 50% Slavic; pastoral terms are more r-Turkic, less Ugric and less Slavic. Finally, Christian and state terminology is more Slavic and less r-Turkic. The Slavic is most probably proto-Slovakian and/or -Slovenian. This is easily understood in the Uralic paradigm, proto-Magyars were first similar to Ob-Ugors who were mainly hunters, fishers &amp; gatherers, but with some horses, too. Then they accultured to Bulgarian r-Turks, so the older layer of agriculture words (wine, beer, wheat, barley &amp;c.) are purely r-Turkic, and also lots of termini of statesmanship &amp; religion were, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmki.kfki.hu/~lukacs/DETREHUN.htm|title=PROTO-MAGYAR TEXTS FROM THE MIDDLE OF 1st MILLENIUM&lt;!--sic--&gt;?|website=Rmki.kfki.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for a few Latin and Greek loan-words, these differences are unnoticed even by native speakers; the words have been entirely adopted into the Hungarian lexicon. There are an increasing number of English loan-words, especially in technical fields.

Another source&lt;ref name="Halukinen-p307"&gt;''The Structure and Development of the Finnish Language'', The Uralic and Altaic Series: 1960–1993 V.1-150, By Denis Sinor, John R. Krueger, Lauri Hakulinen, Gustav Bayerle, Translated by John R. Krueger, Compiled by Gustav Bayerle, Contributor Denis Sinor, Published by Routledge, 1997
{{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7007-0380-7}}, 383 pages. p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; differs in that loanwords in Hungarian are held to constitute about 45% of bases in the language. Although the lexical percentage of native words in Hungarian is 55%, their use accounts for 88.4% of all words used (the percentage of loanwords used being just 11.6%). Therefore, the history of Hungarian has come, especially since the 19th century, to favor neologisms from original bases, whilst still having developed as many terms from neighboring languages in the lexicon.

===Word formation===
Words can be compounds or derived.  Most derivation is with suffixes, but there is a small set of derivational prefixes as well.

====Compounds====
Compounds have been present in the language since the [[Proto-Uralic]] era. Numerous ancient compounds transformed to base words during the centuries. Today, compounds play an important role in vocabulary.

A good example is the word ''arc'':

:: ''orr'' (nose) + ''száj'' (mouth) → ''orca'' (face) (colloquial until the end of the 19th century and still in use in some dialects) &gt; ''arc'' (face)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetismeret.hu/?id=3.2 |title=It's written in chapter Testrészek |publisher=Nemzetismeret.hu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds are made up of two base words: the first is the prefix, the latter is the suffix. A compound can be ''subordinative'': &lt;!-- subordinative is "alárendelő" in Hungarian; it was rather coined by me. I can't find *ANY* reference on this in English. If you can, please translate alárendelő properly. Other "Hunglish" words include subjective, objective, determinative, adjunctive and coordinative. --&gt; the prefix is in logical connection with the suffix. If the prefix is the subject of the suffix, the compound is generally classified as a [[subjective case|subjective]] one. There are [[objective case|objective]], [[determiner (linguistics)|determinative]], and [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]ive compounds as well. Some examples are given below:

: Subjective:
:: ''menny'' (heaven) + ''dörög'' (rumble) → ''mennydörög'' (thundering)
:: ''Nap'' (Sun) + ''sütötte'' (lit by) → ''napsütötte'' (sunlit)
: Objective:
:: ''fa'' (tree, wood) + ''vágó'' (cutter) → ''favágó'' (lumberjack, literally "woodcutter")
: Determinative:
:: ''új'' (new) + ''já'' (modification of ''-vá, -vé'' a suffix meaning "making it to something")  + ''építés'' (construction) → ''újjáépítés'' (reconstruction, literally "making something to be new by construction")
: Adjunctive:
:: ''sárga'' (yellow) + ''réz'' (copper) → ''sárgaréz'' (brass)

According to current orthographic rules, a subordinative compound word has to be written as a single word, without spaces; however, if the length of a compound of three or more words (not counting one-syllable verbal prefixes) is seven or more [[syllables]] long  (not counting case suffixes), a hyphen must be inserted at the appropriate boundary to ease the determination of word boundaries for the reader.

Other compound words are ''coordinatives'': there is no concrete relation between the prefix and the suffix. Subcategories include word duplications (to emphasise the meaning; ''olykor-olykor''
'really occasionally'), twin words (where a base word and a distorted form of it makes up a compound: ''gizgaz'', where the suffix 'gaz' means 'weed' and the prefix ''giz'' is the distorted form; the compound itself means 'inconsiderable weed'), and such compounds which have meanings, but neither their prefixes, nor their suffixes make sense (for example, ''hercehurca'' 'complex, obsolete procedures').

A compound also can be made up by multiple (i.e., more than two) base words: in this case, at least one word element, or even both the prefix and the suffix is a compound. Some examples:

: ''elme'' [mind; standalone base] + (''gyógy'' [medical] + ''intézet'' [institute]) → ''elmegyógyintézet'' ([[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]])
: (''hadi'' [militarian] + ''fogoly'' [prisoner]) + (''munka'' [work] + ''tábor'' [camp]) → ''hadifogoly-munkatábor'' (work camp of prisoners of war)

===Noteworthy lexical items===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

====Points of the compass====
Hungarian words for the points of the compass are directly derived from the position of the [[Sun]] during the [[day]] in the [[Northern hemisphere]].

*North = észak (from "éj(szaka)", 'night'), as the Sun never shines from the North
*South = dél ('noon'), as the Sun shines from the South at noon
*East = kelet ('rise'), as the Sun rises in the East
*West = nyugat ('set'), as the Sun sets in the West

====Two words for "red"====
&lt;!-- Must this "red" issue really be this long? --&gt;

There are two basic words for "red" in Hungarian: "piros" and "vörös" (variant: "veres"; compare with Estonian "verev" or Finnish "punainen"). (They are basic in the sense that one is not a sub-type of the other, as the English "scarlet" is of "red".) The word "vörös" is related to "vér", meaning "blood" (Finnish and Estonian "veri"). When they refer to an actual difference in colour (as on a colour chart), "vörös" usually refers to the deeper (darker and/or more red and less orange) hue of red. In English similar differences exist between "scarlet"  and "red". While many languages have multiple [[colour name|names for this colour]], often Hungarian scholars assume this is unique in recognizing two shades of red as separate and distinct "[[folk colour]]s".&lt;ref name="basiccolor"&gt;Berlin, B and Kay, P (1969). "Basic Color Terms." Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the two words are also used independently of the above in [[collocation]]s. "Piros" is learned by children first, as it is generally used to describe inanimate, artificial things, or things seen as cheerful or neutral, while "vörös" typically refers to animate or natural things (biological, geological, physical and astronomical objects), as well as serious or emotionally charged subjects.

When the rules outlined above are in contradiction, typical collocations usually prevail. In some cases where a typical collocation does not exist, the use of either of the two words may be equally adequate.

Examples:
*Expressions where "red" typically translates to "piros": a red road sign, red traffic lights, the red line of [[Budapest Metro]], red (now called express) bus lines in Budapest, a holiday shown in red in the calendar, ruddy complexion, the red nose of a clown, some red flowers (those of a neutral nature, e.g. tulips), red peppers and paprika, red card suits (hearts and diamonds), red stripes on a flag (but the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and its variants translate to "vörös"), etc.
*Expressions where "red" typically translates to "vörös": [[Red Sea]], [[Red Square]], [[Red Army]], [[Red Baron]], [[Erik the Red]], [[red wine]], red carpet (for receiving important guests), red hair or beard, red lion (the mythical animal), the [[Red Cross]], the novel ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', [[redshift]], [[red giant]], [[red blood cell]]s, [[red oak]], some red flowers (those with passionate connotations, e.g. roses), red fox, names of ferric and other red minerals, red copper, rust, red phosphorus, the colour of blushing with anger or shame, the red nose of an alcoholic (in contrast with that of a clown, see above), the red posterior of a baboon, red meat, regular onion (not the red onion, which is "lila"), [[litmus test|litmus]] paper (in acid), cities, countries, or other political entities associated with [[leftist]] movements (e.g. [[Red Vienna]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Red Russia]]), etc.

====Kinship terms====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The Hungarian words for brothers and sisters are differentiated based upon relative age. There is also a general word for "sibling": ''testvér'', from ''test'' "body" and ''vér'' "blood"; ''i.e.'', originating from the same body and blood.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ||younger||elder||unspecified&lt;br&gt;relative age
|-
|brother||''öcs&lt;!--yes, it's written as "öcs", not "öccs"--&gt;''||''báty&lt;!-- it is written as "báty", not "bátya" --&gt;''||''fivér'' or&lt;br&gt;''fiútestvér''
|-
|sister||''húg''||''nővér''||''nővér'' or&lt;br&gt;''lánytestvér''
|-
|sibling|| &lt;small&gt;''kistestvér''&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;''(nagytestvér)''&lt;/small&gt; ||''testvér''
|}

(There used to be a separate word for "elder sister", ''néne'',&lt;!-- NEM NÉNI, HANEM NÉNE, E-VEL--&gt; but it has become obsolete [except to mean "aunt" in some dialects] and has been replaced by the generic word for "sister".)

In addition, there are separate prefixes for several ancestors and descendants:

{| class="wikitable"
|parent||grandparent||great-&lt;br&gt;grandparent||great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandparent||great-great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandparent
|great-great-great-great-
grandparent
|-
||''szülő''||''nagyszülő''||''déd(nagy)szülő''||''ük(nagy)szülő''||''szép(nagy)szülő''&lt;br&gt;(OR ''ük-ük(nagy)szülő'')
|''ó(nagy)szülő''
(OR ''ük-ük-ük(nagy)szülő)''
|-
|child||grandchild||great-&lt;br&gt;grandchild||great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandchild||great-great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandchild
|great-great-great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandchild
|-
|''gyerek''||''unoka''||''dédunoka''||''ükunoka''||''szépunoka''&lt;br&gt;(OR ''ük-ükunoka'')
|''óunoka''&lt;br&gt;(OR ''ük-ük-ükunoka'')
|}

The words for "boy" and "girl" are applied with possessive suffixes. Nevertheless, the terms are differentiated with different declension or lexemes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ||boy/girl||(his/her)&lt;br&gt;son/daughter||(his/her)&lt;br&gt;lover, partner
|-
|male||''fiú''||''fia''||''fiúja/barátja''
|-
|female||''lány''||''lánya''||''barátnője''
|}

''Fia'' is only used in this, irregular possessive form; it has no nominative on its own (see [[inalienable possession]]). However, the word ''fiú'' can also take the regular suffix, in which case the resulting word ''(fiúja)'' will refer to a lover or partner (boyfriend), rather than a male offspring.

The word ''fiú'' (boy) is also often noted as an extreme example of the ability of the language to add suffixes to a word, by forming ''fiaiéi'', adding vowel-form suffixes only, where the result is quite a frequently used word:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
| fiú || boy
|-
| fia || his/her son
|-
| fiai || his/her sons
|-
| fiáé || his/her son's (singular object)
|-
| fiáéi || his/her son's (plural object)
|-
| fiaié || his/her sons' (singular object)
|-
| fiaiéi || his/her sons' (plural object)
|}

====Extremely long words====
*''megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért''
: Partition to root and suffixes with explanations:
{|class="wikitable"
|-
| meg- || verb prefix; in this case, it means "completed"
|-
| szent || holy (the word root)
|-
| -ség || like English "-ness", as in "holiness"
|-
| -t(e)len || variant of "-tlen", noun suffix expressing the lack of something; like English "-less", as in "useless"
|-
| -ít || constitutes a transitive verb from an adjective
|-
| -het || expresses possibility; somewhat similar to the English modal verbs "may" or "can"
|-
| -(e)tlen || another variant of "-tlen"
|-
| -ség || (see above)
|-
| -es || constitutes an adjective from a noun; like English "-y" as in "witty"
|-
| -ked || attached to an adjective (e.g. "strong"), produces the verb "to pretend to be (strong)" &lt;!-- cf. "okoskodik", "erősködik"; the "-ik" is dropped due to the further suffixes, thus it is better not to mark it in the table --&gt;
|-
| -és || constitutes a noun from a verb; there are various ways this is done in English, e.g. "-ance" in "acceptance"
|-
| -eitek || plural possessive suffix, second-person plural (e.g. "apple" → "your apples", where "your" refers to multiple people)
|-
| -ért || approximately translates to "because of", or in this case simply "for"
|}

: '''Translation:''' "for your [plural] repeated pretending to be indesecrable"&lt;!-- the element "repeated" comes from -ségeskedés-, which can refer to a constant and annoying habit--&gt;

The above word is often considered to be the longest word in Hungarian, although there are longer words like:

* ''legeslegmegszentségteleníttethetetlenebbjeitekként''
:''leges-leg-meg-'''''szent'''''-ség-telen-ít-tet-het-etlen-ebb-je-i-tek-ként''
:"like those of you that are the very least possible to get desecrated"

Words of such length are not used in practice, but when spoken they are easily understood by natives. They were invented to show, in a somewhat facetious way, the ability of the language to form long words (see [[agglutinative language]]). They are not compound words—they are formed by adding a series of one and two-syllable suffixes (and a few prefixes) to a simple root ("szent", saint or holy).
There is virtually no limit for the length of words, but when too many suffixes are added, the meaning of the word becomes less clear, and the word becomes hard to understand, and will work like a riddle even for native speakers.

====Hungarian words in English====
The English word best known as being of Hungarian origin is probably ''[[paprika]]'', from Serbo-Croatian ''papar'' "pepper" and the Hungarian diminutive ''-ka''.  The most common however is ''[[Coach (carriage)|coach]]'', from ''kocsi'', originally ''kocsi szekér'' "car from/in the style of [[Kocs]]".  Others are:

* [[shako]], from ''csákó'', from ''csákósüveg'' "peaked cap"
* [[sabre]], from ''szablya''
* [[wikt:heyduck|heyduck]], from ''hajdúk'', plural of ''hajdú'' "brigand"
* [[tolpatch]], from ''talpas'' "foot-soldier", apparently derived from ''talp'' "[[sole (foot)|sole]]".

==Writing system==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
{{Main article|Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian orthography|Hungarian braille}}
[[File:Tihany 1055.PNG|thumb|The oldest surviving words written in Hungarian, from the founding declaration of the [[Tihany|Benedictine Abbey of Tihany]], 1055. &lt;br&gt; It reads "''feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea''" (in modern Hungarian "''Fehérvárra menő hadi útra''", meaning "''to the military road going to [[Székesfehérvár|Fehérvár]]''")]]
[[File:A 4-es táblája.jpg|thumb|Hungarian language road sign]]

[[File:Codex of munchen - bible in hungarian.jpg|thumb|Medieval Hungarian book (a copy of the [[Hussite Bible]]), 1466]]

The Hungarian language was originally written in right-to-left [[Old Hungarian alphabet|Old Hungarian runes]], superficially similar in appearance to the better-known [[futhark]] runes but unrelated. When [[Stephen I of Hungary]] established the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the year 1000, the old system was gradually discarded in favour of the Latin alphabet and left-to-right order. Although now not used at all in everyday life, the old script is still known and practiced by some enthusiasts.

Modern Hungarian is written using an expanded [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]], and has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] orthography, i.e. pronunciation can generally be predicted from the written language. In addition to the standard letters of the Latin alphabet, Hungarian uses several modified Latin characters to represent the additional vowel sounds of the language. These include letters with acute accents ''(á, é, í, ó, ú)'' to represent long vowels, and umlauts (''ö'' and ''ü'') and their long counterparts [[Double acute accent|''ő'' and ''ű'']] to represent front vowels. Sometimes (usually as a result of a technical glitch on a computer) {{angle bracket|ô}} or {{angle bracket|õ}} is used for {{angle bracket|ő}}, and {{angle bracket|û}} for {{angle bracket|ű}}. This is often due to the limitations of the [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|Latin-1 / ISO-8859-1 code page]]. These letters are not part of the Hungarian language, and are considered misprints. Hungarian can be properly represented with the [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|Latin-2 / ISO-8859-2 code page]], but this [[code page]] is not always available. (Hungarian is the only language using both {{angle bracket|ő}} and {{angle bracket|ű}}.) [[Unicode]] includes them, and so they can be used on the Internet.

Additionally, the letter pairs [[Hungarian ny|{{angle bracket|ny}}]], [[Hungarian ty|{{angle bracket|ty}}]], and [[Hungarian gy|{{angle bracket|gy}}]] represent the palatal consonants {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, {{IPA|/c/}}, and {{IPA|/ɟ/}} (a little like the "d+y" sounds in British "''du''ke" or American "woul''d y''ou")&amp;nbsp;– a bit like saying "d" with the tongue pointing to the [[palate]].

Hungarian uses {{angle bracket|s}} for {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and [[Hungarian sz|{{angle bracket|sz}}]] for {{IPA|/s/}}, which is the reverse of [[Polish language|Polish]] usage. The letter [[Hungarian zs|{{angle bracket|zs}}]] is {{IPA|/ʒ/}} and [[Hungarian cs|{{angle bracket|cs}}]] is {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}. These digraphs are considered single letters in the alphabet. The letter [[Hungarian ly|{{angle bracket|ly}}]] is also a "single letter digraph", but is pronounced like {{IPA|/j/}} (English {{angle bracket|y}}), and appears mostly in old words. The letters [[Hungarian dz|{{angle bracket|dz}}]] and [[Hungarian dzs|{{angle bracket|dzs}}]] {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} are exotic remnants and are hard to find even in longer texts. Some examples still in common use are ''madzag'' ("string"), ''edzeni'' ("to train (athletically)") and ''dzsungel'' ("jungle").

Sometimes additional information is required for partitioning words with digraphs: házszám ("street number") = ''ház'' ("house") + ''szám'' ("number"), not an unintelligible ''házs'' + ''zám''.

Hungarian distinguishes between long and short vowels, with long vowels written with acutes. It also distinguishes between long and short consonants, with long consonants being doubled. For example, ''lenni'' ("to be"), ''hozzászólás'' ("comment"). The digraphs, when doubled, become trigraphs: {{angle bracket|sz}} + {{angle bracket|sz}} = {{angbr|ssz}}, e.g. ''művésszel'' ("with an artist"). But when the digraph occurs at the end of a line, all of the letters are written out. For example, ("with a bus"):
:... ''busz-''
:''szal''...

When the first lexeme of a compound ends in a digraph and the second lexeme starts with the same digraph, both digraphs are written out: ''jegy'' + ''gyűrű'' = ''jegygyűrű'' ("engagement/wedding ring", ''jegy'' means "sign", "mark". The term ''jegyben lenni/járni'' means "to be engaged"; ''gyűrű'' means "ring").

Usually a trigraph is a double digraph, but there are a few exceptions: ''tizennyolc'' ("eighteen") is a concatenation of ''tizen'' + ''nyolc''. There are doubling [[minimal pair]]s: ''tol'' ("push") vs. ''toll'' ("feather" or "pen").

While to English speakers they may seem unusual at first, once the new orthography and pronunciation are learned, written Hungarian is almost completely phonemic (except for etymological spellings and "ly, j" representing {{IPA|/j/}}).

==Word order==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The [[word order]] is basically from general to specific. This is a typical analytical approach and is used generally in Hungarian.

===Name order===
{{Main article|Hungarian names}}
The Hungarian language uses the so-called eastern [[Personal name#Name order|name order]], in which the surname (general, deriving from the family) comes first and the [[given name]] comes last. If a second given name is used, this follows the first given name.

====Hungarian names in foreign languages====
For clarity, in foreign languages Hungarian names are usually represented in the western name order. Sometimes, however, especially in the neighbouring countries of Hungary&amp;nbsp;– where there is a [[Treaty of Trianon|significant Hungarian population]]&amp;nbsp;– the Hungarian name order is retained, as it causes less confusion there.

For an example of foreign use, the birth name of the Hungarian-born physicist, the "father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]" was '''''Teller Ede''''', but he immigrated to the United States in the 1930s and thus became known as '''''[[Edward Teller]]'''''. Prior to the mid-20th century, given names were usually translated along with the name order; this is no longer as common. For example, the pianist uses ''[[András Schiff]]'' when abroad, not ''Andrew Schiff'' (in Hungarian ''Schiff András''). If a second given name is present, it becomes a middle name and is usually written out in full, rather than truncated to an initial.

====Foreign names in Hungarian====
In modern usage, foreign names retain their order when used in Hungarian. Therefore:

*Amikor ''Kiss János'' Los Angelesben volt, látta ''John Travoltá-t.'' (means: When Kiss János was in [[Los Angeles]] he saw John Travolta.)
:The Hungarian name ''Kiss János'' is in the Hungarian name order (''János'' is equivalent to ''John''), but the foreign name ''John Travolta'' remains in the western name order.

Before the 20th century, not only was it common to reverse the order of foreign personalities, they were also "Hungarianised": ''Goethe János Farkas'' (originally [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]). This usage sounds odd today, when only a few well-known personalities are referred to using their Hungarianised names, including ''Verne Gyula'' ([[Jules Verne]]), ''Marx Károly'' ([[Karl Marx]]), ''Kolumbusz Kristóf'' ([[Christopher Columbus]], note that it is also translated in English).

Some native speakers disapprove of this usage; the names of certain historical religious personalities (including popes), however, are always Hungarianised by practically all speakers, such as ''Luther Márton'' ([[Martin Luther]]), ''Husz János'' ([[Jan Hus]]), ''Kálvin János'' ([[John Calvin]]); just like the names of [[monarch]]s, for example the king of Spain, [[Juan Carlos I]] is referred to as ''I. János Károly'' or the queen of the UK, [[Elizabeth II]] is referred to as ''II. Erzsébet''.

[[Japanese names]], which are usually written in western order in the rest of Europe, retain their original order in Hungarian, e. g. ''Kuroszava Akira'' instead of [[Akira Kurosawa]].

====Date and time====
The Hungarian convention for date and time is to go from the generic to the specific: 1. year, 2. month, 3. day, 4. hour, 5. minute, (6. second)

The year and day are always written in [[Arabic numerals]], followed by a [[full stop]]. The month can be written by its full name or can be abbreviated, or even denoted by [[Roman numerals|Roman]] or Arabic numerals. Except for the first case (month written by its full name), the month is followed by a full stop. Usually, when the month is written in letters, there is no leading zero before the day. On the other hand, when the month is written in Arabic numerals, a leading zero is common, but not obligatory. Except at the beginning of a sentence, the name of the month always begins with a lower-case letter.

Hours, minutes, and seconds are separated by a colon (H:m:s). Fractions of a second are separated by a full stop from the rest of the time. Hungary generally uses the [[24-hour clock]] format, but in verbal (and written) communication [[12-hour clock]] format can also be used. See below for usage examples.

Date and time may be separated by a comma or simply written one after the other.

*2008. február 9. 16:23:42 ''or'' 2008. február 9., 16:23:42
*2008. febr. 9.
*2008. 02. 09. ''or'' 2008. 2. 9. (rarely)
*2008. II. 9.

Date separated by [[hyphen]] is also spreading, especially on datestamps. Here&amp;nbsp;– just like the version separated by full stops&amp;nbsp;– leading zeros are in use.

*2008-02-09

When only hours and minutes are written in a sentence (so not only "displaying" time), these parts can be separated by a [[full stop]] (e.g. "Találkozzunk 10.35-kor."&amp;nbsp;– "Let's meet at 10.35."), or it is also regular to write hours in normal size, and minutes put in [[superscript]] (and not necessarily) underlined (e.g. "A találkozó 10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;-kor kezdődik." ''or'' "A találkozó 10&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;35&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;-kor kezdődik."&amp;nbsp;– "The meeting begins at 10.35.").

Also, in verbal and written communication it is common to use "délelőtt" (literally "before noon") and "délután" (lit. "after noon") abbreviated as "de." and "du." respectively. Délelőtt and délután is said or written before the time, e.g. "Délután 4 óra van."&amp;nbsp;– "It's 4 p.m.". However e.g. "délelőtt 5 óra" (should mean "5 a.m.") or "délután 10 óra" (should mean "10 p.m.") are never used, because at these times the sun is not up, instead "hajnal" ("dawn"), "reggel" ("morning"), "este" ("evening") and "éjjel" ("night") is used, however there are no exact rules for the use of these, as everybody uses them according to their habits (e.g. somebody may have woken up at 5 a.m. so he/she says "Reggel 6-kor ettem."&amp;nbsp;– "I had food at ''*morning'' 6.", and somebody woke up at 11 a.m. so he/she says "Hajnali 6-kor még aludtam."&amp;nbsp;– "I was still sleeping at ''*dawn'' 6."). Roughly, these expressions mean these times:
{|class="wikitable"
|-
!Expression!!Approximate time
|-
|Hajnal||4–6 a.m.
|-
|Reggel||6–9 a.m.
|-
|Délelőtt (de.)||9 a.m.&amp;nbsp;– 12 p.m.
|-
|Dél*||=12 p.m. (="noon")
|-
|Délután (du.)||12–6 p.m.
|-
|Este||6–11 p.m.
|-
|Éjjel||11 p.m.&amp;nbsp;– 4 a.m.
|-
|Éjfél*||=12 a.m. (="midnight")
|}
* * "Dél" and "éjfél" mean these exact times, so using time after them is incorrect. So there is '''no''' "Éjfél 0-kor még buliztunk" ("We were still partying at ''*midnight 0''.") or "Dél 12-kor süt a nap." ("The sun shines at ''*noon 12''."). Instead "Éjfél'''kor''' még buliztunk." and "Dél'''ben''' süt a nap." is correct. (More confusingly, one can say "Dél'''i''' 12-kor süt a nap.", meaning "The sun shines at 12 '''of''' noon.", i.e. "The sun shines at 12, which is the 12 of daytime.") "Délen süt a nap" on the other hand means "The sun shines in the south", as Dél means both noon and south.

==== Addresses ====

Although address formatting is increasingly being influenced by standard European conventions, the traditional Hungarian style is:

'''Budapest, Deák Ferenc tér 1. 1052'''

So the order is: 1) settlement (most general), 2) street/square/etc. (more specific), 3) house number (most specific) 4)(HU-)postcode. The house number may be followed by the storey and door numbers. The HU- part before the postcode is only for incoming postal traffic from foreign countries. Addresses on envelopes and postal parcels should be formatted and placed on the right side as follows:

Name of the recipient&lt;br /&gt;
Settlement&lt;br /&gt;
Street address (up to door number if necessary)&lt;br /&gt;
(HU-)postcode

==Vocabulary examples==
''Note: The stress is always placed on the first syllable of each word.  The remaining syllables all receive an equal, lesser stress.  All syllables are pronounced clearly and evenly, even at the end of a sentence, unlike in English.''

[[File:Two people talking.tiff|thumb|Two people talking]]

'''Interaction''' is a kind of [[action (physics)|action]] that occur as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way [[Causality|causal]] effect. A closely related term is [[interconnectivity]], which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomena. ''Interaction'' has different tailored meanings in various [[science]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Changes can also involve interaction.

Casual examples of interaction outside science include:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Communication of any sort, for example two or more people talking to each other, or communication among [[Group (sociology)|groups]], organizations, nations or states: trade, migration, [[International relations|foreign relations]], transportation.
* The [[feedback]] during the operation of a machine such as a computer or tool, for example the interaction between a driver and the position of his or her car on the road: by steering the driver influences this position, by observation this information returns to the driver.

== Physics ==
{{main|Force|Fundamental interaction}}

In [[physics]], a fundamental interaction (depending on the nature of the interaction, it might also be called a fundamental force) is a process by which [[elementary particle]]s interact with each other. An interaction is often described as a physical [[quantum field theory|field]], and is mediated by the exchange of [[gauge boson]]s between particles. For example, the interaction of [[electric charge|charged]] particles takes place through the mediation of [[electromagnetic field]]s, whereas [[beta decay]] occurs by means of the [[weak interaction]]. An interaction is fundamental when it cannot be described in terms of other interactions.  There are four known fundamental interactions in nature: The  [[quantum electrodynamics|electromagnetic]],  [[Strong nuclear force|strong]], [[Weak interaction|weak]] and  [[general relativity|gravitational]] interactions. The weak and electromagnetic interactions are unified in  [[electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]], which is unified with the strong force in the [[standard model]].

=== Biochemistry ===

====Molecular biology====
{{Main|List of protein interactions|Interactome}}
In [[molecular biology]], the knowledge on [[gene]]/[[protein]] interaction among themselves and with their [[metabolite]]s is referred to as [[molecular pathway]]s.

==== Medicine and pharmacology ====
{{main|Drug interaction}}
{{also|Poly drug use#Dangerous interactions}}

In [[medicine]], most [[medication]]s can be safely used with other medicines, but particular combinations of medicines need to be monitored for interactions, often by the pharmacist. Interactions between medications fall generally into one of two main categories:
# [[pharmacodynamic]] : Involving the actions of the two interacting drugs.
# [[pharmacokinetic]] : Involving the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of one or both of the interacting drugs upon the other.

In terms of [[efficacy]], there can be three types of interactions between medications: additive, synergistic, and antagonistic.
* Additive interaction means the effect of two chemicals is equal to the sum of the effect of the two chemicals taken separately. This is usually due to the two chemicals acting on the body via same or similar mechanism. Examples are [[aspirin]] and [[motrin]], [[alcohol]] and [[depressant]], [[tranquilizer]] and [[painkiller]].
* [[Synergistic]] interaction means that the effect of two chemicals taken together is greater than the sum of their separate effect at the same doses. An example is [[pesticide]] and [[fertilizer]]; the biological effect is devastating.
* [[Antagonism (chemistry)|Antagonistic interaction]] means that the effect of two chemicals is actually less than the sum of the effect of the two drugs taken independently of each other. This is because the second chemical increases the excretion of the first, or even directly blocks its toxic actions. Antagonism forms the basis for [[antidote]]s of poisonings.

==Biology and genetics==
{{Main|Biological interaction|Gene–environment interaction|Cell–cell interaction}}
[[Geneticist]]s work with a number of different genetic interaction modes to characterize how the combination of two [[mutation]]s affect (or does not affect) the [[phenotype]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

noninteractive, synthetic, asynthetic, suppressive, epistatic, conditional, additive, single-nonmonotonic and double-nonmonotonic.
Further characterizations is enhancement interaction and nonadditive interaction. [[Biosemiotic]]ists investigate sign-mediated interactions within and between organisms that underlie syntactic, pragmatic and semantic rules.

The word [[epistasis]] is also used for genetic interaction in some contexts.

== Communications ==
{{main|Interactivity}}

== Sociology ==
{{main|Social interaction}}

In [[sociology]], [[social interaction]] is a dynamic, changing sequence of [[social action]]s between individuals (or groups) who modify their actions and reactions due to the actions by their interaction partner(s). Social interactions can be differentiated into accidental, repeated, regular, and regulated. Social interactions form the basis of [[social relation]]s.

== Statistics ==
{{main|Interaction (statistics)}}

In [[statistics]], an '''interaction''' is a term in a [[statistical model]] in which the effect of two, or more, variables is not simply additive.

=== An example from statistics applied to health science ===
If we were examining the effect of two variables, gender and [[premature birth]], on health outcomes, we would describe any difference in health outcome scores between genders as a [[main effect]]. Similarly any difference in scores of full term/premature birth would be described as a main effect. The presence of an interaction effect implies that the effect of gender on health outcome varies as a function of premature birth status.

{{main|Human–computer interaction}}
{{see also|Interaction cost|Interactive computation|Interface (computing)}}

== Media art==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Electronic learning]] --&gt;
In [[Mass media|media]], [[interactivity]] is a feature of the media in question and as digital technology becomes more accessible to the masses interest in interactivity is increasing and becoming a cultural trend especially in the arts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5770">The '''John W. Kluge Prize''' for the Study of Humanity is awarded since 2003 for lifetime achievement in the humanities and social sciences to celebrate the importance of the Intellectual Arts for the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.loc.gov/loc/kluge/prize/|title= John W. Kluge Prize for Achievement in the Study of Humanity|publisher= Library of Congress|accessdate = 21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The prize is awarded by the [[John W. Kluge Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]].  The Prize is conferred in a ceremony in the Great Hall of the Jefferson Building, attended by American political leaders to dramatize America's commitment to these areas of human inquiry. The Prize winner will give an address, will remain in residence at the Library of Congress for a short time thereafter, and will be expected to have some informal interaction with Members of the [[United States Congress]].

Members of the [[Kluge Scholars' Council|Scholars' Council]], as described in the appended Charter of the John W. Kluge Center, and holders of the Kluge Chairs will be among those offering recommendations to the Librarian of Congress concerning recipients of the Kluge Prize.

Endowed by Library benefactor [[John Kluge|John W. Kluge]], the Kluge prize rewards lifetime achievement in the wide range of disciplines not covered by the [[Nobel Prize]]s. Such disciplines include history, philosophy, politics, anthropology, sociology, religion, criticism in the arts and humanities, and linguistics. The award is at the financial level of the Nobel awards.

The prize is international; the recipient may be of any nationality, writing in any language. The main criterion for a recipient of the Kluge Prize is deep intellectual accomplishment in the human sciences. The recipient's body of work should evidence growth in maturity and range over the years. The recipient will have demonstrated unusual distinction within a given area of inquiry and across disciplines in the human sciences. Significantly, the recipient's writings should be, in large part, understandable and important for those involved in public affairs.

==Candidates==

In order to ensure consideration of as wide a pool of candidates as possible, in 2001, the Librarian of Congress solicited nominations for the Kluge Prize from a broad range of individuals knowledgeable about the humanities and social sciences in colleges, universities, and research institutions across the globe, as well as from independent scholars and writers.

In 2002, the Librarian of the Library of Congress called upon a Scholars' Council of 20 preeminent scholars from around the world to consider the range of nominations. The council had been established to offer suggestions and advice on the choice of scholars to study at the John W. Kluge Center at the Library.

Based upon extensive research and further recommendations, the director of the Office of Scholarly Programs prepared a list of candidates for the Librarian's consideration in 2003. In addition to soliciting numerous outside reviews for each of these scholars, the Librarian called upon an expert staff of curators in the Library to conduct extensive biographical and bibliographical research as well as to gather published reviews and discussions of each candidate's work, prepare abstracts of translations of key articles from material available only in foreign languages, and provide a brief characterization and evaluation of the scholarly corpus of the candidate.

Finally, detailed dossiers on each candidate were sent to the members of the Final Kluge Prize Review Panel. Deliberating at the Library, this panel submitted its recommendations to the Librarian, who then made the final decision.

'''The "Lady of the Mountain" (Fjallkona)''' is the female incarnation ([[national personification]]) of [[Iceland]].

== History in Iceland ==
The personification of a nation as a woman was widespread in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe.&lt;ref name="visindavefur.is"&gt;[http://visindavefur.is/?id=6696 Árni Björnsson, 'Hver er uppruni fjallkonunnar og hvaða hlutverki gegnir hún?', ''Vísindavefurinn'' 22.6.2007. viewed 5.6.2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest image of Iceland personified as a woman seems to appear first in association with the poem ''Ofsjónir við jarðarför Lovísu drottningar 1752'' ('Visions at the funeral of [[Louise of Great Britain|Queen Louise]], 1752') by [[Eggert Ólafsson]] (1752), but this image does not survive.&lt;ref name="visindavefur.is"/&gt;

The word ''fjallkona'' is attested for the first time in the poem ''Eldgamla Ísafold'' by [[Bjarni Thorarensen]] from the first decade of the nineteenth century. From that moment onwards she became a well-known symbol in Icelandic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visindavefur.is/?id=6696 Árni Björnsson, 'Hver er uppruni fjallkonunnar og hvaða hlutverki gegnir hún?', ''Vísindavefurinn'' 22.6.2007. viewed 5.6.2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving image of "the lady of the mountains" was published in the last volume of an English translation of Icelandic folk-tales by [[Eiríkr Magnússon|Eiríkur Magnússon]] and [[G. E. J. Powell]], ''Icelandic Legends, Collected by [[Jón Árnason (author)|Jón Arnason]]'' (1864–66). It is the work of the German painter [[Johann Baptist Zwecker]], who drew it to specifications provided by Eiríkur. Eiríkur described the picture in a letter to [[Jón Sigurðsson]] (11 April 1866) thus:

:: Konumyndin á að tákna Ísland, því hefur hún ískórónu á höfði, sem eldar gjósa upp úr. Á öxl hennar er hrafninn, Íslands einkennilegasti fugl, Óðins forni vin og skáldanna eftirlætisgoð, fréttafugl mikill og margkunnugur. Yfir sjónum flögrar már, en yfir brimsævi tíma og sögu berast rúnakefli að landi eða upp í fang konunni, og hefur hún þegar náð einu þeirra. Þetta átti svo sem að vera symbolum (tákn) bókmenntalandsins og sögulandsins okkar. Yfir er nótt og stirndur himinn og máninn uppi. Á bak við eru fjöll, tunglroðin á eggjunum.

:: The picture of the woman is to represent Iceland, thus she has a crown of ice on her head, from which fires erupt. On her shoulder is the raven, Iceland's most characteristic bird, Óðinn's ancient friend and the favourite of poets, a great and knowledgeable carrier of news. Over the seas flutters a seagull, but across the surf of time and history are borne rune-staves to the land and up into the embrace of the woman, and she has picked one of them up. This is intended as a symbol of our land of literature and history. It is night, with a starry sky and the moon up. Behind are mountains, moonlight on the ridges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/Jonas/Heilsa/Heilsa-Arnason.html Description of the drawing of J.B. Zwecker by Eiríkur Magnússon in a letter to Jón Sigurðsson.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also very popular is the image designed by [[Benedikt Sveinbjarnarson Gröndal]] on a memorial card of the National holiday in 1874. Since the establishment of the Icelandic republic in 1944 it has been traditional for a woman in traditional dress to read the poem on the national holiday (17 June).&lt;ref name="visindavefur.is"/&gt;

The idea of the ''fjallkonan'' as motherland was a counterweight to the idea of the Danish King as 'father' in nineteenth-century Iceland under Danish rule, and after independence in 1944 became one of the images through which feminism and the idea of powerful women, such as Iceland's first female president [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]], were made to seem a natural part of Icelandic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Inga Dóra Björnsdóttir, 'The Mountain Woman and the Presidency', in ''Images of Contemporary Iceland: Everyday Lives and Global Contexts'', ed. by Gísli Pálsson and E. Paul Durrenberger (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1996), pp. 106-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History in Canada ==
The image of the ''fjallkonan'' has also been prominent among [[New Iceland|Vestur Íslendingar]] in Canada. A woman dressed as the Lady of the Mountain first appeared at the Iceland Days in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada in 1924. Here too, the ''fjallkona'' has been deployed to promote feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Brydon, 'Mother to her Distant Children: The Icelandic ''Fjallkona'' in Canada', in Undisciplined Women: Tradition and Culture in Canada, ed. by Pauline Greenhill and Diane Tye (Montreal: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 1997), pp. 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lamahalot''' or '''Solorese''' people are an indigenous tribe located on [[Flores|Flores Island]], [[Indonesia]], and some smaller islands around it ([[Solor]], [[Adonara]], and [[Lomblen]]). Lamaholot people speak the [[Lamaholot language]] with different dialects, the number of speakers counts between 150,000 and 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Grammar of Lamaholot, Eastern Indonesia: The Morphology And Syntax of The Lewoingu Dialect |first1=Kunio |last1=Nishiyama|first2=Herman |last2=Kelen |year=2007|publisher=Lincom Europa|isbn=978-3-89586-714-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamaholot people's famous traditional dance is a war dance known as ''Hedung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Peku Djawang|title=Mosaik Pariwisata Nusa Tenggara Timur|year=1987|publisher=Dinas Pariwisata Propinsi Daerah Tingkat I Nusa Tenggara Timur|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the 16th century the territory of the Lamaholot was the object of the claims of the Sultanate of Makassar, Portugal and the Netherlands. Until the middle of the 19th century Lamaholot were under the Portuguese colonial administration, then under the Netherlands in 1859-1942, and until the middle of the 20th century they were formally submitted to the Rajas of [[Larantuka]] and [[Adonara]].

==Language==
The [[Lamaholot language]] belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] of the [[Austronesian languages]] family. The language is divided into many dialects, the most common are the Western Lamaholot (Muang and Pukaunu), Lamaholot (Taka, Levotaka, Mandiri Island), and Western Solor. Language is a means for wide communication between the numerous ethnic groups living in the area around [[Larantuka]] and [[Solor]]. On the island of [[Flores]], the Lamaholot people speak Bahasa Nagi ([[Larantuka Malay]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Nelson|title=Attending to Early Modern Women: Conflict and Concord|year=2013|publisher=University of Delaware|isbn=16-114-9445-1|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mandarut language, a dialect of the [[Malay language]].

==Religion==
Most Lamaholot people are [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12965/ID |title=Lamaholot people |publisher=[[Joshua Project]] |accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them are [[Muslim]]s or devotees of a traditional [[monotheistic religion]] who believe in a god whom they call ''Lera Wulan Tanah Ekan'' (The combined power of the Sun, Moon, and Earth),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.tempo.co/read/news/2015/11/21/204720927/wisata-pantai-legenda-naga-kepala-tujuh-di-laut-flores |title=WISATA PANTAI: Legenda Naga Kepala Tujuh di Laut Flores |author=Wayan Agus Purnomo |publisher=Tempo |date=21 November 2015 |accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Urte Undine Frömming|title=Naturkatastrophen: kulturelle Deutung und Verarbeitung|year=2006|publisher=Campus Verlag|isbn=35-933-8004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; death cults and shamanism. The Lamaholot people also preserve rich verbal and musical folklore.

==Family==
Traditional social organization is strictly based on patrilineal birth.&lt;ref name="TMOMP"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Meaning of Marriage Payments |author=John L. Comaroff |year=1980|publisher=Acad. Press|isbn=01-218-3450-6|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also maintained a characteristic of descent line that divides into "origin groups" or [[Phratry|phratries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Authoritative Discourse: Language and Ideology in Adonara, Eastern Indonesia |author=Nancy Melissa Lutz |year=1986|publisher=University Microfilms|isbn=|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriages occur across on the [[matrilateral]] side, with a marital settlement of [[Patrilocal residence]].&lt;ref name="TMOMP"/&gt; The family unit is small.

==Economy==
The main occupation is manual tropical farming. Dominant agricultural crops are such as corn, dried rice, millet, yam, cassava, sweet potato, legumes, pumpkin, various fruits and vegetables. Fishing is developed on the coast. Livestock plays an auxiliary role. The main dietary food includes boiled corn and rice with vegetable and fish seasonings. Residents of a number of coastal villages specialize in intermediary trade in textiles, clothing and agricultural implements. In the Lamalera village on [[Lomblen]] island and [[Lamakera, Indonesia|Lamakera]] village on [[Solor]] island, whaling is developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecology of Nusa Tenggara |author=Kathryn Monk &amp; Yance De Fretes |year=2012|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=14-629-0506-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifestyle==
Traditional cumulus settlements (in the mountains) are surrounded by a dense hedge of corals, houses are skeleton-pillared, rectangular, with a high steep roof. Before the beginning of the 20th century, there were long houses. Modern settlements are coastal farms, the dwelling is designed for a small family. They also adopt Malay-style clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Народы и религии мира. Энциклопедия |author=Бернова А. А. &amp; Членов М.

'''''Lebensphilosophie''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈleːbn̩s.filozoˌfiː|lang}}, "[[philosophy of life]]") is a philosophical [[school of thought]] which emphasises the [[meaning of life|meaning]], value and purpose of life as the foremost focus of philosophy.&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;{{cite book|first=Jason |last=Gaiger |chapter=Lebensphilosophie |title=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |editor1-first=Edward |editor1-last=Craig |publisher=Routledge |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Inspired by the critique of [[rationalism]] in the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''Lebensphilosophie'' emerged in 19th-century Germany as a reaction to the rise of [[positivism]] and the theoretical focus prominent in much of post-Kantian philosophy.&lt;ref name=routledge/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;[[Michael Friedman (philosopher)|Michael Friedman]], ''A Parting of the Ways: Carnap, Cassirer, and Heidegger'', Open Court, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lebensphilosophie'' movement bore indirect relation to the subjectivist philosophy of [[vitalism]] developed by [[Henri Bergson]], which lent importance to [[Immediate experience|immediacy of experience]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|quote=In Germany the corresponding school [to [[vitalism]]], known as ''Lebensphilosophie'' (“philosophy of life”), began to take on aspects of a political ideology in the years immediately preceding World War I. The work of [[Hans Driesch]] and [[Ludwig Klages]], for example, openly condemned the superficial intellectualism of Western civilization. In associating “reason” with the shortcomings of “civilization” and “the West,” Lebensphilosophie spurred many German thinkers to reject intellection in favour of the irrational forces of blood and life. In the words of Herbert Schnädelbach, at this point “philosophy of life tendentiously abolished the traditional difference between nature and culture and thus facilitated the success of the general biologism in the theory of culture, which culminated in National Socialist racism.” |title=Continental philosophy |first=Richard |last=Wolin |authorlink=Richard Wolin |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1308494/continental-philosophy |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twentieth-century forms of ''Lebensphilosophie'' can be identified with a critical stress on norms and conventions. The Israeli-American historian Nitzan Lebovic identified ''Lebensphilosophie'' with the tight relation between a "corpus of life-concepts" and what the German education system came to see, during the 1920s, as the proper ''Lebenskunde'', the ‘teaching of life’ or ‘science of life’—a name that seemed to support the broader philosophical outlook long held by most biologists of the time. In his book Lebovic traces the transformation of the post-Nietzschean ''Lebensphilosophie'' from the radical aesthetics of the [[Stefan George]] Circle to Nazi or "[[biopolitical]]" rhetoric and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Nitzan Lebovic, ''The Philosophy of Life and Death Ludwig Klages and the Rise of a Nazi Biopolitics'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This philosophy pays special attention to ''life'' as a whole, which can only be understood from within. The movement can be regarded as a rejection of [[Kantian]] abstract philosophy or scientific reductionism of positivism.

London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;, a new psychological theory of [[consciousness]], and leader of the [[Vygotsky Circle]] (also referred to as "Vygotsky-[[Alexander Luria|Luria]] Circle").

Despite his claim for a "new psychology" that he foresaw as a "science of the Superman" of the [[Communism|Communist future]], Vygotsky's main work was in [[developmental psychology]] and he proposed a theory of the development of "higher psychological functions" that saw human psychological development as emerging through interpersonal connections and actions with the social environment. During an earlier [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] and [[Reductionism|reductionist]] "instrumental psychology" period of his career (1920s), he argued that human psychological development can be formed through the use of meaningless (i.e., virtually random) signs that he viewed as psychological equivalent of instrument use in human labor and industry.&lt;ref name="revBook"/&gt; Later, in the "[[Holism|holistic]]" period of his career (first half of 1930s), Vygotsky rejected his earlier reductionist views on signs. Under the increasing influence from the holistic thinking of the scholars primarily associated with German-American [[Gestalt psychology]] movement Vygotsky adopted their views on "psychological systems" and—inspired by [[Kurt Lewin]]'s "[[Field theory (psychology)|Topological (and vector) psychology]]"—introduced the vague notion of the "[[zone of proximal development]]". It was during this period that he identified play of young children as their "leading activity", that he understood as the main source of preschoolers psychological development, which he viewed as the inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development. 

As early as in mid-1920s, Vygotsky's ideas were introduced in the West, but he remained virtually unknown until the early 1980s when the popularity among educators of the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] (1896-1980) started to decline and, in contrast, Vygotsky's notion of the "zone of proximal development" became a central component of the development of the so-called "[[Social constructivism|social constructivist]]" turn in developmental and, primarily, educational psychology and practice. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' study, published in 2002, ranked Vygotsky as the 83rd top psychologist of the twentieth century and the third (and the last) Russian on the top-100 list after [[Ivan Pavlov]] and Vygotsky's longtime collaborator [[Alexander Luria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early twenty-first century has seen scholarly reevaluations of the popular version of Vygotsky's legacy (sometimes termed "Vygotsky cult", "the cult of Vygotsky", or even "the cult of personality around Vygotsky"), which is referred to as the "revisionist revolution in Vygotsky Studies".&lt;ref name="revBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. &amp; van der Veer, R.

The studies conducted in the framework of the "revisionist turn" in Vygotsky studes in the decade of 2010s revealed not only systematic and massive falsifications and distortions of Vygotsky's legacy, but also demonstrated rapid decrease of this author's popularity in international scholarship that started in 2016-2017 and the downfall even further accelerated in 2018у&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=djqLs50AAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=djqLs50AAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC Michael Cole’s (and Lev Vygotsky’s) ''Mind in society'' (1978): Google Scholar citation rate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/15934.html psyanimajournal: ''Vygotsky Bubble in 2017: The Year of the Great Break!'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/16496.html psyanimajournal: ''Vygotsky Cult in figures and the Vygotsky Bubble: the 3rd Anniversary of the project!'']&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biography==
Lev Vygotsky was born to the Vygodskii family in the town of [[Orsha]], [[Belarus]] (then belonging to [[Russian Empire]]) into a non-religious middle-class family of [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] extraction. His father Simkha Vygodskii was a banker. Young Lev Vygodskii was raised in the city of [[Gomel]], where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained formal degree (with distinction) in a private Jewish Gimnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913 Lev Vygodskii was admitted to the [[Moscow University]] by mere ballot through a "[[Jewish quota#Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students|Jewish Lottery]]": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had interest in humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school in Moscow University. During the first semester of study he transferred to the law school. There he studied law and, in parallel, he attended lectures at fully official, but privately funded and non degree granting Shaniavskii [[:ru:Московский городской народный университет имени А. Л. Шанявского|Moscow City People's University]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Shaniavskii+University Shaniavskii University]&lt;/ref&gt; His early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity. In contrast, during this period he was highly critical of the ideas of both [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]], and proposed the solution of the "Jewish question" by return to the traditional Jewish Orthodoxy.

Lev Vygodskii never completed his formal studies at the [[Imperial Moscow University]] and, thus, he never obtained a university degree: his studies were interrupted by the October Bolshevik uprising in 1917 in the country's capital Petrograd and the second largest city Moscow. Following these events, he left Moscow and eventually returned to Gomel, where he lived after the [[October Revolution|October Socialist Revolution]] of 1917 occurred. There is virtually no information about his life during the years in Gomel (that administratively belonged to the [[Ukrainian State]] at the time) after the German occupation during the [[WWI]], until the Bolsheviks captured the town in 1919. Since then he was an active participant of major social transformation under the Bolshevik (Communist) rule and a fairly prominent representative of the Bolshevik government in Gomel from 1919 to 1923. By the early 1920s, as reflected in his journalistic publications of the time, he informally changed his Jewish-sounding birth name, 'Lev Símkhovich Výgodskii' ({{lang-rus|Лев Си́мхович Вы́годский}}), with the surname becoming ''Vygótskii'' and the [[Russian patronymic|patronymic]] 'Símkhovich' becoming the Slavic 'Semiónovich'. It was under this pen-name that the fame subsequently came to him. His daughters (subsequently born in 1925 and 1930)  and other relatives, though, preserved their original family name 'Vygodskii'. The traditional English spelling of his last name nowadays is 'Vygotsky'.&lt;ref name="bioBook"/&gt;

In January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in [[Petrograd]] (soon thereafter renamed [[Leningrad]]). After the Congress, Vygotsky received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a "staff scientist, second class".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Veer, R., &amp; Valsiner, J. (1991). [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/10170 Understanding Vygotsky. A quest for synthesis]. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1925, Vygotsky completed his dissertation in 1925 entitled, "The Psychology of Art", that was not published until the 1960s and a book entitled, "Pedagogical Psychology", that apparently was created on the basis of lecture notes that he prepared in Gomel while he was a psychology instructor at local educational establishments. In summer 1925 he made his first and only trip abroad to a London congress on the education of the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;van der Veer, R. &amp; Zavershneva, E. (2011).

After his release from hospital Vygotsky did theoretical and methodological work on the crisis in psychology, but never finished the draft of the manuscript and interrupted his work on it around mid-1927. The manuscript was published later with notable editorial interventions and distortions in 1982 and presented by the editors as one of the most important Vygotsky's works.&lt;ref name="Zavershneva, E 2009"&gt;Zavershneva, E. 2009.

Vygotsky. ''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology'', vol. 50, no. 4, July–August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In this early manuscript, Vygotsky argued for the formation of a general psychology that could unite the naturalist objectivist strands of psychological science with the more philosophical approaches of Marxist orientation. However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a "[[Marxism|Marxist]] Psychology" as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit.&lt;ref name="Kozulin1986"&gt;Kozulin, Alex. 1986. "Vygotsky in Context" in Vygotsky L. "Thought and Language", MIT Press. pp. xi - lvii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926-30 Vygotsky worked on a research programme investigating the development of higher cognitive functions of logical memory, selective attention, decision making, and language comprehension, from early forms of primal psychological functions. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including [[Alexander Luria]], Boris Varshava, [[Alexei Leontiev]], [[Leonid Zankov]], and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: 
* The instrumental approach, which tried to understand the ways humans use objects as mediation aids in memory and reasoning
*A developmental approach, focused on how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development
* A culture-historical approach, studying how social and cultural patterns of interaction shape forms of mediation and developmental trajectories &lt;ref name="Kozulin1986"/&gt;

In the early 1930s Vygotsky experienced deep crisis, personal and theoretical, and after a period of massive self-criticism made an attempt at a radical revision of his theory. The work of the representatives of the [[Gestalt psychology]] and other holistic scholars was instrumental in this theoretical shift. In 1932-1934 Vygotsky was aiming at establishing a psychological theory of consciousness, but because of his death this theory remained only in a very sketchy and unfinished form.

==Life and scientific legacy==
Vygotsky was a pioneering psychologist and his major works span six separate volumes, written over roughly ten years, from ''Psychology of Art'' (1925) to ''Thought and Language'' [or ''Thinking and Speech''] (1934). Vygotsky's interests in the fields of [[developmental psychology]], [[child development]], and [[education]] were extremely diverse. His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as [[internalization]] of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of [[zone of proximal development]], a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development. His work covered topics such as the origin and the [[psychology of art]], development of higher [[mental function]]s, [[philosophy of science]] and the [[Methodology|methodology of psychological research]], the relation between [[learning]] and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], concept formation, interrelation between [[language and thought]] development, play as a psychological phenomenon, [[learning disabilities]], and abnormal human development (aka ''defectology''). His scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout his career, but generally Vygotsky's legacy may be divided into two fairly distinct periods,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the transitional phase between the two during which Vygotsky experienced the crisis in his theory and personal life. These are the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] "instrumental" period of the 1920s, integrative "[[Holism|holistic]]" period of the 1930s, and the transitional years of, roughly, 1929-1931. Each of these periods is characterized by its distinct themes and theoretical innovations.

==="Instrumental" period (1920s)===

====Cultural mediation and internalization====
Vygotsky studied child development and the significant roles of [[cultural mediation]] and [[interpersonal communication]]. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as [[internalization]]. ''Internalization'' may be understood in one respect as "knowing how". For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or pouring a cup of milk initially, are outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through the activity of the child within society. A further aspect of internalization is ''appropriation'', in which children take tools and adapt them to personal use, perhaps using them in unique ways. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for personal ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously.

===The period of crisis, criticism, and self-criticism (1929–1932)===

In 1930s Vygotsky was engaged in massive reconstruction of his theory of his "instrumental" period of the 1920s. Around 1929-1930 he realized numerous deficiencies and imperfections of the earlier work of the Vygotsky Circle and criticized it on a number of occasions: in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. self-criticism of 1929: "I am revising the s[econd] part of "monkey"[i.e., the book Ape, primitive, and child]. Alas! The f[irst] chapter is written wholly according to the Freudianists [...]; then the impenetrable Piaget is turned into an absolute beyond all measure; instrument and sign are mixed together even more, and so on and so forth. This is not the fault of A. R. [Luria] personally, but of the entire "epoch" of our thinking. We need to put a stop to this unrelentingly. [...] Let there be the most rigorous, monastic regime of thought; ideological seclusion, if necessary. And let us demand the same of others.

Their structure and the system of their development remain the same. What is changed and modified are rather the relationships, the links between the functions. New constellations emerge which were unknown in the preceding stage". In: Vygotsky, L. S. (1930/1997). On psychological systems. In R. W. Rieber &amp; J. Wollock (Eds.), The collected works of L. S.

Luria, from Moscow, June 12, 1931: "I am still beset with thousands of petty chores. The fruitlessness of what I do greatly distresses me. My scientific thinking is going off into the realm of fantasy, and I cannot think things through in a realistic way to the end. Nothing is going right: I am doing the wrong things, writing the wrong things, saying the wrong things. A fundamental reorganization is called for—and this time I am going to carry it out." In:  Vygotsky, L. S. (2007). Letters to students and colleagues. ''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology'', 45(2), 11-60. doi:10.2753/RPO1061-0405450201, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, archival document of mid-1932 titled "Consciousness without word": "'''Our deficiency is not a deficiency of facts, but the untenability of the theory''': in the analysis of our crisis this is the main difficulty, but not a departure from facts. '''This is ''contra'' A[.]N.[Leontiev.]''' '''Consequently''': salvation is not in the facts but in the theory. We introduced the systemic point of view '''too late'''... '''Now''' I understand all this more deeply" (Zavershneva, 2010b, p. 54)&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Vygotsky criticized his earlier idea of radical separation between the "lower" and "higher" psychological functions and, around 1932, appears to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky in his presentation of December, 1932, a year and half before his death: "1. The necessity of a new stage of inquiry does not stem from the fact that a new thought has occurred to me or a new idea has caught my interest, but from the necessity of developing the research itself—new facts prod me into searching for new and more intricate explanations. The narrowness, bias, and schematism of the old mindset led us to the wrong assessment of the essential principles that we mistook for the secondary ones: interfunctional connections. We focused attention on the sign (on the tool) to the detriment of the operation with it, representing it as something simple, which goes through three phases: magical—external—internal. But the knot is external  and the teenager’s diary is external. Hence we have a sea of poorly explained facts and a desire to delve more deeply into the facts, i.e., to evaluate them theoretically in a different way.
2. The higher and lower functions are not constructed in two tiers: their number and names do not match. But our previous understanding was not right, either[, according to which] a higher function is the mastery of the lower ([e.g.,] voluntary attention is the subordination to it of involuntary attention) because this means exactly—in two tiers". Vygotsky’s record titled "Symposium, December 4, 1932", see in Zavershneva, E. 2010b. The Vygotsky Family Archive: New Findings. Notebooks, Notes, and Scientific Journals of L.S. Vygotsky (1912–1934). ''Journal of the Russian and East European Psychology'' 48 (1):34-60, pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Vygotsky's self-criticism was complemented by external criticism for a number of issues, including the separation between the "higher" and the "lower" psychological functions, impracticality and inapplicability of his theory in social practices (such as industry or education) during the time of rapid social change, and vulgar Marxist interpretation of human psychological processes. Critics also pointed to his overemphasis on the role of language and, on the other hand, the ignorance of the emotional factors in human development. Major figures in Soviet psychology such as [[Sergei Rubinstein]] criticized Vygotsky's notion of mediation and its development in the works of students. Following criticism and in response to generous offer from the highest officials in Soviet Ukraine, a major group of Vygotsky's associates, the members of the [[Vygotsky Circle]], including [[Alexander Luria|Luria]], [[Mark Lebedinsky]], and [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Leontiev]], moved from Moscow to Ukraine to establish the [[Kharkov School of Psychology|Kharkov school of psychology]]. In the second half of the 1930s, Vygotsky was criticized again for his involvement in the cross-disciplinary study of the child known as [[paedology]] and uncritical borrowings from contemporary "bourgeois" science. Considerable critique came from the alleged Vygotsky's followers, such as Leontiev and members of his research group in Kharkov. Much of this early criticism was later discarded by these Vygotskian scholars as well.

==="Holistic" period (1932–1934)===

The period of major revision of Vygotsky's theory and its transition from mechanist orientation of his 1920s to integrative holistic science of the 1930s. During this period Vygotsky was under particularly strong influence of holistic theories of German-American group of proponents of [[Gestalt psychology]], most notably, the peripheral participants of the Gestalt movement [[Kurt Goldstein]] and [[Kurt Lewin]]. However, Vygotsky's work of this period remained largely fragmentary and unfinished and, therefore, unpublished.

====Zone of proximal development====
"[[Zone of proximal development]]" (ZPD) is Vygotsky's term for the range of tasks that a child is in the process of learning to complete. In the original Vygotsky's writings this phrase is used in three different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Kozulin, A. (2014). Dynamic assessment in search of its identity in Yasnitsky, A., van der Veer, R., &amp; Ferrari, M. (Eds.). (2014). The Cambridge Handbook of Cultural-Historical Psychology. Cambridge University Press (pp. 126-147)&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky viewed the ZPD as a better way to explain the relation between children’s learning and cognitive development. Prior to the ZPD, the relation between learning and development could be boiled down to the following three major positions: 1) Development always precedes learning (e.g., [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]): children first need to meet a particular maturation level before learning can occur; 2) Learning and development cannot be separated, but instead occur simultaneously (e.g., [[behaviorism]]): essentially, learning is development; and 3) learning and development are separate, but interactive processes (e.g., [[gestaltism]]): one process always prepares the other process, and vice versa. Vygotsky rejected these three major theories because he believed that learning should always precede development in the ZPD. According to Vygotsky, through the assistance of a more capable person, a child is able to learn skills or aspects of a skill that go beyond the child’s actual developmental or maturational level. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child's developmental level). The upper limit is the level of potential skill that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. In this sense, the ZPD provides a prospective view of cognitive development, as opposed to a retrospective view that characterizes development in terms of a child’s independent capabilities.

====''Thinking and speech''====
Perhaps Vygotsky's most important contribution concerns the inter-relationship of language development and thought. This problem was explored in Vygotsky's book, ''Thinking and speech'', entitled in Russian, ''Myshlenie i rech'', that was published in 1934. In fact, this book was a mere collection of essays and scholarly papers that Vygotsky wrote during different periods of his thought development and included writings of his "instrumental" and "holistic" periods. Vygotsky never saw the book published: it was published posthumously, edited by his closest associates (Kolbanovskii, Zankov, and Shif) not sooner than December, 1934, i.e., half a year after his death. First English translation was published in 1962 (with several later revised editions) heavily abbreviated and under an alternative and incorrect translation of the title ''Thought and Language'' for the Russian title ''Mysl' i iazyk''. The book establishes the explicit and profound connection between speech (both silent inner speech and oral language), and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness. Vygotsky described inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech. Although Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of "internalization" (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to "think out loud", he claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developing socially.

===Death (1934) and posthumous fame===
Vygotsky died of [[tuberculosis]] on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]. One of Vygotsky's last private notebook entries gives a proverbial, yet very pessimistic self-assessment of his contribution to psychological theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the final thing I have done in psychology – and I will like [[Moses]] die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it. Farewell, dear creations. The rest is silence.&lt;ref name="revBook"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Immediately after his death, Vygotsky was proclaimed one of the leading psychologists in the Soviet Union, although his stellar reputation was somewhat undermined by the decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 1936 that denounced the mass movement, discipline, and related social practice of the so-called [[Pedology (children study)|pedology]]. Yet, even despite some criticisms and censorship of his works—most notably, in the post-Stalin era in the Soviet Union of 1960s-1980s by his Russian alleged and self-proclaimed best students and followers—Vygotsky always remained among the most quoted scholars in the field and has become a [[Cult following|cult figure]] for a number of contemporary intellectuals and practitioners in Russia and the international psychological and educational community alike.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, J. &amp; Yasnitsky, A. (2015). [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Fraser%20&amp;%20Yasnitsky%20(2015).pdf Deconstructing Vygotsky’s Victimization Narrative: A Re-Examination of the "Stalinist Suppression" of Vygotskian Theory].

==Influence worldwide==

===Eastern Europe===
In the [[Soviet Union]], the work of the group of Vygotsky's students known as the [[Vygotsky Circle]] was vital for preserving and, in many respects, distorting the scientific legacy of Lev Vygotsky.&lt;ref name="Kozulin 1986 264–274"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozulin|first=A.|title=The concept of activity in Soviet psychology: Vygotsky, his disciples and critics|journal=American Psychologist|year=1986|volume=41|issue=3|pages=264–274|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.41.3.264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the group subsequently laid a foundation for Vygotskian psychology's systematic development in such diverse fields as the psychology of memory ([[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]]), perception, sensation, and movement ([[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]], [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]], [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]]), personality (Lidiya Bozhovich, [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]], [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]]), will and volition ([[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]], [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]], [[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]], L. Bozhovich, [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]]), psychology of play (G. D. Lukov, Daniil El'konin) and psychology of learning ([[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]], L. Bozhovich, D. El'konin), as well as the theory of step-by-step formation of mental actions (Pyotr Gal'perin), general psychological [[activity theory]] ([[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]]) and psychology of action ([[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]]).&lt;ref name="Kozulin 1986 264–274"/&gt; Andrey Puzyrey elaborated the ideas of Vygotsky in respect of psychotherapy and even in the broader context of deliberate [[psychological intervention]] (psychotechnique), in general.&lt;ref name=Puzyrey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vassilieva|first=J.|title=Russian psychology at the turn of the 21st century and post-Soviet reforms in the humanities disciplines|journal=History of Psychology|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=138–159|doi=10.1037/a0019270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Laszlo Garai]] &lt;ref&gt;:Interview with Laszlo Garai on the Activity Theory of Alexis Leontiev and his own Theory of Social Identity as referred to the meta-theory of Lev Vygotsky. ''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology'' 2012; vol. 50, no. 1, pp. 50–64.&lt;/ref&gt; founded a Vygotskian research group.

===North America===
In North America, Vygotsky's work was known from the end of the 1920s through a series of publications in English, but it did not have a major impact on research in general. In 1962 a translation of his posthumous 1934 book, ''Thinking and Speech'', published with the title,''Thought and Language'', did not seem to change the situation considerably. It was only after an eclectic compilation of partly rephrased and partly translated works of Vygotsky and his collaborators, published in 1978 under Vygotsky's name as ''Mind in Society'', that the Vygotsky boom started in the West: originally, in North America, and later, following the North American example, spread to other regions of the world. This version of Vygotskian science is typically associated with the names of its chief proponents Michael Cole, [[James Wertsch]], their associates and followers, and is relatively well-known under the names of "[[cultural-historical activity theory]]" (aka CHAT) or—yet more distant from Vygotsky's legacy--"[[activity theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=W.M.|author2=Lee, J.Y. |title="Vygotsky's Neglected Legacy": Cultural Historical Activity Theory|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=June 2007|volume=77|issue=2|doi=10.3102/0034654306298273|pages=186–232|url=http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Mail/xmcamail.2007_06.dir/att-0021/Wolff-Michael_Roth_Vygotsky.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toomela1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for cultural-historical psychology | url = | journal = Culture &amp; Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 353–364 | doi=10.1177/1354067x0063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="toomela2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2008 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for methodological thinking in cultural psychology too | url = | journal = Culture &amp; Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 289–303 | doi=10.1177/1354067x08088558}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Instructional scaffolding|Scaffolding]], a concept introduced by Wood, [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]], and Ross in 1976, is somewhat related to the idea of ZPD, although Vygotsky never used the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.

==Criticisms of North American "Vygotskian" and original Vygotsky's legacy==
A critique of the North American interpretation of Vygotsky's ideas and, somewhat later, its global spread and dissemination appeared in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Valsiner, J. (1988). Developmental psychology in the Soviet Union. Brighton, Sussex: Harvester Press, p. 117: Present-day psychologists’ interest in Vygotsky’s thinking is indeed paradoxical. On the one hand, his writings seem increasingly popular among developmental psychologists in Europe and North America. On the other hand, however, careful analyses and thorough understanding of the background of Vygotsky’s ideas is rare... Vygotsky seems to be increasingly well known in international psychology, while remaining little understood. The roots of his thinking in international philosophical and psychological discourse remain largely hidden. His ideas have rarely been developed further, along either theoretical or empirical lines.&lt;/ref&gt; The early 1980s criticism of Russian and Western "Vygotskian" scholars &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = J | year = 1987 | title = Vygotsky and the Vygotskians | url = | journal = American Journal of Education | volume = 95 | issue = 4| pages = 609–613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; continued throughout the 1990s. Thus, different authors emphasized the biased and fragmented interpretations of Vygotsky by representatives of what was termed "neo-Vygotskian fashions in contemporary psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Van der Veer, R., and J. Valsiner. 1991. Understanding Vygotsky: A quest for synthesis. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; or "selective traditions" in Vygotskian scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Cazden, C. B. 1996. Selective traditions: Readings of Vygotsky in writing pedagogy. In Child discourse and social learning: An interdisciplinary perspective, edited by D. Hicks, 165-186. New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, the most fashionable "Vygotskian" phraseology in wide circulation in Western scholarly and educational discourse—such as the so-called "[[zone of proximal development]]"—in the critical literature of this period were referred to as "one of the most used and least understood constructs to appear in contemporary educational literature",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Palincsar | first1 = A.

Other authors also suggest clearly distinguishing between Vygotsky's original notion of "zona blizhaishego razvitiia" (''ZBR'') and its later Western superficial interpretations known under the umbrella term, "zone of proximal development" (''ZPD'').&lt;ref&gt;Valsiner, J., &amp; Van der Veer, R.

Renninger (Eds.), The development and meaning of psychological distance (pp. 35-62). Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valsiner, J., &amp; van der Veer, R. (2014).

Ferrari (Eds.), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Cultural-Historical Psychology''. (pp. 148-174). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism continued and reached a peak in the 2000s. Most often these critiques address numerous distortions of Vygotsky's ideas, mere "declarations of faith",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Valsiner, J., and R. Van der Veer (2000). The social mind: Construction of the idea. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p.4: It is often an open question as to what functions such declarations can have in science. From a position of in-depth analysis, such statements seem merely to be stating the obvious (compared with the statements like the rain is wet or the rich are affluent). And yet, such general claims about the sociality of the human psyche are made with remarkable vigour and repetitiveness&lt;/ref&gt; "versions of Vygotsky",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillen | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = Versions of Vygotsky | url = | journal = British Journal of Educational Studies | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 183–98 | doi=10.1111/1467-8527.t01-1-00141}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "concepts and inferences curiously attributed to Lev Vygotsky",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gredler | first1 = M.

Critical analysis of Vygotsky's ideas revealed that the alleged "Vygotsky's theory of play" never existed as such: instead, it was proposed that "Vygotsky's brief writings about play do not constitute a theory according to scientific definitions of psychological theory, and would be better acknowledged merely as part of the historical evolution of ideas about children's play. Of greater significance is that the theoretical relevance of Vygotsky's opinion about play can seriously be called into question upon the basis of current research in the area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E.

==Revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies==
The revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies was termed a "revisionist revolution"&lt;ref name="revBook"/&gt; to describe a relatively recent trend that emerged in the 1990s. This trend is typically associated with growing dissatisfaction with the quality and scholarly integrity of available texts of Vygotsky and members of [[Vygotsky Circle]], including their English translations made from largely mistaken, distorted, and even in a few instances falsified Soviet editions,&lt;ref&gt;Veer, R., van der (1997).

The revisionist strand is solidly grounded in a series of studies in Vygotsky's archives that uncovered previously unknown and unpublished Vygotsky materials.&lt;ref name="Zavershneva, E 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zavershneva, E. 2007.

Thus, some studies of the revisionist strand show that certain phrases, terms, and expressions typically associated with Vygotskian legacy as its core notions and concepts—such as "cultural-historical psychology", "cultural-historical theory", "cultural-historical school", "higher psychical/mental functions", "internalization", "zone of proximal development", etc., -- in fact, either occupy not more than just a few dozen pages within the six-volume collection of Vygotsky’s works,&lt;ref&gt;Tudge, J. 1999.

==''Complete Works of L. S. Vygotsky''==
Scholars associated with the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] movement in Vygotsky Studies propose returning to Vygotsky's original uncensored works, critically revising the available discourse, and republishing them in both Russian and translation with a rigorous scholarly commentary.&lt;ref name="html"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veer, R., van der (2010). Vygotsky in English: What still needs to be done. Website for International Cultural Historical Studies (http://www.ichs.udk.-berlin.de{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an essential part of this revisionist strand is the ongoing work on "''PsyAnima'' Complete Vygotsky" project&lt;ref&gt;[http://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/ psyanimajournal]: [http://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/3526.html PsyAnima Полное собрание сочинений Выготского / PsyAnima Complete Vygotsky]&lt;/ref&gt; that for the first time ever exposes full collections of Vygotsky's texts, uncensored and cleared from numerous mistakes, omissions, insertions, and blatant distortions and falsifications of the author's text made in Soviet editions and uncritically transferred in virtually all foreign translated editions of Vygotsky's works. This project is carried out by an international team of volunteers—researchers, archival workers, and library staff—from Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Switzerland, who joined their efforts and put together a collection of L. S. Vygotsky’s texts. This publication work is supported by a stream of critical scholarly studies and publications on textology, history, theory and methodology of Vygotskian research that cumulatively contributes to the first ever edition of ''The Complete Works of L.S. Vygotsky''.&lt;ref&gt;Yasnitsky, A. (2012). [http://www.psyanima.su/journal/2012/3/2012n3a6/2012n3a6.2.pdf The Complete Works of L.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34670">[[Pre-Code Hollywood]] is the era in the American [[film industry]] between the introduction of sound in the late 1920s&lt;ref name="La1"&gt;LaSalle (2002). pg.1&lt;/ref&gt; and the enforcement of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] (Hays Code) censorship guidelines. Although the Code was adopted in 1930, oversight was poor and it did not become effectively enforced until July 1, 1934. Before that date, movie content was restricted more by local laws, negotiations between the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Studio Relations Committee]] (SRC) and the major studios, and popular opinion than strict adherence to the Hays Code, which was often ignored by Hollywood filmmakers.

The criterion for inclusion on this list is the direct mention or discussion of the film as pre-Code in a [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|mainstream source]].

'''Localism''' describes a range of political philosophies which prioritize the local. Generally, localism supports local production and [[Local purchasing|consumption of goods]], local control of government, and promotion of [[local history]], local culture and local identity. Localism can be contrasted with [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] and [[centralized government]], with its opposite being found in the [[unitary state]].

Localism can also refer to a systematic approach to organizing a national government so that local autonomy is retained rather than following the usual pattern of government and political power becoming centralized over time.

On a conceptual level, there are important affinities between localism and [[deliberative democracy]]. This concerns mainly the democratic goal of engaging citizens in decisions that affect them. Consequently, localism will encourage stronger democratic and political participatory forums and widening public sphere connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ercan | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Hendriks | first2 = C.H. | year = 2013 | title = The democratic challenges and potential of localism: Insights from deliberative democracy | url = | journal = Policy Studies | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 422–440 | doi = 10.1080/01442872.2013.822701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Localists{{such as?|date=October 2018}} assert that throughout the world's history, most social and economic institutions have been scaled at the local level, as opposed to regional, interregional, or global (basically until the late 19th to the early 20th centuries).{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs attribution; claim seems far-fetched since, e.g., Feudalism was hierarchical|date=October 2018}} Only with [[imperialism]] and the [[industrial revolution]] did local scales become less central.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs attribution; 'Only with' seems far-fetched since, e.g., Feudalism was hierarchical|date=October 2018}} Most proponents of localism position themselves as defending aspects of this earlier way of life;{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs attribution; 'Most' suggests an analysis has been conducted|date=October 2018}} the phrase "relocalization" is often used in this sense.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} 

In the 20th century, localism drew heavily on the writings of [[Leopold Kohr]], [[E.F. Schumacher]], [[Wendell Berry]], and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], among others. More generally, localism draws on a wide range of movements and concerns and it proposes that by re-localizing democratic and economic relationships to the local level, social, economic and environmental problems will be more definable and solutions more easily created. They include [[anarchism]], [[bioregionalism]], [[environmentalism]], the [[Green politics|Greens]], and more specific concerns about food, monetary policy and education. Political parties of all persuasions have also occasionally favored the [[devolution]] of power to local authorities. In this vein [[Alan Milburn]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP, has spoken of "making services more locally accountable, devolving more power to local communities and, in the process, forging a modern relationship between the state, citizens and services"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/localism_page349.aspx | title = Localism: The need for a new settlement | author-link = Alan Milburn | first = Alan | last = Milburn | type = speech | publisher = Demos |year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, a particularly visible strain of localism in the United States was a movement started by [[Alice Waters]] to buy locally produced products. This movement originated with [[organic farming]] and likely gained impetus because of growing dissatisfaction with [[organic certification]] and the failing economic model of [[industrial agriculture]] for small farmers. While the advocates of local consumption draw on [[protectionist]] arguments, they also appealed primarily to an [[Environmentalism|environmental]] argument: that pollution caused by transporting goods was a major [[externality]] in a global economy, and one that "[[local food|localvores]]" could greatly diminish. Also, environmental issues can be addressed when decision making power is held by those affected by the issues instead of power sources that do not understand the needs of local communities.

== Political philosophy ==
Localism as a philosophy is related to the principle of [[subsidiarity]].

In the early 21st century, localists have frequently found themselves aligned with critics of [[globalisation]]. Variants of localism are prevalent within the [[green politics|Green movement]]. According to an article in ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]'', localism of this sort seeks to "answer to the problems created by globalisation" with "calls to minimise [[international trade]] and to seek to establish economies based on ‘local’ [[self-sufficiency]] only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=176&amp;issue=109 | first = Mark | last = Tomas | title = Feedback: Transport and climate change—a reply to James Woodcock|work=[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]] | number = 109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some localists believe that society should be organised politically along community lines, with each community being free to conduct its own business in whatever fashion its people see fit. The size of the communities is defined such that their members are both familiar and dependent on each other, a size something along the lines of a small town or village.{{Citation needed|date= February 2007}}

In reference to localism, [[Edward Goldsmith]], former editor of ''The Ecologist'' magazine, claims: "The problems facing the world today can only be solved by restoring the functioning of those natural systems which once satisfied our needs, i.e. by fully exploiting those incomparable resources which are individual people, families, communities and ecosystems, which together make up the biosphere or real world"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page78.html | title = De-industrialising society | author-link = Edward Goldsmith | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060514003214/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page78.html | archivedate = 2006-05-14 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tip O'Neill]], a longtime [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in the [[US Congress]], once famously declared that "All politics is local".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = River Deep | date = October 2000 | url = http://www.riverdeep.net/current/2000/10/103000_politic.jhtml | title = Politic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually wrote a book by that name: ''All Politics Is Local: And Other Rules of the Game''.

=== Localism and populism ===
There are discussions whether localism correlates with populism in theory basis. Wayne Yeung, a writer in an online publication (NEW BLOOM) &lt;ref name="Yeung 2016"&gt;[Yeung, Wayne. “From Populism to Localism.” New Bloom. Updated on April 15, 2016. https://newbloommag.net/2016/04/15/from-populism-to-localism/.]&lt;/ref&gt; She made an assumption claiming that localism is a sub-school of European-American populism, and its ideology is a combination of ultra-nationalist, anti-leftist, and immigrant-bashing rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Yeung 2016" /&gt; She raised an example of localism application, in which localism certify a “civic” or “cultural” value rather than ethnic understanding in Hong Kong identity politics.&lt;ref name="Yeung 2016" /&gt; Consequently, localism contains elements of populism, primarily as being a politicised form of racism. &lt;ref name="Yeung 2016" /&gt;

Jane Wills, a Professor of Human Geography in the University of Exeter, argued that the increasing numbers of populist politicians are endorsing localism as the framework for public policy.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189"&gt;[Wills, Jane. “Populism, localism and the geography of democracy.” In Geoforum, Volume 62 (June 2015), pp.188-189.]&lt;/ref&gt; She defined that populism is the form of politics that involves actions to speak for the people in a register that is more authentic to the experiences and needs of those people.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189" /&gt; In other words, most likely that Populist Party policies would contradict with parties supporting the elites.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189" /&gt; She also used anti-politics to describe populist or localist politician because they stood against mainstream politics.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189" /&gt; She used the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) as an example where UKIP adopted localism into frame working their policies. Mainstream politicians from Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat threatened by the rise of UKIP and their adoption on localism policy, in which they increasingly exposed from the emotional connection to the people.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189" /&gt;

== Localism and Third World ==

Many localists are concerned with the problems of the development of the [[Third World]]. Many advocate that third world countries should aim to rely on their own goods and services to escape from what they see are the unfair trade relations with the [[developed world]]. [[George Monbiot]] claims this idea does not recognise the fact that, even if Third World countries often get a raw deal in trade relations, refusing to trade at all would be a significant blow, as the countries need the revenue generated by trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1038164,00.html | contribution = The myth of localism | author = George Monbiot | author-link = George Monbiot | title = [[The Guardian]] | date = September 9, 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some localists are also against [[immigration]] from poor countries to rich ones. One of the problems they claim results from such immigration is the drain on the intellectual resources of poor countries, so called [[brain drain]]. For example, in the past decade, [[Bulgaria]] is estimated to have lost more than 50,000 qualified scientists and skilled workers through emigration every year. About a fifth of them were highly educated specialists in chemistry, biology, medicine and physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www2.rnw.nl/rnw/en/specialseries/euexpansiondrive/050401euexp?view=Standard | title = East-West brain drain | first = Hélène | last = Michaud | publisher = Radio Netherlands | date = April 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Feser and Stuart H. Sweeney, ''Out-migration, population decline, and regional economic distress'', Washington, DC: Economic Development Administration, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== International relations ==

Some localists are against political intervention and peace keeping measures. They believe that communities should find solutions to their own problems and in their own time, in whatever fashion they decide. They believe that all societies are capable of achieving long term peace once given the opportunity to do so.

== Localist activism ==
Localism usually describes social measures or trends which emphasise or value local and small-scale phenomena.  This is in contrast to large, all-encompassing frameworks for action or belief.  Localism can therefore be contrasted with [[globalisation]], and in some cases localist activism has parallels with opposition to corporate-led globalization. Localism can be geographical, but there are also transnational linkages. Localist movements are often organized in support of locally owned, independent businesses and nonprofit organizations. Although the focus of this aspect of localist activism is on "buy local," "support local food," and "bank local" campaigns, some organizations and businesses also combine the goal of increased local ownership with environmental sustainability and social fairness goals.&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite book|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=Localist Movements in a Global Economy: Sustainability, Justice, and Urban Development in the United States|year=2009|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262512329|url=http://www.davidjhess.org/sustlocproject.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeYoungPrincen&gt;{{cite book|last=DeYoung, Raymond|first= &amp; Princen, Thomas|title=The Localization Reader: Adapting to the Coming Downshift|year=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262516877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of localism are:
* Support for local food networks, such as [[farmers' markets]], [[community-supported agriculture]], [[community gardens]], [[farm-to-table]] programs, food cooperatives, and restaurants that serve local food. The [[Slow Food|slow food]] movement, using diverse, seasonal, natural food in reaction to multinational merchandising of food which is uniform, produced using industrial methods, and called [[fast food]].
* Support for locally owned, independent businesses, including community banks and credit unions, such as the following organizations: [[American Independent Business Alliance]], Business Alliance for Local Living Economies, the [[Institute for Local Self-Reliance]], and [[Move Your Money]]. [http://www.amiba.net/home/benefits-local-business "The Benefits of Doing Business Locally"] an essay by Jeff Milchen, American Independent Business Alliance co-founder, covers many arguments for local business ownership and patronage.
* [[Localism in media]] to support a diverse news media in the face of increasing corporate control.  The US [[Federal Communications Commission]] is using this term when seeking input on its rules and states that "promoting localism is a key goal of the Commission’s media ownership rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-277560A1.pdf | title = FCC Localism Hearing to be Held in Washington, DC, on October 31st | publisher = FCC | place = USA | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Localism in government structures, which can include:
** [[Tertiary government]] where small community councils make relevant decisions, with some degree of independence from local or national government.
** [[Workers' councils]], where the employees of a particular workplace discuss and negotiate with their employer, rather have this done by a national union which may be remote from local issues.
** [[Federalism]] and [[devolution]].
* [[Postmodernism]] can be seen as a sort of cultural localism, where accepted cultural values may be ignored in favour of people creating their own criteria of value. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
* Religion (Protestant):
** Exclusive localism holds that there can't be more than one legitimate institutionally visible church at one given location, the variation of which varies but is usually held to be either a city or a neighbourhood.
** Localism is more generally the congregationalist idea that each local church should be autonomous, only extended to reject any formal association of churches.  It is specially relevant among [[Baptists]], where localists reject the forming of Conventions.
* Religion (Churches of Christ):
** The congregationalist idea of local autonomy is a cornerstone of [[restoration movement]] fellowships that identify as [[churches of Christ]] or [[Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]].  Founders of the movement declared their independence from various denominations, seeking a fresh start to restore the New Testament church, and abandoning creeds. The names "Church of Christ," "Christian Church" and "Disciples of Christ" were adopted by the movement because they believed these terms to be biblical and not man made.

** One of the largest divisions within churches of Christ was due to controversy of foreign missionary work.

* Localism as it applies to saving our globe economically and environmentally: Localism is essential in describing the magnitude of our climate crisis and economic concerns. Through several selfish actions, globally, we have created an entirely new planet; a planet that is struggling to maintain it’s sustainability. The book, "Earth" by Bill McKibben, focusses on this topic. McKibben notes that we are at a point in which we need to drastically alter our attitude in order to provide the generations to come with a more bearable environment. This meaning, that our sights need to be directed towards merely just enduring, rather than growing. To do so, he suggests that we must return to, and rely on the notion of localism. As a result, communities will be able to rediscover what we may have lost sight of in lieu of the recent economic growth, that being the benefits of relying on our neighbors. An example of this is local farming; although it has shown to be more labor concentrated, in the long run it could prove to be more practical in an economic sense. McKibben believes that by supporting local farming, communities can essentially cut out the middlemen that are needed to transport, store, and package the items that we see in the supermarket and therefore save not only economically, but also conserve the limited energy resources that we do have. An article from Business and The Environment Journal in September 2011 stated that, "buying local makes consumers feel good," and "shorter trips from the field to the market mean fewer carbon emissions." Although this may depend on the product of interest, a decrease of carbon emission will lead to conserved energy which was McKibben’s initial topic of concern in getting our world back to a more sustainable place. Fred Curtis from the Department of Economics at Drew University labels this broad notion as "eco-localism". He believes that "the road to environmental sustainability lies in the creation of local, self-reliant, community economies." Socially, physically, and financially, communities need to adapt and become more locally oriented in order for this process to play out favorably in the long run. One of the key points that Curtis acknowledges is that by producing goods and services based on local needs, communities can essentially produce higher quality products, in turn allowing the needs of consumers to be met, inevitably leading to a restructure of the local economy.

'''Polygamy''' (called '''plural marriage''' by [[Mormons]] in the 19th century or '''the Principle''' by modern [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] practitioners of [[polygamy]]) was practiced by leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church or Mormons) for more than half of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=LDSofficialstatement&gt;{{citation | author=LDS Church |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/article/polygamy-latter-day-saints-and-the-practice-of-plural-marriage |title=Polygamy: Latter-day Saints and the Practice of Plural Marriage |publisher=LDS Newsroom}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890 by between 20 and 30 percent of Latter-day Saint families. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Flake| first=Kathleen| title=The Politics of American Religious Identity| year=2004| publisher=University of North Carolina Press| isbn=0807855014| pages=65, 192| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLLCAB5vmMQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Embry1994&gt;{{citation |first= Jessie L. |last= Embry |contribution= Polygamy |contribution-url= http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/p/POLYGAMY.html |editor-last= Powell |editor-first= Allan Kent |year= 1994 |title= Utah History Encyclopedia |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= [[University of Utah Press]] |isbn= 0874804256 |oclc= 30473917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latter-day Saints' practice of polygamy has been controversial, both within Western society and the LDS Church itself. America was both fascinated and horrified by the practice of polygamy, with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] platform at one time referencing "the twin relics of barbarism—polygamy and slavery."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/convention_1856.htm US History.org] website&lt;/ref&gt; The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder [[Joseph Smith]]. The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], [[Orson Pratt]],&lt;ref name=Embry1994 /&gt; by the request of [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Brigham Young]].

For over 60 years, the [[LDS Church and politics in the United States|LDS Church and the United States]] were at odds over the issue: the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it, consistent with prevailing public opinion. Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the [[Utah War]] of 1857 and 1858, given the Republican attempts to paint Democratic President [[James Buchanan]] as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery. In 1862, the United States Congress passed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], which prohibited plural marriage in the territories.&lt;ref name=Embry1994 /&gt; In spite of the law, Mormons continued to practice polygamy, believing that it was protected by the [[First Amendment]]. In 1879, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Reynolds v. United States'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20061009192447/http://www.historyofsupremecourt.org/scripts/supremecourt/glossary.cgi?term=r&amp;letter=yes “The History of The Supreme Court”]&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Morrill Act, stating: "Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinion, they may with practices."&lt;ref name=Embry1994 /&gt;

In 1890, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] that officially terminated the practice of polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Official Declaration |od|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before Congress and issued a "[[Second Manifesto]]", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease and established [[excommunication]] as the consequence for those who disobeyed. Several small "fundamentalist" groups, seeking to continue the practice, split from the LDS Church, including the [[Apostolic United Brethren]] (AUB) and the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (FLDS Church). Meanwhile, the LDS Church continues its policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today actively seeks to distance itself from fundamentalist groups that continue the practice.&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church encourages journalists not to use the word "Mormon" in reference to organizations or people that practice polygamy {{cite web |url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/style-guide |title=Style Guide — LDS Newsroom |accessdate=2014-04-15}}; the church repudiates polygamist groups and excommunicates their members if discovered {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=91}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25396937/ns/us_news-faith/t/mormons-seek-distance-polygamist-sects |title=Mormons seek distance from polygamous sects |year=2008 |publisher=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its web site, the church states that "the standard doctrine of the church is monogamy" and that polygamy was a temporary exception to the rule.&lt;ref name=LDSofficialstatement /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Citing [[Book of Jacob|Jacob]], chapter 2, from the [[Book of Mormon]]: "Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none …. For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early converts to the religion including Brigham Young,&lt;ref name="JournalHist1857"&gt;Journal History, 26 August 1857; cited by Hyrum Leslie Andrus, ''Doctrines of the Kingdom'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Desert Book Co., 1999), 489n436 ({{Harvnb|Andrus|1973}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Pratt]], and [[Lyman E. Johnson|Lyman Johnson]], recorded that Joseph Smith was teaching plural marriage privately as early as 1831 or 1832. Pratt reported that Smith told some early members in 1831 and 1832 that plural marriage was a true principle, but that the time to practice it had not yet come.&lt;ref name="OrsonPratt"&gt;Orson Pratt, "[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/JournalOfDiscourses3,4951 Celestial Marriage]," ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'', reported by David W. Evans (7 October 1869), Vol. 13 (London: Latter-day Saint's Book Depot, 1871), 192–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson also claimed to have heard the doctrine from Smith in 1831.&lt;ref name="LymanJohnson"&gt;Lyman Johnson as recounted by Orson Pratt, "[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/MStar,27192 Report of Elders Orson Pratt and Joseph F. Smith]," ''[[Millennial Star]]'', vol. 40, no. 50 (16 December 1878): 788.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mosiah Hancock]] reported that his father was taught about plural marriage in the spring of 1832.&lt;ref name="MosiahHancock"&gt;[[Todd M. Compton]], ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1997), 644; citing Mosiah Hancock ''Autobiography'', 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1835 and 1844 versions of the church's [[Doctrine and Covenants]] (D&amp;C) prohibited polygamy and declared that monogamy was the only acceptable form of marriage:

{{quote|In as much as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine and Covenants (1835 ed.), section 101, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]], Smith's scribe, recorded early polygamous marriages in 1843, including unions between Smith and Eliza Partridge, Emily Partridge, [[Sarah Ann Whitney]], [[Helen Kimball]] and Flora Woodworth. Clayton relates: "On the 1st day of May, 1843, I officiated in the office of an Elder by marrying Lucy Walker to the Prophet Joseph Smith, at his own residence. During this period the Prophet Joseph took several other wives. Amongst the number I well remember Eliza Partridge, Emily Partridge, Sarah Ann Whitney, Helen Kimball and Flora Woodworth. These all, he acknowledged to me, were his lawful, wedded wives, according to the celestial order. His wife Emma was cognizant of the fact of some, if not all, of these being his wives, and she generally treated them very kindly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1995|pp=94–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1832, Mormon missionaries worked successfully to convert followers in [[Maine]] of polygamist religious leader [[Jacob Cochran]], who went into hiding in 1830 to escape imprisonment due to his practice of polygamy. Among Cochran's marital innovations was "[[spiritual wifery]]", and "tradition assumes that he received frequent consignments of spiritual consorts, and that such were invariably the most robust and attractive women in the community".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1880s-1890s/ridl1895.htm#pg269a Ridlon, G.T. ''Cochran Delusion/Mormon Invasion'', in ''Saco Valley Settlements and Families: Historical, Biographical, Genealogical, Traditional, and Legendary''] (Rutland, Vermont: Charles E. Tuttle, 1895), 269 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of what became the [[Quorum of the Twelve]] in 1835 attended Mormon conferences held in the center of the Cochranites in 1834 and 1835.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Evening and Morning Star]]'' '''2''' [August 1834]: 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Messenger and Advocate]]'' '''2''' [October 1835]: 204–07 states that "On August 21, 1835, nine of the Twelve met in conference at Saco, Maine".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints'' '''1''':583.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':252&lt;/ref&gt; Brigham Young, an [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] of the church, became acquainted with Cochran's followers as he made several missionary journeys through the Cochranite territory from Boston to Saco,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''6''' [November 1, 1845].&lt;/ref&gt; and later married Augusta Adams Cobb, a former Cochranite.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. J. (1961) ''Brigham Young and His Wives'', at p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, K.B. (1973) ''Our pioneer heritage'' 6, 187–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Smith]] publicly condemned polygamy, denied his involvement in it, and participants were excommunicated, as church records and publications reflect.&lt;ref&gt;"Notice", ''[[Times and Seasons]]'', Volume 5, No. 3, 1 February 1844 (p. 423 in [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131021175853/http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/8375 bound edition] — [http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n03.htm alt source] of text) "As we have lately been credibly informed, that an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter-day Saints, by the name of Hiram Brown, has been preaching Polygamy, and other false and corrupt doctrines, in the county of Lapeer, state of Michigan."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=B.

"A Proclamation", ''[[Warsaw Signal]]'', Warsaw, Illinois [October 1845], page 1, column 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sidney Rigdon]], while he was estranged from the church, wrote a letter in backlash to the ''[[Messenger and Advocate]]'' in 1844 condemning the church's Quorum of the Twelve and their alleged connection to polygamy:

{{quote|It is a fact so well known that the Twelve and their adherents have endeavored to carry on this spiritual wife business … and have gone to the most shameful and desperate lengths to keep from the public. First, insulting innocent females, and when they resented the insult, these monsters in human shape would assail their characters by lying, and perjuries, with a multitude of desperate men to help them effect the ruin of those whom they insulted, and all this to enable them to keep these corrupt practices from the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Wagoner|1989|p=83}} {{Clarify| reason=this Harvard reference doesn't have a matching citation| date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the time, the practice was kept secret from non-members and most church members. Throughout his life, Smith publicly denied having multiple wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|pp=195, 283–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[John C. Bennett]], a recent convert to the church and the first mayor of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], used ideas of eternal and plural marriage to justify acts of seduction, [[adultery]] and, in some cases, the practice of [[abortion]] in the guise of "spiritual wifery". Bennett was called to account by Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith]], and was excommunicated from the church.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''3''' [August 1, 1842]: 870–71.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1844, Joseph Smith referred to polygamy as "John C. Bennett's spiritual wife system" and warned "if any man writes to you, or preaches to you, doctrines contrary to the Bible, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Doctrine and Covenants, set him down as an imposter." Smith mused 

{{quote|we cannot but express our surprise that any elder or priest who has been in Nauvoo, and has had an opportunity of hearing the principles of truth advanced, should for one moment give credence to the idea that any thing like iniquity is practised, much less taught or sanctioned, by the authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''5''' [April 1, 1844]: 490–91.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The practice was publicly announced in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah Territory]], in 1852, some five years after the Mormons arrived in Utah, and eight years after Smith's death. The doctrine authorizing plural marriage was published in the 1876 version of the LDS Church's [[Doctrine and Covenants]].&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine and Covenants, section 132; in the same edition, the statement denouncing polygamy (the old section 101) was removed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teachings on the multiple wives of God and Jesus===

Top leaders used the examples of the polygamy of God the Father and Jesus Christ in defense of it and these teachings on God and Jesus' polygamy were widely accepted among Mormons by the late-1850s.&lt;ref name="Desert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swanson|first1=Vern G.|title=Dynasty of the Holy Grail: Mormonism's Holy Bloodline|date=2013|publisher=Cedar Fort, Inc.|location=Springville, UT|isbn=9781462104048|chapter=Christ and Polygamy|pages=247–259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rss1CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT251&amp;lpg=PT251&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Dr. William E.

==Plural marriages of early church leaders==

===Joseph Smith===
{{See also|List of Joseph Smith's wives}}

The [[1843 polygamy revelation]], published posthumously, counseled Smith's wife [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma]] to accept all of Smith's plural wives, and warns of destruction if the new covenant is not observed.&lt;ref name="1843 polygamy revelation"&gt;A 12 July 1843 polygamy revelation on plural marriage, attributed to [[Joseph Smith]], with the demand that [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma Smith]], the first wife, accept all of Joseph Smith's plural wives. See the LDS version of the ''[[w:Doctrine and Covenants|Doctrine and Covenants]]'', [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 132|132:1–4, 19, 20, 24, 34, 35, 38, 39, 52, 60–66]].&lt;/ref&gt; Emma Smith was publicly and privately opposed to the practice and Joseph may have married some women without Emma knowing beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|pp=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emma publicly denied that her husband had ever preached or practiced polygamy,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Saints' Herald]]'' '''48''':165–66.&lt;/ref&gt; which later became a defining difference between the LDS Church under Brigham Young and the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS Church; now known as the Community of Christ), led by [[Joseph Smith III]]. Emma Smith remained affiliated with the RLDS Church until her death at the age of 74. Emma Smith claimed that the very first time she ever became aware of the 1843 polygamy revelation was when she read about it in [[Orson Pratt]]'s publication ''[[The Seer (periodical)|The Seer]]'' in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Saints' Herald]]'' '''65''':1044–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a subtle difference between "[[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]]" (which is a [[priesthood (Mormonism)|Mormon priesthood]] ordinance that binds individuals together in the eternities), and "marriage" (a social tradition in which the man and woman agree to be husband and wife in this life). In the early days of Mormonism, common practices and doctrines were not yet well-defined. Even among those who accept the views of conventional historians, there is disagreement as to the precise number of wives Smith had: [[Fawn M. Brodie]] lists 48,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. Michael Quinn]] 46,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Quinn|1994|p=587}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George D. Smith]] 38.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2010|p=621}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy is created by the lack of documents to support the alleged marriages to some of the named wives.

A number of Smith's "marriages" occurred after his death, with the wife being sealed to Smith via a proxy who stood in for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= All Things Move in Order in the City: The Nauvoo Diary of Zina Diantha Huntington Jacobs |editor-link= Maureen Ursenbach Beecher |editor-first= Maureen Ursenbach |editor-last= Beecher |last= Jacobs |first= Zina Diantha Huntington |journal= [[BYU Studies]] |volume= 19 |issue= 3 |page= 285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One historian, [[Todd M. Compton]], documented at least 33 plural marriages or sealings during Smith's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Compton|1997"/&gt; [[Richard Lloyd Anderson]] and [[Scott H. Faulring]] came up with a list of 29 wives of Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?reviewed_author&amp;vol=10&amp;num=2&amp;id=290 |title= The Prophet Joseph Smith and His Plural Wives |journal= [[FARMS Review]] |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |pages= 67–104 |location= Provo, Utah |publisher= [[Maxwell Institute]] |year= 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear how many of the wives Smith had [[sexual relations]] with. Many contemporary accounts from Smith's time indicate that he engaged in sexual relations with several of his wives.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Compton|1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Anderson |first= Richard Lloyd |last2= Faulring |first2= Scott H. |url= http://mi.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=10&amp;num=2&amp;id=290 |title= The Prophet Joseph Smith and His Plural Wives – FARMS Review |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |publisher= mi.byu.edu |date= |accessdate= 2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007}}, there are at least twelve early [[Latter Day Saints]] who, based on historical documents and circumstantial evidence, have been identified as potential Smith offspring stemming from plural marriages.

===1857–58 Utah War===
{{Main|Utah War}}
As the LDS Church settled in what became the Utah Territory, it eventually was subjected to the power and opinion of the United States. Friction first began to show in the [[Presidency of James Buchanan|James Buchanan administration]] and federal troops arrived (see [[Utah War]]). Buchanan, anticipating Mormon opposition to a newly appointed territorial governor to replace Brigham Young, dispatched 2,500 federal troops to Utah to seat the new governor, thus setting in motion a series of misunderstandings in which the Mormons felt threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Richard D. |last= Poll |authorlink= Richard D.

===1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act===
{{Main|Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act}} {{further|Poland Act}}
For the most part, the rest of the United States considered  plural marriage offensive. On July 8, 1862, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]] into law, which forbade the practice in U.S. territories. Lincoln made a statement that he had no intentions of enforcing it if the LDS Church would not interfere with him, and so the matter was laid to rest for a time. But rhetoric continued, and polygamy became an impediment to Utah being admitted as a state. Brigham Young preached in 1866 that if Utah will not be admitted to the Union until it abandons polygamy, "we shall never be admitted."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' '''11''':266.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Civil War, immigrants to Utah who were not members of the church continued the contest for political power. They were frustrated by the consolidation of the members. Forming the [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]], non-Mormons began pushing for political changes and sought to weaken the church's dominance in the territory. In September 1871, Young was indicted for adultery due to his plural marriages. On January 6, 1879, the Supreme Court upheld the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]''.

===1882 Edmunds Act===
{{Main|Edmunds Act}}
In February 1882, [[George Q. Cannon]], a prominent leader in the church, was denied a non-voting seat in the U.S. House of Representatives due to his polygamous relations. This revived the issue of polygamy in national politics. One month later, the [[Edmunds Act]] was passed by Congress, amending the Morrill Act and made polygamy a felony punishable by a $500 fine and five years in prison. "Unlawful cohabitation", in which the prosecution did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), was a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine and six months imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Embry1994 /&gt; It also revoked the right of polygamists to vote or hold office and allowed them to be punished without due process. Even if people did not practice polygamy, they would have their rights revoked if they confessed a belief in it. In August, [[Rudger Clawson]] was imprisoned for continuing to cohabit with wives that he married before the 1862 Morrill Act.

[[File:Polygamists in prison.jpg|thumb|290px|Portrait of polygamists in prison, at the Utah Penitentiary, including [[George Q. Cannon]] in 1889, arrested under the Edmunds–Tucker Act.]]
In 1887, the [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]] allowed the disincorporation of the LDS Church and the seizure of church property; it also further extended the punishments of the Edmunds Act. In July of the same year, the U.S. Attorney General filed suit to seize all church assets.

The church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, the leadership was left to navigate "underground".

Following the passage of the Edmunds–Tucker Act, the church found it difficult to operate as a viable institution. After visiting  priesthood leaders in many settlements, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] left for San Francisco on September 3, 1890, to meet with prominent businessmen and politicians. He returned to Salt Lake City on September 21, determined to obtain divine confirmation to pursue a course that seemed to be agonizingly more and more clear. As he explained to church members a year later, the choice was between, on the one hand, continuing to practice plural marriage and thereby losing the [[temple (LDS Church)|temples]], "stopping all the ordinances therein," and, on the other, ceasing plural marriage in order to continue performing the essential ordinances for the living and the dead. Woodruff hastened to add that he had acted only as the Lord directed: 

{{quote|I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I do; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1|title=Official Declaration 1|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==1890 Manifesto banning plural marriage==
{{Main|1890 Manifesto}}
The final element in Woodruff's revelatory experience came on the evening of September 23, 1890. The following morning, he reported to some of the [[general authorities]] that he had struggled throughout the night with the Lord regarding the path that should be pursued. The result was a 510-word handwritten manuscript which stated his intentions to comply with the law and denied that the church continued to solemnize or condone plural marriages. The document was later edited by [[George Q. Cannon]] of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and others to its present 356 words. On October 6, 1890, it was presented to the Latter-day Saints at the [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] and unanimously approved.

While many church leaders in 1890 regarded the [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] as inspired, there were differences among them about its scope and permanence. Contemporary opinions include the contention that the manifesto was more related to an effort to achieve statehood for the Utah territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/sfeature/utah_04.html|title=The Mormons – Special Features – PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some leaders were reluctant to terminate a long-standing practice that was regarded as divinely mandated. As a result, over 200 plural marriages were performed between 1890 and 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardy|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1904 Second Manifesto===
{{Main|Second Manifesto}}
It was not until 1904, under the leadership of church president [[Joseph F. Smith]], that the church completely banned new plural marriages worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the Sunday Schools, Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union, 1968, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, rumors persisted of marriages performed after the 1890 Manifesto, and beginning in January 1904, testimony given in the [[Reed Smoot hearings|Smoot hearings]] made it clear that plural marriage had not been completely extinguished.

The ambiguity was ended in the General Conference of April 1904, when Smith issued the "[[Second Manifesto]]", an emphatic declaration that prohibited plural marriage and proclaimed that offenders would be subject to [[Disciplinary council|church discipline]]. It declared that any who participated in additional plural marriages, and those officiating, would be excommunicated from the church. Those disagreeing with the Second Manifesto included apostles [[Matthias F. Cowley]] and [[John W. Taylor (Mormon)|John W. Taylor]], who both resigned from the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]]. Cowley retained his membership in the church, but Taylor was later excommunicated.

Although the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages, existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent church leaders, maintained existing plural marriages into the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Embry|first1=Jessie L.|title=The History of Polygamy|url=https://heritage.utah.gov/history/uhg-history-polygamy-2|website=heritage.utah.gov|publisher=Utah State Historical Society|year=1994|quote=Those involved in plural marriages after 1904 were excommunicated; and those married between 1890 and 1904 were not to have church callings where other members would have to sustain them. Although the Mormon church officially prohibited new plural marriages after 1904, many plural husbands and wives continued to cohabit until their deaths in the 1940s and 1950s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] learned that apostle [[Richard R. Lyman]] was cohabitating with a woman other than his legal wife. As it turned out, in 1925 Lyman had begun a relationship which he defined as a polygamous marriage. Unable to trust anyone else to officiate, Lyman and the woman exchanged vows secretly. By 1943, both were in their seventies. Lyman was excommunicated on November 12, 1943, at age 73. The Quorum of the Twelve provided the newspapers with a one-sentence announcement, stating that the ground for excommunication was violation of the [[law of chastity]].

Over time, many of those who rejected the LDS Church's relinquishment of plural marriage formed small, close-knit communities in areas of the Rocky Mountains. These groups continue to practice "the Principle". In the 1940s, LDS Church apostle [[Mark E. Petersen]] coined the term "[[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]]" to describe such people.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Driggs, "'This Will Someday Be the Head and Not the Tail of the Church': A History of the Mormon Fundamentalists at Short Creek", ''[[Journal of Church and State]]'' '''43''':49 (2001) at p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentalists either practice as individuals, as families, or as part of organized denominations. Today, the LDS Church objects to the use of the term "Mormon fundamentalists" and suggests using the term "polygamist sects" to avoid confusion about whether the main body of Mormon believers teach or practice polygamy.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/faqs/controversies.html|title=The Mormons . Frequently Asked Questions . Dissent/Excommunication/Controversies – PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormon fundamentalists believe that plural marriage is a requirement for [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]] and entry into the highest level of the [[celestial kingdom]]. These beliefs stem from statements by 19th-century Mormon authorities including Brigham Young (although some of these leaders gave possibly conflicting statements that a monogamist may obtain at least a lower degree of "exaltation" through mere ''belief'' in polygamy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1985|pp=24 fn. 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For public relations reasons, the LDS Church has sought vigorously to disassociate itself from Mormon fundamentalists and the practice of plural marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/mormon-fundamentalists- "Mormon Fundamentalists"], 6 March 2006 press release by the LDS Church.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the LDS Church has requested that journalists not refer to Mormon fundamentalists using the term "Mormon",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/polygamist-sects-are-not--mormons,--church-says "Polygamist Sects Are Not 'Mormons,' Church Says"], 25 October 2006 press release by the LDS Church.&lt;/ref&gt; journalists generally have not complied, and "Mormon fundamentalist" has become standard terminology. Mormon fundamentalists themselves embrace the term "[[Mormon (word)|Mormon]]" and share a religious heritage and beliefs with the LDS Church, including canonization of the [[Book of Mormon]] and a claim that Joseph Smith is the founder of their religion.

==Modern plural marriage theory within the LDS Church==
{{Main|Current state of polygamy in the Latter Day Saint movement}}

Although the LDS Church has abandoned the practice of plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. According to the church's [[sacred text]]s and pronouncements by its leaders and theologians, the church leaves open the possibility that it may one day re-institute the practice. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to be sealed to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may be sealed to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may be sealed to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may be sealed to a second wife. A deceased woman may also be sealed to multiple men, but only through [[Mormonism and polygamy#Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died|vicarious sealing]] if they are also deceased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]] (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 3.6.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for polygamy===
As early as the publication of the [[Book of Mormon]] in 1830, Latter Day Saint doctrine maintained that polygamy was allowable only if it was commanded by God. The [[Book of Jacob]] condemned polygamy as adultery,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|23|29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but left open the proviso that "For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise, they shall hearken unto these things."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the LDS Church today teaches that plural marriage can only be practiced when specifically authorized by God. According to this view, the [[1890 Manifesto]] and [[Second Manifesto]] rescinded God's prior authorization given to Joseph Smith.

However, [[Bruce R. McConkie]] controversially stated in his 1958 book, ''[[Mormon Doctrine (book)|Mormon Doctrine]]'', that God will "obviously" re-institute the practice of polygamy after the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. McConkie, ''Mormon Doctrine'', 2d ed., Bookcraft, 1966, p. 578 ("Obviously the holy practice [of plural marriage] will commence again after the Second Coming of the Son of Man and the ushering in of the millennium."). See also Janet Bennion, ''Women of Principle: Female Networking in Contemporary Mormon Polygyny'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 20 [https://books.google.com/books?id=q90cUKnsFEMC&amp;pg=PA20 online at google books]: "Ironically, many mainstream Mormons still believe plural marriage to be a law of the highest degree of heaven, simply in suspension until the millennium."&lt;/ref&gt; This echoes earlier teachings by Brigham Young that the primary purpose of polygamy was to bring about the Millennium.&lt;ref&gt;John Cairncross, ''After polygamy was made a sin: the social history of Christian polygamy'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1974, {{ISBN|0-7100-7730-0}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Current official church materials do not make any mention of the future re-institution of plural marriage.

====Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died====
In the case where a man's first wife dies, and the man remarries, and both of the marriages involve a [[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]], LDS authorities teach that in the afterlife, the man will enter a polygamous relationship with both wives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles W. Penrose]], ''"Mormon" Doctrine Plain and Simple, or Leaves from the Tree of Life'', 1897, Salt Lake City, p.66 ("In the case of a man marrying a wife in the everlasting covenant who dies while he continues in the flesh and marries another by the same divine law, each wife will come forth in her order and enter with him into his glory."); [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], [[Bruce R. McConkie]], ed., ''Doctrines of Salvation'', 1956, vol. 2, p. 67 (Smith, who was sealed to two different women, stated, "[M]y wives will be mine in the eternity."); [[Harold B. Lee]], ''Deseret News 1974 Church Almanac'', p. 17 ("My lovely Joan was sent to me: So Joan joins Fern/That three might be, more fitted for eternity./'O Heavenly Father, my thanks to thee'.").&lt;/ref&gt; Apostle [[Dallin Oaks]] is an example of such a case.&lt;ref&gt;"When I was 66, my wife June died of cancer. Two years later I married Kristen McMain, the eternal companion who now stands at my side." [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2003/10/timing "Timing"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under LDS Church policy, a man whose sealed wife has died does not have to request any permission beyond having a current temple recommend and an interview with his bishop to get final permission for a living ordinance, to be married in the temple and sealed to another woman, unless the new wife's circumstance requires a cancellation of sealing. However, a woman whose sealed husband has died is still bound by the original sealing and must request a cancellation of sealing to be sealed to another man (see next paragraph for exception to this after she dies). In some cases, women in this situation who wish to remarry choose to be married to subsequent husbands in the temple "for time only", and are not sealed to them, leaving them sealed to their first husband for eternity.

As of 1998, however, women who have died may be sealed to more than one man. In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after both she and her husband(s) have died.&lt;ref name = CHOI&gt;LDS Church, ''[[Church Handbook of Instructions]]'', (LDS Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1998) p. 72. "A deceased woman may be sealed to all men to whom she was legally married during her life. However, if she was sealed to a husband during her life, all her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed to a husband to whom she was not sealed during life."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if a widow who was sealed to her first husband remarries, she may be sealed by proxy to all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely ''offered'' to the person in the afterlife, indicating that the purpose is to allow the woman to choose the right man to be sealed to. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

====Multiple sealings when marriages end in divorce====
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012|talk=y}}
A man who is sealed to a woman but later divorced must apply for a "sealing clearance" from the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] in order to be sealed to another woman. Receiving clearance does not void or invalidate the first sealing. A woman in the same circumstances would apply to the First Presidency for a "cancellation of sealing" (sometimes called a "temple divorce"), allowing her to be sealed to another man. This approval voids the original sealing as far as the woman is concerned. Divorced women who have not applied for a sealing cancellation are considered sealed to the original husband. However, it is generally believed that even in the afterlife the marriage relationship is voluntary, so no person could be forced into an eternal relationship through temple sealing that they do not wish to be in. Divorced women may also be granted a cancellation of sealing, even though they do not intend to marry someone else. In this case, they are no longer regarded as being sealed to anyone and are presumed to have the same eternal status as unwed women.

====Proxy sealings where both spouses have died====
According to church policy, after a man has died, he may be sealed by proxy to all of the women to whom he was legally married while he was alive. The same is true for women; however, if a woman was sealed to a man while she was alive, all of her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed by proxy to them.&lt;ref name = CHOI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.familysearch.org/kb/UserGuide/en/policy/r_wws_policy_sealing_to_spouse_multiple_husbands.html|title=Help Center — FamilySearch.org|website=help.familysearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities:
# Regardless of how many people a man or woman is sealed to by proxy, they will only remain with one of them in the afterlife, and that the remaining spouses, who might still merit the full benefits of exaltation that come from being sealed, would then marry another person in order to ensure each has an eternal marriage.
# These sealings create effective plural marriages that will continue after death. There are no church teachings clarifying whether polyandrous relationships can exist in the afterlife, so some church members doubt whether this possibility would apply to women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. The possibility for women to be sealed to multiple men is a recent policy change enacted in 1998. Church leaders have neither explained this change, nor its doctrinal implications.

==Criticism of plural marriage==

===Instances of unhappy plural marriage===
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that plural marriages produced unhappiness in some wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=226–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; LDS historian Todd Compton, in his book ''[[In Sacred Loneliness]]'', described various instances where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Compton|1997"&gt;{{Harvnb|Compton|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A means for male sexual gratification===
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders established the practice of polygamy in order to further their immoral desires for sexual gratification with multiple sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=204–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics point to the fact that church leaders practiced polygamy in secret from 1833 to 1852, despite a written church doctrine (Doctrine and Covenants 101, 1835 edition) renouncing polygamy and stating that only monogamous marriages were permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanner|1987|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also cite several first-person accounts of early church leaders attempting to use the polygamy doctrine to enter into illicit relationships with women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|1876|pp=65–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1842|pp=226–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also assert that Joseph Smith instituted polygamy in order to cover up an 1835 adulterous affair with a neighbor's daughter, [[Fanny Alger]], by taking Alger as his second wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|pp=132–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compton dates this marriage to March or April 1833, well before Joseph was accused of an affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Compton|1996|pp=174–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian Lawrence Foster dismisses the marriage of Alger to Joseph Smith as "debatable supposition" rather than "established fact".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm "Review of Todd Compton, ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith''"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060323034213/http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm |date=2006-03-23 }}, ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' 33 (Spring 2001): 184–86&lt;/ref&gt;

Others conclude that many Latter-day Saints entered into plural marriage based on the belief that it was a religious commandment, rather than as an excuse for sexual license. For instance, many of the figures who came to be best associated with plural marriage, including church president Brigham Young and his counselor [[Heber C. Kimball]], expressed revulsion at the system when it was first introduced to them. Young famously stated that after receiving the commandment to practice plural marriage in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], he saw a funeral procession walking down the street and he wished he could exchange places with the corpse. He recalled that "I was not desirous of shrinking from any duty, nor of failing in the least to do as I was commanded, but it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave, and I could hardly get over it for a long time."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard J. Arrington]], ''[[Brigham Young: American Moses]]'', p. 100 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; When Kimball first heard of the principle, he believed that he would marry elderly women whom he would care for and who would not be a threat to his first wife Vilate. He was later shocked to learn that he was to marry a younger woman.&lt;ref name="Whitney 1888 p=326"&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitney|1888|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer writes that he "became sick in body, but his mental wretchedness was too great to allow of his retiring, and he would walk the floor till nearly morning, and sometimes the agony of his mind was so terrible that he would wring his hands and weep like a child".&lt;ref name="Whitney 1888 p=326"/&gt; While his wife Vilate had trials "grievous to bear" as a result of her acceptance of plural marriage, she supported her husband in his religious duties, and taught her children that "she could not doubt the plural order of marriage was of God, for the Lord had revealed it to her in answer to prayer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitney|1888|pp=325–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underage plural marriages===
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders sometimes used polygamy to take advantage of young girls for immoral purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[George D. Smith]] studied 153 men who took plural wives in the early years of the Latter Day Saint movement, and found that two of the girls were thirteen years old, 13 girls were fourteen years old, 21 were fifteen years old, and 53 were sixteen years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[George D. Smith]], "Nauvoo Polygamists", ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', Spring 1994, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Todd Compton documented that Joseph Smith married girls of age 13 or 14.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Compton|1997"/&gt; Historian Stanly Hirshon documented cases of girls aged 10 and 11 being married to old men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hirshon|1969|pp=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it seems that Brigham Young attempted to stamp out the practice of men being sealed to excessively young girls. In 1857, he stated, "I shall not seal the people as I have done. Old Father Alread brought three young girls 12 &amp; 13 years old. I would not seal them to him. They would not be equally yoked together .... Many get their endowments who are not worthy and this is the way that devils are made."&lt;ref&gt;Wilford Woodruff, Wilford Woodruff's Journal, '''5''':58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increase in bachelorhood===
As the type of polygamy practiced is primarily polygyny, critics of the early LDS Church argue that polygamy may have caused a shortage of brides in the early LDS community,&lt;ref name="Abanes 2003 pp=297"&gt;{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|pp=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing quotes by church leader [[Heber C. Kimball]] who is purported to have said (addressing departing missionaries): 

{{quote|Brethren, I want you to understand that it is not to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hirshon|1969|pp=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

On another occasion, he said  "You are sent out as shepherds to gather sheep together; and remember that they are not your sheep ... do not make selections before they are brought home and put into the fold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Journal of Discourses]] |date= August 28, 1852 |volume= 6 |page= 256 |quote= Let truth and righteousness be your motto; and do not go into the world for anything else but to preach the Gospel, build up the kingdom of God, and gather the sheep into the fold. You are sent out as shepherds to gather the sheep together; and remember that they are not your sheep: they belong to Him that sends you. Then do not make a choice of any of those sheep; do not make selections before they are brought home and put into the fold. You understand that. Amen.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first quote above is not attested in any Mormon source, but first appeared in a derisive article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on May 15, 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Hirshson's cited source of the first quote is an April 17, 1860 ''New York Times'' article: {{cite news |author= "From Our Own Correspondents" |date= April 17, 1860 |title= From Utah.; Polygamy and its Fruits—The Missionaries—The Pony Express—More Pugnacious Preaching—Death of a Prominent Physician—The Season. |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/17/news/utah-polygamy-its-fruits-missionaries-pony-express-more-pugnacious-preaching.html |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FairMormon]], an LDS apologetics organization, considers the "prettiest women" statement to be apocryphal, but that it may be a paraphrase of Kimball's ''Journal of Discourses'' statement, which is authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://en.fairmormon.org/Criticism_of_Mormonism/Books/The_Lion_of_the_Lord/Use_of_sources/Heber_C._Kimball_says_missionaries_are_%22picking_out_the_prettiest_women%22 |contribution= Heber C. Kimball says missionaries are 'picking out the prettiest women' |title= A FairMormon Analysis of: ''The Lion of the Lord'' – A work by author: Stanley P. Hirshson |publisher= [[FairMormon]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141204232534/http://en.fairmormon.org/Criticism_of_Mormonism/Books/The_Lion_of_the_Lord/Use_of_sources/Heber_C._Kimball_says_missionaries_are_%22picking_out_the_prettiest_women%22 |archive-date= 2014-12-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the paragraph immediately following the above quote, Kimball said:

{{quote|The principle of plurality of wives never will be done away. Some sisters have had revelations that when this time passes away and they go through the veil every woman will have a husband to herself. ''I wish more of our young men would take to themselves wives of the daughters of Zion and not wait for us old men to take them all''; go-ahead upon the right principle young gentlemen and God bless you forever and ever and make you fruitful, that we may fill the mountains and then the earth with righteous inhabitants.}}

The precise number who participated in plural marriage is not known, but studies indicate a maximum of 20 to 25 percent of Latter-day Saint adults were members of polygamist households. One third of the women of marriageable age and nearly all of the church leadership were involved in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]''. Macmillan (1992) p. 1095.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instances of coercion===
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church have documented several cases where deception and coercion were used to induce marriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostling|1999|pp=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example citing the case of Joseph Smith who warned some potential spouses of eternal damnation if they did not consent to be his wife.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Compton|1997"/&gt; In 1893, married LDS Church member John D. Miles traveled to England and proposed to Caroline Owens, assuring her that he was not polygamous. She returned to Utah and participated in a wedding, only to find out after the ceremony that Miles was already married. She ran away, but Miles hunted her down and raped her. She eventually escaped, and filed a lawsuit against Miles that reached the Supreme Court and became a significant case in polygamy case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gage|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ann Eliza Young]], nineteenth wife of Brigham Young, claimed that Young coerced her to marry him by threatening financial ruin of her brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|1875|pp=440–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incestuous plural marriages===
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that polygamy was used to justify marriage of close relatives that would otherwise be considered immoral.&lt;ref name="Abanes 2003 pp=297"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|1875|pp=306–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, Joseph Smith's diary records the sealing of [[John Milton Bernhisel]] to his sister, Maria, in a ceremony that included the sealing of Bernhisel to multiple relatives, some of whom were deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Faulring|1987|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is understood by most scholars as the collective sealing or binding of the family and not a marriage between Bernhisel and his sister. Similar family sealings are practiced in Latter-Day Saint temples today, where children of parents who were not sealed at the time of their marriage are sealed to their parents and to one another in a group ceremony.{{CN|date=November 2018}}

{{Taoism condensed}}
The '''Neijing Tu''' ({{zh|s=內经图|t=內經圖|p=''Nèijīng tú''|w=''Nei-ching t'u''}}) is a [[Daoist]] "inner landscape" diagram of the human body illustrating ''[[Neidan]]'' "[[Internal alchemy]]", [[Wu Xing]], [[Yin and Yang]], and [[Chinese mythology]].

==Title==
The name ''Neijing tu'' combines ''nei'' [[Wikt:內|內]] "inside; inner; internal", ''jing'' [[Wikt:經|經]] "warp (vs. woof); scripture, canon, classic; ([[Traditional Chinese medicine|TCM]]) [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]]; channel", and ''tu'' [[Wikt:圖|圖]] "picture; drawing; chart; map; plan". This title, comparable with ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' 黃帝內經 "[[Yellow Emperor]]'s Inner Canon", is generally interpreted as a "chart" or "diagram" of "inner" "meridians" or "channels" for circulating ''[[qi]]'' in ''neidan'' practices.

English translations of ''Neijing tu'' include:
*"Diagram of the Internal Texture of Man" (Needham 1983:114)
*"Diagram of the Inner Scripture" (Ching 1997:188)
*"Chart of Inner Passageways" (Despeux and Kohn 2003:184)
*"Diagram of Internal Pathways" (Komjathy 2004:40)
*"Chart of the Inner Warp" or "Chart of the Inner Landscape" (Despeux 2008:767)

''Neijing tu'' 內經圖 has an alternate writing of ''Neijing tu'' 內景圖 "Diagram of Interior Lights" (Kohn 2000:499, 521), using ''jing'' [[Wikt: 景|景]] "view; scenery; condition" as a [[variant Chinese character]] for ''jing'' 經.

==History==
While the original ''Neijing tu'' provenance is unclear, it probably dates from the 19th century (Komjathy 2004:11). All received copies derive from an engraved [[stele]] dated 1886 in [[Beijing]]'s [[White Cloud Temple]] 白雲觀 that records how Liu Chengyin 柳誠印 based it on an old silk scroll discovered in a library on [[Mount Song]] (in [[Henan]]). In addition, a [[Qing Dynasty]] colored scroll ''Neijing tu'' was painted at the [[Ruyi (scepter)|Ruyi]] Guan 如意館 "Palace of Fulfilled Wishes" library in the [[Forbidden City]] (Despeux 2008:767).

The ''Neijing Tu'' was the precursor for the ''[[Xiuzhen Tu]]'' 修真圖 "Cultivating Perfection Diagram". The earliest anatomical diagrams with Daoist ''Neidan'' symbolism are attributed to Yanluozi 煙蘿子 ([[floruit|fl.]] 10th century) and conserved in the 1250 CE ''Xiuzhen shishu'' 修真十書 "Cultivating Perfection Ten Books" (Kohn 2000:521).

==Contents==

The ''Neijing tu'' laterally depicts a human body (resembling either [[meditator]] or [[fetus]]) as a microcosm of nature – an "inner landscape" (Schipper 1993:100-112) with mountains, rivers, paths, forests, and stars. [[Joseph Needham]] (1983:114) coins the term "microsomography" and describes the ''Neijing tu'' as "much more fanciful and poetical" than previous Daoist illustrations.

The textual descriptions include names of ''[[zangfu]]'' organs, two poems attributed to [[Lü Dongbin]] 呂洞賓 (born ca. 798 CE, one of the [[Eight Immortals]]), and quotations from the ''Huangting jing'' 黃庭經 "Yellow Court Scripture".

The ''Neijing'' image of a mountain with crags on the skull and spinal column elaborates upon the "body-as-mountain" metaphor, first recorded in 1227 CE (Despeux and Kohn 2003:185). The head shows [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountains]], upper ''[[dantian]]'' "cinnabar field", [[Laozi]], [[Bodhidharma]], and two circles for the eyes (labelled "sun" and "moon"). The flanking poem explains.
 &lt;blockquote&gt;The white-headed old man's eyebrows hang down to earth; &lt;br&gt;
The blue-eyed foreign monk's arms support heaven. &lt;br&gt;
If you aspire to this mysticism; &lt;br&gt;
You will acquire its secret. (tr. Wang 1992:145) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Chinese constellation]]s figure prominently. The heart depicts Niulang 牛郎 "the cowherd" "[[Altair]]" holding the Beidou 北斗 "Northern Dipper" "[[Big Dipper]]". Together with his archetypal lover Zhinü 織女 "the weaver girl" "[[Vega]]" (see [[Qi Xi]]), they propel [[qi]] up to the tracheal Twelve-Storied Pagoda. The liver and gall bladder are a forest, the stomach is a granary, and the intestines caption reads "the iron ox ploughs the field where coins of gold are sown" (tr. Needham 1983:116) referring to the [[Elixir of life]]. At base of the spine are treadmill [[waterwheel]]s (an early [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese invention]]) being run by two children representing yin and yang.

{{History of Romania| Antiquity}}
Several theories address the issue of the '''origin of the Romanians'''. The [[Romanian language]] descends from the [[Vulgar Latin]] dialects spoken in the [[Roman provinces]] north of the "[[Jireček Line]]" (a proposed notional line separating the predominantly [[Latin language|Latin-speaking]] territories from the [[Koine Greek|Greek-speaking]] lands in [[Southeastern Europe]]) in [[Late Antiquity]]. The theory of Daco-Roman continuity argues that the [[Romanians]] are mainly descended from the [[Daco-Romans]], a people developing through the cohabitation of the native [[Dacians]] and the Roman colonists in the province of [[Dacia Traiana]] (primarily in present-day [[Romania]]) north of the river [[Danube]]. The competing immigrationist theory states that the Romanians' ethnogenesis commenced in the provinces south of the river with Romanized local populations (known as [[Vlachs]] in the Middle Ages) spreading through mountain refuges, both south to [[Greece]] and north through the [[Carpathian Mountains]].  According to the "admigration theory", migrations from the [[Balkan Peninsula]] to the lands north of the Danube contributed to the survival of a Romance-speaking population in those territories.

Political motivations{{mdash}}the Transylvanian Romanians' efforts to achieve their emancipation, Austro-Hungarian and Romanian{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=278}} expansionism, and Hungarian irredentism{{mdash}}influenced the development of the theories, and "national passions"{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=17}} still color the debates. In 2013, authors of ''The Cambridge History of the Romance Languages'' came to the conclusion that the "historical, archaeological and linguistic data available do not seem adequate to give a definitive answer" in the debate.{{sfn|Andreose|Renzi|2013|p=287}} Their view was accepted by scholars contributing to ''The Oxford Guide to the Romance Languages'', published in 2016, which concludes that "the location and extent of the territory where "Daco-Romance" originated" is uncertain.{{sfn|Maiden|2016|p=91}}

[[File:Balkans 200AD.png|thumb|alt=Roman provinces in Southeastern Europe|[[Roman province]]s (dark blue) in [[Southeastern Europe]], ''c.'' 200&amp;nbsp;AD. Romanian descended from a variant of Vulgar Latin spoken in one or more Latin-speaking provinces.]]

Three major ethnic groups{{spaced ndash}}the [[Dacians]], [[Illyrians]] and [[Thracians]]{{spaced ndash}}inhabited the northern regions of Southeastern Europe in Antiquity.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=9}} Modern knowledge of their languages is based on limited evidence (primarily on proper names), making all scholarly theories proposing a strong relationship between the three languages or between Thracian and Dacian speculative.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=405}} The Illyrians were the first to be conquered by the Romans, who organized their territory into the province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] around 60 BC.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=208}} In the lands inhabited by Thracians, the Romans set up the province of [[Moesia]] in 6&amp;nbsp;AD, and [[Thracia]] forty years later.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=110}} Present-day [[Dobruja]] was attached to Moesia in 46.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=4}} The Romans annihilated the [[Dacian kingdom]] to the north of the [[Lower Danube]] under Emperor [[Trajan]] in 106.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=5}} Its western territories were organized into the [[Roman Dacia|province of Dacia]] (or "Dacia Traiana"), but [[Maramureș]] and further regions inhabited by the [[Costoboci]], [[Bastarnae]] and other tribes remained free of Roman rule.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=98}} The Romans officially abandoned Dacia under Emperor [[Aurelian]] (''r.'' 270&amp;ndash;275), who organized a new province bearing the same name ("[[Dacia Aureliana]]") south of the Lower Danube.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|pp=103-104}} Although Roman forts were erected north of the Danube in the 320s,{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=116}} the river became the boundary between the empire and the [[Goths]] in the 360s.{{sfn|Heather|1998|p=85}}

Meanwhile, from 313 under the [[Edict of Milan]], the Roman Empire began to transform itself into a Christian state.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=29}} Roman emperors supported Christian missionaries in the lands dominated by the Goths from the 340s.{{sfn|Heather|1998|p=60}} The [[Huns]] destroyed all these territories between 376 and 406, but their empire also collapsed in 453.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=97, 124}} Thereafter the [[Gepids]] dominated Banat, [[Crișana]], and Transylvania.{{sfn|Todd|2003|pp=220, 223}} The [[Bulgars]], [[Antes people|Antes]], [[Sclavenes]] and other tribes made frequent raids across the Lower Danube against the Balkans in the 6th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=115-116}} The Roman Empire revived under Emperor [[Justinian I]] (''r.'' 527&amp;ndash;565),{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=45}} but the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who had subjugated the Gepids,{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=122}} invaded the Balkans from the 580s.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=30-31}} In 30 years all Roman troops were withdrawn from the peninsula, where only [[Dyrrhachium]], [[Thessaloniki]] and a few other towns remained under Roman rule.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=35, 41}}

The next arrivals, the Bulgars, established their own state on the Lower Danube in 681.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=67}} Their territorial expansion accelerated after the collapse of the [[Avar Khaganate]] in the 790s.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|pp=133-134}} The ruler of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] (''r.'' 852&amp;ndash;889) converted to Christianity in 864.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=108, 118, 296}} A synod of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] promoted a [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] in Old Church Slavonic in 893.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=130}} Bulgaria was invaded by the Magyars (or [[Hungarians]]) in 894,{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=9, 11-12}} but a joint counter-attack by the Bulgars and the [[Pechenegs]]{{spaced ndash}}a nomadic Turkic people{{spaced ndash}}forced the Magyars to find a new homeland in the Carpathian Basin.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=138-139}} Historians still debate whether they encountered a [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages#Dark Ages#Between Avars and Hungarians (c. 600–c. 900)|Romanian population]] in the territory.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=38}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=117-118}} The Byzantines occupied the greater part of Bulgaria under Emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]] (''r.'' 969&amp;ndash;976).{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|pp=508-510, 859}} The Bulgars regained their independence during the reign of [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuel]] (''r.'' 997&amp;ndash;1014),{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|pp=510, 871}} but Emperor [[Basil II]] of Byzantium conquered their country around 1018.{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=xx, 244-245}}

The first bishop consecrated for the Hungarians was a Greek from [[Constantinople]],{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|pp=39-40}} but their supreme ruler, [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen]], was baptized according to the [[Western Church|Western rite]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=26}} Crowned the first king of Hungary in 1000 or 1001, he expanded his rule over new territories, including Banat.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=26-27}} {{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=15-16}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=40-41}}{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=65}} Pecheneg groups, pushed by the [[Ouzes]]{{spaced ndash}}a coalition of Turkic nomads{{spaced ndash}}sought asylum in the Byzantine Empire in the 1040s.{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=298-299}} After the Ouzes there followed the [[Cumans]]{{spaced ndash}}also a Turkic confederation{{spaced ndash}}who took control of the Pontic steppes in the 1070s.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|pp=154-155}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=306}} Thereafter, specific groups, including the Hungarian-speaking [[Székelys]] and the Pechenegs, defended the frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] against them.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=74}} The arrival of mostly [[Transylvanian Saxons|German-speaking colonists]] in the 1150s also reinforced the Hungarian monarch's rule in the region.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=16}}{{sfn|Kristó|2003|pp=115-117, 129-131}}

The Byzantine authorities introduced new taxes, provoking an [[Vlach-Bulgarian Rebellion|uprising in the Balkan Mountains in 1185]].{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=289}} The local Bulgarians and Vlachs achieved their independence and established the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in coalition with the Cumans.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=40}} A chieftain of the western Cuman tribes accepted Hungarian supremacy in 1227.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=95}} The Hungarian expansion towards the Pontic steppes was halted by the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|large Mongol campaign against Eastern and Central Europe]] in 1241.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=404}} Although the Mongols withdrew in a year, their invasion caused destruction throughout the region.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=44}}

The unification of [[Foundation of Wallachia|small polities ruled by local Romanian leaders]] in [[Oltenia]] and [[Muntenia]]{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=44}} led to the establishment of a new principality, [[Wallachia]].{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=17}} It achieved independence under [[Basarab I of Wallachia|Basarab the Founder]], who defeated a Hungarian army in the [[battle of Posada]] in 1330.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=17}} A second principality, [[Moldavia]], became independent in the 1360s under [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]], a Romanian nobleman from [[Maramureș]].{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=18}}

==Theories on the Romanians' ethnogenesis==

[[File:Map Length of Roman Rule Neo Latin Languages.jpg|thumb|right|Length of Roman rule and distribution of modern [[Romance languages]]. Romanian is the only Romance language which is spoken primarily in territories which were never or only for about 170 years under Roman rule.]]

One of the first scholars who systematically studied the [[Romance languages]], [[Friedrich Christian Diez]], described Romanian as a semi-Romance language in the 1830s.{{sfn|Posner|1996|p=4}} In 2009, Kim Schulte likewise argued that "Romanian is a language with a hybrid vocabulary".{{sfn|Schulte|2009|p=250}} The proportion of loanwords in Romanian is indeed higher than in other Romance languages.{{sfn|Pei|1976|p=143}} Its certain structural features{{mdash}}such as the construction of the future tense{{mdash}}also distinguish Romanian from other Romance languages.{{sfn|Pei|1976|p=143}} The [[Balkan sprachbund|same peculiarities]] connect it to [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and other tongues spoken in the Balkan Peninsula.{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=9}} Nevertheless, as linguist Graham Mallinson emphasizes, Romanian "retains enough of its Latin heritage at all linguistic levels to qualify for membership of the Romance family in its own right", even without taking into account the "re-Romancing tendency" during its recent history.{{sfn|Mallinson|1988|p=418}} The core vocabulary is to a large degree Latin, including the most frequently used 2500 words.{{sfn|Boia|2004|p=54}}{{sfn|Pană Dindelegan|2013|p=3}} Around one-fifth of the entries of the 1958 edition of the ''Dictionary of the Modern Romanian'' have directly been inherited from Latin.{{sfn|Mallinson|1988|p=417}} More than 75% of the words in the semantic fields of sense perception, quantity, kinship and spatial relations are of Latin origin, but the basic lexicons of religion and of agriculture have also been preserved.{{sfn|Schulte|2009|pp=239, 243-244}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp=224, 269}} 

Romanians, known by the [[exonym]] [[Vlachs]] in the Middle Ages,{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=15}} speak a language descended from the [[Vulgar Latin]] that was once spoken in south-eastern Europe.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=276}}{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=4}} Inscriptions from the Roman period prove that a line, known as the "[[Jireček Line]]", can be drawn through the [[Balkan Peninsula]], which separated the Latin-speaking northern provinces, including Dacia, Moesia and [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]] from the southern regions where Greek remained the predominant language.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=128}} [[Eastern Romance languages|Eastern Romance]] now has four variants,{{sfn|Mallinson|1988|p=392}} which are former dialects of a [[Proto-Romanian language]].{{sfn|Augerot|2009|p=901}}{{sfn|Mišeska Tomić|2006|p=39}} [[Romanian language|Daco-Romanian]], the official language of Romania, is the most widespread of the four variants.{{sfn|Augerot|2009|p=901}} Speakers of the [[Aromanian language]] live in scattered communities in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and Macedonia.{{sfn|Augerot|2009|p=901}} Another two, by now nearly extinct variants, [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]], are spoken in some villages in Macedonia and Greece, and in Croatia, respectively.{{sfn|Augerot|2009|p=901}}  Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are spoken in the central and southern regions of the Balkans, indicating that they migrated to these territories in the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Mišeska Tomić|2006|p=40}}{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=320}} Some variants of the [[Eastern Romance languages]] retained more elements of their Latin heritage than others.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, both the [[Maramureș subdialect of Romanian]] and Arumanian have preserved the Latin word for sand (''arină'') instead of standard ''nisip'', a Slavic loanword.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mallinson|1988|p=412}}{{sfn|Mišeska Tomić|2006|p=665}}

The territories south of the Danube were subject to the Romanization process for about 800 years, while Dacia province to the north of the river was only for 165 years under Roman rule, which caused "a certain disaccord between the effective process of Roman expansion and [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] and the present ethnic configuration of Southeastern Europe", according to [[Lucian Boia]].{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=113-114}} Political and ideological considerations, including the dispute between Hungary and Romania over [[Transylvania]], have also colored these scholarly discussions.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=276, 280}}{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=17}} Accordingly, theories on the Romanian ''[[Urheimat]]'' or "homeland" can be divided into two or more groups, including the theory of Daco-Roman continuity of the continuous presence of the Romanians' ancestors in the lands north of the Lower Danube and the opposite immigrationist theory.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=276}}{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=4}} Independently of the theories, a number of scholars propose that Romanian developed from the tongue of a bilingual population, because bilingualism is the most probable explanation for its peculiarities.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=131}}{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=141}}{{sfn|Schulte|2009|p=235}}{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=335}}

===Historiography: origin of the theories===

[[Byzantine literature|Byzantine authors]] were the first to write of the Romanians (or Vlachs).{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=13}} The 11th-century scholar [[Kekaumenos]] wrote of a Vlach homeland situated "near the Danube and&amp;nbsp;[...]&amp;nbsp;the Sava, where the Serbians lived more recently".{{sfn|Madgearu|2005a|p=56}}&lt;ref&gt;''Cecaumeno: Consejos de un aristócrata bizantino'' (12.4.2), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; He associates the Vlachs with the Dacians and the [[Bessi]] and with the Dacian king [[Decebal]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2005a|pp=56-57}} Accordingly, historians have located this homeland in several places, including [[Pannonia Inferior]] ([[Bogdan Petriceicu Hașdeu]]) and "Dacia Aureliana" (Gottfried Schramm).{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=323}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2005a|p=56}} When associating the Vlachs with ancient ethnic groups, Kekaumenos followed the the practice of Byzantine authors who named contemporary peoples for peoples known from ancient sources.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=215}} The 12th-century scholar [[John Kinnamos]] wrote that the Vlachs "are said to be formerly colonists from the people of Italy".{{sfn|Kristó|2003|p=139}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=132}}&lt;ref&gt;''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus by John Kinnamos'' (6.3.260), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Rubruck]] wrote that the Vlachs of Bulgaria descended from the ''Ulac'' people,&lt;ref&gt;''The Mission of Friar William of Rubruck'' (21.3.), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; who lived beyond [[Bashkirs|Bashkiria]].{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp=77-78}} Rubruck's words imply that he regarded the Vlachs a migrant population, coming from the region of the Volga like their Hungarian and Bulgarian neighbors.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=78}} The late 13th-century Hungarian chronicler [[Simon of Kéza]] states that the Vlachs used to be the Romans' "shepherds and husbandmen" who "elected to remain behind in Pannonia"&lt;ref&gt;''Simon of Kéza: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (chapter 14.), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; when the Huns arrived.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005a|pp=46-47}} An unknown author's ''Description of Eastern Europe'' from 1308 likewise states that the Balkan Vlachs "were once the [[shepherds of the Romans]]" who "had over them ten powerful kings in the entire [[Moesia|Messia]] and Pannonia".{{sfn|Madgearu|2005a|pp=54-55}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=76}}

[[Poggio Bracciolini]], an Italian scholar was the first to write (around 1450) that the Romanians' ancestors had been Roman colonists settled in Dacia Traiana.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=4}} In 1458, [[Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini]] stated in his work ''De Europa'' (1458) that the Vlachs were a ''genus Italicum'' ("an Italian race")&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini: Europe'' (ch. 2.14.), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and were named after one Pomponius Flaccus, a commander sent against the Dacians.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=5}} Piccolomini's version of the Vlachs' origin from Roman settlers in Dacia Traiana was repeated by many scholars{{mdash}}including the Italian [[Flavio Biondo]] and [[Pietro Ranzano]], the Transylvanian Saxon Johannes Lebelius and the Hungarian [[Stephan Szántó]]{{mdash}}in the subsequent century.{{sfn|Almási|2010|pp=107, 109-109}}{{sfn|Armbruster |1972|p=61}} On the other hand, [[Laonikos Chalkokondyles]]{{mdash}}a late-15th-century Byzantine scholar{{mdash}}stated that he never heard anyone "explain clearly where" the Romanians "came from to inhabit" their lands.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=19}} Chalkokondyles also wrote that the Romanians were said to have come "from many places and settled that area".&lt;ref&gt;''Laonikos Chalkokondyles: Demonstrations of Histories'', p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century [[Johannes Lucius]] expressed his concerns about the survival of Romans in the territory of the former Dacia Traiana province, exposed to invasions for a millennium.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=19}}

A [[Foundation of Moldavia#'Dismounting' by Dragoş|legend on the origin of the Moldavians]], preserved in the ''Moldo-Russian Chronicle'' from around 1505,{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=11}}{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=197}} narrates that one "King Vladislav of Hungary" invited their Romanian ancestors to his kingdom and settled them "in Maramureş between the ''Moreş'' and Tisa at a place called ''Crij''".{{sfn|Vékony|2000|pp=11-13}} ''[[Logothete|Logofăt]]'' Istratie and other 17th-century Moldavian historians continued to credit "King Vladislav" with the settlement of the Romanians' ancestors in Maramureş.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=13}} [[Grigore Ureche]]'s  ''Chronicle of Moldavia'' of 1647{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=69}} is the first Romanian historical work stating that the Romanians "all come from ''Rîm''" (Rome).{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=85}}{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=14}} In 30 years [[Miron Costin]] explicitly connected the Romanians' [[ethnogenesis]] to the conquest of "Dacia Traiana".{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=69-70}} [[Constantin Cantacuzino (stolnic)|Constantin Cantacuzino]] stated in 1716 that the native Dacians also had a role in the formation of the Romanian people.{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=85}}{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=16}} [[Petru Maior]] and other historians of the "[[Transylvanian School]]" flatly denied any interbreeding between the natives and the conquerors, claiming that the autochthonous Dacian population which was not eradicated by the Romans fled the territory.{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=85-86}} The Daco-Roman mixing became widely accepted in the Romanian historiography around 1800. This view is advocated by the Greek-origin historians [[Dimitrie Philippide]] (in his 1816 work ''History of Romania'') and [[Dionisie Fotino]], who wrote ''History of Dacia'' (1818).{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=86}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=116}} The idea was accepted and taught in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], including Hungary until the 1870s,{{sfn|Pohl|2013|pp=23-24}} although the Austrian Franz Joseph Sulzer had by the 1780s rejected any form of continuity north of the Danube, and instead proposed a 13th-century migration from the Balkans.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|pp=19-20}}

The development of the theories was closely connected to political debates in the {{nobr|18th century}}.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=12}}{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=22}}{{sfn|Deletant|1992|p=134}} Sulzer's theory of the Romanians' migration was apparently connected to his plans on the annexation of Wallachia and Moldavia by the Habsburg Monarchy, and the settlement of German colonists in both principalities.{{sfn|Holban|2000|pp=20, 23, 456, 460, 474}} The three political "nations" of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Principality of Transylvania]] (the Hungarians, Saxons and Székelys) enjoyed special privileges, while local legislation emphasized that the Romanians had been "admitted into the country for the public good" and they were only "tolerated for the benefit of the country".{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=22}}{{sfn|Prodan|1971|p=12}} When suggesting that the Romanians of Transylvania were the direct descendants of the Roman colonists in Emperor Trajan's Dacia, the historians of the "Transylvanian School" also demanded that the Romanians were to be regarded as the oldest residents of the country.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=22}}{{sfn|Deletant|1992|pp=134-135}} The ''[[Supplex Libellus Valachorum]]''{{spaced ndash}}a petition completed by the representatives of the local Romanians in 1791{{spaced ndash}}explicitly demanded that the Romanians should be granted the same legal status that the three privileged "nations" had enjoyed because the Romanians were of Roman stock.{{sfn|Deletant|1992|p=135}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=91}}

===Theory of Daco-Roman continuity===

[[File:Vatra.jpg|left|thumb|The Romanians' homeland (horizontal red lines in center) and their migrations (red arrows) in the 4th-7th centuries (a map presenting views proposed by scholars who accept the "continuity" theory)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The map also depicts the "Jireček Line" (yellow), the Latin- and Greek-speaking territories (pink and blue areas, respectively), and the Albanians' supposed homeland (yellow areas).&lt;/ref&gt;|215x215px]]

Scholars supporting the continuity theory argue that the Romanians descended primarily from the inhabitants of "[[Dacia Traiana]]", the province encompassing three or four [[Historical regions of Romania|regions of present-day Romania]] to the north of the Lower Danube from 106.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|pp=17-18}} In these scholars' view, the close contacts between the autochthonous Dacians and the Roman colonists led to the formation of the Romanian people because masses of provincials stayed behind after the [[Roman Empire]] [[Aurelian Retreat|abandoned the province]] in the early 270s.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=7-8}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=22-23, 28}}{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|p=50}} Thereafter the process of Romanization expanded to the neighboring regions due to the free movement of people across the former imperial borders.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=29}}{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|p=52}} The spread of Christianity contributed to the process, since Latin was the [[Sacred language|language of liturgy]] among the Daco-Romans.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=29}} The Romans held bridgeheads norths of the Lower Danube, keeping Dacia within their sphere of influence uninterruptedly until 376.{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|p=51}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=10}} Proponents of the theory argues that the north-Danubian regions remained the main "center of Romanization" after the Slavs started assimilating the Latin-speaking population in the lands south of the river, or forcing them to move even further south in the 7th century.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=12-13}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=32-33}}{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|pp=131-132}} Although for a millennium [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages|migratory peoples invaded the territory]], a sedentary Christian [[Romance languages|Romance-speaking]] population survived, primarily in the densely forested areas, separated from the "heretic" or pagan invaders.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=30-31}} {{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|p=61}} Only the "semisedentarian" Slavs exerted some influence on the Romanians' ancestors, especially after they adopted Orthodox Christianity in the 9th century.{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=32-33}}{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|pp=58-59, 61}} They played the role in the Romanians' ethnogenesis that the Germanic peoples had played in the formation of other Romance peoples.{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=32-33}}{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|pp=58-59, 61}}{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=131}}

Historians who accept the continuity theory emphasize that the Romanians "form the numerically largest people" in southeastern Europe.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=10}}{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|p=45}}{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=108}}{{sfn|Sala|2005|p=13}} Romanian ethnographers point at the "striking similarities" between the traditional Romanian folk dress and the Dacian dress depicted on [[Trajan's Column]] as a clear evidence for the connection between the ancient Dacians and modern Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Velcescu|first=Leonard|date=2011|title=Reprezentările sculpturale de Daci în Forul lui Traian (Roma) şi importanţa lor pentru cultura română  (Les représentations sculpturales de Daces du Forum de Trajan (Rome) et leur importance pour la culture roumaine)|url=|journal=Antichitatea Clasica şi Noi|volume=|pages=294-315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ETNOGRAFIA POPORULUI ROMAN|last=Prof. Dr. Praoveanu|first=Ioan|publisher=Paralela 45|year=2004|isbn=|location=Brasov|pages=2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also highlight the importance of the massive and organized colonization of Dacia Traiana.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=6}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=22}}{{sfn|Sala|2005|p=10}} One of them, Coriolan H. Opreanu underlines that "nowhere else has anyone defied reason by stating that a [Romance] people, twice as numerous as any of its neighbours..., is only accidentally inhabiting the territory of a former Roman province, once home to a numerous and strongly Romanized population".{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=108}} With the colonists coming from many provinces and living side by side with the natives, Latin must have emerged as their common language.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=6}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=22}}{{sfn|Sala|2005|pp=10-11}} The Dacians willingly adopted the conquerors' superior culture and they spoke Latin as native tongue after two or three generations.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=7}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=23-28}} Estimating the provincials' number at 500,000-1,000,000 in the 270s, supporters of the continuity theory rule out the possibility that masses of Latin-speaking commoners abandoned the province when the Roman troops and officials left it.{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|p=50}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=28}}{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=17}} Historian Ioan-Aurel Pop concludes that the relocation of hundreds of thousands of people across the Lower Danube in a short period was impossible, especially because the commoners were unwilling to "move to foreign places, where they had nothing of their own and where the lands were already occupied."{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=28}} Romanian historians also argue that Roman sources failed to mention that the whole population was moved from Dacia Traiana.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=17}} 

Most Romanian scholars accepting the continuity theory regard the archaeological evidence for the uninterrupted presence of a Romanized population in the lands now forming Romania undeniable.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=28}}{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|pp=52, 62}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=8-10}}{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=127}} Especially, artefacts bearing Christian symbolism, hoards of bronze Roman coins and Roman-style pottery are listed among the archaeological finds verifying the theory.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=10}}{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|pp=51-52, 54-55}} The same scholars emphasize that the Romanians directly inherited the basic Christian terminology from Latin, which also substantiates the connection between Christian objects and the Romanians' ancestors.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|p=56}} Other scholars who support the same theory underline that the connection between certain artefacts or [[Assemblage (archaeology)|archaeological assemblages]] and ethnic groups is uncertain.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=127}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=104-105}} Instead of archaeological evidence, Alexandru Madgearu highlights the importance of the linguistic traces of continuity, referring to the Romanian river names in the [[Apuseni Mountains]] and the preservation of archaic Latin lexical elements in the local dialect.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=105}} The survival of the names of the largest rivers from Antiquity is often cited as an evidence for the continuity theory,{{sfn|Felecan|Felecan|2015|p=259}}{{sfn|Sala|2005|p=17}} although some linguists who support it notes that a Slavic-speaking population transmitted them to modern Romanians.{{sfn|Tomescu|2009|p=2728}} Some words directly inherited from Latin are also said to prove the continuous presence of the Romanians' ancestors north of the Danube, because they refer to things closely connected to these regions.{{sfn|Sala|2005|pp=22-23}} For instance, linguists [[Grigore Nandriș]] and Marius Sala argue that the Latin words for natural oil, gold and bison could only be preserved in the lands to the north of the river.{{sfn|Nandris|1951|p=16}}{{sfn|Sala|2005|pp=22-23}}

Written sources did not mention the Romanians, either those who lived north of the Lower Danube or those living to the south of the river, for centuries.{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|pp=47-48}} Scholars supporting the continuity theory notes that the silence of sources does not contradict it, because early medieval authors named the foreign lands and their inhabitants after the ruling peoples.{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|pp=47-48}} Hence, they mentioned Gothia, Hunia, Gepidia, Avaria, Patzinakia and Cumania, and wrote of Goths, Huns, Gepids, Avars, Pechenegs and Cumans, without revealing the multi-ethnic character of these realms.{{sfn|Brezeanu|1998|pp=47-48}} References to the ''Volokhi'' in the ''Russian Primary Chronicle'', and to the ''Blakumen'' in Scandinavian sources are often listed as the first records of north-Danubian Romanians.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=14}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=51-54}}{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|p=139}} The ''Gesta Hungarorum''{{mdash}}the oldest extant Hungarian chronicle{{mdash}}mentioned the Vlachs and the "shepherds of the Romans" (along with the Bulgarians, Slavs, Greeks and other peoples) among the inhabitants of the Carpathian Basin at the time of the arrival of the Magyars (or Hungarians) in the late 9th century; [[Simon of Kéza]]'s later Hungarian chronicle identified the Vlachs as the "Romans shepherds and husbandman" who remained in Pannonia.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=14}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=46-47}} {{sfn|Pop|1999|p=37}} Pop concludes that the two chronicles "assert the Roman origin of Romanians... by presenting them as the Romans' descendants" who stayed in the former Roman provinces.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=36}}

===Immigrationist theory===

[[File:Map Romanian Dawns.jpg|thumb|right|The Romanians' homeland and their medieval migrations (a map presenting views proposed by scholars who accept the "immigrationist theory")|215x215px]]

Scholars who support the immigrationist theory propose that the Romanians descended from the Romanized inhabitants of the provinces to the south of the Danube.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=326}}{{sfn|Izzo|1986|pp=144-145}}{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=47, 113, 114}} Following the collapse of the empire's frontiers around 620, some of this population moved south to regions where Latin had not been widely spoken.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=304, 309}} Others took refuge in the [[Balkan Mountains]] where they adopted an itinerant form of sheep- and goat-breeding, giving rise to the modern [[Vlach]] shepherds.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=326}} Their mobile lifestyle contributed to their spread in the mountainous zones.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=326}}{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=186}} The start of their northward migration cannot exactly be dated, but they did not settle in the lands north to the Lower Danube before the end of the 10th century and they crossed the Carpathians after the mid-12th century.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=340-342}}

Immigrationist scholars emphasize that all other Romance languages developed in regions which had been under Roman rule for more than 500 years and nothing suggests that Romanian was an exception.{{sfn|Izzo|1986|p=143}}{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=288}} Even in Britain, where the Roman rule lasted for 365 years (more than twice as long as in Dacia Traiana) the pre-Roman languages survived.{{sfn|Izzo|1986|p=143}} Proponents of the theory have not developed a consensual view about the Dacians' fate after the Roman conquest, but they agree that the presence of a non-Romanized rural population (either the remnants of the local Dacians, or immigrant tribesmen) in Dacia Traiana is well-documented.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=290, 292-295}}{{sfn|Vékony|2000|pp=120-123}} The same scholars find it hard to believe that the Romanized elements preferred to stay behind when the Roman authorities announced the withdrawal of the troops from the province and offered the civilians to also move to the Balkans.{{sfn|Izzo|1986|p=143}}{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=297-298}} Furthermore, the Romans had started fleeing from Dacia Traiana decades before it was abandoned.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|pp=121, 127, 135, 139}}

Almost no place name has been preserved in the former province (while more than twenty settlements still bear a name of Roman origin in England).{{sfn|Izzo|1986|p=143}} The present forms of the few river names inherited from Antiquity show that non-Latin-speaking populations{{mdash}}Dacians and Slavs{{mdash}}mediated them to the modern inhabitants of the region.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=292}} Both literary sources and archaeological finds confirm this conjecture: the presence of Carpians, Vandals, Taifals, Goths, Gepids, Huns, Slavs, Avars, Bulgarians and Hungarians in the former Roman province in the early Middle Ages is well documented.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|pp=155-156, 159-163, 167, 170-171, 173}} Sporadic references to few Latin-speaking individuals{{mdash}}merchants and prisoners of war{{mdash}}among the Huns and Gepids in the 5th century does not contradict this picture.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|pp=160-161, 167}} Since Eastern Germanic peoples inhabited the lands to the north of the Lower Danube for more than 300 years, the lack of loanwords borrowed from them also indicates that the Romanians' homeland was located in other regions.{{sfn|Izzo|1986|p=143}}{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=295}} Likewise, no early borrowings from Eastern or Western Slavic languages can be proven, although the Romanians' ancestors should have had much contact with Eastern and Western Slavs to the north of the Danube.{{sfn|Izzo|1986|p=144}}

Immigrationist scholars underline that the population of the Roman provinces to the south of the Danube was "thoroughly Latinized".{{sfn|Izzo|1986|p=144}} Romanian has common features with idioms spoken in the Balkans (especially with Albanian and Bulgarian), suggesting that these languages developed side by side for centuries.{{sfn|Izzo|1986|p=144}}{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=308, 315-316, 320-322}} Southern Slavic loanwords also abound in Romanian.{{sfn|Izzo|1986|p=144}} Literary sources attest the presence of significant Romance-speaking groups in the Balkans (especially in the mountainous regions) in the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=322-324}}{{sfn|Vékony|2000|pp=206-209, 211-215}} Dozens of place names of Romanian origin can still be detected in the same territory.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=323}} The Romanians became Orthodox Christians and adopted [[Old Church Slavonic]] as liturgical language, which could hardly happen in the lands to the north of the Danube after 864 (when [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] converted to Christianity).{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=337}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=117-118}} Early medieval documents unanimously describe the Vlachs as a mobile pastoralist population.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=326-329}} Slavic and Hungarian loanwords also evince that the Romanians' ancestors adopted a settled way of life only at a later phase of their ethnogenesis.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=309}}

Reliable sources refer to the Romanians' presence in the lands to the north of the Danube for the first time in the 1160s. No place names of Romanian origin were recorded where early medieval settlements existed in this area.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=118}} Here, the Romanians adopted Hungarian, Slavic and German toponyms, also indicating that they arrived after the Saxons settled in southern Transylvania in the mid-12th century.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=118-119}}{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=339-341}} The Romanians initially formed scattered communities in the Southern Carpathians, but their northward expansion is well-documented from the second half of the 13th century.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=342}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=119, 270}} Both the monarchs and individual landowners (including Roman Catholic prelates) promoted their immigration, because the Romanian sheep-herders strengthened the defense of the borderlands and colonised areas which could not be brought into agricultural cultivation.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=270-271}}{{sfn|Makkai|1994|pp=195-197}} The Romanians adopted a sedentary way of life after they started settling on the edge of lowland villages in the mid-14th century.{{sfn|Makkai|1994|pp=214-215}} Their immigration continued  during the following centuries and they gradually took possession of the settlements in the plains which had been depopulated by frequent incursions.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=343}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=331}}

===Admigration theory ===
According to the "admigration theory", proposed by [[Dimitrie Onciul]], the formation of the Romanian people occurred in the former "Dacia Traiana" province, and in the central regions of the Balkan Peninsula.{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=117}}{{sfn|Schramm|1997|pp=277-278}}{{sfn|Pană Dindelegan|2013|p=1}} However, the Balkan Vlachs' northward migration ensured that these centers remained in close contact for centuries.{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=117}}{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=278}} It's a compromise between immigrationist and continuity theories.{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=117}}

[[John Skylitzes]]'s chronicle contains one of the earliest records on the Balkan Vlachs.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=102}}{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=211}} He mentions that "some vagabond Vlachs"&lt;ref&gt;''John Skylitzes: A Synopsis of Byzantine History'' (ch. 16.), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; killed [[David (noble)|David]], one of the four [[Cometopuli]] brothers between [[Kastoria]] and [[Prespa]] in 976.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|p=152}}{{sfn|Vékony|2000|pp=211-212}} After the Byzantine occupation of Bulgaria, Emperor Basil II set up the [[autocephalous]] [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]] with the right from 1020 to collect income "from the Vlachs in the whole of ''[[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]'' of [[Bulgaria (theme)|Bulgaria]]".{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=19}}{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=79}} The late 11th-century Kekaumenos relates that the Vlachs of the region of [[Larissa]] had "the custom of having their herds and families stay in high mountains and other really cold places from the month of April to the month of September".{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=280}}&lt;ref&gt;''Cecaumeno: Consejos de un aristócrata bizantino'' (12.3.4), p. 115.''&lt;/ref&gt; A passing remark by [[Anna Komnene|Anna Comnena]] reveals that nomads of the Balkans were "commonly called Vlachs" around 1100.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=215}}{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=20}}&lt;ref&gt;''Anna Comnena: The Alexiad'' (8.3.), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, the Balkan Vlachs cooperated with the Cumans against the Byzantine Empire, for instance by showing them "the way through the passes"&lt;ref&gt;''Anna Comnena: The Alexiad'' (10.3.), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Stara Planina]] in the 1090s.{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=21}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=281}}

Most information on the 1185 uprising of the Bulgars and Vlachs and the subsequent establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire is based on Niketas Choniates's chronicle.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=358}} He states that it was "the rustling of their cattle"&lt;ref&gt;''O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates'' (5.1.368) , p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; which provoked the Vlachs to rebel against the imperial government.{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=289}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=358-359}} Besides him, Ansbert, and a number of other contemporary sources refer to the Vlach origin of the [[Asen dynasty|Asen brothers]] who initiated the revolt.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Ansbert referred to one of the Asen brothers, [[Peter II of Bulgaria]] as "Kalopetrus Flachus".&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|pp=36-37}} The Vlachs' pre-eminent role in the Second Bulgarian Empire is demonstrated by ''Blacia'', and other similar denominations under which the new state was mentioned in contemporary sources.{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=27}} The ''[[Annales Florolivienses]]'', the first such source,{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=29}} mentions  the route of Emperor [[Frederick I Barbarossa]] "through Hungary, [[Kievan Rus'|Russia]], [[Cumania]], ''Vlakhia'', [[Durrës|Durazzo]], Byzantium and [[Sultanate of Rum|Turkey]]" during [[Third Crusade#Barbarossa's crusade|his crusade of 1189]].{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=29}} [[Pope Innocent III]] used the terms "Vlachia and Bulgaria" jointly when referring to the whole territory of the Second Bulgarian Empire.{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=30}} Similarly, the chronicler [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] refers to the Bulgarian ruler [[Kaloyan]] as "Johanitsa, the king of Vlachia and Bulgaria".{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=30}}&lt;ref&gt;''Geoffrey Villehardouin: The Conquest of Constantinople'' (6.202), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Icelandic author [[Snorri Sturluson]] mentioned the Balkan Vlachs' territory  as ''[[Blakumen#Blokumannaland|Blokumannaland]]'' in his early 13th-century text ''[[Heimskringla]]''.{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=56}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp=105-106}}  William of Rubruck distinguished Bulgaria from ''Blakia''.{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=30}} He stated that "Bulgaria, ''Blakia'' and [[Slavonia]] were provinces of the Greeks",&lt;ref&gt;''The Mission of Friar William of Rubruck'' (21.5.), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that his ''Blakia'' was also located south of the Danube.{{sfn|Vásáry|2005|p=30}} Likewise, the "Vlach lands" mentioned in the works of [[Abulfeda]], [[Ibn Khaldun]] and other medieval Muslim authors are identical with Bulgaria.{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=132}}

====Uncertain references====

{{Further|Blakumen}}

The 10th-century Muslim scholars, [[Al-Muqaddasi]] and [[Ibn al-Nadim]] mentioned the ''Waladj'' and the ''Blaghā'', respectively in their lists of peoples.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp=82-83}} The lists also refer to the [[Khazars]], [[Alans]], and Greeks, and it is possible that the two ethnonyms refer to Vlachs dwelling somewhere in south-eastern Europe.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=83}} For instance, historian Alexandru Madgearu says that Al-Muqaddasi's work is the first reference to Romanians living north of the Danube.{{sfn|Madgearu|1997|pp=161}}  [[Victor Spinei]] writes that a [[runestone]] which was set up around 1050 contains the earliest reference to Romanians living east of the Carpathians.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=54}} It refers to ''[[Blakumen]]'' who killed a [[Varangian]] merchant at an unspecified place.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=54}} The 11th-century Persan writer, [[Gardizi]], wrote about a Christian people called ''N.n.d.r'' inhabiting the lands along the Danube.{{sfn|Armbruster|1972|p=11}} Historian [[Adolf Armbruster]] identified this people as Vlachs.{{sfn|Armbruster|1972|p=11}} In Hungarian, the Bulgarians were called ''Nándor'' in the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=63}}

The ''[[Russian Primary Chronicle]]'' from 1113 contains possible references to Vlachs in the Carpathian Basin.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=51}}{{sfn|Kristó|2003|p=31}} It relates how the ''Volokhi'' seized "the territory of the Slavs"&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Primary Chronicle'' (years 6396&amp;ndash;6406), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and were expelled by the Hungarians.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=51-53}}{{sfn|Deletant|1992|p=84}} Therefore, the Slavs' presence antedates the arrival of the ''Volokhi'' in the chronicle's narration.{{sfn|Kristó|2003|p=31}} Madgearu and many other historians argue that the ''Volokhi'' are Vlachs, but the ''Volokhi'' have also been identified with either Romans or Franks annexing Pannonia (for instance, by [[Lubor Niederle]] and by Dennis Deletant respectively).{{sfn|Kristó|2003|p=31}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=52-53, n45 on p. 163}}{{sfn|Deletant|1992|pp=84-85}}

The poem ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' from the early 1200s mentions one "duke Ramunc of Wallachia"&lt;ref&gt;''The Nibelungenlied: The Lay of the Nibelungs'' (22.1342), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; in the retinue of [[Attila the Hun]].{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=56}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=355}} The poem alludes to the Vlachs along with the Russians, Greeks, Poles and [[Pechenegs]], and may refer to a "Wallachia" east of the Carpathians.{{sfn|Spinei|1986|pp=56-57}} The identification of the Vlachs and the ''[[Bolokhoveni]]'' of the ''[[Hypatian Chronicle]]'' whose land bordered on the [[Principality of Halych]] is not unanimously accepted by historians (for instance, Victor Spinei refuses it).{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp=161-162}}

''[[Tumuli]]'' erected for a cremation rite appeared in Oltenia and in Transylvania around 100&amp;nbsp;BC, thus preceding the emergence of the Dacian kingdom.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2005|p=45}} Their rich inventory has analogies in archaeological sites south of the Danube.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2005|p=45}} Although only around 300 graves from the next three centuries have been unearthed in Romania, they represent multiple burial rites, including ''[[ustrinum]]'' cremation{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=405}} and [[inhumation]].{{sfn|Lockyear|2004|pp=63-65}} New villages in the Mureș valley prove a demographic growth in the 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2005|p=46}} Fortified settlements were erected on hilltops,{{sfn|Rustoiu|2005|p=46}} mainly in the [[Orăştie Mountains]],{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=405}} but open villages remained the most common type of settlement.{{sfn|Lockyear|2004|p=37}} In contrast with the finds of 25,000 Roman ''[[denarii]]'' and their local copies, imported products were virtually missing in Dacia.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=407}} The interpretations of Geto-Dacian archaeological findings are problematic because they may be still influenced by methodological nationalism.{{sfn|Daskalov|Vezenkov|2015|p=47}}

The conquering Romans destroyed all fortresses{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=75}} and the main Dacian sanctuaries around 106 AD.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=227}} All villages disappeared because of the demolition.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=75}} Roman settlements built on the location of former Dacian ones have not been identified yet.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=75}} However, the rural communities at [[Boarta]], [[Cernat, Covasna|Cernat]], and other places used "both traditional and Roman items", even thereafter.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=76}} Objects representing local traditions have been unearthed at Roman villas in [[Aiudul de Sus]], [[Deva, Romania|Deva]] and other places as well.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=143}} A feature of the few types of native [[pottery]] which continued to be produced in Roman times is the "Dacian cup", a mostly hand-made mug with a wide rim,{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=50}} which was used even in military centers.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=225}} The use of a type of tall cooking pot indicates the survival of traditional culinary practices as well.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=225}}

Colonization and the presence of military units gave rise to the emergence of most towns in "Dacia Traiana": for instance, [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]] was founded for veterans, [[Apulum (castra)|Apulum]] and [[Potaissa]] started to develop as ''[[canabae]]''.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|pp=88-89}} Towns were the only places where the presence of Christians can be assumed based on objects bearing Christian symbolism, including a lamp and a cup decorated with crosses, which have been dated to the Roman period.{{sfn|Madgearu|2004|p=41}} Rural cemeteries characterized by burial rites with analogies in sites east of the Carpathians attest to the presence of immigrant "barbarian" communities, for instance, at [[Obreja]] and [[Soporu de Câmpie]].{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=79}} Along the northwestern frontiers of the province, "[[Przeworsk culture|Przeworsk]]" settlements were unearthed at [[Boineşti]], [[Cehăluţ]], and other places.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=99}}

Archaeological finds suggest that attacks against Roman Dacia became more intensive from the middle of the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century: an inscription from Apulum hails Emperor [[Decius]] (''r.'' 249&amp;ndash;251) as the "restorer of Dacia"; and coin hoards ending with pieces minted in this period have been found.{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=52}} Inscriptions from the 260s attest that the two Roman legions of Dacia were transferred to [[Pannonia Superior]] and Italy.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=103}} Coins bearing the inscription "DACIA FELIX" minted in 271 may reflect that Trajan's Dacia still existed in that year,{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=103}} but they may as well refer to the establishment of the new province of "Dacia Aureliana".{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=55}}

The differentiation of archaeological finds from the periods before and after the Roman withdrawal is not simple, but [[Archiud]], Obreja, and other villages produced finds from both periods.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=109}} Towns have also yielded evidence on locals staying behind.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=10}} For instance, in Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegatusa, at least one building was inhabited even in the 4th century, and a local factory continued to produce pottery, although "in a more restricted range".{{sfn|Oltean|2007|pp=174, 185}} Roman coins  from the 3rd and 4th&amp;nbsp;centuries, mainly minted in bronze, were found in Banat where small Roman forts were erected in the 290s.{{sfn|Ellis|1998|pp=231-232}} Coins minted under Emperor Valentinian I (''r.'' 364&amp;ndash;375) were also found in Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, where the gate of the [[amphitheatre|amphitheater]] was walled at an uncertain date.{{sfn|Vékony|2000|pp=144-145}} A [[Biertan Donarium|votive plate]] found near a spring at [[Biertan]] bears a Latin inscription dated to the 4th century, and has analogies in objects made in the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Madgearu|2004|pp=46, 48-49}} Whether this ''donarium'' belonged to a Christian missionary, to a local cleric or layman or to a pagan Goth making an offering at the spring is still debated by archaeologists.{{sfn|Madgearu|2004|p=47, 49}}

A new cultural synthesis, the "[[Sântana de Mureş-Chernyakhov culture]]", spread through the plains of Moldavia and Wallachia in the early 4th century.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=117}} It incorporated elements of the "[[Wielbark culture]]" of present-day Poland and of local tradition.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=37-38}}{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=88-89}} More than 150 "Sântana de Mureş-Chernyakhov" settlements{{sfn|Niculescu|2007|p=145}} suggest that the territory experienced a demographic growth.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=117}} Three sites in the Eastern Carpathians already inhabited in the previous century&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Botoşana]], [[Dodeşti]], and [[Mănoaia]] ''(Heather, Matthews 1991, p. 91.)''.&lt;/ref&gt; prove the natives' survival as well.{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=91-92}} Growing popularity of inhumation burials also characterizes the period.{{sfn|Ellis|1998|p=230}} "Sântana de Mureş-Chernyakhov" cemeteries from the 4th century were also unearthed in Transylvania.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=70}}
Coin hoards ending with pieces from the period between 375 and 395 unearthed at [[Bistreţ]], [[Gherla]], and other settlements{{sfn|Madgearu|2004|p=42}} point to a period of uncertainty.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=76}} Featuring elements of the "Przeworsk" and "Sântana de Mureş-Chernyakhov" cultures also disappeared around 400.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=119}} Archaeological sites from the next centuries have yielded finds indicating the existence of scattered communities bearing different traditions.{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp=43, 48-49}} Again, cremation became the most widespread burial rite east of the Carpathians, where a new type of building{{spaced ndash}}sunken huts with an oven in the corner{{spaced ndash}}also appeared.{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=48}} The heterogeneous vessel styles were replaced by the more uniform "Suceava-Şipot" [[archaeological horizon]] of hand made pottery from the 550s.{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=56}}

In contrast with the regions east of the Carpathians, Transylvania experienced the spread of the "row grave" horizon of inhumation necropolises in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century,{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=120}} also known from the same period in Austria, [[Bohemia]], [[Transdanubia]] and [[Thuringia]].{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=85}} At the same time, large villages appeared in Crișana and Transylvania,{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=54}} in most cases in places where no earlier habitation has yet been proven.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=86}} Moreover, imported objects with Christian symbols, including a fish-shaped lamp from [[Lipova, Arad|Lipova]], and a "[[Saint Menas]] flask" from [[Moigrad]], were unearthed.{{sfn|Madgearu|2004|p=46}} However, only about 15% of the 30 known "row grave" cemeteries survived until the late 7th century.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=89-90}} They together form the distinct "Band-Noşlac" group of graveyards{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=122}} which also produced weapons and other objects of Western or Byzantine provenance.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=90}}

The earliest examples in Transylvania of inhumation graves with a corpse buried, in accordance with nomadic tradition, with remains of a horse were found at [[Band, Mureş|Band]].{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=93}} The "Gâmbaş group" of cemeteries{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=122}} emerged in the same period, producing weapons similar to those found in the Pontic steppes.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=94}} Sunken huts appeared in the easternmost zones of Transylvania around 7th century.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=99}} Soon the new horizon of "Mediaș" cemeteries,{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=122}} containing primarily cremation graves, spread along the rivers of the region.{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=76}} The "Nușfalău-Someşeni" cemeteries{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=122}} likewise follow the cremation rite, but they produced large ''[[tumuli]]'' with analogies in the territories east of the Carpathians.{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=76}}

In the meantime, the "Suceava-Şipot horizon" disappeared in Moldavia and Wallachia, and the new "[[Dridu culture]]" emerged on both sides of the Lower Danube around 700.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=127}}{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|p=135}} Thereafter the region again experienced demographic growth.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=50}} For instance, the number of settlements unearthed in Moldavia grew from about 120 to about 250 from the 9th century to the 11th century.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=193}} Few graveyards yielding artifacts similar to "Dridu cemeteries" were also founded around Alba Iulia in Transylvania.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|p=135}} The nearby "Ciumbrud group" of necropolises of inhumation graves point at the presence of warriors.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=104}} However, no early medieval fortresses unearthed in Transylvania, including [[Cluj-Mănăştur]], [[Dăbâca]], and [[Şirioara]], can be definitively dated earlier than the 10th century.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=114-115, 121-122, 127}}

Small inhumation cemeteries of the "Cluj group",{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=122}} characterized by "partial symbolic horse burials", appeared at several places in Banat, Crişana, and Transylvania including at [[Biharia]], [[Cluj]] and [[Timişoara]] around 900.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=131}} Cauldrons and further featuring items of the "[[Saltovo-Mayaki]] culture" of the Pontic steppes were unearthed in Alba Iulia, Cenad, Dăbâca, and other settlements.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=160}} A new custom of [[Charon's obol|placing coins on the eyes of the dead]] was also introduced around 1000.{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=160}} "[[Bijelo Brdo culture|Bijelo Brdo]]" cemeteries, a group of large graveyards with close analogies in the whole Carpathian Basin, were unearthed at Deva, Hunedoara and other places.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=251}} The east&amp;ndash;west orientation of their graves may reflect Christian influence,{{sfn|Bóna|1994|p=160}} but the following "Citfalău group" of huge cemeteries that appeared in royal fortresses around 1100 clearly belong to a Christian population.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=351}}

Romanian archaeologists propose that a series of archaeological horizons that succeeded each other in the lands north of the Lower Danube in the early Middle Ages support the continuity theory.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|pp=126-127}}{{sfn|Niculescu|2007|p=136}} In their view, archaeological finds at [[Brateiu]] (in Transylvania), [[Ipotești, Olt|Ipotești]] (in Wallachia) and [[Costișa]] (in Moldavia) represent the Daco-Roman stage of the Romanians' ethnogenesis which ended in the 6th century.{{sfn|Niculescu|2007|p=136}}{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=126}} The next ("Romanic") stage can be detected through assemblages unearthed in Ipotești, [[Botoșana]], [[Hansca]] and other places which were dated to the 7th-8th centuries.{{sfn|Niculescu|2007|p=136}} Finally, the [[Dridu culture]] is said to be the evidence for the "ancient Romanian" stage of the formation of the Romanian people.{{sfn|Niculescu|2007|p=136}} In contrast to these views, Opreanu emphasizes that the principal argument of the hypothesis{{mdash}}the presence of artefacts imported from the Roman Empire and their local copies in allegedly "Daco-Roman" or "Romanic" assemblages{{mdash}}is not convincing, because close contacts between the empire and the neighboring Slavs and Avars is well-documnted.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=127}} He also underlines that Dridu culture developed after a "cultural discontinuity" that followed the disappearance of the previous horizons.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=127}} Regarding both the Slavs and Romanians as sedentary populations, Alexandru Madgearu also underlines that the distinction of "Slavic" and "Romanian" artefacts is difficult, because archaeologists can only state that these artifacts could hardly be used by nomads.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=104-105}} He proposes that "The wheel-made pottery produced on the fast wheel (as opposed to the tournette), which was found in several settlements of the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, may indicate the continuation of Roman traditions" in Transylvania.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=105}}

Thomas Nägler proposes that a separate "Ciugud culture" represents the Vlach population of southern Transylvania.{{sfn|Nägler|2005|p=215}} He also argues that two treasures from [[Cârțișoara]] and [[Făgăraș]] also point at the presence of Vlachs.{{sfn|Nägler|2005|p=215}} Both hoards contain Byzantine coins ending with pieces minted under Emperor [[John II Komnenos]] who died in 1143.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|p=161}} Tudor Sălăgean proposes that these treasures point at a local elite with "at least" economic contacts with the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|p=161}} Paul Stephenson argues that Byzantine coins and jewellery from this period, unearthed at many places in Hungary and Romania, are connected to salt trade.{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|pp=42-44}}

====Central and Northern Balkans====

Fortified settlements built on hill-tops characterized the landscape in Illyricum before the Roman conquest.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|pp=226-227}} In addition, huts built on piles formed villages along the rivers Sava and its tributaries.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=227}} Roman coins unearthed in the northwestern regions may indicate that trading contacts between the Roman Empire and Illyricum began in the 2nd century BC, but piracy, quite widespread in this period, could also contribute to their cumulation.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=225}} The first Roman road in the Balkans, the [[Via Egnatia]] which linked Thessaloniki with Dyrrhachium was built in 140 BC.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=212}} [[Byllis]] and Dyrrhachium, the earliest Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonies]] were founded a century later.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|pp=212-213}} The Romans established a number of colonies for veterans and other towns, including [[Emona]], [[Siscia]], Sirmium and [[Iovia Botivo]], in the next four centuries.{{sfn|Mócsy|1974|pp=40, 74, 112-116, 221, 223}}

Hand-made pottery of local tradition remained popular even after potter's wheel was introduced by the Romans.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=230}} Likewise, as it is demonstrated by altars dedicated to [[Illyrians#Religion|Illyrian deities]] at [[Bihać]] and [[Topusko]], native cults survived the Roman conquest. {{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=246}} Latin inscriptions on stone monuments prove the existence of a native aristocracy in Roman times.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=238}} Native settlements flourished in the mining districts in [[Upper Moesia]] up until the 4th century.{{sfn|Bartel|2004|pp=180-181}} Native names and local burial rites only disappeared in these territories in the 3rd century.{{sfn|Mócsy|1974|p=247}} In contrast, the frontier region along the Lower Danube in Moesia had already in the 1st century AD transformed into "a secure Roman-only zone" (Brad Bartel), from where the natives were moved.{{sfn|Bartel|2004|pp=178-179}}

Emperors born in Illyricum, a common phenomenon of the period,{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=261-262}} erected a number of imperial residences at their birthplaces.{{sfn|Mócsy|1974|p=300}} For instance, a palace was built for [[Maximianus Herculius]] near Sirmium, and another for Constantine the Great in [[Mediana]].{{sfn|Mócsy|1974|p=301}} New buildings, rich burials and late Roman inscriptions show that [[Horreum Margi]], [[Remesiana]], Siscia, [[Viminacium]], and other centers of administration also prospered under these emperors.{{sfn|Mócsy|1974|p=311, 313}} Archaeological research{{spaced ndash}}including the large cemeteries unearthed at Ulpianum and Naissus{{spaced ndash}}shows that Christian communities flourished in Pannonia and Moesia from the 4th century.{{sfn|Mócsy|1974|p=33-335}} Inscriptions from the 5th century point at Christian communities surviving the destruction brought by the Huns at Naissus, Viminacium and other towns of Upper Moesia.{{sfn|Mócsy|1974|pp=351-352}} In contrast, ''[[villa rustica|villae rusticae]]'' which had been centers of agriculture from the 1st century disappeared around 450.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=43}} Likewise, [[Forum (Roman)|forums]], well planned streets and other traditional elements of urban architecture ceased to exist.{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=40-42}} For instance, Sirmium "disintegrated into small hamlets emerging in urban areas that had not been in use until then" after 450.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=40}} New fortified centers developed around newly erected Christian churches in Sirmium, [[Novae]],{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=127}} and many other towns by around 500.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=40}} In contrast with towns, there are only two archaeological sites&lt;ref group="note"&gt;At Novgrad in Bulgaria and at [[Slava Rusă]] in Romania  ''(Barford 2001, p. 60.)''.&lt;/ref&gt; from this period identified as rural settlements.{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=60}}{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=147}}

Under Justinian the walls of [[Serdica]], Ulpianum and many other towns were repaired.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=268}} He also had hundreds of small forts erected along the Lower Danube,{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=52}} at mountain passes across the [[Balkan Mountains]] and around Constantinople.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=45}} Inside these forts small churches and houses were built.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=46}} [[Pollen analysis]] suggest that the locals cultivated legumes within the walls, but no other trace of agriculture have been identified.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=46}} They were supplied with grain, wine and oil from distant territories, as it is demonstrated by the great number of amphorae unearthed in these sites which were used to transport these items to the forts.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=186-188}} Most Roman towns and forts in the northern parts of the Balkans were destroyed in the 570s or 580s.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=189}} Although some of them were soon restored, all of them were abandoned, many even "without any signs of violence", in the early 7th century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=189}}

The new horizon of "Komani-Kruja" cemeteries emerged in the same century.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=273}} They yielded grave goods with analogies in many other regions, including belt buckles widespread in the whole [[Mediterranean Basin]], rings with Greek inscriptions, pectoral crosses, and weapons similar to "Late Avar" items.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=104-105}}{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=276}} Most of them are situated in the region of Dyrrhachium, but such cemeteries were also unearthed at [[Gradsko Municipality|Viničani]] and other settlements along the Via Egnatia.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=104}} "Komani-Kruja" cemeteries ceased to exist in the early 9th century.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=277}} John Wilkes proposes that they "most likely" represent a Romanized population,{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=278}} while Florin Curta emphasizes their Avar features.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=106}} Archaeological finds connected to a Romance-speaking population have also been searched in the lowlands to the south of the Lower Danube.{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=158}} For instance, Uwe Fiedler mentions that inhumation graves yielding no grave goods from the period between the 680s and the 860s may represent them, although he himself rejects this theory.{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=158}}

[[File:Theoretical map of Romanian origins.png|thumb|200x200px|alt=Albanians as migrating Carps (a theory by B. P. Hasdeu)|[[Albanians]] as descendants of migrating [[Carpians]] (a theory proposed in 1905 by [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hașdeu]] to explain the similarities between the Romanian and Albanian languages within the framework of the continuity theory, by establishing a shared origin from [[Dacian language|Dacian]], with the Albanian resisting Romanization in the Roman Empire for centuries)]]

The formation of the [[Common Romanian]] language from Vulgar Latin started in the 6th or 7th centuries and was completed in the 8th century.{{sfn|Pană Dindelegan|2013|p=2}} Common Romanian split into four variants (Daco-Romanian, Macedo-Romanian, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian) during the 10th-12th centuries.{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|pp=5-6}}{{sfn|Augerot|2009|p=901}}{{sfn|Pană Dindelegan|2013|pp=3, 6}} Unlike other Romance languages, the Romanian subdialects spoken to the north of the Danube display a "remarkable unity".{{sfn|Pană Dindelegan|2013|p=6}} Primarily the use of different words differentiate them, because their [[phonology]] is quite uniform.{{sfn|Wexler|1997|p=183}} Whether the shepherds seasonal movements between the mountains and the lowlands secured the preservation of language unity,{{sfn|Pană Dindelegan|2013|p=6}} or the levelling effect of migrations gave rise to the development of a uniform idiom,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The development of a uniform language along the Western coasts if the USA demonstrates such a leveling effect.&lt;/ref&gt; cannot be decided.{{sfn|Wexler|1997|p=183}}

There are [[List of Romanian words of possible Dacian origin|around 100 Romanian words]] with a possible [[Eastern Romance substratum|substratum]] origin, but the language from which they were transferred cannot be determined.{{sfn|Augerot|2009|p=901}} Around 30% of these words&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, ''cârlan''  ("yearling") [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/cârlan], and ''[[urdă]]'' ("cheese made of whey") [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/urdă] ''(Spinei 2009, p. 228.)''.&lt;/ref&gt; represent the specific vocabulary of sheep- and goat-breeding.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=312}} Moreover, about 70 possible substrate words,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Including, Romanian ''strungă'' ("sheepfold") [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/strungă] and Albanian ''shtrungë'' ("milking enclosure"), Romanian ''ţap'' [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/ţap] and Albanian ''cjap'' ("he-goat") ''(Orel 1998, pp. 47., 443.)''.&lt;/ref&gt; have Albanian cognates.{{sfn|Schramm|1997|p=312}}{{sfn|Orel|1998|pp=631-633}} Romanian, Albanian and other languages sharing some common [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[Syntax|syntactic]] characteristics form together a supposed "[[Balkan Sprachbund|Balkan linguistic union]]".{{sfn|Augerot|2009|p=901}} These common features include the postposed [[definite article]]s&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, ''o doamnă'' ("a lady") and ''doamna'' ("the lady"), ''un domn'' ("a gentleman") and ''domnul'' ("the gentleman") ''(Augerot 2009, p. 902.)''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the merger of the [[dative case]] and [[possessive case]].{{sfn|Schulte|2009|p=235}}{{sfn|Mišeska Tomić|2006|p=27}} Whether they represent a common substrate language, or convergent development is still a matter of debate among linguists.{{sfn|Augerot|2009|p=901}}{{sfn|Schulte|2009|p=235}}

Hundreds of words that have presumably been inherited from Latin can only be traced back to hypotetical Latin words which were reconstructed based on their Romanian form.{{sfn|Wexler|1997|p=173}} Words of Latin origin were also borrowed from Slavic languages.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Including, ''[[colindă]]'' ("Christmas carol") and ''troiani'' ("snow drift").&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wexler|1997|p=183}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp=269-270}}

In addition to words of Latin or of possible substratum origin, loanwords make up more than 40% (according to certain estimations 60-80%){{sfn|Pană Dindelegan|2013|p=3}}{{sfn|Mallinson|1988|p=417}} of the Romanian vocabulary.{{sfn|Schulte|2009|p=239}} Linguist Gabriela P. Dindelegan underlines that contacts with other peoples has not modified the "Latin structure of Romanian" and the "non-Latin grammatical elements" borrowed from other languages were "adapted to and assimilated by the Romance pattern".{{sfn|Pană Dindelegan|2013|p=3}} No loanwords of [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] (Gothic or Gepid) origin have so far been proven.{{sfn|Augerot|2009|p=901}} In the Middle Ages, Slavic languages had a substantial influence on Romanian, but a significant number of words were borrowed from Turkic, Hungarian, Greek or German languages.{{sfn|Schulte|2009|pp=235-237}}{{sfn|Mallinson|1988|pp=413-415}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=343}}

The ratio of Slavic loanwords is still about 14%, although a strong "re-latinization" process has decreased their number since the 19th century.{{sfn|Schulte|2009|pp=241, 244}}{{sfn|Mallinson|1988|pp=415-417}} For instance, the number of Slavic borrowings exceeds that of the inherited terms in several semantic fields, including that of the natural environment{{sfn|Schulte|2009|p=250}} The names for most species of fish of the Danube&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Including ''biban'' ("perch") [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/biban], ''cegă'' ("sterlet") [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/cegă], and ''plătică'' ("common bream") [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/plătică].&lt;/ref&gt; and of a number of other animals living in Romania&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, ''cârtiță'' ("mole") [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/cârtiță], ''dropie'' ("great bustard") [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/dropie], and ''râs'' ("lynx") [http://dexonline.ro/definitie/râs].&lt;/ref&gt; are of Slavic origin.&lt;ref name="Kopecký"&gt;{{Citation | last = Kopecký | first = Peter | title = ''Caractéristique lexicale de l'élément slave dans le vocabulaire roumain: Confrontation historique aux sédiments lexicaux turcs et grecs'' [=Lexical characteristics of the Slavic elements of the Romanians language: A historical comparison with the Turkic and Greek lexical layers] | journal = Ianua: Revista Philologica Romanica | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2004–2005 | pages = 43–53 | url = http://www.romaniaminor.net/ianua/Ianua05/ianua05_04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists often attribute the development of about 10 phonological and morphological features of the Romanian language to Slavic influence, but there is no consensual view.{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=2}} For instance, contacts with Slavic-speakers allegedly contributed to the appearance of the [[semi-vowel]] [y] before the vowel [e] at the beginning of basic words and to the development of the [[vocative case]] in Romanian.{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|pp=49, 53, 101, 109}} Linguist Kim Schulte says, the significant common lexical items and the same morpho-syntactic structures of the Romanian and Bulgarian (and Macedonian) languages "indicates that there was a high decree of bilingualism in this mixed population".{{sfn|Schulte|2009|p=235}}

All neighboring peoples adopted a number of Romanian words connected to goat- and sheep-breeding.{{sfn|Nandris|1951|p=12}} Romanian loanwords are rare in standard Hungarian, but abound in its Transylvanian dialects.{{sfn|Szabó T.|1985|p=60}} In addition to place names and elements of the Romanian pastoral vocabulary, the Transylvanian Hungarians primarily adopted dozens of Romanian ecclesiastic and political terms to refer to specific Romanian institutions already before the mid-17th centuries.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, ''[[Boyar of Fogaras|bojér]]'', ''[[Logofăt|logofét]]'', ''[[Eastern Christian monasticism|kalugyér]]'' and ''[[Wooden churches of Maramureș|beszerika]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Szabó T.|1985|pp=53, 57, 60-61}} The adoption of the Romanian terminology shows that the traditional Romanian institutions, which followed Byzantine patterns, significantly differed from their Hungarian counterparts.{{sfn|Szabó T.|1985|p=60}}

More than a dozen of the tributaries of the large rivers had a name with probable Indo-European roots, suggesting a Dacian etymology.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, the modern name of the river [[Ampoi]] may be connected to the Iranian words ''am'' ("with") and ''pel-/pal-'' ("color"), and the name of [[Săsar River]] is allegedly related to the Indo-European root ''*sar'' or ''*ser'' ("water", "to flow").&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Felecan|Felecan|2015|pp=257-258}} The Slavic mediation during the transmission of the names of some of them is obvious.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, the modern names of the rivers [[Cerna (Danube)|Cerna]] and [[Bârzava (Timiș)|Bârzava]] were transmitted from ancient ''Dierna'' and ''Bersobis'' through the mediation of a Slavic-speaking population.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Tomescu|2009|p=2728}}{{sfn|Felecan|Felecan|2015|p=258}} The longer tributaries of the large rivers in Banat, Crişana and Transylvania which run through the most populated areas had modern names of German, Hungarian, Slavic or Turkic origin, which were also adopted by the Romanians.&lt;ref name='Makkai'/&gt; For instance, the tributaries of the [[Someșul Mic River]] bear Hungarian&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Including, [[Căpuş River|Căpuş]], [[Nadăş River (Someş)|Nadăş]], and [[Fizeş River (Someş)|Fizeş]] [http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/61.html].&lt;/ref&gt; or Slavic&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Lonea River|Lonea]] and [[Lujerdiu River|Lujerdiu]] [http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/61.html].&lt;/ref&gt; names,&lt;ref name='Makkai'/&gt; while other tributaries bear local Dacian names.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Including [[Bârzava (Timiș)|Bârzava]] and [[Nera (Danube)|Nera]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the smallest rivers and streams&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, [[Baicu River (Iza)|Baicu]], Ghișa, Manciu.&lt;/ref&gt; bear names of Romanian origin.{{sfn|Felecan|Felecan|2015|p=262}}{{sfn|Tomescu|2009|p=2728}}

The use of genetic data to supplement traditional disciplines has now become mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;From molecular genetics to archaeogenetics. PNAS, Colin Renfrew, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Given the palimpsest nature of modern genetic diversity, more direct evidence has been sought from ancient DNA (aDNA)&lt;ref&gt;Pinhasi R, Thomas MG, Hofreiter M, Currat M, Burger J.

Eng&lt;/ref&gt; Although data from southeastern Europe is still at an incipient stage, general trends are already evident. For example, it has shown that the Neolithic revolution imparted a major demographic impact throughout Europe, disproving the Mesolithic adaptation scenario in its pure form. In fact, the arrival of Neolithic farmers might have been in at least two "waves", as suggested by a study which analysed mtDNA sequences from Romanian Neolithic samples.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient DNA from South-East Europe Reveals Different Events during Early and Middle Neolithic Influencing the European Genetic Heritage. Hervella, et al (2015a)&lt;/ref&gt; This study also shows that 'M_NEO' (''Middle Neolithic populations that lived in what is present-day Romania/Transylvania'') and modern populations from Romania are very close, in contrast with Middle Neolithic and modern populations from Central Europe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ancient DNA from South-East Europe Reveals Different Events during Early and Middle Neolithic|journal = PLOS ONE|volume = 10|issue = 6|pages = e0128810|authors=Hervella, et al|last=|first=|date=|website=|dead-url=|year=2015b|pmc = 4460020|pmid = 26053041|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0128810}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the samples extracted from Late Bronze Age DNA from Romania are farther from both of the previously mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Hervella, et al (2015b), Figure 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors have stated "Nevertheless, studies on more individuals are necessary to draw definitive conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;Hervella, et al (2015b), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study performed a "genetic analysis of a relatively large number of samples of Boian, Zau and Gumelniţa cultures in Romania (n = 41) (M_NEO)"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ancient DNA study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/453597|title=Ancient DNA study on human fossils found in Costişa, Romania, dating from de Bronze Age|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on human fossils found in Costişa, Romania, dating from de Bronze Age shows "close genetic kinship along the maternal lineage between the three old individuals from Costişa and some individuals found in other archeological sites dated from the Bronze and Iron Age. We also should note that the point mutations analyzed above are also found in Romanian modern population, suggesting that some old individuals from the human populations living on the Romanian land in the Bronze and Iron Age, could participate to a certain extent in the foundation of the Romanian genetic pool."

Another major demographic wave also occurred after 3000 BC from the steppe, postulated to be linked with the expansion of Indo-European languages.&lt;ref&gt;Massive migration from the steppe is a source for Indo-European languages in Europe&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze and Iron Age samples from Hungary,&lt;ref&gt;Haak 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria&lt;ref&gt;Population Genomic Analysis of Ancient and Modern Genomes Yields New Insights into the Genetic Ancestry of the Tyrolean Iceman and the Genetic Structure of Europe&lt;/ref&gt; and Romania,{{sfn|Cardos|Stoian|Miritoiu|Comsa|2004|pp=239-241}} however, suggest that this impact was less significant in Southeastern Europe than areas north of the Carpathians. In fact, in the abovementioned studies, the Bronze and Iron Age Balkan samples do not cluster with modern Balkan groups, but lie between [[Sardinians]] and other southwestern European groups, suggesting later phenomena (i.e. in Antiquity, Great Migration Period) caused shifts in population genetic structure. However, aDNA samples from southeastern Europe remain few, and only further sampling will allow a clear and diachronic overview of migratory and demographic trends.

No detailed analyses exist from the Roman and early medieval periods. Genome-wide analyses of extant populations show that intra-European diversity is a continuum (with the exception of groups like [[Finns]], [[Sami people|Sami]], [[Basques]] and [[Sardinians]]). Romanians cluster amidst their Balkan and East European neighbours. However, they generally lie significantly closer to Balkan groups (Serbs, Macedonians, Bulgarians) than to central and eastern Europeans like Hungarians, Czechs, Poles and Ukrainians, and many lie in the center of the Balkan cluster, near Albanians, Greeks, and Bulgarians, while many former Yugoslav populations like Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes may draw closer to central European West Slavs. On autosomal studies, genetic distance of some Romanian samples to some Italians, such as Tuscans, is greater than that of the distance to neighboring Balkan peoples, but can in some cases still be relatively close when considering the overall European population structure; this likely reflects mainly ancient or prehistoric population patterns rather than more recent ties due to linguistic relationships.

{{Marxism|variants}}
'''Orthodox Marxism''' is the body of [[Marxist]] thought that emerged after the death of [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and which became the official philosophy of the [[Socialism|socialist movement]] as represented in the [[Second International]] until the First World War in 1914. Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of [[classical Marxism]].

The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the [[productive forces]]) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]] and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new [[economic system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rees|first=John|title=The Algebra of Revolution: The Dialectic and the Classical Marxist Tradition|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=July 1998|isbn= 978-0415198776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the term orthodox Marxism, the word "orthodox" refers to the methods of [[historical materialism]] and of [[dialectical materialism]]—and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, Georg. ''What is Orthodox Marxism?''. Marxism Internet Archive (1919): [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/orthodox.htm "What is Orthodox Marxism?"]. "Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx's investigations. It is not the 'belief' in this or that thesis, nor the exegesis of a 'sacred' book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
The emergence of orthodox Marxism is associated with the latter works of [[Friedrich Engels]], such as the ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'' and ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'', which were efforts to popularise the work of Karl Marx, render it systematic and apply it to the fundamental questions of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Mendelson. "On Engels' metaphysical dialectics: A foundation of orthodox "Marxism"" ''Dialectical Anthropology''. 1979. Volume 4. Issue 1. pp. 65–73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel De Leon]], an early American socialist leader, contributed much to the thought during the final years of the 19th century and the early 20th century. Orthodox Marxism was further developed during the Second International by thinkers such as [[Georgi Plekhanov]] and [[Karl Kautsky]]. Kautsky and to a lesser extent Plekhanov were in turn major influences on [[Vladimir Lenin]], whose version of Marxism was known as [[Leninism]] by its contemporaries. The official thought of the [[Third International]] was based in orthodox Marxism combined with Leninist views on revolutionary organization.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The terms [[dialectical materialism]] and [[historical materialism]] are associated with this phase of orthodox Marxism. [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Hal Draper]] and [[Rudolf Hilferding]] are prominent thinkers in the orthodox Marxist tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Orthodox Marxism is contrasted with later variations of Marxism, notably [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] and [[Leninism]]. In contrast to Lenin's Bolshevik idea of revolution, orthodox Marxists said that Imperial Russia was too backwards for the development of socialism and would first have undergo a capitalist (bourgeois) phase of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steele|first=David Ramsay|title=From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation|publisher=Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn= 978-0875484495|page=67|quote=Lenin is urging a socialist revolution in Russia, against the traditional Marxists who argue that Russia is too backwards for anything but a bourgeois revolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of orthodox Marxism are:
* A strong version of the theory that the economic base (material conditions) determines the cultural and political [[Superstructure#Marxist concept|superstructure]] of society. In its most extensive form, this view is called [[economic determinism]], [[economism]] and vulgar materialism. A related variation is that of [[technological determinism]].
* The view that capitalism cannot be reformed through policy and that any attempt to do so would only exacerbate its contradictions or distort the efficiency of the market economy (in contrast to [[reformism]]). Orthodox Marxism holds that the only viable and lasting solution to the contradictions of capitalism is for the establishment of a post-capitalist [[socialist economy]].
* The centrality of class as a process and the view that existing policymakers and government is largely and structurally beholden to the interests of the [[ruling class]]. This view is called [[instrumental Marxism]].
* The claim that Marxist methodology is a science.
* The attempt to make Marxism a total system, adapting it to changes within the realm of current events and knowledge.
* An understanding of [[ideology]] in terms of [[false consciousness]].
* That every open class struggle is a political struggle.
* A pre-crisis emphasis on organizing an independent, mass workers' movement (in the form of welfare, recreational, educational and cultural organizations) and especially its political party, combining reform struggles and mass strikes without overreliance on either. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* The socialist revolution is necessarily the act of the majority (contrasted with [[Marxism–Leninism]]'s view of the [[vanguard party]] and [[democratic centralism]]).

Orthodox Marxism is contrasted with [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist Marxism]] as developed in post-First World War [[Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic parties]]. Some writers also contrast it with Marxism–Leninism as it developed in the Soviet Union,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} while others describe the latter as firmly within orthodoxy: &lt;blockquote&gt;Orthodox Marxism rested on and grew out of the European working class movement that emerged in the final quarter of the 19th century and continued in that form until the middle years of the twentieth century. Its two institutional expressions were the 2nd and 3rd Internationals, which despite the great schism in 1919, were marked by a shared conception of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Wage labour|labour]]. Their fortunes therefore rose and fell together. [[Trotskyism]] and [[Left communism]] were equally orthodox in their thinking and approach, and therefore must be considered left-variants of this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Rooke. [http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext30/Rooke.html "Marxism is Dead! Long Live Marxism!"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}}

Two variants of orthodox Marxism are [[impossibilism]] and [[anti-revisionism]]. Impossibilism is a form of orthodox Marxism that both rejects the [[reformism]] of revisionist Marxism and opposes the Leninist theories of imperialism, vanguardism and democratic centralism (which argue that socialism can be constructed in underdeveloped, [[Feudalism|quasi-feudal]] countries through revolutionary action as opposed to being an emergent result of advances in material development). An extreme form of this position is held by the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard, M.C. and King, J.E. ''State Capitalism in the Soviet Union''. History of Economic Thought Society of Australia: http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf/34-A-08.pdf: "The same point was made, in the United Kingdom, by the leadership of the remorselessly orthodox Socialist Party of Great Britain".&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the anti-revisionist tradition criticised official [[Communist party|Communist parties]] from the opposite perspective as having abandoned the orthodox Marxism of the founding fathers.

== Variants ==
A number of theoretical perspectives and political movements emerged that were firmly rooted in orthodox Marxist analysis, as contrasted with later interpretations and alternative developments in Marxist theory and practice such as Marxism–Leninism, revisionism and reformism.

=== Impossibilism ===
{{main|Impossibilism}}
Impossibilism stresses the limited value of economic, social, cultural and political reforms under capitalism and posits that socialists and Marxists should solely focus on efforts to propagate and establish socialism, disregarding any other cause that has no connection to the goal of the realization of socialism.

Impossibilism posits that reforms to capitalism are counterproductive because they strengthen support for capitalism by the working class by making its conditions more tolerable while creating further contradictions of their own, while removing the socialist character of the parties championing and implementing said reforms. Because reforms cannot solve the systemic contradictions of capitalism, impossibilism opposes reformism, revisionism and ethical socialism.

Impossibilism also opposes the idea of a vanguard-led revolution and the centralization of political power in any elite group of people as espoused by Leninism and Marxism–Leninism .

This perspective is maintained by the [[World Socialist Movement]], [[De Leonism]], and to some extent followers of [[Karl Kautsky]] and pre-reformist social democracy.

=== Luxemburgism ===
Luxemburgism is an informal designation for a current of Marxist thought and practice that originates from the ideas and work of [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. In particular, it stresses the importance for spontaneous revolution which can only emerge in response to mounting contradictions between the productive forces and social relations of society and therefore rejects Leninism and Bolshevism for its insistence on a "hands-on" approach to revolution. Luxemburgism is also highly critical of the reformist Marxism that emerged from the work of Eduard Bernstein's faction of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. According to Rosa Luxemburg, under reformism "[capitalism] is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1973/01/reform.htm|title=Do We Support Reformist Demands?|author=Duncan Hallas|year=1973|work=Controversy: Do we support reformist demands?|publisher=International Socialism|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Menshevism ===
Menshevism refers to the political positions taken by the [[Menshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] prior to the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. The Mensheviks believed that socialism could not be realized in Russia due to its backwards economic conditions and that Russia would first have to experience a bourgeois revolution and go through a capitalist stage of development before socialism became technically possible and before the working class could develop the class consciousness for a [[Proletarian revolution|socialist revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/m/e.htm|title=Menshevik|work=Marxism.org|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mensheviks were thus opposed to the Bolshevik idea of a [[vanguard party]] and their pursuit of socialist revolution in semi-feudal Russia.

=== Karl Kautsky and "Kautskyism" ===
[[Karl Kautsky]] is recognized as one of the most authoritative promulgators of orthodox Marxism following the death of [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1895. As an advisor to [[August Bebel]], leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) until Bebel's death in 1913 and as editor of Die Neue Zeit from 1883 till 1917, he was known as the "Pope of Marxism". He was removed as editor by the leadership of the SPD when the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) split away from the SPD. Kautsky was an outspoken critic of Bolshevism and Leninism, seeing the Bolsheviks (or Communists as they had renamed themselves after 1917) as an organization that had gained power by a coup and initiated revolutionary changes for which there was no economic rationale in Russia. Kautsky was also opposed to Eduard Bernstein's reformist politics in the period 1896–1901.

=== Instrumental Marxism ===
Instrumental Marxism is a theory derived from classical Marxism which reasons that policy makers in government and positions of power tend to "share a common business or class background, and that their decisions will reflect their business or class interests".&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S. 2004. ''International Relations''. Canadian Edition. Ed. Whitworth, Sandra. Toronto: [[Pearson Education]]. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
There have been a number of criticisms of orthodox Marxism from within the socialist movement. From the 1890s during the Second International, [[Eduard Bernstein]] and others developed a position known as [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]], which sought to revise Marx's views based on the idea that the progressive development of capitalism and the extension of democracy meant that gradual, parliamentary reform could achieve socialism. This view was contested by orthodox Marxists such as Kautsky as well as by the young [[Georg Lukacs]], who in 1919 clarified the definition of orthodox Marxism as thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;[O]rthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed, expanded and deepened only along the lines laid down by its founders. It is the conviction, moreover, that all attempts to surpass or 'improve' it have led and must lead to over-simplification, triviality and eclecticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/orthodox.htm "What is Orthodox Marxism?"]. March 1919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Western Marxism]], the intellectual Marxism which developed in Western Europe from the 1920s onwards, sought to make Marxism more "sophisticated", open and flexible by examining issues like culture that were outside the field of orthodox Marxism. Western Marxists, such as [[Georg Lukács]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Antonio Gramsci]] and the [[Frankfurt School]], have tended to be open to influences orthodox Marxists consider [[bourgeois]], such as [[psychoanalysis]] and the [[sociology]] of [[Max Weber]]. Marco Torres illustrates the shift away from orthodox Marxism in the Frankfurt School: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the early 1920s, the original members of the Frankfurt Institute—half forgotten names such as [[Carl Grünberg]], [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Karl August Wittfogel]], were social scientists of an orthodox Marxist conviction. They understood their task as an advancement of the sciences that would prove useful in solving the problems of a Europe-wide transition into socialism, which they saw, if not as inevitable, at least as highly likely. But as [[fascism]] reared its head in Germany and throughout Europe, the younger members of the Institute saw the necessity for a different kind of Marxist Scholarship. Beyond accumulating knowledge relevant to an orthodox Marxist line, they felt the need to take the more critical and negative approach that is required for the maintenance of an integral and penetrating understanding of society during a moment of reaction. This could be described as the politically necessary transition from Marxist positive science to [[Critical Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Marco Torres [http://platypus1917.org/2008/05/01/the-science-that-wasnt/ "The science that wasn't: The orthodox Marxism of the early Frankfurt School and the turn to Marxist Critical Theory"]. ''Platypus''. May 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In parallel to this, [[Cedric Robinson]] has identified a Black Marxist tradition, including people like [[C.L.R. James]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], who have opened Marxism to the study of race.

In the postwar period, the [[New Left]] and [[new social movements]] gave rise to intellectual and political currents which again challenged orthodox Marxism. These include Italian [[autonomism]], French [[Situationist International|Situationism]], the Yugoslavian [[Praxis School]], British [[cultural studies]], [[Marxist feminism]], [[Marxist humanism]], [[analytical Marxism]] and [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]].

'''Parang Chandong''' (also spelled as '''Parang Candong''', '''Parang Candung''', '''Duku Candong''' or '''Duku Candung''') is a traditional chopper used by the [[Dayak people]] ([[Iban people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Augustine Anggat Ganjing, Jonathan Singki|title=Asas Ukiran Iban: Suatu Pengenalan|year=1991|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka|isbn=983-62-1398-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[Baram River]] in [[Borneo]].

The Parang Candung is also the primary weapon of Sari Panji, a character in the Rajé Ngalam tale of [[Sambas Regency]], [[West Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chairil Effendy|title=Teks Rajé Ngalam: Telaah Struktur Dan Resepsi|year=2001|publisher=Pusat Bahasa, Departemen Pendidikan Nasional|isbn=979-685-197-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently in the west, the Parang Chandong was popularized by [[Raymond Mears]] and is sometimes referred to as '''Ray Mears Parang'''.

This parang is also not to be confused with the ''Candung'' in [[Lampung language]], which refers to another type of [[golok]] in [[Lampung]], [[Indonesia]].

==Description==
The blade's edge is convex. The back is concave and curves towards the edge at the point. The centre of gravity lies near to the tip. The wooden scabbard's two parts are held together by means of rattan strips. The scabbard may be finely decorated, for instance with open-work carvings of floral motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert G Van Zonneveld|title=Traditional Weapons of the Indonesian Archipelago|url=https://www.amazon.com/Traditional-Weapons-Indonesian-Archipelago-Zonneveld/dp/9054500042/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394869874&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Traditional+Weapons+of+the+Indonesian+Archipelago|year=2002|publisher=Koninklyk Instituut Voor Taal Land|isbn=90-5450-004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Belgium}}
The '''partition of Belgium''' is a hypothetical situation which has been discussed by both Belgian and international media, especially in the context of events such as the [[2007–11 Belgian political crisis]].&lt;ref name="nytGermany"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/04/22/102586832.pdf |title=Belgium faces a crisis |work=[[New York Times]] |date=May 22, 1900 |accessdate=July 12, 2008 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytJulesDestree"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2007/12/04/afx4401225.html |title=Belgium's 'AA+' rating, stable outlook unaffected by political stalemate — Fitch |work=[[Forbes]] |date=April 12, 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |quote=[[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]] believes while the eventual partition of Belgium has always been a possibility, it is unlikely to happen over the medium-term.

== Background ==
The territories corresponding to the modern Belgian, Dutch and [[Luxembourg]]ish states are collectively called the [[Low Countries]]. They emerged at the end of the [[Middle Ages]] as a set of more or less independent [[fiefdom]]s loosely linked to the [[France in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The southern part of this region—the [[Southern Netherlands]], the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]], the [[Imperial Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy]] and the [[Duchy of Bouillon]]—was partitioned both politically (into many fiefdoms), and linguistically (into the [[Romance languages|Romanic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[sprachraum|Sprachräume]]). The feudal borders did not match the linguistic borders, and some fiefdoms were divided into Francophone and Germanic regions. However, the ruling aristocracy, which usually spoke languages other than the population, did not much bother about these language-related disparities. After the 1581 secession of the [[Dutch Republic]] in the northern Low Countries, French progressively emerged in the [[Southern Netherlands]] under the influence of the [[Habsburg]] nobility and, later, of the French invasions, as the [[upper class]] language, not only at the court but also in the administration and in the political circles.

Antagonism between speakers of French and Dutch increased after the [[Belgian revolution|independence of Belgium]] in 1830, when residents of the Southern Netherlands rebelled against the newfound hegemony of the northern provinces of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Major European powers were divided in opinion over the fallout of the revolution. Ultimately, the state of Belgium, composed of provinces of both French-speaking and Dutch-speaking people, gained independence as a [[buffer state]] between France and the Netherlands. French became the sole [[language legislation in Belgium|official language]]. Dutch speakers demanded equal rights beginning in the late 19th century, but these were only introduced gradually throughout the 20th century. While postage stamps became bilingual in 1893, it was not until 1967 that an official Dutch version of the [[Constitution of Belgium|Constitution]] was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnic structure, inequality and governance of the public sector in Belgium |url=http://www.unrisd.org/UNRISD/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/ec506a59176be044c1256e9e003077c3/$FILE/Deschou.pdf |author=[http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BC203/(httpPeople)/417C5EAAE7060027C1256F2000472415?OpenDocument Kris Deschouwer] |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) |date=January 2004 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614025223/http://www.unrisd.org/UNRISD/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/ec506a59176be044c1256e9e003077c3/$FILE/Deschou.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence, [[economy of Belgium|socio-economic imbalances]] have fueled resentment between the two communities.&lt;ref name=VanParijsHealth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/DOCH_053_(PVP).pdf |format=PDF |title=Just health care and the two solidarities |author=[[Philippe Van Parijs]] |year=1999 |accessdate=September 10, 2008 |quote=Statistical data revealed that the Walloon population had a per capita consumption of publicly funded health care significantly higher than the Flemish population. This could be attributed in part to its demographic structure (more elderly people) and to its economic situation (more unemployment). But it was also due in part to medical habits that turned out to be more expensive in Wallonia than in Flanders. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218230837/http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/DOCH_053_(PVP).pdf |archive-date=December 18, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}. Since the publication of this book, there are other figures and the Flemish daily newspaper ''[[De Standaard]]'' wrote it in 2007 : Guy Tegenbos “Scheeftrekkingen in ziektekosten bijna weg” (''Imbalance almost vanished''). in ''De Standaard'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WillemynsEconomicTransfer&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dutch–French Language Border in Belgium |work=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development |year=2002 |url=http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/023/0036/jmmd0230036.pdf |format=PDF |quote=From the late 1950s onwards, the economy of Flanders was transformed from one based on agriculture to one based on industry and trade, and the region experienced a rise in its standard of living. At the same time, the heavy industrial economy of Wallonia, formerly the wealthier portion of the country, gradually declined, giving way to a serious economic recession from which it has not yet recovered. In 1996 74.5% of the industrial gross added value was generated in the Flemish region, which contain 58% of Belgium’s population. Consequently, the cultural and linguistic balance of power in Belgium shifted towards Flanders (Willemyns, 1992). The present-day social and economic imbalance between Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia is to be considered potentially disruptive for the continuation of Belgium’s existence, since it requires a considerable amount of so-called ‘solidarity transfers’ from Flanders to Wallonia (for 80%) and from Flanders to Brussels (for 20%). Most of these transfers occur in the field of social security financing (De Boeck, 1999). |accessdate=July 23, 2008 |author1=Roland Willemyns |author2=Vrije Universiteit Brussel |authorlink2=Vrije Universiteit Brussel }}{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, separate regions have been created based on the country's linguistic division. As a result, minorities in certain areas (in and around Brussels and along the language border) claim to be disenfranchised in local government and services. Along with the usual left–right political division, there is also a linguistic division, causing a [[list of political parties in Belgium|double party system]] which complicates coalition creation on the national level. The recent crisis over the [[2007–2008 Belgian government formation|formation of a coalition government]] in the aftermath of the [[Belgian general election, 2007|2007 elections]], coupled with the unsolved problem of the [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] electoral district and the rise of extremist political parties, has given a fresh impetus to the issue, with recent opinion polls showing sizable support for a partition. However, support for a unified state remains among the majority of Belgium's people.&lt;ref name="standaard"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://destandaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF09112007_060 |title=België moet blijven, maar niet zoals nu |work=[[De Standaard|De Standaard Online]] |date=November 9, 2007 |accessdate=November 28, 2007 |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarists claim that the monarchy, strong national institutions, and the geopolitical importance of the linguistically and ethnically mixed [[Brussels]] serve as unifying elements, while separatists rather claim these factors (and the considerable [[economy of Belgium|state debt]]) serve merely as obstacles to an inevitable partition. Some political observers have suggested that a possible partition of Belgium may be a blow to the [[European Union]] model of diverse cultures working together.&lt;ref name="timejune2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2000517,00.html| title= No Love Lost: Is Belgium About to Break in Two? | author = Cendrowicz, Leo |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=June 30, 2010 | accessdate = July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As no [[census]] exists, there are no official statistics on Belgium's three official languages or their dialects. Various criteria, including the language(s) of parents, of education, or the second-language status of foreign born, may affect suggested figures. An estimated 59%&lt;ref&gt;Footnote: Native speakers of Dutch living in Wallonia and of French in Flanders are relatively small minorities which furthermore largely balance one another, hence counting all inhabitants of each monolingual area to the area's language can cause only insignificant inaccuracies (99% can speak the language). Dutch: Flanders' 6.079 million inhabitants and about 15% of Brussels's 1.019 million are 6.23 million or 59.3% of the 10.5 million inhabitants of Belgium (2006); German: 70,400 in the German-speaking Community (which has [[Municipalities with language facilities|language facilities]] for its less than 5% French-speakers), and an estimated 20,000–25,000 speakers of German in Wallonia outside the geographical boundaries of their official Community, or 0.9%; French: in the latter area as well as mainly in the rest of Wallonia (3.414 – 0.093 = 3.321 million) and 85% of the Brussels inhabitants (0.866 million) thus 4.187 million or 39.8%; together indeed 100%;&lt;/ref&gt; of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often colloquially referred to as ''[[Flemish]]''), and French is spoken by 40%. Total Dutch speakers number 6.23 million, concentrated in the northern [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] region, while French speakers comprise 3.32 million in [[Wallonia]] and an estimated 870,000 (85%) of the officially bilingual [[Brussels-Capital Region]].&lt;ref name="ericcorijn"&gt;Flemish Academic Eric Corijn (initiator of [http://www.charta91.be/ Charta 91]), at a colloquium regarding Brussels, on December 5, 2001, states that in Brussels there is 91% of the population speaking French at home, either alone or with another language, and there is about 20% speaking Dutch at home, either alone (9%) or with French (11%) – After pondering, the repartition can be estimated at between 85 and 90% French-speaking, and the remaining are Dutch-speaking, corresponding to the estimations based on languages chosen in Brussels by citizens for their official documents (ID, driving licenses, weddings, birth, death, and so on); all these statistics on language are also available at Belgian Department of Justice (for weddings, birth, death), Department of Transport (for Driving licenses), Department of Interior (for IDs), because there are no means to know ''precisely'' the proportions since Belgium has abolished 'official' linguistic censuses, thus official documents on language choices can only be estimations.

The Capital Region having bilingual status obliges its authorities to attend to people and organisations in French or Dutch language as these prefer, and to show street names in both languages on the plates, but does not allow a bilingual school as education belongs to either the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] or the [[Flemish Community of Belgium|Flemish one]]. Geographically, it is an [[enclave]] in the Flemish Region, though near Wallonia. Constitutionally, it is a politically distinct Region, while within its boundaries both the Flemish and French Communities exercise their authority. Historically, [[frenchification of Brussels|the local language of Brussels was Dutch]], and Dutch remained the vernacular language of a majority of inhabitants until around 1950.

Dutch is mainly spoken by approximately 150,000 residents, or a 15% minority, at most. The city has strong economic ties with surrounding Flanders, and many Dutch-speakers commute to Brussels for work; but, at the same time, the expanding suburbs of Brussels led to a majority of French-speakers in six Flemish villages.

==Feudal borders==
[[File:Map-1477 Low Countries.png|thumb|200px|left|The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (orange, brown and yellow areas) and the [[Bishopric of Liège]] (green)]]
The territory of Belgium is the southern part of the historical region called [[Low Countries]].  The Low Countries emerged at the end of the Middle Ages as a very loose political [[confederation]] of [[fiefdom]]s ruled in [[personal union]] by the [[House of Habsburg]]: the [[Seventeen Provinces]]. The largest components of this union were the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the [[County of Flanders]], the [[County of Hainaut]] and the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]].  The [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] was almost an enclave within the Seventeen Provinces. The prince-bishopric was not formally included in the Habsburgs' dominion but was, since the time of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], strongly influenced by its Habsburg neighbors.  The border which emerged after the [[Dutch Revolt]] and the [[Eighty Years' War]] split the Seventeen Provinces into the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]].  In particular Brabant and Flanders were divided into northern and southern components. Though the fiefdoms constituting the Southern Netherlands were more or less ruled by a single reigning House, they were all quite distinct.  Different traditions and [[Flemish|dialects of Dutch]] and [[Walloon language|Walloon]] appeared.  Within the largest fiefdoms like Liège, Flanders and Luxembourg, several distinct languages and dialects were in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter II: Habsburg Rule in the Netherlands |work=History of Holland |author=Edmundson, George |publisher=The University Press, Cambridge.

[[File:Netherlands during French administration 1810-1814.png|thumb|200px|Map of French [[First French Empire|Imperial]] [[departments of France|departments]] in the Low Countries]]
The feudal borders partitioning Belgium during the [[Ancien Régime]] have nothing in common with the partitioning lines which currently separate the Belgian federal entities. The French disbanded these feudal entities and replaced them with [[130 departments of the First French Empire|departments]] during the French occupation from 1794 to 1815. The new entities or departments mirrored, approximately, the language border. For instance the new division separated the bilingual kernel of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège into two more or less monolingual regions. The only major exceptions were the bilingual [[Dyle (department)|Dyle]] and [[Forêts]] departments. The departments would eventually become the provinces of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and later on of [[Belgium]]. The name of the [[provinces of Belgium|provinces]] were inspired by the roughly corresponding medieval fiefdoms.  In particular, the Dyle department became the [[province of Brabant]], that is the most southern part of the older duchy of Brabant.

In 1815, the territory now constituting Belgium was incorporated into the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], which had been created to rehabilitate and consolidate the former Seventeen Provinces and serve as a [[buffer state|buffer]] against any expansionist ambitions of France. However, this placed the Catholic Belgian provinces, including French-speaking Wallonia, under Dutch-majority rule and a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Dutch king. The Belgians had little influence over their lives and resented Dutch control and domination over economic, political and social institutions, sentiment that culminated in revolution in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authorama.com/history-of-holland-32.html |title=Chapter XXX: The Kingdom of the Netherlands–union of Holland and Belgium, 1815–1830 |author=George Edmundson |work=History of Holland |publisher=The University Press, Cambridge.

After this proposal had been rejected by the other European powers, which supported the continued union of the Netherlands, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], the French ambassador to the United Kingdom, proposed a [[Talleyrand partition plan for Belgium|partition of the Southern Netherlands]] (most areas of modern Belgium).&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; To this end, the parts of the provinces of [[Liège (province)|Liège]], of Limburg and of [[Namur (province)|Namur]] east of the Meuse river as well as the cities of Maastricht and [[Liège (city)|Liège]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] would go to [[Prussia]]. Part of the province of [[East Flanders]], nearly all of the province of [[Brabant (province)|Brabant]], the province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and the province of Namur west of the Meuse would be assigned to France. The province of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]—except the city of [[Antwerp]] itself—and the province of [[Province of Limburg (1815–1839)|Limburg]], west of the [[Meuse]] river—except [[Maastricht]]—would remain with the Netherlands, as would a small part of the province of Brabant, the former Oranje Lordship of [[Diest]]. [[West Flanders]], most of East Flanders, including [[Zeelandic Flanders]], and the city of [[Antwerp]] were to form the Free State of Antwerp, under British protection.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt;

However, this plan was rejected and Belgium was established as an essential buffer state to check the ambitions of France.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/world/europe/21belgium.html |title=Calls for a Breakup Grow Ever Louder | work=The New York Times | first=Elaine | last=Sciolino | date=September 21, 2007 | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallonia and Flanders were unified as one state under a German prince, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]] of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]].

== Language border ==

The [[language border]] separating the Germanic and Romance [[sprachraum|''Sprachräume'']] moved over the centuries which preceded the establishment of the Belgian state over an area between the [[Ardennes]] and the more or less straight line going from [[Aachen]] to [[Calais]] on the one hand and the much less populated frontier from [[Aachen]] to [[Arlon]] via [[Malmedy]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; switched from French to Dutch. The [[Voeren]] have a long Flemish tradition and, in the [[Land of Herve]], several communes which used to use Germanic dialects switched to French during the 18th century, as for example, [[Berneau]] and [[Warsage]], both now part of [[Dalhem]] and [[Saint-Jean-Sart]], a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Aubel]].

Prior to the 20th century, this language border did not merely distinguish speakers of [[Belgian French]], [[standard Dutch]] and standard German, as today, but between [[Romance language|Romance]] and [[Germanic language|Germanic]] [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]]. The Germanic ''Sprachraum'' was made of different components such as [[West Flemish]], [[East Flemish]], [[Brabantic]], [[Limburgish]], [[Ripuarian (language)|Ripuarian]] (transitional dialects between Limbourgish and Ripuarian are called [[Low Dietsch]]), [[Moselle Franconian]] dialect of [[Trier]] and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]]. The Romance sprachraum was made of [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]] (with four distinct dialects around the cities of [[Charleroi]], [[Namur (city)|Namur]], [[Liège]] and [[Bastogne]]), [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] and [[Champenois]]. Due to [[mass education]] and the expansion of modern media such as television, the mid-20th century saw a uniformization of the different language regions, leading to the domination of the standard languages in their respective domains. In Wallonia, French became the dominant, priority language (local dialects being seldom used). Elsewhere in the Low Countries, the local dialects survived better, at least in private use.

The historical language border in the Low Countries corresponds to the frontier between populations whose majorities spoke distinct languages. However, the ruling upper classes most often spoke French. As was the case in many European [[noble court]]s, French was historically the nobility's language. This was also the case most of the rest of the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zweisprachigkeit in den Benelux-ländern |language=German |author=Johannes Kramer |quote=Zur prestige Sprache wurde in den Spanischen Niederlanden ganz eindeutig das Französische. Die Vertreter Spaniens beherrschte normalerweise das Französische, nicht aber das Niedderländische; ein beachtlicher Teil der am Hofe tätigen Adligen stammte aus Wallonien, das sich ja eher auf fie spanische Seite geschlagen hatte als Flandern und Brabant.  In dieser Situation war es selbstverständlich, dass die flämischen Adligen, die im Laufe der Zeit immer mehr ebenfalls zu Hofbeamten wurden, sich des Französischen bedienen mussten, wenn sie als gleichwertig anerkannt werden wollten. [Transl.: The prestigious language in the Spanish Netherlands was clearly French. Spain's representatives usually mastered French but not Dutch; a notable part of the nobles at the court came from Wallonia, which had taken party for the Spanish side to a higher extent than Flanders and Brabant.

For instance, while the major part of the population of Luxembourg speaks Luxembourgish in a private context, the [[languages of Luxembourg|administrative language]] of Luxembourg is French. As another example, the motto of the Kingdom of the Netherlands is the French phrase: "Je maintiendrai", because the language of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|Orange-Nassau]] reigning family was French until 1890. In Flanders, until the beginning of the 20th century, many upper class Flemish burghers, such as [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] or [[Suzanne Lilar]], used French as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Belgian nationalism ===
{{main article|Belgian nationalism}}
Currents of Belgian nationalism began to emerge in the late 19th century, seeking to overcome the ethnic and linguistic divide and create a national culture. Historian [[Henri Pirenne]] asserted that Belgian identity was not defined on racial, ethnic or linguistic lines, but in the civilizational community of the Belgian people.&lt;ref name="FL"/&gt; Supporters of a partition of Belgium argue that the synchronized attempts to forge a national identity and culture have been unable to forestall ethno-linguistic rivalries.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

=== Flemish movement ===
{{main article|Flemish movement}}
French was the only official language of Belgium until 1898, even though [[Flanders]] was and still is predominantly Dutch-speaking. The government's long refusal to acknowledge Dutch as an official language led to hostilities between Flanders and the French-speaking [[bourgeoisie]] who held both political and economic power. These hostilities gave rise to the [[Flemish movement]], which began as a literary and cultural organization, but later became a political movement that called for legal recognition of Dutch and for social emancipation of the [[Flemish people]]. The 1898 [[Coremans-De Vriendt law|Equality Law]] made Dutch an official language of Belgium, but it did not become the sole official language of Flanders until 1921.&lt;ref name="FL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Politics of Belgium: A Unique Federalism |author=John Fitzmaurice |publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. |year=1996 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9YiXzULaD8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=flemishisation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=1g4b3xyooj&amp;sig=tDFcnaXVmdWnPIEcyGpraXPAMQg&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA30,M1 |isbn=978-1-85065-209-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Frenchification of Brussels]] was at that time in full expansion. To this day, French remains the language of the aristocracy.

While a [[Sillon industriel|Walloon industrial and mining base]] developed during the 19th century, the largely agrarian Flanders area trailed in socio-economic development, leading to widespread demands for regional autonomy and the correction of imbalances in taxation, social services, and representation. The deterioration of the Walloon industrial base in the late 20th century occurred parallel to the growth of service and technological industries in Flanders, aggravating socio-economic tensions. Modern Fleming demands center over the alleged over-taxation of Flanders and insufficient autonomy and complaints over the concentration of social services in Wallonia, causing a so-called "stream of money" from Flanders to Wallonia.&lt;ref name="VanParijsHealth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WillemynsEconomicTransfer"/&gt; The Flemish movement has inspired the growth of Flemish nationalist political parties such as the [[People's Union (Belgium)|Volksunie]] (People's Union) which split into different parties including the [[Vlaams Blok]] (succeeded by the [[Vlaams Belang]]), the [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) and [[FlemishProgressives]]. While the N-VA seeks greater autonomy and favours the independence of Flanders, possibly in a confederate state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.n-va.be/programma/wiewatwaarom/beginselverklaring.asp |title=Beginselverklaring |work=[[New Flemish Alliance]] |date=October 13, 2001 |accessdate=July 28, 2007 |language=Dutch |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628082208/http://www.n-va.be/programma/wiewatwaarom/beginselverklaring.asp |archivedate = June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vlaams Belang is more clearly separatist.

=== Walloon/Francophone movement ===
{{main article|Walloon movement}}
The Walloon movement arose in the 19th century along with the language disputes; French-speakers sought the preservation of the French language and culture as the defining creed of the country. French-speaking politicians (who were sometimes  elected in Flanders) and other influential citizens opposed the Flemish demands for the recognition of Dutch and wished to maintain a centralized government to prevent regionalization. On the other hand, the Walloon politician [[Jules Destrée]] reacted in 1912 to the process of minorisation of [[Wallonia]] and asked explicitly for a splitting of Belgium along linguistic lines. However, Destrée was using the word ''separation'' in French in the sense of federalization ({{lang-fr|séparation administrative}}), and not in the sense of complete partition. ''[[The New York Times]]'' explained that Destrée was afraid of the domination of the Flemings within Belgian institutions.&lt;ref name="nytJulesDestree"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/09/08/100375417.pdf |title=Belgium may separate |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 9, 1912|accessdate=June 11, 2008 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:France-Wallonie-Bruxelles in red.svg|thumb|Map of [[France]] plus [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]] (red), as advocated by [[Rattachism|rattachist]]s]]
The Flemish historian Maarten van Ginderachter wrote that the [[Walloons]] were "excluded from the national power, between 1884 and 1902 there was only one Walloon in the Belgian government"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.flwi.ugent.be/btng-rbhc/pdf/Cahiers%20Jan%20Dhondt,%203,%20nl.pdf |author=Maarten Van Ginderachter |title=Het Kraaien van de Haan |language=Dutch |quote=de Waalse verbanning uit het centrum van de macht — tussen 1884 en 1902 zat er maximaal één Waal in de regering }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the division of Belgium into two clearly separate linguistic areas, and after the economic decline of Wallonia, two more or less separate currents have formed. One is a more regional Walloon movement, demanding to maintain the solidarity between the richer north and the poorer south, but also increasingly stressing the separate cultural identity of Wallonia. Another current is merely Francophone and pro-Belgian, but not regional as such, mainly based on the French-speakers of Brussels and especially of the surrounding rim municipalities which are effectively suburbs of Brussels but situated in Flanders. The two movements have in common the support of the French language, support of the Belgian state and opposition to further federal devolution. A minority of Walloons, however, support increased independence. Flemish nationalists have claimed that the French-speaking "Belgicists" of Brussels and its suburbs do not have common interests with the Walloons, but that these two parties have formed a [[quid-pro-quo]] alliance to oppose the Dutch-speaking majority.{{citation needed |date=June 2009}} According to this analysis, Walloon politicians would allegedly give political support to the French-speaking politicians of Brussels (and its surroundings) in return for receiving economic support to Wallonia.

Since the 1960s, Belgian political parties and civic organizations have witnessed bifurcation of membership and organizations between Walloon and Flanders. Ethnic tensions affect the working of local governments, which often pass laws prohibiting the use of the language of the respective minority populations in official functions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} For example, municipal council meetings in Flanders must take place in Dutch, even if a majority of the council is French-speaking. On the other hand, Dutch-speaking citizens of the Flemish municipalities close to Brussels claim their position is being undermined by the minority rights of French-speaking settlers. Significant pressures in living conditions have kept the two main communities separate and confined to their majority regions; stark ethnic and linguistic segregation has emerged in Brussels, the capital and largest city of the country.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Ethnic tensions have affected some of the city's surrounding municipalities, which are situated in Flanders, but have had a great influx of monolingual French-speakers as a result of suburbanisation. These Dutch-speaking "[[facility municipalities]]" are obliged to offer local government services in French, meaning health-care and public amenities are divided on linguistic lines, and in some municipalities the original French-speaking minority is believed to have become a majority.&lt;ref name="PA"/&gt;

=== Brussels ===
[[File:Map of Dutch-speaking political parties results in Brussels-Capital Region - 2010 (en).svg|thumb|300px|Votes for Dutch speaking parties in Brussels in the [[Belgian general election, 2010|Belgian federal election, 2010]]]]
The main reason for Brussels being mainly French-speaking was the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium during the 19th century and the severe discrimination of both Dutch as a language and of the Flemings.&lt;ref name="nlb"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/toor004gesc01_01/toor004gesc01_01_0029.htm |title=Nederlands in België, Het Nederlands bedreigd en overlevend |author=G.

Pijnenburg, J.A. van Leuvensteijn and J.M. van der Horst}}&lt;/ref&gt; French was, at that time, the language of the administration, government, culture, law and education. From 1880 onwards, more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual and passed only French on to their children, resulting in a rise of monolingual French-speakers after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers carried the day over the (mostly) bilingual Flemish inhabitants.&lt;ref name="brio4"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/andere%20publicaties/btng-rbhc,%2021,%201990,%203-4,%20pp%20383-412.pdf "Thuis in gescheiden werelden" — De migratoire en sociale aspecten van verfransing te Brussel in het midden van de 19e eeuw"], BTNG-RBHC, XXI, 1990, 3–4, pp. 383–412, Machteld de Metsenaere, Eerst aanwezend assistent en docent Vrije Universiteit Brussel&lt;/ref&gt; Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian [[communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|language border]] and the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use.&lt;ref name="dbnl"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_han001197301_01/_han001197301_01_0009.htm |title=De historische kracht van de Vlaamse beweging in België: de doelstellingen van gister, de verwezenlijkingen vandaag en de culturele aspiraties voor morgen |author=J.

The status of Brussels in a partitioned Belgium is uncertain and a source of considerable debate.

; Union with Flanders

One idea is that the city rejoins Flanders in which Brussels is geographically and economically embedded. Proposals include a guarantee that the linguistic rights of the French-speaking population in Brussels are safeguarded.

; Union with Wallonia
Another idea is that Brussels would form a union with Wallonia, often referred to as Wallobrux. One problem is that the regions do not border each other, as Brussels is an enclave in Flanders. Some French-speaking politicians therefore demand that a corridor be made between the two territories (see the topic of the extension of Brussels below).

; City-state scenario
{{see also|Brussels and the European Union}}
Another idea is that Brussels would become a "European [[capital districts and territories|[capital] district]]", similar to [[Washington D.C.]] or the [[Australian Capital Territory]], run by the EU rather than Flanders or Wallonia. The Union's structure, however, has no experience at governing at this level at present. To fulfill this solution in practice, Brussels would probably need to be an independent [[city-state]] which could join the EU on equal footing with other [[European Union member state|EU member states]].&lt;ref name="uclouvain"/&gt; The possible status of Brussels as a "city-state" has been suggested by [[Charles Picqué]], [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region|Minister-President]] of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]], who sees a tax on the [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]] as a way of enriching the city.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} However, the Belgian issue has generated very little discussion within the EU bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Feki |first=Donya |title=Jean Quatremer: a nation has been born—Flanders |date=November 29, 2007 |work=Café Babel |url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/politics/article/jean-quatremer-a-nation-has-been-born-flanders.html|accessdate=2016-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Extension of Brussels

[[File:Arrondissement Brussels-Periphery Belgium Map.PNG|thumb|right|The six [[municipalities with language facilities]] in the periphery of Brussels (red) belong to the province [[Flemish Brabant]] (gray)]]
A controversial issue, complicating the "city-state" scenario, is the possible extension of the Brussels capital region into the surrounding [[municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]] within Flemish Brabant and [[Walloon Brabant]]. This proposal is not necessarily linked to a split-up of Belgium.

Some have, however, suggested that these wealthy areas would make the city financially viable as an independent state, potentially give it around [[List of cities by population|1.5 million inhabitants]], an [[Brussels Airport|airport]] and [[Sonian Forest|forest]] within its boundaries, and make it three or four times larger than the current capital region. Currently, Brussels is the most important seat of EU institutions, but the EU has no formal capital. It has been claimed that a large and independent status may help Brussels advance its claim as the capital of the EU.&lt;ref name="uclouvain"&gt;{{cite web |last=van Parijs |first=Philippe |title=Brussels after Belgium: fringe town or city state? |date=October 4, 2007 |work=The Bulletin |url=http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/2007zp.Brussels_Bulletin.final.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enlargement of the Brussels capital region is supported by many French-speakers in the [[Municipalities with language facilities#Dutch-speaking municipalities with facilities for French-speakers|Flemish municipalities with facilities for French-speakers]] surrounding Brussels. As a result of suburbanisation and an influx of French-speakers and EU officials from Brussels, these municipalities have in recent decades become increasingly French-speaking to an extent that French-speakers now form a majority in some municipalities. In contrast, an extension of the bilingual region is out of the question for the Dutch-speaking inhabitants of these communities and for virtually all Flemish political parties, who say that these newer inhabitants should respect and adjust to the language of the region they are moving into. In fact the facilities now in place were initially established in order to ease the adaptation of the French-speaking to living in a Flemish area.

Similar to a "Greater Brussels" region, the electoral district of [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] consisted of Brussels and 35 surrounding municipalities in Flanders. Prior to its dissolution, this district was the last remaining entity in Belgium that did not coincide with provincial borders, and as such had been deemed unconstitutional by the Belgian Constitutional Court. The district was a conflict issue for several years, and a major political problem in the [[2007–2008 Belgian government formation|cabinet formation crisis of 2007–2008]]. In July 2012, following the [[2010–2011 Belgian government formation]], Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde was split into two parts as part of the [[sixth Belgian state reform]].

; Condominium

Another proposition is the establishment of a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] of the Flemish and the French-speaking Communities of Brussels, where both sides would govern Brussels together for national and international issues. For all local territorial policies, Brussels would be fully autonomous. For all 'non-territorial' public services (as culture, welfare and education), each community would enjoy autonomy. This idea is in general popular among Flemish politicians, such as socialist politician [[Louis Tobback]] and nationalist [[Bart De Wever]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Such an arrangement has existed for several centuries in [[Maastricht]]. Shortly after 1200 this city received [[Condominium (international law)|dual authority]], with the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|prince-bishops of Liège]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant|dukes of Brabant]] holding joint sovereignty over the city.  In 1284, this dual authority was formally endorsed in a constitutional agreement, the 'Alde Caerte' ('Old Charter').  After some disputes in the interpretation, this was elaborated further in 1356 with the Doghter Caerte ('Daughter Charter'). These institutional arrangements then survived until the French Revolution.

This dual authority ensured a relatively stable and prosperous institutional environment for nearly six centuries (from  1204 till 1794). The citizens from Maastricht had to choose between the Brabant nationality (and jurisprudence) and the Liège nationality. Each had its own judges and public services. Something similar would be the case if Brussels would become a condominium governed by the two major communities, the French-speakers and the Flemings.

===German-speaking Community===
[[File:Karte_Deutschsprachige_Gemeinschaft.svg|thumb|The German-Speaking Community (yellow).  The municipalities of [[Malmedy]] and [[Waimes]] belong to the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] (light grey).]]

The small [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] in the east is in fact more an observer than a player in the difficult negotiations between Flanders and Wallonia.  The region of [[Eupen-Malmedy]] was given to Belgium in the aftermath of the [[First World War]]. (The former German city of [[Malmedy]] and the surrounding villages are Walloon and therefore are not part of the German-speaking Community.) The territory consists of two detached parts with a total area of about {{cvt|850|km2}}. Approximately 75,000 people live there. The conflict between Walloons and Flemings provided the German-speaking Community with considerable autonomy. Although the region is too small to play a role in the negotiations, it obtained an autonomy similar to that of its larger neighbors. The German-speaking Belgians now have a parliament and a [[Government of the German-speaking Community|government]] with four ministers and a [[minister-president]].&lt;ref name=PreusAllgZeit&gt;{{cite news | title=Was wird aus Eupen? | author=Hans Heckel | newspaper = Preußische Allgemeine Zeitung |date=December 1, 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-26 |url=http://www.ostpreussen.de/textarchiv.html?embed=http%3A%2F%2Fsuche.ostpreussenarchiv.de%2Fonline-archiv%2Ffile.asp%3FFolder%3Darchiv11%26File%3D2220110604paz21.htm%26STR1%3Deupen%26STR2%3D%26STR3%3D%26STR4%3D | language=German |trans-title=What shall happen to Eupen?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four theoretical scenarios are usually considered in the event that a partition of Belgium would occur: remaining with Wallonia, sovereign statehood, reattachment to Germany, or attachment to Luxembourg. The community is part of the Walloon [[province of Liège]] and, per se, would stay so in case of partition. This status quo solution is the most probable, although it is uncertain whether or not the German-speakers could maintain their cultural and political rights in the long term in an otherwise monolingual francophone country. The other three possibilities would become realistic only if Wallonia were to seek unification with France. Since the community used to be part of Germany, "reunification" seems to be the logical step to take (the region borders the [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]). However, opponents to this idea argue that the autonomy of the region would be lost in Germany as much as it would in France. Therefore, and because of the strong cohesion of the regional population, some would prefer the creation of an independent state. They argue that the new country would, for example, be five times as large and more than twice as populous as [[Liechtenstein]]. Opponents say this would lead to the creation of a new undesired [[tax haven]]. The last option would be to merge with [[Luxembourg]]. Supporters of this scenario underline that many from [[St. Vith]] currently commute to Luxembourg and that a union with the rich [[Grand Duchy]] would be economically profitable. However this would leave the northern part of the community around [[Eupen]] as an [[exclave]] of Luxembourg. Minister-president [[Karl-Heinz Lambertz]] has been said to have supported such a project. He, however, has refuted this and has committed himself to the continued union with Belgium.&lt;ref name=PreusAllgZeit/&gt; In an interview with the German TV-channel [[Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen|ZDF]] in February 2011, he listed the four aforementioned options concerning the future of the German-speaking Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/beitrag/video/1262718/Belgien-249-Tage-ohne-Regierung |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220043313/http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/beitrag/video/1262718/Belgien-249-Tage-ohne-Regierung#/beitrag/video/1262718/Belgien-249-Tage-ohne-Regierung |archive-date=February 20, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parties with long lasting participation in the Belgian governments, that is the Christian Democrats, the Liberals and the Socialists, as well as the Green parties, usually refuse to speak openly about a possible partitioning of Belgium.  This question seems to be taboo on the Belgian political scene and is only discussed from time to time by mainstream politicians in order to menace the other community, not unlike the atomic bomb threat during the [[Cold War]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/monde/298173.FR.php |title=L'appel à une "Belgique française" [Call for a "French Belgium"] |language=French |publisher=[[Libération]] |author=Jean Quatremer |date=December 15, 2007 |accessdate=2008-05-20 |quote=[...][[Daniel Ducarme]] [...] propose [...] que les francophones créent une «Belgique française», réunissant les régions de Bruxelles et de Wallonie, qui serait «associée» à la France !

While most Francophones argue that the state reform is unnecessary, virtually all Flemish political parties demand a severe reform of the Belgian state.  In particular the [[New Flemish Alliance|N-VA]] and a part of the Flemish movement want to apply the so-called [[Maddens Doctrine]] in order to enforce the Francophones to require such a state reform.

Socialist Party Different (sp.a), the Flemish socialist party, states on its website that it believes an independent Flanders is not necessary. It does support the devolution of a number of additional responsibilities, such as the railways or the policy of employment.  [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (Open VLD) want more socio-economic and financial autonomy for Flanders, a homogenous division of responsibilities, more cooperation between the communities and regions and a strong federal state.  Green, the Flemish green party, wants another round in the state reform, but only if it leads to more solidarity, a better functioning of the institutions and more democracy. It states on its website that it doesn’t want to reform for the purpose of reforming. Green wants Belgium to remain a federal state and considers the cooperation between different communities within one state to be a challenge rather than a problem. It also pleads for federal loyalty and respect for the rulings of the Constitutional Court and wants to see a more homogenous division of responsibilities.

The Francophone Socialist Party (PS) and Christian democrats (cdH) promote the conservation of the current Belgian [[welfare state]], and therefore oppose any further regionalisation of the federal [[social policy|social policies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ps.be/Source/PageContent.aspx?ParentID=1282&amp;MenID=4833&amp;EntID=1

=== 2007 government formation ===
{{main article|2007–08 Belgian government formation}}
[[File:Yves Leterme.jpg|thumb|[[Yves Leterme]] (CD&amp;V) won the 2007 federal election after an alliance with the separatist party N-VA.]]
The [[Belgian general election, 2007]], resulted in no political party or coalition gaining enough seats to form a working majority. The crisis continued for 196 days, leaving Belgium without a government with a popular mandate. While prime minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]]'s [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] ministry remained in power as [[caretaker government|caretaker]], several leading politicians were nominated without success by the King&lt;ref&gt;Footnote: During the government formation periods, the king nominates the governmental [[formateur|formateurs and informateurs]] and therefore acts as a mediator between the different political parties. However it is not clear whether the head of the Belgian state acts on his own initiative or only on the advice of senior politicians, of the caretaker government or of the [[Crown Council of Belgium|Council of the Crown]].&lt;/ref&gt; to build a stable governmental coalition. Flemish politician [[Yves Leterme]] had been the prime candidate to lead the national government, but a political gaffe would prove to be his undoing. Asked to sing the Belgian national anthem in French at National Day celebrations, instead of the [[Brabançonne]] Leterme started to sing the ''[[La Marseillaise|Marseillaise]]'', France's anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/archief/2.1222/politiek/1.438580 |title=De lijdensweg van de regering-Leterme |language=Dutch |date=December 19, 2008 |publisher=VRT web site deredactie.be |accessdate=2011-08-29}} ''"Op 21 juli, de nationale feestdag, giet Leterme dan nog eens ongewild olie op het vuur door de Marseillaise te zingen in plaats van de Brabançonne"''.&lt;/ref&gt; Leterme's error drew condemnation from the different communities, aggravating distrust and separatist sentiments.

Eventually, after 196 days, the parties finally succeeded in forming a new government. In December 2008, another crisis related to the [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis case]], erupted, again destabilising the country and resulting in the resignation of [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Belgian Prime Minister]] [[Yves Leterme]]. The new [[Herman Van Rompuy]]-led government brought a brief period of fragile stability, but ended when Van Rompuy left his office to become the first full-term [[President of the European Council]]. The succeeding [[Leterme II government]] fell in April 2010 over the lack of progress on resolving the BHV issue.

Although most Flemish political parties describe their demands as limited to seeking greater regional autonomy and decentralization of government (save for&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; members of the [[Vlaams Belang]] party, who called for a splitting of the country and claim of a national identity, [[culture of Belgium|culture]] and institutions, and claim Belgium is an "unnatural" and "artificial" state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,2170606,00.html |title=Belgium?

After the [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (Open VLD) left the government on April 22, 2010, Prime Minister [[Yves Leterme]] offered his resignation to [[Albert II of Belgium|King Albert II]]. An [[Belgian general election, 2010|election]] were then called for June 13, amid fears that coalition-building would once again be protracted. In Flanders, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party won a plurality with 27.8% of votes, while the winning party in Wallonia was the [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Socialist Party]]. Both parties, along with other parties, negotiated a state reform during the [[2010 Belgian government formation]].

Although seven parties (N-VA, CD&amp;V, sp.a, Groen!, PS, cdH, and Ecolo) were participating, the negotiations were led by the main winners, [[Bart De Wever]] (N-VA) and [[Elio Di Rupo]] (PS). The large number of implied parties was due not only to the multipolar Belgian political landscape but also to the will of the Flemish parties to [[state reform in Belgium|reform the state]] and, hence, to change the [[constitution of Belgium|constitution]], which can be modified according only to very restrictive rules including a two-third majority vote in the Lower House.

Some in the international media saw this election as evidence that Belgium would be partitioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/06/201061352529302994.html |title=Unity at stake in Belgium vote – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=June 13, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 9, 2010, a poll taken by [[RTL Television|RTL]] showed that a third of the French-speaking population supported the beginning of preparations for the country's partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1/3 des Wallons prêts à une scission  | url = http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2010/09/09/97001-20100909FILWWW00686-13-des-wallons-prets-a-une-scission.php  | agency = AFP | newspaper = Le Figaro | date = September 9, 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-09 | language = French |trans-title=1/3 of the Walloons ready to a partition }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Een op de drie Franstaligen wil eigen staat voorbereiden  | url = http://www.gva.be/nieuws/binnenland/aid971043/een-op-de-drie-walen-wil-een-franstalige-staat-voorbereiden.aspx  | newspaper = Gazeet van Antwerpen | date = September 9, 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-09 | language = Dutch |trans-title=One of three Francophones is willing to prepare an independent state}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, [[Het Laatste Nieuws]] published the result of a poll within the Flemish population.

This percentage is to be compared with the 12% of the Belgians wanting a partition of the country and the 32% who desired a further federalization. The poll also showed that a unitary Belgian state was supported by 22% of the Flemish, 50% of the Brusselers and 51% of the Walloons, and that 16% of the Flemish wished a split of Belgium. It is interesting to compare this with the 40.8% of Flemings who voted for a party advocating Flemish independence during the 2010 election. In any case, the vast majority of the Belgians want a change: only 8% agree with the current Belgian federal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/article/612280/la-belgique-unitaire-fait-rever-quatre-belges-sur-dix.html | newspaper=La Libre Belgique | date=September 25, 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-26 | title=La Belgique unitaire fait rêver quatre Belges sur dix | language = French |trans-title=4 Belgians out of 10 dream at unitary Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgians who participated in this poll were also asked which scenario they would prefer in case a partition of Belgium did occur. An independent Flanders together with a union of Brussels and Wallonia was supported by 35% of the Belgians. The creation of three small states (Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia) was preferred by 23%, a union between France and Wallonia was supported by 14%, and a union between Flanders and Brussels together with an independent Wallonia by 12%. In Flanders, 27% supported a three-state scenario and 26% supported a union between Flanders and Brussels. Those who had no preferred scenario numbered 25%. The majority of the Walloons (53%) agreed with a union between Brussels and Wallonia while a minority (21%) supported a merge with France. Only 10% of the Walloons prefer an independent Walloon state. In contrast, the Brusselers were divided between a union with Wallonia (39%) and a city-state scenario (34%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/elections-2010/article/612385/les-wallons-pour-une-federation-avec-bruxelles-en-cas-de-scission.html | newspaper=La Libre Belgique | date=September 26, 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-26 | title=Les Wallons pour une fédération avec Bruxelles en cas de scission  | language = French |trans-title=The Walloons support a federation with Brussels in case of a partition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2010, [[Bart De Wever]] (N-VA) departed from the negotiations.  His exit put [[Elio Di Rupo]]'s Plan B for Belgium, i.e. a partition of Belgium along the borderline of the French Community, under a new light and many, particularly in the French-speaking part of the country, started to speak openly about its concrete realization.  Plan B is the continuation of Belgium with Brussels and Wallonia only and the departure of Flanders from the Belgian federation.  On October 10, Elio Di Rupo stated on television what his plan was: first, asking the Flemish population whether it was willing to secede; second, asking the population in Brussels and Wallonia whether they intended to remain united within Belgium. He also stressed that in either case citizens living in municipalities with linguistic facilities should also be asked.

Oktober 2010 | author=Alexander Homann | newspaper=BRF Online | date=October 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Plan B proposed by Di Rupo was developed by [[Christian Berhendt]], a specialist of constitutional law at the [[University of Liège]].  According to Berhendt, a hypothetical partition of Belgium is constrained by the fact that no political party is ready to split Belgium at the cost of separating from the numerous international organizations to which Belgium is affiliated.  These constraints are such that a splitting of the country would require the modification and ratification of a huge number of treaties.  The interpenetration of the Belgian entities is so complicated that, in comparison, the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peaceful splitting of Czechoslovakia]] appears quite simple.  According to Berhendt several scenarios are therefore impossible: a unilateral secession of Flanders would be rejected by [[Lists of active separatist movements|countries fearing secession of their own minorities]], such as China, Russia or Spain, because this would create a precedent they cannot allow; the creation of an autonomous European district in Brussels is not a realistic perspective because the European Union, as it is now, is not able to administrate such a large city; a scenario where Flanders and Brussels would form a union is unlikely either because, according to Berhendt, the French-speakers will never agree on such a treaty.&lt;ref name=Berhendt&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=La Libre Belgique | date=October 23, 2010 | author=Martin Buxant | title=Ne pas changer de nationalité, c’est capital | url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/article/618825/ne-pas-changer-de-nationalite-c-est-capital.html |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[Marc Verdussen]] ([[Université Catholique de Louvain]]), two doorways are open: Plan B1, Belgium dissolves into two entities Flanders on the one hand and a new Wallonia-Brussels state on the other; and Plan B2, Flanders secedes and a residual Belgian state continues with Brussels and Wallonia.  Though it is clear that Plan B2 is favorable to the Francophones,&lt;ref name=Berhendt/&gt; it is not evident that it would be accepted by the Flemings and by a hypothetical international tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=La Libre Belgique | language=French | author=Francis Van de Woestyne | title=Une Belgique amputée de la Flandre ?

The Gewif therefore argued that only a union with France would be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Le Soir | date=August 16, 2010 | author=Edgard Baeckeland |author2=Guy Bertrand |author3=Willy Burgeon |author4=Jean-Alexis D'Heur| author5=Jules Gheude |author6=Marc Hansen | author7=Jean-Sébastien Jamart | author8=Jean-Luc Lefèvre |author9=Jean Lerusse | author10=Michel Pieret | author11=Jean-François Renwart | title=Un plan B pour Elio Di Rupo | url=http://www.lesoir.be/debats/cartes_blanches/2010-08-16/un-plan-b-pour-elio-di-rupo-787440.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Other groups are for the reunion of Wallonia and Brussels with France.

However Le Soir's columnists observed that the new state would have a huge GDP per capita (31,000 €) and would rank 7th among the 27 EU states.  Nevertheless, this would be only due to the inclusion of Brussels where the GDP per capita numbers more than 60,000 €.&lt;ref name=BRF100913/&gt;

'''Reflective writing''' is an [[analysis|analytical]] practice in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, form, adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the item or incident, thought, feeling, emotion, or situation in his or her life. Many reflective writers keep in mind questions, such as "What did I notice?", "How has this changed me?" or "What might I have done differently?".

Thus, the focus is on writing that is not merely descriptive. The writer revisits the scene to note details and emotions, reflect on meaning, examine what went well or revealed a need for additional learning, and relate what transpired to the rest of life.

Reflective writing is also analyzing the event or idea (thinking in depth and from different [[Point of view (literature)|perspectives]], and trying to explain, often with reference to a model or theory from the subject.)

'''''Shabda''''', or '''{{IAST|Śabda}}''', is the [[Sanskrit]] word for "speech sound". In [[Sanskrit grammar]], the term refers to an [[utterance]] in the sense of [[linguistic performance]].

==History==
In classical Indian [[philosophy of language]], the grammarian [[Katyayana]] stated that ''shabda'' ("speech") is eternal (''nitya''), as is ''[[artha]]'' "meaning", and that they share a mutual co-relation. According to [[Patanjali]], the permanent aspect of ''shabda'' is [[sphoṭa|{{IAST|sphoṭa}}]] ("meaning"), while ''dhvani'' ("sound, acoustics") is ephemeral to ''shabda''.

Om, or [[Om|Aum]], a sacred syllable of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]], is considered to be the first resonating vibrational sound within an individual being. It also denotes the non-dualistic universe as a whole. In Buddhism, Om corresponds to the [[crown chakra]] and white light.

[[Bhartrihari]], on the other hand, held a ''shabda-[[advaita]]'' position, identifying ''shabda'' as indivisible, and unifying the notions of cognition and linguistic performance, which is ultimately identical to [[Brahman]]. Bhartrhari recognised two entities, both of which may be referred to as ''shabda''. One entity is the underlying cause of the articulated sounds, while the other entity is the functionality that is used to express meaning. Bhartrhari thus rejected the difference posited between the ontological and the linguistic by [[Indian logic|logicians]]. His concept of ''shabda-brahman'' which identified linguistic performance and creation itself ran parallel to the Greek concept of ''[[logos]]''.

Language philosophy in Medieval India was dominated by the dispute of the "naturalists" to the [[Mimamsa]] school, notably defended by [[Kumarila]], who held that ''shabda'' designates the actual phonetic utterance, and the Sphota school, defended by [[Mandana Mishra]], which identifies ''[[sphota]]'' and ''shabda'' as a mystical "indivisible word-whole".

==In religion==

===Hinduism===
''Shabda'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word that was first used as a religio-philosophic term in the context of Hindu religion. It refers to the verbal testimony (of revealed scriptures: ''[[shruti]]'' that is indispensable to gaining knowledge of the ultimate reality, Brahman.

===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]] the term ''Shabad'' has two primary meanings. The first context of the term is to refer to a hymn or paragraph or sections of the [[Holy Text]] that appears in [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the main holy scripture of the Sikhs. The Guru Granth Sahib is organised by chapters of ''[[ragas]]'', with each chapter containing many ''shabads'' of that ''raga''. The first ''Shabad'' in Guru Granth Sahib is the [[Mool Mantar]]. The script used for the ''Shabad'' is [[Gurmukhi]]. ''Shabad'' is the term also used to refer to hymns within other Sikh scriptures, like [[Deh Siva Var Mohe]]. The second use of the term ''Shabad'' in Sikhism is for the holy name of God, [[Waheguru]].

===Other faiths and philosophies===
Esoterically, ''Shabd'' is the “Sound Current vibrating in all creation. It can be heard by the inner ears.”&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/gloss.htm Glossary of Oriental terms and important names of persons and places] ''&lt;/ref&gt; Variously referred to as the ''Audible Life Stream'', ''Inner Sound'', ''Sound Current'' or ''Word'' in English,{{source?|date=January 2018}} the ''Shabd'' is the [[Esotericism|esoteric]] essence of [[God]] which is available to all human beings, according to the Shabd path teachings of [[Sant Mat]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[Eckankar]], Vardankar (a split-off from Eckankar),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giamboi|first1=Heather|title=Thousands of Visits to Heaven and the Heart of God: "The Most Profound, Vividly Detailed Out of Body Discoveries Yet!"|publisher=Direct Path Publishing|isbn=978-0996907309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Twitchell|first1=Paul|title=The Shariyat-Ki-Huray Book Two|publisher=Direct Path Publishing|isbn=978-0996907378}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]].

Adherents believe that a ''[[satguru]]'', [[Eck Master]], or VARDAN Master, who is a [[human]] being, has merged with the ''Shabd'' in such a manner that he or she is a living manifestation of it at its highest level (the “Word made flesh”). However, not only can the ''Satguru'' attain this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way. Indeed, in [[Sant Mat]] the ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d’être]]'' for the human form is to meditate on the Sound Current, and in so doing merge with it until one’s own divinity is ultimately realized.

''Naam'' ("Word") has been described through the use of several different terms. [[Sant Baljit Singh]], a contemporary Sant Mat Master, uses the term "Light and Sound Current". He describes it as the connecting link between human beings and God.

"'''Sir Galahad'''" is a poem written by [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson]], and published in his [[Poems (Tennyson, 1842)|1842 collection of poetry]]. It is one of his many poems that deal with the [[Matter of Britain|legend of King Arthur]], and describes [[Galahad]] experiencing a vision of the [[Holy Grail]]. The subject of the poem was later included in "The Holy Grail" section of Tennyson's ''[[Idylls of the King]]'', but the latter version depicts Galahad as a pious individual who is grimly determined to fulfill his destiny. ''Sir Galahad'', in contrast, depicts Galahad as prideful, and has almost cheerful undertones.

==Background==
In 1833, Tennyson's close friend [[Arthur Hallam]] died. The death greatly affected both Tennyson and his sister Emily, and he withdrew from society as he slowly dealt with the pain. By mid-summer 1834, they slowly began to participate together in social events once again. On one occasion, Tennyson, Emily, and his other sister Mary were invited to visit friends in [[Dorking]],  and then travel onwards to see the Hallam family. Tennyson, however, set out on his own, and spent time alone at [[Leith Hill]], Dorking. It was during this time that he began working on a version of ''Sir Galahad'', along with an early version of ''The Blackbird'' and a version of "The Sleeping Beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Thorn 1975 pp. 122–134&lt;/ref&gt; 

The poem was completed in September 1834.&lt;ref name="Shaw p. 202"&gt;Shaw 1976 p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in the second volume of [[Poems (Tennyson, 1842)|Tennyson's 1842 collection of poems]], along with other poems discussing the Arthurian legend. These included "Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere" and "Morte d'Arthur".&lt;ref&gt;Martin 1979 p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; The Galahad story was picked up again by Tennyson in the section "The Holy Grail" of ''Idylls of the King''. The later work was first published in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Epperly 1992 p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poem==
The poem begins with a description of Galahad that, in terms of rhythm and rhyme, is almost cheerful even though the language is not:&lt;ref name="Epperly p. 106"&gt;Epperly 1992 p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
:My good blade carves the casques of men,
:My tough lance thrusteth sure,
:My strength is as the strength of ten
:Because my heart is pure. (lines 1–4)

As the poem continues, Galahad is able to experience a vision that is preceded by a sound:&lt;ref name="Shaw p. 202"/&gt;
:When down the stormy crescent goes,
:A light before me swims,
:Between dark stems the forest glows,
:I hear a noise of hymns:
:Then by some secret shrine I ride;
:I hear a voice but none are there;  (lines 25–30)

This vision includes three angels with the Holy Grail:&lt;ref name="Shaw p. 203"&gt;Shaw 1976 p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;
:Three angels bear the holy Grail:
:With folded feet, in stoles of white,
:On sleeping wings they sail.
:Ah, blessed vision! blood of God!
:My spirit beats her mortal bars,
:As down dark tides the glory slides,
:And star-like mingles with the stars. (lines 42–48)

Galahad continues by comparing the vision to light clothed in drapery:&lt;ref name="Shaw p. 203"/&gt;
:A maiden knight-to me is given
:Such hope, I know not fear;
:I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven
:That often meet me here.
:I muse on joy that will not cease,
:Pure spaces clothed in living beams,
:Pure lilies of eternal peace,
:Whose odours haunt my dreams; (lines 61–68)

==Themes==
In ''In Memoriam'', Tennyson suggests that the supernatural has to be partly known and partly unknown. In order to incorporate this idea into his poetry, Tennyson relies on a series of different characters who serve as filters to visions of truth. These characters appear in many of Tennyson's poems, with the figure of Galahad being the one who is most capable of understanding the visions. In Galahad's case, his vision is of the Holy Grail, which contains images similar to those in "The Holy Grail" in ''Idylls of the King''. In "The Holy Grail", Bors and Lancelot as well as Galahad receive visions. Of the three, Galahad is the one who best understands his abilities and his sins, and his strength allows him to complete his quest.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw 1976 pp. 202–204&lt;/ref&gt; 

In terms of differences between "Sir Galahad" and "The Holy Grail", "Sir Galahad" depicts Galahad as prideful in regards to his abilities and to his purity, whereas "The Holy Grail" emphasizes that Galahad is both pious and grimly determined. Furthermore, the rhythm of "Sir Galahad" is almost cheerful, whereas "The Holy Grail" is melancholic. "The Holy Grail" incorporates a passage in which King Arthur begs his knights not to quest because he knows that most of them will not return. In the event, the quest does indeed mark the end of the Round Table. In the end, only Galahad is capable of completing the Grail Quest, while many of the knights are killed.&lt;ref&gt;Epperly 1992 pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

As with "The Lady of Shalott", "Morte d'Arthur", and other poems, Tennyson incorporates technical aspects of "Sir Galahad" into ''Idylls of the King''. The aspects that are drawn from "Sir Galahad" are the same as those taken from "Morte d'Arthur": the use of ritual. This addition allows Tennyson to create a long poem that relies on a variety of styles while containing artistic value.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw 1976 pp. 222, 274&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Idylls of the King'' varies in terms of meter and tone from "Sir Galahad", as the former is blank verse and the latter is a mixture of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter.&lt;ref name="Epperly p. 106"/&gt;

The '''[[social history]] of the [[piano]]''' is the history of the instrument's role in society. The piano was invented at the end of the 17th century, had become widespread in Western society by the end of the 18th, and is still widely played today.

==Early years==
At the time of its origin around the year 1700,&lt;ref name="met museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the piano was a speculative invention, produced by the well-paid craftsman and inventor [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] for his wealthy patron [[Ferdinando (III) de' Medici|Ferdinando de Medici]], Grand Prince of [[Florence]]. As such, it was an extremely expensive item. For some time after its invention, the piano was largely owned by royalty (e.g. the kings of [[Portugal]] and [[Prussia]]); see [[Fortepiano]] for details. Even later on, (i.e. throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries), pianos were financially beyond the reach of most families, and the pianos of those times were generally the property of the [[gentry]] and the [[aristocracy]]. Visiting music masters taught their children to play the piano.

==Pianos and women==
Both Parakilas&lt;ref&gt;Parakilas (1999, 96–109)&lt;/ref&gt; and Loesser&lt;ref&gt;Loesser (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize a connection during this period between pianos and the female gender; piano study was apparently more common for girls than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Wheelock (1999, 117) asserts this, basing her claim on the "iconography of the period"; i.e. surviving paintings and other images. Perhaps facetiously, she adds that this evidence "confirms the impression that '[[Historically informed performance|historically correct]]' performances of solos and trios should feature women at the keyboard."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, women were discouraged from playing the piano professionally and were encouraged not to take their musical aspirations too seriously. Nevertheless, women were considered more attractive and desirable if they could play the piano. The piano was a symbol of social status, and the ability to play the piano stood as a testament to a woman's marriageability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iawm.org/stef/articles_html/burns_piano_women.html|title="Women in Piano Pedagogy"|website=iawm.org|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Emma Darwin.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Emma Wedgwood Darwin]]
Women who had learned to play as children often continued to play as adults, thus providing music in their households.&lt;ref&gt;Parakilas (1999, 102)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Emma Wedgwood]] (1808–1896), the granddaughter of the wealthy industrialist [[Josiah Wedgwood]], took piano lessons from none other than [[Frédéric Chopin]], and apparently achieved a fair level of proficiency. Following her marriage to [[Charles Darwin]], Emma still played the piano daily, while her husband listened appreciatively.

A number of female piano students became outright ''virtuose'', and the skills of woman pianists inspired the work of [[Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who dedicated difficult-to-play works to their woman friends.&lt;ref&gt;Wheelock (1999, 116) notes that with but a single exception, the dedicatees of Haydn's keyboard works were all women (the exception is the first publication authorised by his employer [[Nikolaus Esterházy]], the sonatas of 1774, which were dedicated to him).&lt;/ref&gt; However, careers as concert musicians were typically open only to men (an important exception was [[Clara Schumann]]).

==The spread of the piano==

When the piano was invented in 1700, it failed to catch the public's attention due to its expense and the fact that the [[harpsichord]] was the preferred instrument of the time. Very few people knew of the piano until after the [[Seven Years' War]] when a young man named Johann Zumpe fled Germany for London. While there he refined Cristofori's piano, introducing separate sections of black keys as well as treble and bass capabilities. This new piano was extremely difficult to play, and very few people learned how to play the instrument because of this. That changed when Zumpe convinced [[Johann Christian Bach]], the personal music master to [[Queen Charlotte]] and an international celebrity, to purchase and play on a Zumpe piano for the first ever Zumpe piano concert in 1768. Because of Bach's fame, the piano soon replaced the harpsichord as the predominant instrument of the time, and later composers such as Mozart and Beethoven chose to play on a Zumpe piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.piano-tuners.org/history/history_1.html|title=A History of the Piano, 1157-2014|website=www.piano-tuners.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bach's fame and the interest of Queen Charlotte helped the piano become a symbol of social status. The turn of the 19th century also saw the rise of the [[middle class]] in the Western world. This middle class was eager to showcase their social status, and it became the proper [[Victorian era|Victorian]] man's goal to shower his wife and daughters with leisure time and leisure activities, as leisure was a symbol of social status. Consequently, the piano, which was often used for leisure, stood as a testament to a family's position on the socioeconomic ladder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thecuriouspianoteachers.org/history-of-piano-teaching-part-1/ |title=The Social History of Piano Teaching - Part 1 - The Curious Piano Teachers |date=2016-06-17 |work=The Curious Piano Teachers |access-date=2017-03-09 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the middle class of Europe and North America increased in both numbers and prosperity. This increase produced a corresponding rise in the domestic importance of the piano, as ever more families became able to afford pianos and piano instruction. The piano also became common in public institutions, such as schools, hotels, and [[public houses]]. As elements of the Western middle-class lifestyle gradually spread to other nations, the piano became common in these nations as well, for example in [[Japan]].

To understand the rise of the piano among the middle class, it is helpful to remember that before mechanical and electronic reproduction, music was in fact performed on a daily basis by ordinary people. For instance, the working people of every nation generated a body of [[folk music]], which was transmitted orally down through the generations and sung by all. The parents of [[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) could not read music, yet [[Mathias Haydn|Haydn's father]] (who worked as a wheelwright) taught himself to play the [[harp]], and the Haydn family frequently played and sang together. With rising prosperity, the many families that could now afford pianos and music adapted their home-grown musical abilities to the new instrument, and the piano became a major source of music in the home.

Amateur pianists in the home often kept track of the doings of the leading pianists and composers of their day. Professional virtuosi wrote books and methods for the study of piano playing, which sold widely. The virtuosi also prepared their own editions of classical works, which included detailed marks of tempo and expression to guide the amateur who wanted to use their playing as a model. (Today, students are usually encouraged to work from an [[Urtext edition]].) The piano compositions of the great composers often sold well among amateurs, despite the fact that, starting with Beethoven, they were often far too hard for anyone but a trained virtuoso to play well. Evidently, the amateur pianists obtained satisfaction from coming to grips with the finest music, even if they could not perform it from start to finish.&lt;ref&gt;This point is made in a variety of places in Loesser (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

A favourite form of musical recreation in the home was playing works for [[four-hand piano]], in which the two players sit side by side at a single piano. These were frequently arrangements of orchestral works, and in the days before recordings served to spread knowledge of new orchestral music to places lacking an orchestra. Sometimes members of the household would sing or play other instruments along with the piano. This practice was often a part of [[courtship]], for performing music together—particularly in the presence or at least earshot of other members of the household—was one of the few "respectable" ways for a young man and young woman from "good" families to be together.

Parents whose children showed unusual talent often pushed them toward professional careers, sometimes making great sacrifices to make this possible. [[Artur Schnabel]]'s book ''My Life and Music''&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted 1988; Mineola, NY: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; vividly depicts his own experience along these lines, which took place in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in the late 19th century.

==Decline==
[[Image:SteinwayWelte1919.jpg|thumb|right|[[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] [[Welte-Mignon]] reproducing piano (1919)]]
The piano's status in the home remained secure until technology made possible the enjoyment of music in passive form. First the [[player piano]] (c. 1900), then the home [[phonograph]] (which became common in the decade before [[World War I]]), then the [[radio]] (in the 1920s) dealt severe blows to amateur piano-playing as a form of domestic recreation. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, piano sales dropped sharply, and many manufacturers went out of business. 
[[Image:Philco cathedral radio.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Philco]] 90 "cathedral" style radio, 1931]]

Another blow to the piano was the widespread acceptance in the late 20th century of the [[electronic keyboard]]. This instrument, in its cheaper forms, is widely considered to provide only a poor substitute for the tonal quality of a good piano (see [[piano]] for why), but it is more easily portable, cheaper, much more flexible and in many ways better suited to the performance of [[popular music]].

Nevertheless, the piano survives to this day in many 21st-century homes. The pianos being bought today tend to be of higher quality and more expensive than those of several decades ago, suggesting perhaps that domestic piano playing may have concentrated itself in homes of wealthier or better-educated members of the middle class. It is unlikely that ability to play the piano contributes much these days to the marriageability of daughters, but many parents still feel today that piano lessons teach their children concentration and self-discipline, and open a door into the world of [[classical music]].

[[Image:SockMonkeyVol1No1.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''Sock Monkey'' comic book, Volume 1, Number 1]]
'''''Sock Monkey''''' is a series of [[Comic book|comics]] and illustrated books written and drawn by the [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] [[Tony Millionaire]].

==Description==
''Sock Monkey'' relates the adventures of the titular [[sock monkey]], named Uncle Gabby, and a [[plush]] [[crow]] named Mr. Crow. Despite being toys, they are able to move, think, talk, and eat, as are most of the other toys in the series. The books are notable for their intricate artwork, dark humor, and quaint, vaulted dialogue. The inspiration for books' detailed settings come from Millionaire's childhood memories of his grandparents' [[Victorian house]]. In contrast to the scabrous humor of his weekly [[comic strip]] ''[[Maakies]]'', Millionaire has said that "''Sock Monkey'' is me trying to rise above all that bullshit, to be more poetic, looking at the bright side, remembering the things that used to delight me as a child." At the same time, "the main theme to all the ''Sock Monkey'' books is the crashing of innocent fantasy into bone-crushing reality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maakies.com/reviews/three.html Flak Magazine Interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105055205/http://www.maakies.com/reviews/three.html |date=November 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Four volumes of [[black-and-white]] ''Sock Monkey'' comics have been published; each volume consists of two issues. Volume 3 won the 2001 [[Eisner Award]] for Best Humor Publication.  Volume 4 featured one issue drawn in [[charcoal]], as opposed to the ink of the other issues, and another issue in which the character designs were changed dramatically. These comics have also been collected in two [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]], each containing two volumes: ''The Adventures of Tony Millionaire's Sock Monkey'' (2000) and ''The Collected Works of Tony Millionaire's Sock Monkey'' (2004). As of late 2006 a four-issue ''Sock Monkey'' [[miniseries]] featuring an extended story titled "The Inches Incident" is being released one issue at a time.
    
In addition to the ''Sock Monkey'' comics, Millionaire has also produced five other ''Sock Monkey'' books. ''Sock Monkey: A Children's Book'' (2001) and ''Sock Monkey: The Glass Doorknob'' (2002) mix comics with illustrated prose. ''Sock Monkey: Uncle Gabby'' (2004), ''That Darn Yarn'' (2005), and ''Little and Large'' (2005) are full-color, hardcover comic books. ''That Darn Yarn'' and ''Little and Large'' are both 36 pages and read much more like children's storybooks than Millionaire's other ''Sock Monkey'' comics. 

The 8 issues ("Heaven", "Borneo", "Dollhouse", "The Trumbernick", "The Hunters", "A Baby Bird", "The Oceanic Society", and "Heartbreak"), "The Inches Incident", ''Sock Monkey: The Glass Doorknob'', and ''Sock Monkey: Uncle Gabby'' have been published together by Fantagraphics Books, Inc. in a volume known as ''Sock Monkey Treasury'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/sock-monkey-treasury-a-tony-millionaire-s-sock-monkey-collection-5.html?vmcchk=1 Fantagraphics Books | Comics and Graphic Novels - Sock Monkey Treasury: A "Tony Millionaire's Sock Monkey" Collection &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205200821/http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/sock-monkey-treasury-a-tony-millionaire-s-sock-monkey-collection-5.html?vmcchk=1 |date=2014-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Millionaire also published an 80-page illustrated story with co-author Matt Danner under Fantagraphics Books, Inc. called ''Sock Monkey Into The Deep Woods'' (2014). This book re-tells the story of Uncle Gabby's origins (previously seen in ''Sock Monkey: A Children's Book''), along with an adventure shared by Uncle Gabby, Mr. Crow, and Inches.
''Sock Monkey: A Children's Book'' and ''Sock Monkey Into The Deep Woods'' are both illustrated literature, as opposed to Millionaire's usual comics. While ''Sock Monkey: A Children's Book'' alternates between a page of text and illustration, ''Sock Monkey Into The Deep Woods'' has small illustrations interspersed throughout the prose.

All the ''Sock Monkey'' books are published by [[Dark Horse Comics]]. Dark Horse also sells a variety of ''Sock Monkey'' merchandise including [[stationery]], [[t-shirt]]s and [[figurine]]s.

==Audience==
Though the titles, format, and general ambience of the ''Sock Monkey'' books are strongly reminiscent of classic [[children's literature]] and [[picture books]], Millionaire has emphasized that "some of the ''Sock Monkey'' books I do are for kids, and some are definitely not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/51073/Ten_Minutes_with_Tony_Millionaire_pg3.html |title=G4 – Feature – Ten Minutes with Tony Millionaire |publisher=G4tv.com |date=2005-02-16 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes them as being "based on kids' books. They're for adults who remember and love great old kids' books."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/general/features/give-me-a-tall-ship-and-a-monkey-to-steer-her-by/130/ LA Weekly – News – Give Me a Tall Ship and a Monkey to Steer Her By – Bill Smith – The Essential Online Resource for Los Angeles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517212750/http://www.laweekly.com/general/features/give-me-a-tall-ship-and-a-monkey-to-steer-her-by/130/ |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurring characters==
'''Uncle Gabby''': A sock monkey with a hat and a penchant for [[poetry]].  He is curious and eager to help others. Together with his friend Mr. Crow he cooks up various schemes, such as going on a [[salamander]] hunt or match-making for a widowed [[mouse]], which tend to lead to unforeseen calamity. He is loosely connected to the character of the same name in ''Maakies''.

'''Mr. Crow''':  A plush crow with buttons for eyes.  He has a fondness for [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and is generally more brash and excitable than Uncle Gabby.  Unaware that he is not a real bird, he occasionally attempts (and fails) to fly, and does not understand why other crows are not friendly toward him.  Though ostensibly an alternate version of Drinky Crow from ''Maakies'', in the ''Sock Monkey'' stories he is referred to as "Mr. Crow" or simply "Crow," never "Drinky."

'''Ann-Louise''':  The young girl whose home is the starting point of most of the stories (although the house itself is drawn differently each time).  She owns Uncle Gabby, whom she treats very dearly, as well as most of the other toys. It is unclear whether or not she owns Mr. Crow; in the first issue he is depicted as living in the house next door, but in others he seems to live with Ann-Louise.

'''Inches''': A small [[doll]] with an egotistic, inconsiderate, and bellicose personality.

==Adaptation==
In 2014, Millionaire and animator [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0200402/ Matt Danner] created an proof-of-concept short to promote an upcoming live-action/animated feature. The film, to be written and directed by Danner, would be based on the storybook ''Sock Monkey Into the Deep Woods.'' As of April 2017, they are currently shopping around Hollywood to find investors that are interested in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/tony-millionaires-sock-monkey-in-development-as-animated-feature-105537.html|title=Tony Millionaire’s ‘Sock Monkey’ in Development as Animated Feature|publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]]|author=Amid Amidi|date=November 13, 2014|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An archaic historical rendering of the native ''{{lang|squ|Sḵwx̱wú7mesh}}'' is ''Sko-ko-mish'' but this should not be confused with the name of the [[Skokomish people]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. Squamish is most closely related to the [[Sechelt language|Sechelt]], [[Halkomelem]], and [[Nooksack language|Nooksack]] languages.

== Documentation ==
{{Sḵwxwú7meshSideBar}}
Anthropologists and linguists who have worked on the Squamish language go back to the 1880s. The first collection of words was collected by German anthropologist [[Franz Boas]]. During the following decade,  anthropologist [[Charles Hill-Tout]] collected some Squamish words, sentences and stories. In the 1930s, anthropologist [[Homer Barnett]] worked with [[Jimmy Frank]] to collect information about traditional [[Squamish culture]], including some Squamish words. In the 1950s, Dutch linguist [[Aert H. Kuipers]] worked on the first comprehensive grammar of the Squamish language, later published as ''The Squamish Language'' (1967). In 1968, the British Columbia Language Project undertook more documentation of the Squamish language and culture. Randy Bouchard and Dorothy Kennedy, the main collaborators on this project, devised the writing system presently used for Squamish. The Squamish-English bilingual dictionary (edited by Peter Jacobs and Damara Jacobs) was published by the University of Washington Press in 2011.

== Use and language revitalization efforts ==
[[Image:Bilingual road sign in squamish language 2.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Bilingual road sign in Squamish and English languages. Seen on Highway 99.]]
In 1990, the Chief and Council of the Squamish people declared Squamish to be the official language of their people, a declaration made to ensure funding for the language and its revitalization.&lt;ref name="revitalization"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/18352/ubc_2006-0709.pdf?sequence=1 | title=Squamish Language Revitalization: From the Hearts and the Minds of the Language Speakers | publisher=University of British Columbia | date=August 2006 | accessdate=March 12, 2012 | author=Baker-Williams, Kirsten | page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, the First Peoples’ Heritage, Language and Culture Council considered the language to be "critically endangered" and "nearly extinct", with just ten fluent speakers.&lt;ref name="fphlccreport2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fphlcc.ca/downloads/2010-report-on-the-status-of-bc-first-nations-languages.pdf | title=Report on the Status of B.C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Squamish–English dictionary was also completed in 2011.

A Squamish festival was scheduled for April 22, 2013, with two fluent elders, aiming to inspire more efforts to keep the language alive. Rebecca Campbell, one of the event's organizers, commented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The festival is part of a multi-faceted effort to ensure the language's long-term survival, not only by teaching it in the schools, but by encouraging parents to speak it at home. Squamish Nation cultural workers, for example, have begun to provide both parents and children with a list of common Squamish phrases that can be used around the home, as a way to reinforce the learning that takes place in the [[School District 48 Sea to Sky|Sea to Sky School District]] schools. So far 15 families in the Squamish area are part of the program ... 'The goal is to revive the language by trying to have it used every day at home — getting the parents on board, not just the children.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Additionally, Simon Fraser University has launched the Squamish Language Academy, in which students learn the Squamish language for two years. The aforementioned programs increase the number of active language learners each year.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
The vowel system in Squamish phonemicly features four sounds, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, as well as a schwa sound {{IPA|/ə/}}, each with phonetic variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Squamish language: Grammar, Texts, Dictionary|last=Kuipers|first=Aert H.|publisher=Mouton &amp; Co., The Hague|year=1967|isbn=|location=Netherlands|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a fair amount of overlap between the vowel spaces, with stress nd adjacency relationships as main contributors. The [[vowel]] [[phoneme]]s of Squamish are listed below in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] with the orthography following it.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==== Vowel Variants&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;====
/i/ has four main phonetic variants [e, ɛ, ɛy, i], which surface depending on adjacency relationships to consonants, or stress.

* [ɛ] surfaces preceding uvulars consonants, and can exist in a non-adjacent relationship so long as no other vowels intervene. [ɛy] surfaces proceeding a uvular consonant, before an non-uvelar consonant.
* [e] sufaces in non-uvular environments when /i/ is in stressed syllables. 

/a/ has four main phonetic variants  [ɛ, æ, ɔ, ɑ].

* [ɛ, æ] surfaces when palatals are present (with the exception of /y/)
* [ɔ] surfaces when labial/labialized consonants are present (with the exception of /w/. 
* [a] surfaces when not in the prior conditions. Stress usually does not change the vowel.

/u/ 

* [o] surfaces in stressed syllables.

===Modifiers===

Other symbols include the glottal stop and stress marks.

{{IPA|/ʔ/}} or ''{{lang|squ|7}}'' represent a [glottal stop]. Glottalization can occur on a variety of consonants (e.g: m/n/l/y/w), and after or before vowels. 

== Orthography ==
The following table shows the vowels and consonants and their respective [[Orthography|orthographic]] symbols. Vowels marked with an asterisk indicate phonological variation. Consonants are sorted by place (bilabial to uvular descending) and voicing (Left - Voiceless, Right - Voiced). Note that, Squamish contains no voiced plosives, as is typical of Salish language family languages. Because the {{IPA|/ʔ/}} character glyph is not found on typewriters and did not exist in most fonts until the widespread adoption of [[Unicode]], the Squamish orthography still conventionally represents the glottal stop with the number symbol ''{{lang|squ|7}}''; the same character glyph is also used as a digit to represent the number seven.

The other special character is a stress mark, or accent (á, é, í or ú). This indicates that the vowel should be realized as louder and slightly longer.&lt;ref name="howtoread" /&gt;

== Grammar ==
Squamish, like other Salish languages, has two main types of words: [[Clitic|Clitics]] and full words. Clitics can be articles, or [[Predicate (grammar)|predicative clitics.]] Squamish words are able to be subjected to reduplication, suffixation, prefixation. A common prefix is the nominalizer prefix /s-/, which occurs in a large number of fixed combinations with verb stems to make nouns (e.g: /t'iq/ "to be cold" -&gt; /s-t'iq/ "(the) cold"). 

==== Reduplication ====
{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}
Squamish uses a variety of reduplication types, serving to express functions such as pluralization, diminutive form, aspect, etc.

=== Syntax ===
Squamish sentences follow a [[Verb–subject–object|Verb-Subject-Object]] form (the action precedes the initiator and the initiator of an action precedes the goal). Sentences typically begin with a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] noun, but may also begin with a [[Transitive verb|transitive]], [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]], or [[Passive voice|passive verb]]. 

The table below summarizes the general order of elements in Squamish. Referents are nominal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1281">'''Strié''' is a popular form of [[faux painting]] using [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] and paint brushes to create a soft natural striped texture.  [[File:sch ewf 10.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of the strie faux painting technique over raised stencil]]

Strié is a negative glaze technique. The glaze is generally rolled over the entire surface, and then removed with a tool such as a brush.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Schmidt, ''Building &amp; Finishing Walls &amp; Ceilings'', Creative Publishing International, 2002, p86. {{ISBN|1-58923-042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''strié'' can be used to describe this process of painting, or to describe the actual finish created.

Strié is a simple technique that can be altered and elaborated in many ways.  It can be done on its own, with the streaks directed either vertically or horizontally.  It can be brushed over a raised [[plaster]] stencil.  It is also very popular to overlap a horizontal and vertical strié, creating the look of fabrics such as linen or denim.  This is often referred to as a linen weave or burlap strié.

'''''The Squire of Low Degree''''', also known as '''''The Squyr of Lowe Degre''''', '''''The Sqyr of Lowe Degre''''' or '''''The Sqyr of Lowe Degree''''', is an anonymous late [[Middle English]] or [[early Modern English]] verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]].  There is little doubt that it was intended to be enjoyed by the masses rather than the wealthy or aristocratic sections of society,&lt;ref&gt;Erik Kooper (ed.) ''Sentimental and Humorous Romances: Floris and Blancheflour, Sir Degrevant, the Squire of Low Degree, the Tournament of Tottenham, and the Feast of Tottenham'' (Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publications, 2006) p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and, perhaps in consequence of this, it was one of the better-known of the English romances during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, and again in the 19th century.  There are three texts of the poem: it was printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]] c. 1520 under the title ''Undo Youre Dore'', though only fragments totalling 180 lines survive of this book; around 1555 or 1560 another edition in 1132 lines was produced by William Copland; and a much shorter version, thought to have been orally transmitted, was copied into [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Bishop Percy]]'s [[Percy Folio|Folio Manuscript]] around the middle of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Loomis ''Medieval Romance in England'' (New York: Burt Franklin, 1969) pp. 263, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise date of the poem is unknown, estimates varying from 1440 to 1520,&lt;ref&gt;William Edward Mead (ed.) ''The Squyr of Lowe Degre: A Middle English Metrical Romance'' (Boston: Ginn, 1904) p. lxxvi; [[Derek Pearsall]] "English Romance in the Fifteenth Century", ''Essays and Studies'' New Series, vol. 29 (1976) p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Henry Bradley]]'s date of c. 1475 has been quite widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Henry Stratmann (rev. [[Henry Bradley]]) ''A Middle-English Dictionary'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1891) p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Standing as it does at the very end of the English Middle Ages it has been called "a swan song of the romance".&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Sands (ed.) ''Middle English Verse Romances'' (Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 1986) p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a squyer of lowe degré&lt;br/&gt;That loved the kings doughter of [[Hungary|Hungré]].&lt;ref&gt;Line 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After seven years of undeclared love the squire opens his heart to the princess.  She replies that she loves him, but that as a mere squire he will have to prove himself by fighting his way to [[Jerusalem]] and laying his sword on the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]].  Only this, she believes, will be enough to convince her father that they should marry.  Their conversation is overheard by the king's steward, who steals off to the king to report it, and adds the malicious lie that the squire has made an attempt on the princess's virtue.  The king has a good opinion of the squire and is reluctant to believe this, but tells the steward to watch the princess's room closely to see whether the squire will visit her.  The squire now goes to the king to ask his leave to go abroad adventuring.  On being given this permission the squire sets out, but turns aside from his way to visit the princess's chamber and make his farewells.  There, finding the steward and a numerous body of men-at-arms lying in wait for him, he asks the princess to let him in.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Anone he sayde: "Your dore undo!&lt;br/&gt;Undo," he sayde, "nowe, fayre lady!&lt;br/&gt;I am beset with many a spy.&lt;br/&gt;Lady as whyte as whales bone,&lt;br/&gt;There are thyrty agaynst me one." &lt;ref&gt;Line 534.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But she, as a virtuous unmarried lady, turns him from her door and tells him to win her in marriage.  Now the steward and his men approach the chamber to take the squire prisoner.  Though he resists to such good effect that the steward is killed, the squire is finally taken prisoner by the steward's men.  These men mutilate the dead steward's face, dress him in the squire's clothes, and leave him at the princess's door hoping she will mistake him for the squire.  The princess is taken in by this trick, embalms the body of the dead steward and keeps it in a tomb by her bed.  Meanwhile the squire is taken to the king, who imprisons him.  Finally, finding that his daughter is inconsolable, the king releases the squire and allows him to go abroad.

Having done all this he returns to Hungary.  Here the princess, still lamenting her supposedly dead lover, has decided to retire from the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt; And, squyer, for the love of thee,&lt;br/&gt;[[wikt:fie|Fy]] on this worldes vanyté!&lt;br/&gt;Farewell golde pure and fyne;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell velvet and satyne;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell castelles and maners also;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell huntynge and hawkynge to;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell revell, myrthe, and play;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell pleasure and garmentes gay;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell perle and precyous stone;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell my juielles everychone;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell mantell and [[Scarlet (cloth)|scarlet]] [[Red|reed]];&lt;br/&gt;Farewell crowne unto my heed;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell hawkes, and farewell hounde;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell [[Mark (money)|markes]] and many a pounde;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell huntynge at the hare;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell harte and hynde for evermare.&lt;br/&gt;Nowe wyll I take the mantell and the rynge,&lt;br/&gt;And become an [[Anchorite|ancresse]] in my lyvynge.&lt;br/&gt;And yet I am a mayden for thee.&lt;ref&gt;Line 939.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Her father now belatedly tells her that she has been mourning the steward, and that the squire has returned from Jerusalem.  He gives the lovers his blessing, and they marry.

== Reception ==

There are many references to the poem in the works of [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Beaumont and Fletcher]], and other Elizabethan writers – [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], for example, alludes to the poem when, in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', Act V, sc. i, [[Fluellen]] says "You called me yesterday mountain-squire, but I will make you to-day a squire of low degree" – but as the 17th century advanced the poem fell into neglect.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Loomis ''Medieval Romance in England'' (New York: Burt Franklin, 1969) p. 263; Stephen Guy-Bray ''Loving in Verse'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2006) pp. 50-57; H. R. D. Andes ''Shakespeare's Books'' (Whitefish, Montana: Kessinger, 2003) p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th century [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]] acquired the famous [[Percy Folio|Folio Manuscript]], with its version of ''The Squire of Low Degree'', and came to the mistaken conclusion that the poem was one of the romances satirised by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] in his "[[Chaucer's Tale of Sir Topas|Tale of Sir Thopas]]", and must therefore have been written in the 14th century.  He communicated these opinions together with an extract from ''The Squire of Low Degree'' to his friend [[Thomas Warton]], who included them in the 1762 edition of his ''Observations on the Fairy Queen of Spenser''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Warton]] ''Observations on the Fairy Queen of Spencer'' (London: R. and J. Dodsley, 1762) vol. 1, pp. 139-141; Arthur Johnston ''Enchanted Ground: The Study of Medieval Romance in the Eighteenth Century'' (London: Athlone Press, 1964) pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Percy planned to edit ''The Squire'' as part of a proposed collection of ''Ancient English and Scottish Poems'', but this plan fell through, and it was left to the medievalist [[Joseph Ritson]] to make the Copland text available to general readers in 1802 in his ''[[Ancient Engleish Metrical Romanceës]]'' [sic].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Johnston ''Enchanted Ground: The Study of Medieval Romance in the Eighteenth Century'' (London: Athlone Press, 1964) pp. 93, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Scott]] refers to the poem in several of his novels, and it particularly influences his ''[[Quentin Durward]]'' and ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'', in each of which the hero finds himself in a situation so parallel to that of the squire that he cannot help identifying with him.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Mitchell ''Scott, Chaucer, and Medieval Romance: A Study in Sir Walter Scott's Indebtedness to the Literature of the Middle Ages'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1987) pp. 160-162, 169, 178, 195, 215, 227&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Love Peacock]] and [[George Eliot]] both used quotations from ''The Squire'' as epigraphs – to chapter 3 of ''[[Crotchet Castle]]'' and chapter 62 of ''[[Middlemarch]]'' respectively.  The bibliographer [[William Carew Hazlitt]] produced another edition of the Copland text in his ''Remains of the Early Popular Poetry of England'' (1864–1866), and shortly afterwards the Folio MS text was published for the first time by John W. Hales and [[Frederick James Furnivall|Frederick J. Furnivall]] in their edition of ''Bishop Percy's Folio Manuscript'' (1867–1868).  [[James Russell Lowell]] wrote that the romance "Has passages that are unsurpassed in simple beauty by anything in our earlier poetry." &lt;ref&gt;[[James Russell Lowell]] ''Literary Essays'' (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1892) vol. 1, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; William Edward Mead, in his standard edition of the romance, published in 1904, expressed an opinion closer to that of most modern critics when he said that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;We can praise ''The Squyr of Lowe Degre'' only with considerable reservations, and do not seek a place for it among the great creative poems of the world.  But it is interesting, at times charming, and it more than holds its own among poems of its class.&lt;ref&gt;William Edward Mead (ed.) ''The Squyr of Lowe Degre: A Middle English Metrical Romance'' (Boston: Ginn, 1904) p. lxxxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Virtus''''' was a specific [[virtue]] in [[Ancient Rome]].  It carries connotations of valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, perceived as masculine strengths (from [[Latin]] ''vir'', "man"). It was thus a frequently stated virtue of [[Roman emperors]], and was personified as a deity—[[Virtus (god)|Virtus]].

== Origins ==

The origins of the word ''virtus'' can be traced back to the Latin word ''vir'', "man".  The common list of attributes associated with ''virtus'' are typically perceived masculine strengths, which may indicate its derivation from ''vir''. From the early to the later days of the Roman Empire, there appears to have been a development in how the concept was understood. 

Originally ''virtus'' was used to describe specifically martial courage, but it eventually grew to be used to describe a range of Roman virtues. It was often divided into different qualities including ''prudentia'' ([[prudence]]), ''iustitia'' ([[justice (virtue)|justice]]), ''[[temperantia]]'' ([[temperance (virtue)|temperance]], self-control), and ''fortitudo'' ([[courage]]). This division of virtue as a whole into [[cardinal virtues]] is today classified as [[virtue ethics]], as described by [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'' and [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. It implies a link between ''virtus'' and the Greek concept of ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]''.

This inclusion leads to the belief that at one time ''virtus'' extended to cover a wide range of meanings that covered one general ethical ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the word began to grow and shift to fit the new idea of what manliness meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
No longer did ''virtus'' mean that a person was a brave warrior but it could also mean that he was a good man, someone who did the right thing.  During the time of the decline of the Roman elite ''virtus'' the Roman upper class no longer thought of themselves as unmanly if they did not serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtue as described by Aristotle was rediscovered in the medieval age by [[Muslim]] philosopher [[Averroes]], which in turn influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] to fuse virtue and ethics with Christianity in connection with the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].

== In Roman political philosophy ==

''Virtus'' comes from the aristocratic tradition in which it is a specific type of public conduct. It is really only applicable in the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', certainly by the late republic at least. It is not a "private" virtue in the way that modern people might consider it. Valor, courage, and manliness are not things that can be pursued in the private sphere of the individual or the individual's private concerns. There could be no virtue in exploiting one's manliness in the pursuit of personal wealth, for example. ''Virtus'' is exercised in the pursuit of ''gloria'' for the benefit of the ''[[res publica]]'' resulting in the winning of eternal "memoria". According to D.C. Earl "Outside the service of the ''res publica'' there can be no ''magistratus'' and therefore, strictly speaking, no ''gloria'', no ''nobilitas'', no ''virtus''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1966|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the nobility ''virtus'' lies not only in one's personal "acta" but also that of one's ancestors. However Cicero, a ''[[novus homo]]'', asserted that ''virtus'' was a virtue particularly suited to the new man just as nobilitas was suited to the noble.  Cicero argued that just as young men from noble families won the favor of the people so too should the novus homo earn the favor of the people with his ''virtus''. He even extended the argument that ''virtus'' and not one’s family history should decide a man’s worthiness. ''Virtus'' is something that a man earns himself, not something that is given to him by his family, thus it is a better measure of a man’s ability.  Cicero's goal was not to impugn the noble class but widen it to include men who had earned their positions by merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1966|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used quite significantly by the historian [[Sallust]], a contemporary of Cicero. Sallust asserted that it did not rightfully belong to the ''nobilitas'' as a result of their family background but specifically to the ''[[novus homo]]'' through the exercise of ''ingenium'' (talent). For Sallust and Cicero alike, ''virtus'' is situated in the winning of glory by the execution of illustrious deeds (''egregia facinora'') and the observance of right conduct through ''bonae artes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Who could have it ==

''Virtus'' was not universally applicable to just anyone – generally (although not always exclusively) only adult male Roman citizens would be thought of as possessing ''virtus''.

=== Women ===
''Virtus''  was rarely attributed to women, likely because of its association with ''vir''.  The highest regarded female virtue was ''pudicitia'': "modesty" or "chastity".  [[Cicero]], however, attributes this characteristic to females several times. He uses it once to describe Caecilia Metella when she helps a man who is being chased by assassins.{{refn|group=Note|There were several women called [[Caecilia Metella]]. Freese identifies her as the daughter of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=255 |author=Cicero |title=Pro Quinctio. Pro Roscio Amerino. Pro Roscio Comoedo. On the Agrarian Law. |others=Translated by J. H. Freese. Loeb Classical Library 240. |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balearicus had two daughters of that name. [[Caecilia Metella Balearica (priestess)|The elder]] was a [[Vestal Virgin]] and a priestess of [[Juno Sospita]]. [[Caecilia Metella Balearica|The younger]] was the wife of [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 79 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]]. Kaplan says that the Caecilia Metella who sheltered Roscius was "very probably [...] also a priestess of Juno Sospita".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sulla's 'Watergate' |first=Arthur |last=Kaplan |journal=The Classical Outlook |year=1976 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyck identifies her as the wife of Pulcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cicero: 'Pro Sexto Roscio' |author=Cicero |editor-first=Andrew R. |editor-last=Dyck |page=96 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=7 June 2010 |isbn=978-0521882248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brill's New Pauly]] says that she was the wife of Pulcher, but has no entry for her elder sister. The identification is in doubt, and is likely to remain so.}} Twice more he uses it when describing his daughter, [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]], portraying her in his letters as brave in his absence.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero: ''Fam'' 14.11 and ''Att.'' 10.8&lt;/ref&gt;  He uses it again to describe his first wife [[Terentia]] during his exile.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero: ''Fam'' 14.1&lt;/ref&gt;
Livy in Book 2 attributes it to Cloelia.

=== Children ===
''Virtus'' was not a term commonly used to describe children.  Since ''virtus'' was primarily attributed to a full grown man who had served in the military, children were not particularly suited to obtain this particular virtue.

=== Slaves ===
While a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] was able to be ''homo'' ("man") he was not considered a ''vir''. Slaves were often referred to as ''puer'' (Latin for ''boy'') to denote that they were not citizens.&lt;ref name="Myles McDonnell p.160"&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since a slave could not be a ''vir'' it follows that they would not be allowed to have the quality of ''virtus''. Once a slave was manumitted he was able to become a ''vir'' and he was also classified as a freedman but this did not allow him to have ''virtus''.  A good slave or freedman was said to have ''fides'', but no ''virtus''.&lt;ref name="Myles McDonnell p.160"/&gt;

=== Foreigners ===
[[Peregrinus (Roman)|Foreigners]] in the Roman world could be attributed with ''virtus'':  If they fought bravely they could be said to have ''virtus''.  ''Virtus'' could also be lost in battle.  ''Virtus'' could even be a cause to gain citizenship as in the case of Spanish cavalry men granted citizenship by Cn. Pompeius Strabo in 89 BC for their ''virtus'' in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How was it used ==
''Virtus'' applies exclusively to a man's behaviour in the public sphere, i.e. to the application of duty to the ''[[res publica]]'' in the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. His private business was no place to earn ''virtus'', even when it involved courage or feats of arms or other qualities associated to it if performed for the public good.

=== In private ===
While in many cultures around the world it is considered "manly" to father and provide for a family, family life was considered in the Roman world to be part of the private sphere.  During this time there was no place for ''virtus'' in the private sphere.  Most uses of ''virtus'' to describe any part of private life are ambiguous and often refer to another similar quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|pp=168–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman world the oldest living patriarch of the family was called the ''[[pater familias]]'' and this title implied that he was able to make all legal and binding decisions for the family; he also owned all the money, land, and other property.  His wife, daughters, sons, and his sons’ families were all under his ''[[potestas]]''.  The only time a son was seen as separate from his father's control in the eyes of other Romans was when he assumed his public identity as a citizen. He could earn his ''virtus'' by serving in the military, and thus could only demonstrate manliness outside of the family setting. This is another reason that ''virtus'' is not often used to describe the Roman private life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In public ===
''Virtus'' was a crucial component for a political career. Its broad definition led to it being used to describe a number of qualities that the Roman people idealized in their leaders.

In everyday life a typical Roman, especially a young boy, would have been inculcated with the idea of ''virtus''.  Since military service was a part of most Roman men's life, military training would have started fairly early. Young boys would have learned how to wield weapons and military tactics starting at home with their fathers and older male relatives and later in school.  Also as a young boy one would have heard numerous stories about past heroes, battles, and wars.  Some of these stories would have surely told of the ''virtus'' of past heroes, and even family members.  Publicly it was easy to see the rewards of ''virtus''.  Public triumphs were held for victorious generals and rewards were given to brave fighters.  All of this propaganda would have encouraged young boys coming into their manhood to be brave fighters and earn the attribute of ''virtus''.  It was the duty of every generation of men to maintain the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' which his family had already earned and enlarge it.  This pressure to live up to the standards of one’s ancestors was great.  In achieving ''virtus'' one could achieve ''[[Glory (religion)|gloria]]''.  By gaining ''virtus'' and ''gloria'' one could hope to aspire to high political office and great renown.

While young boys were encouraged to earn ''virtus'' there were also limits put on showing ''virtus'' in public.{{or|date=July 2012}} ''Virtus'' was often associated with being aggressive{{cn|date=July 2012}} and this could be very dangerous in the public sphere and the political world.  Displays of violent ''virtus'' were controlled through several methods.  Men seeking to hold political office typically had to follow the ''[[cursus honorum]]''.  Many political offices had an age minimum which ensured that the men filling the positions had the proper amount of experience in the military and in government.  This meant that even if a man proved himself capable of filling a position or was able to persuade people that he was capable, he would not necessarily be able to hold the position until he had reached a certain age. This also served to ensure that in elections of public offices no one had a certain advantage over another person because by the time most men went into public office they would have retired from military service. Furthermore, before any Roman soldier could partake in single combat he had to gain permission from his general. This procedure was meant to keep soldiers from putting themselves in extremely dangerous situations that they may or may not have been able to handle in order gain ''virtus''.

The concept of ''virtus'' also tended to be a concept of morality as far as politics were concerned.  This could range from the very literal definition of manliness seen in aggression and the ruthless acquisition of money, land, and power, or the lighter, more idealistic political meaning which almost took on the extended meaning of "pietas", a man who was morally upright and concerned with the matters of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1967|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plautus in ''[[Amphitruo]]'' contrasted ''virtus'' and ''ambitio''.  Virtus is seen as a positive attribute, though ''ambitio'' itself is not necessarily a negative attribute but is often associated with negative methods such as bribery.  [[Plautus]] said that just as great generals and armies win victory by ''virtus'', so should political candidates.  ''Ambitio'' “is the wrong method of reaching a good end.”  Part of ''virtus'', in the political sphere was to deal justly in every aspect of one’s life, especially in political and state matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1967|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Military ====

Although the two concepts are related, ''virtus'', for the Roman, did not necessarily emphasize the behavior that the associations of the present-day English term 'virtue' suggest. ''Virtus'' was to be found in the context of 'outstanding deeds' (''egregia facinora''), and brave deeds were the accomplishments which brought ''gloria'' ('a reputation'). This ''gloria'' was attached to two ideas: ''fama'' ('what people think of you') and ''dignitas'' ('one's standing in the community'). The struggle for ''virtus'' in Rome was above all a struggle for public office (''honos''), since it was through aspiring to high office, to which one was elected by the People, that a man could best show his manliness by means of military achievement which would in turn cultivate a reputation and votes. It was the duty of every aristocrat and would-be aristocrat to maintain the ''dignitas'' which his family had already achieved and to extend it to the greatest possible degree, through higher political office and military victories. This system resulted in a strong built-in impetus in Roman society to engage in military expansion and conquest at all times.

=== Sexuality ===
While in many cultures the virtue of manliness is also seen as being partly sexual, in the Roman world ''virtus'' apparently did not have sexual connotations.  Similar words deriving from the same stem often have sexual connotations.  In the Roman world ''virtus'' dealt with a great many areas such as martial courage, honor, and being morally upright rather than sexual manliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|pp=165–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

One of the most well known demonstrations of ''virtus'' was shown by [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]].  Before Cincinnatus was appointed dictator in 458 BC, Rome was in the midst of a battle with the [[Aequi]] and needed someone to take control. Messengers sent to fetch him found him plowing in his field.  Upon being informed of the appointment, he wept saying, "So my field will be unsown this year, and we shall be in danger of not having enough food to support us."&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius: ''Roman Antiquities'' 10.17.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, he dutifully gathered his things, kissed his wife goodbye and departed to raise an army and defeat the Aequi in a mere fifteen days. Upon returning home after the victory, Cincinnatus picked up the plough from where he left it and began plowing again.  [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] recounts this story to illustrate the type of leaders the men of Rome were. He says that they “worked with their hands, led self-disciplined lives, did not complain about honorable poverty, and far from pursuing positions of royal power.”&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius: ''Roman Antiquities'' 10.17.6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pompey]] is another prominent example of ''virtus''.  In 55 BC, Pompey inaugurated his grand theatre complex and dedicated several shrines to different gods, one of these being ''Virtus''.  This consecrated Pompey’s link with ''virtus''.  He gained a reputation with the public as being a man of ''virtus''.  Cicero, throughout his speech, the ''De imperio Cn. Pompei'', connects Pompey with ''"divina virtus"''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero; ''De imperio Cn. Pompei''&lt;/ref&gt;  Pompey was so closely connected with ''virtus'' that once during a production of a play at the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' one of the characters spoofed Pompey by stating ''"eandem virtutem istam veniet tempus cum graviter gemes"'': "The time will come when you bitterly resent that same ''virtus''".  The audience did not need to hear his name to know that Pompey was being referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcellus and the Temple===
[[M. Claudius Marcellus]], during the battle of [[Clastidium]] in 222 BC, dedicated a temple to [[Honos]] and Virtus.  This was one of the first times that ''Virtus'' had been recognized as divine. The connection with ''Honos'' would have been obvious to most Romans as demonstrations of ''virtus'' led to election to public office and both were considered ''honos''.  The cult of ''Honos'' was already a long-standing tradition in Rome. The marriage of the two deities ensured that ''Virtus'' would also get proper respect from the Romans. But an objection by the pontiffs was that one temple could not properly house two gods because there would be no way of knowing which god to sacrifice to should a miracle happen in the temple.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Augustus===

During the reign of [[Augustus]], the [[Senate]] voted that a golden shield be inscribed with Augustus’ attributes and displayed in the [[Curia Iulia]], including ''virtus'', ''[[clementia]]'', ''[[iustitia]]'', and ''[[pietas]]''. These political catchwords continued to be used as propaganda by later emperors.

=== In literature ===

The comic poet Plautus made use of the concept of ''virtus'' in his play ''Trinummus'' which concerned family ''virtus'', honor and public office, and obligations to the state. He also offered commentary on the concept of ''virtus'' in ''Amphitruo'' (see above "Virtus and the Public").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1967|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warung in Garut.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A village warung in [[Garut Regency|Garut]], West Java]]

A '''warung''' (old spelling '''''waroeng''''') is a type of small family-owned business &amp;mdash;  a small [[restaurant]] or [[café]] — in [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="Bali.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Warung and Streetfood|author=|date=|publisher=Bali.com |url=http://www.bali.com/warung-streetfood.html |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent, [[Malaysia]]. A ''warung'' is an essential part of daily life in Indonesia. Today, the term ''warung'' has slightly shifted — especially among foreign visitors, expatriates, and people abroad — to refer more specifically to a modest Indonesian restaurant or a place that sells things Indonesian (mostly groceries or foodstuff).&lt;ref name="JPWarung"&gt;{{cite news |title=London-based Indonesian ‘warung’ feels like home |first=Aditya |last=Suharmoko |date= 17 February 2013 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/02/17/london-based-indonesian-warung-feels-home.html |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But for the majority of Indonesians, the meaning is still a small, neighborhood convenience shop, often a front room in a family's home. 

There are establishments on the touristy island of [[Bali]] and elsewhere that attach the term ''warung'' in their business to indicate their Indonesian nature.&lt;ref name="BaliTimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Warung Bumbu Mertua, Offers Delicious Javanese Cuisine to Tourists |author=|date=2 December 2013 |newspaper=Bali Times |url=http://www.thebalitimes.com/2013/12/02/warung-bumbu-mertua-offers-delicious-javanese-cuisine-to-tourists/ |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, ''warung'' is indeed a family-owned business, run by the family members, mostly by women.&lt;ref name="JPWarung2"&gt;{{cite news |title=In Yogyakarta 3 women run 3 very different ‘warung’ |first=Willow |last=Paule |date= 26 August 2014 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/08/26/in-yogyakarta-3-women-run-3-very-different-warung.html |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional warungs are made from wooden, bamboo or thatched materials. More permanent warungs are made from bricks and concrete, some family-owned businesses are attached to their homes. Some smaller portable warungs are made from tin, zinc or some modern version might use [[fiberglass]] mold. ''Warung tenda'' is a portable [[tent]] warung, covered with [[canvas]], [[fabric]], [[Tarpaulin|tarp]] or plastic sheet tent for roofing.

==Terminology==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Huis langs de weg waar eten verkocht wordt TMnr 3728-805.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th century image of warung during colonial period]]
The term ''warung'' simply denotes a wide category of small businesses, either a small shop or small restaurant. It is widely used in [[Java]] and most of Indonesia. In certain parts of [[Sumatra]] and [[Malay Peninsula]], the word ''kedai'' is sometimes used as well. In [[Javanese culture]] areas, such as in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Semarang]] and [[Surakarta]], its counterpart term ''angkringan'' is more commonly found.&lt;ref name="JPWarung2"/&gt; On the other hand, the term ''[[Toko (shop)|toko]]'' is used for a larger and more established shop.

The term can be used to loosely refer to many other types of shops, including the ''wartel'' (short for ''warung telepon'', essentially a manned [[phone booth]]) and ''warnet'' (short for ''warung internet'' [[Internet cafe|Internet café]]).

==Varieties==
There are many kinds of warung, some take the form of a small shop that sells cold bottled drinks, [[candy]], [[cigarettes]], snacks, ''[[krupuk]]'' and other daily necessities, while the larger ones are small restaurant establishments. A warung that sells food typically sells local food; ''[[pisang goreng]]'' and many kinds of ''[[gorengan]], [[nasi goreng]]'' (fried rice), and ''[[mie goreng]]'' (fried noodles).

In resort island of [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]], a warung might refer to a touristy [[Cabana (structure)|cabana]] cafe that sells locals' favourites as well as Asian or western food. Other than Indonesian dishes, on their menu there might be a selection of soups, steaks, fries, sandwiches or grilled fish.

Some types of warung are:
* '''Warung rokok''' or common warung is a very small street side shop, constructed from wood, bamboo or tin. Most of them measure not more than 2 x 1 meters. They sell ''rokok'' (cigarettes), cold bottled drinks, snacks and candies, [[krupuk]], soap, tooth paste and other daily necessities. This is the most commonly distributed warung, sprung in residential areas, slums, street sides, and tucked between high rise business areas.
* '''Warkop''' or '''warung kopi''' is a small humble cafe or [[Coffeehouse|coffeeshop]] that sells [[coffee]] and snacks, such as roasted peanuts, [[rempeyek]], krupuk, [[pisang goreng]] and bread. Recently in Indonesia, the Malaysian and Singaporean counterpart [[kopi tiam]], gained popularity instead of humble local warung kopi. Traditionally, ''warung kopi'' served a social function as a gathering place for men of the village to socialize and trade news. In recent years, specialty cafes were flourished spurred by the surge of the locals interest in quality coffee. As the result various cafes were growing, from humble ''warung kopi'' to fancy coffeeshop selling artisan and premium specialty coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Coffee lovers fuel surge in speciality cafes in Indonesia | author = Arlina Arshad | work = Strait Times | date = 18 March 2017 | url = http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/hot-shot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Warung nasi''' is a humble small restaurant that sells ''nasi'' ([[rice]]) with other [[Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesian dishes]]. Usually they did not provides separate tables and chairs, but a long communal bar and a long wooden [[bench (furniture)|bench]] instead.
* '''Warteg''' or '''warung tegal''' is a more specific warung nasi, established by [[Javanese people]] from the town [[Tegal (city)|Tegal]] in [[Central Java]]. They sell favourite [[Javanese cuisine|Javanese dishes]] and rice, the wide array of pre-cooked dishes are arranged in glass windowed cupboard. They are well known on selling modestly-priced meals, popular among working class such as low-skilled labours in the cities.
* '''Warung padang''' is a small scaled [[Padang food|Padang]] restaurant. Usually provides bar and bench instead of tables and chairs for seating, and sometimes, a choice of fewer dishes. Larger scale are more established Padang eateries are referred to as ''rumah makan padang'' or Padang restaurant instead.
* '''Warung jamu''' specifically selling ''[[jamu]]'' traditional herbal medicine.  
* '''Warnet''' or '''warung internet''' is an [[internet cafe]].
* '''Wartel''' or '''warung telepon''' is a manned [[phone booth]].

Most of the time, warung are named after the main dishes they sell. For example, '''warung bubur kacang ijo''' or '''warung burjo''' sells [[bubur kacang hijau]], '''warung roti bakar''' sells grilled bread, '''warung pecel lele''' sells ''[[pecel lele]]'' or fried catfish with [[sambal]], while '''warung indomie''' sells cooked [[instant noodle]]s, although the brand might not always be [[Indomie]].

'''William Dickson''' (born 1947), known as '''Billy Dickson''', is a [[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]] politician in [[Northern Ireland]].

Dickson was born in [[Greencastle, County Down|Greencastle]] and grew up off the [[Donegall Road]] in [[Belfast]],&lt;ref name="petticrew"&gt;Rebecca Petticrew, "[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/temp/through-the-grapevine-billy-dickson-29648694.html Through the Grapevine - Billy Dickson]", ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', 10 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied at Kelvin Secondary School.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;''The Times Guide to the House of Commons May 1979'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt;  He first rose to prominence in 1970, as the secretary of the Donegall Road Defence Committee, at which time he was also active in [[Ian Paisley]]'s [[Protestant Unionist Party]] (PUP).&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bruce, ''The Red Hand'', p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickson was a founder member of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), the successor to the PUP.  He was elected to [[Belfast City Council]] in [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1977|1977]], and again stood for the party in [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 UK general election]], taking third place with 11.2% of the vote.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Belfast"&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/73-81lgbelfast.htm The Local Government Elections 1973–1981: Belfast], Northern Ireland Elections&lt;/ref&gt;  He was able to hold his council seat in [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1981|1981]].&lt;ref name="Belfast" /&gt;

Dickson was selected as a candidate for [[Belfast West (Assembly constituency)|Belfast West]] at the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 1982|1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election]].  Six weeks before the election, he was shot at his home by members of the [[Irish National Liberation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Bowyer Bell, ''The Secret Army: The IRA'', p.531&lt;/ref&gt;  He survived the attack, although he was unable to take part in the remainder of the election campaign,&lt;ref&gt;"Ulster alert after school shooting", ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'', 19 October 1982, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; and narrowly failed to win election.&lt;ref name="Belfast" /&gt;

Although Dickson was re-elected at the [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1985|1985 local election]], and served as Deputy [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]] in 1986, he then left the DUP and stood as an [[independent Unionist]] in [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1989|1989 local election]], losing his seat.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/85-89lgbelfast.htm Local Government Elections 1985 - 1989: Belfast]", Northern Ireland Elections&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently joined the [[Conservatives in Northern Ireland]], but again missed election when he stood for them in [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1993|1993]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/lgbelfast.htm Belfast City Council Elections 1993-2011]", Northern Ireland Elections&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside politics, Dickson long worked at the [[Ulster Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;Bill Rolston, ''Politics and Painting'', p.52&lt;/ref&gt; but later became a tour guide, specialising in the history of Belfast and the [[Ulster Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nitga.co.uk/item/william-dickson/ William Dickson]", Northern Ireland Tourist Guide Association&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as a [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] Reservist, and from 2007 had a weekly column in the ''South Belfast Community Telegraph''.&lt;ref name="petticrew" /&gt;

Dickson later joined [[Traditional Unionist Voice]], and at the [[Northern Ireland local elections, 2014]], he stood unsuccessfully for the party in [[Botanic (District Electoral Area)|Botanic]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/23_05_14_botanic.pdf Botanic]", ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently left the party, and in 2016 formed his own organisation, South Belfast Unionists, for which he stood in [[Belfast South (Assembly constituency)|Belfast South]] at the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2016]],&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Black, "[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland-assembly-election/billy-dicksons-new-party-south-belfast-unionists-joins-the-fray-34622378.html Billy Dickson’s new party South Belfast Unionists joins the fray]", ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; taking 351 first preference votes.

"'''You Have 0 Friends'''" is the fourth episode of the [[South Park (season 14)|14th season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 199th episode of the series overall. It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on April 7, 2010. In the episode, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] make [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] a [[Facebook]] profile against his will and he becomes extremely frustrated with everyone asking him for friend requests. After he gets fed up with Facebook, Stan tries to delete his profile but is sucked into a virtual Facebook world. Meanwhile, Kyle starts trying to find ways to get more friends on Facebook after he drastically starts losing them due to his befriending of a third-grade friendless Facebook user, whom everyone considers a loser.

The episode was written and directed by co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States.&lt;ref name="episodeguide"&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=South Park episode guide |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/1404/ |work= |publisher=South Park Studios |date=2010-04-04 |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; "You Have 0 Friends" features several references to the popular social networking service [[Facebook]], and [[Stan Marsh|Stan's]] plotline parodies the 1982 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Tron]]'' with Stan in the role of Kevin Flynn, and its climax borrows from the climax of the 2009 film ''[[Summer Wars]]''. The episode also parodies the [[CNBC]] series ''[[Mad Money]]'', as well as the online chat website [[Chatroulette]], and the social network game ''[[FarmVille]]''.

"You Have 0 Friends" has received positive reviews from critics, and according to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was viewed by 3.071 million viewers and became the cable lead in the 18–49 Wednesday night.

== Plot ==
[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] surprise [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] by creating a [[Facebook]] account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as [[Social network service#Basics|friends]]. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as [[List of South Park families#Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]], [[List of South Park families#Grandpa Marvin Marsh|his grandmother]] and even [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, in part due to a ''Mad Friends'' [[podcast]] he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and [[self-fulfilling prophecy|asserts]] nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to [[Chatroulette]] as a way to make new friends, which fails as most of the people on the site are [[online predator]]s (either [[masturbating]] or flashing their genitals), until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.

Meanwhile, Stan now has 845,323 friends (almost all of whom he hardly knows or does not know) on his account and has finally decided to delete it, only to find that [[Criticism of Facebook#Inability to voluntarily terminate accounts|Facebook refuses to allow him to]]. Instead of deleting his account, Stan is forcibly transported by the software into the [[virtual world]] of Facebook, where he meets "profiles" of everyone he knows who communicate in Facebook lingo, and is forced to engage in Facebook activities such as [[Yahtzee]]. Unexpectedly winning on the first roll, Stan escapes and finds his way to Kyle's ''[[FarmVille|Farm Town]]'' farm, blaming Kyle for getting him "sucked into Facebook" in the first place. Stan orders Kyle to check out his profile status and Kyle finds out that Stan is supposedly hosting a party elsewhere in Facebook at ''[[Café World]]''. Kyle makes it to Stan's party, only to find that Isiah has refused to be his friend because of Kip. Desperate to retain some friends, Kyle finally deletes Kip, leaving him with no friends. Kip, too, is disheartened to find his friend has abandoned him.

At the party, Stan encounters his online profile, which has the form of a huge monstrous version of himself. It challenges him to a game of Yahtzee and Stan wins, again on the first roll, causing the profile to be finally deleted. The victory returns Stan to the real world once more. He now has no Facebook friends, and Randy, upon realizing that Stan is no longer his friend, asks Stan why he deleted him. Stan explains what just happened to him and that he has "sent all his friends somewhere else". Back at Kip's house, Kip is still depressed about Kyle deleting him as a friend, but is then overjoyed when all 845,323 friends Stan had prior to deletion are suddenly transferred to his account as friends.

"You Have 0 Friends" was written and directed by co-series creator Trey Parker. He came up with the episode after signing up for Facebook and actually being sucked into it until people were angry that he did not respond to anyone on Facebook. He came up with the idea of doing something similar to ''Tron''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3g6VNrk_Og  South Park Season 14 You Have 0 Friends Commentary] on [[YouTube]]. Retrieved 15 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The episode prominently features several aspects of the online website [[Facebook]], including the Facebook games ''[[Farmville]]'', ''[[Café World]]'' and a digital version of the [[Milton Bradley]] game [[Yahtzee]].&lt;ref name="KenTucker"/&gt; Also, many aspects of the virtual Facebook world Stan gets sucked into in the episode parody the film ''[[Tron]]''. Stan's Facebook account is based on the Master Control Program.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; Cartman's podcast, ''Mad Friends'', is a parody of a segment from the financial show ''[[Mad Money]]'' hosted by [[Jim Cramer]] on [[CNBC]].&lt;ref name="!Ay caramba!"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/04/08/south-park-lampoons-facebook-jim-cramer-tron/ ‘South Park’ Lampoons Facebook, [[Jim Cramer]], ‘Tron’]&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received generally positive reviews from critics.

There have been less favorable reviews of "You Have 0 Friends" that criticize the use of its cultural Facebook jokes. TV Fanatic, who gave the episode 3/5, said there was "too much Facebook" in the episode and that "it was a great parody, but just a decent episode that could have had more [[LOL]] moments".&lt;ref name="tvfanatic"&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=South Park Review: 'You Have 0 Friends' |url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/04/south-park-review-you-have-0-friends/ |work= |publisher=TV Fanatic |date=2010-04-08 |accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grading it a D+, [[The A.V. Club]]'s Todd VanDerWerff opined the episode "mostly made all of the jokes about [Facebook] that the rest of us did back when Facebook first invaded all of our lives. It doesn't give me high hopes for the inevitable Twitter episode the show does in 2013."&lt;ref name = "A.V.
