The '''1996 Parliament House riot''' (also called the '''Canberra riot''') involved a physical attack on [[Parliament House, Canberra]], Australia, on 19 August 1996, when protesters broke away from the "Cavalcade to Canberra" rally organised by the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU) and sought to force their way into the national [[Parliament of Australia]], causing property damage and attacking police.

==Overview==
[[File:Parliament House Canberra (706422542).jpg|thumb|The entrance to [[Parliament House, Canberra]] - scene of the 1996 riot.]]

The [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] called the "cavalcade to Canberra" rally to protest against the industrial relations reform agenda of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National]] Coalition [[Howard Government]]. The protest began with senior Australian Trade Union officials including ACTU President [[Jennie George]] and Assistant Secretary [[Greg Combet]], as well as senior members of the [[Australian Labor Party]] rallying demonstrators from a  podium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/jennie-george-bids-farewell-to-politics/1682568.aspx?storypage=2 Jennie George bids farewell to politics - Local News - News - General - Illawarra Mercury]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/nation-today-with-malcolm-farr/story-e6frg15u-1226027256101 |title=The nation today - live with Malcolm Farr &amp;#124; Perth Now |access-date=24 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609143104/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/nation-today-with-malcolm-farr/story-e6frg15u-1226027256101 |archive-date=9 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to then [[President of the Australian Senate|President of the Senate]], [[Margaret Reid (politician)|Margaret Reid]], the initially peaceful protest deteriorated into violent action when a new group of demonstrators arrived in the early afternoon and, joined by people from the main protest, attacked the entrance to Parliament. Around 90 personnel were injured —including lacerations, sprains, and head and eye injuries. Damage to the forecourt and foyer of Parliament was initially estimated at $75,000 and the Parliamentary shop was looted. Nine rioters were arrested and charged with a variety of offences.&lt;ref name="aph1"&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds200896.pdf Hansard of the Australian Senate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216215833/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds200896.pdf |date=16 February 2012 }} 20 Aug 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Before the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 Australian Federal election]], ACTU Secretary, [[Bill Kelty]], had threatened 'industrial war' if a Coalition Government tried to challenge union power.&lt;ref name="anu1"&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/riot.htm The Parliament House riot of 1996] by Luke Deer, published by [[Australian National University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following their 1996 election victory, the [[Howard Government]] proposed to balance the [[Australian federal budget]] by means of extensive budget cuts, and introduced a draft Workplace Relations Amendment Bill which proposed to curtail '[[closed shop|compulsory unionism]]' and to introduce a more decentralised bargaining structure to the Australian work place. Both endeavours were opposed by Trade Unionists who organised a campaign of protest to culminate on the eve of the federal budget, 19 August 1996 with a protest rally on the lawns of the Federal Parliament, called the "Cavalcade to Canberra".&lt;ref name="anu1"/&gt;

==The protest and riot==

On 4 July 1996, the [[A.C.T. Trades and Labour Council]] advised the Speaker and President of the Parliament that a rally would be held at Parliament House on Monday, 19 August and requested permission to conduct a march around the Parliament building. The march was approved for between 1.35&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 2.25 p.m, provided adequated marshalling was organised and that the demonstration did not obstruct access to Parliament. Subsequent discussions were also conducted with the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]] and the indigenous representatives and all agreed to these parameters for the demonstration. On the day of 19 August, The protest rally remained peaceful until about 12.20&amp;nbsp;p.m. at which point a separate group of demonstrators entered the parliamentary precinct. The following day, the [[President of the Australian Senate]] outlined to Parliament the events that followed thus:&lt;ref name="aph1"/&gt;

{{quote|[T]his group refused to accept police direction, forced a breach in police lines and ran towards the main front entrance of Parliament House. Unfortunately, it was apparent that some of these demonstrators were affected by alcohol. This group was supported by participants from the more general demonstration who were incited to join those involved in riotous conduct by a speaker from the official platform.

Police formed a protective line along the perimeter of the Great Verandah which was subsequently forced back to the main doors. The police line was withdrawn from this area due to the level of violence being experienced by officers and was redeployed to an area inside the front doors in support of parliamentary security personnel. This deployment stabilised the situation for a short period. However, demonstrators using increasing force broke through the first line of doors.

Once inside this area, demonstrators used weapons, including a large hammer, a wheel brace, a steel trolley and a stanchion torn from the external doors to break open the internal doors. Simultaneously, a second group of demonstrators used other weapons to break into the Parliament House shop, but were held at the internal doors. The shop was ransacked by demonstrators and major damage was caused by persons who subsequently occupied the area. After some two hours, the demonstrators were finally repelled from Parliament House and driven back onto the forecourt area and, shortly afterwards, they dispersed.

In addition to the events which took place at the front entrance to the building, incidents also occurred on the Members Terrace, the roof of the Great Verandah and the Queens Terrace. There were 197 Australian Federal Police on duty at the start of the demonstration, in addition to the Australian Protective Service officers and parliamentary security personnel. A further 60 Australian Federal Police reinforcements were called out under established contingency plans.
}}

During the course of the riot, unionist Davie Thomason, of the [[CFMEU]], took the podium at the official rally with a bloodied face and spoke while shaking a police riot shield, saying to cheers from other protesters:&lt;ref name="anu1"/&gt;

{{quote|[T]he CFMEU and other organisations from the construction division, 100 of us have got into our House. And look what we got from the coppers. And we have to remember it's going to be a long haul but these people up here will never defeat us, we have to remember that ... Workers, united, will never be defeated.
}}

Addressing the Senate the following day, Senator [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], leader of the Government in the Senate, described the event as "very sad day in the history of the Australian political process", and his opposition counterpart Senator [[John Faulkner]] condemned the "appalling violence" on behalf of the opposition. Senator [[Cheryl Kernot]] for the [[Australian Democrats]] said she "condemned" the violence and "I deplore the actions of those who, in my opinion, selfishly and deliberately chose to distract from discussion of the issues". Senator [[Dee Margetts]], speaking for the [[Greens Western Australia]] said that "the Greens WA do not associate ourselves with the violent action" but that "there are obviously some in the Greens movement who have differing opinions about that".&lt;ref name="aph1"/&gt; In the House of Representatives, Opposition Leader [[Kim Beazley]] called the rioters "lunatics" and "louts" who had distracted from a "peaceful and lawful" protest, while Prime Minister [[John Howard]] described the violence as "thuggery" and said that the ACTU should accept some responsibility for the riot:&lt;ref name="aph1"/&gt;

{{quote|Those who organise demonstrations have a responsibility to stop them getting out of hand, and it is utterly disingenuous of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to pretend that it can accept no responsibility at all for what happened yesterday.

Members of the '''Alanine or Glycine:Cation Symporter (AGCS) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25 TC# 2.A.25]) transport [[alanine]] and/or [[glycine]] in [[symport]] with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Structure and function==
Known proteins in the AGCS family are between 445 and 550 amino acyl residues in length and possess 8 to 12 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners. Members may possess 11 transmembrane segments (TMSs), as seems to be true for DagA ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.1.1 TC# 2.A.25.1.1]) and AgcS ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.1.3 TC# 2.A.25.1.3]), although Acp ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.1.2 TC# 2.A.25.1.2]) has only 8 TMSs, perhaps the result of truncation. As of early 2016, there does not appear to be any 3D crystal structure data available for these proteins. Members of the AGCS family have been found in bacteria and archaea, such as extremophile halotolerant cyanobacterium ''Aphanothece halophytica,'' and thermophilic bacteria, ''Bacillus'' ''PS3''.&lt;ref name="Bualuang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bualuang A, Kageyama H, Tanaka Y, Incharoensakdi A, Takabe T | title = Functional characterization of a member of alanine or glycine: cation symporter family in halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica | journal = Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 230–5 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25421789 | doi = 10.1080/09168451.2014.968091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanamori M, Kamata H, Yagisawa H, Hirata H | title = Overexpression of the alanine carrier protein gene from thermophilic bacterium PS3 in Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 125 | issue = 3 | pages = 454–9 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10050032 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, only three members of the family have been functionally characterized. These proteins show limited sequence similarity in the APC family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3 TC# 2.A.3]).&lt;ref name=TCDB/&gt; As of early 2016, there do not appear to be any crystal structures available for members of the AGCS family.

===Transport reaction===
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by the AGCS family is:&lt;ref name=TCDB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saier|first1=MH | name-list-format = vanc |title=2.A.25 The Alanine or Glycine:Cation Symporter (AGCS) Family|url=http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25|website=Transporter Classification Database|publisher=Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

alanine or glycine (out) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → alanine or glycine (in) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

==Proteins in the AGCS family==
There are currently 10 proteins belonging to the AGCS family. These proteins and their descriptions can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.2 Transporter Classification Database].

'''Abraham of Augsburg''' (died 21 November 1265) was a [[Germany|German]] [[proselyte]] to [[Judaism]]. He died a [[Martyrdom in Judaism|martyr's death]].

==Life==
Abraham was born at [[Augsburg]], and he later converted into [[Judaism]] at a foreign region.&lt;ref name=martyr/&gt;

He adopted his new faith with such enthusiasm that, returning to Augsburg, he publicly assailed [[Christianity]] and attacked images of the [[saints]], namely severing the heads of some [[crucifix]] figurines, and also smashing a religious portrait which had been engraved on stone. For all this he was sentenced to [[torture]] and [[death by burning]].&lt;ref name=martyr&gt;[[Salfeld]], ''Martyrologium des Nürnberger Memorbuches'', pp. 22, 149, 150;&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, Abraham's rage ensued in a bitter confrontation between Jewish and Catholics of [[Sinzig]], ensuing in a regional [[pogrom]] in which 61 other Jews were slain, together with Abraham.&lt;ref name=sinzing&gt;[http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/sinzig_synagoge.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The incident attracted considerable attention, and it forms the subject of elegies by [[Mordecai ben Hillel]] (who himself suffered martyrdom in 1298) and by the liturgical poet [[Moses ben Jacob]]. The rites of [[Selichot]] tell about Abraham.

{{japanese name|Adachi}}

'''Adachi Ginkō''' ({{lang|ja|安達 吟光}}, born 1853; active {{circa|1870}}&amp;nbsp;– 1908) was a Japanese artist best known for his prints in the [[ukiyo-e]] style as a member of the [[Utagawa school]].  He worked in a variety of genres, including portraits of beauties and actors, landscapes, book illustrations, and satirical works, and produced a large number of [[triptych]]s of contemporary events.  His most successful work was his ''Pictorial Outline of Japanese History'' series of triptychs in the late 1880s.  He was jailed and fined in 1889 for caricaturing [[Emperor Meiji|the Meiji Emperor]].

==Life and career==

Few details of Ginkō's birth and early life are known; his birth name was Adachi Heishichi.{{efn|{{lang|ja|安達 平七}} }}{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=174}}  He was born about the second month of [[Kaei]] 6 on the [[Japanese calendar]] (about March or April 1853).{{sfn|Kimoto|1984|p=83}}

Ginkō studied under the painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Goseda Hōryū|ja|3=五姓田芳柳}}, who worked in a Western style.  Ginkō may have begun designing [[ukiyo-e]] woodblock prints as early as 1870, though these purported prints of the [[Boshin War]] have not survived.  Ginkō's earliest surviving prints date to 1873—a number of ''[[yakusha-e]]'' prints of actors in the style of [[Toyohara Kunichika]].{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=174}}  He published his early work under the [[art name]] Shōsetsusai Ginkō.{{efn|{{lang|ja|松雪斎 銀光}} }}{{sfn|Yoshida|1974|p=80}}  He found success with a series of actor prints titled ''Complete Issue of Top Battle Stories'' {{efn|{{lang|ja|講談一席読切}} ''{{transl|ja|Kōdan isseki yomikiri}}''}} in 1874.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=174}}  Later that year he began using the art name Adachi Ginkō.{{efn|{{lang|ja|安達 吟光}} }}&lt;!-- ''Kōdan isseki yomikiri'' was published under the name 松雪斎銀光 --&gt;{{sfn|Yoshida|1974|p=80}}

Ginkō produced in a variety of genres, including ''[[bijin-ga]]'' portraits of beauties, landscapes, book illustrations, and satirical works.  A large number of his works dealt with contemporary events such as the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] and the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].

'''Albert Eduard Kusnets''' (12 August 1902 – 1942) was a middleweight Greco-Roman wrestler from [[Estonia]]. He competed in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[1928 Summer Olympics]] and placed fourth and third, respectively. He won his 1928 bronze medal despite breaking a leg in 1928 and not competing until the Olympics. He earned three more medals at the European championships in 1927–1933.&lt;ref name=iat /&gt; Kusnets missed the 1932 Olympics, because Estonia could not afford sending a team to [[Los Angeles]] during the [[Great Depression]]. After retiring in 1933 he worked as wrestling coach, and prepared the Olympic champion [[Kristjan Palusalu]]. 

In 1941, he was sent to a Russian labor camp in [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]], where he starved to death the next winter.&lt;ref name=sr /&gt;&lt;ref name=esbl /&gt;&lt;ref name="WWII"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/friv/lists.cgi?id=65 |title=Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=Sports Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ann Cargill''' (born Ann Brown) (1760 – 4 March 1784) was a British [[opera]] [[diva]] and celebrated beauty whose life and death were a sensation in [[London]] at the close of the 18th century.

==Death==
[[File:Ann cargill.PNG|thumb|''Tempest'', Miss Brown and Mr. Mattocks in the characters of Miranda and Ferdinand]]

By 1783, she had a new love. Her lover was in the [[British East India Company]] and stationed in [[Calcutta]], so she left England for [[India]]. In 1783, she performed operatic parts in Calcutta, to tremendous applause, and her benefit night brought in "the astonishing sum of 12,000 rupees."&lt;ref&gt;(Baldwin and Wilson, 93)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Cargill, Ann |first=John Joseph|last=Knight|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a passenger on the [[packet ship]] [[Nancy (1774 EIC ship)|''Nancy'']], whose captain, John Haldane, was her lover, when it wrecked and sank off the [[Isles of Scilly]] on 4 March 1784. Her body, originally unidentified, was buried on [[Rosevear]] then reburied at [[St Mary's Old Church, St Mary's|Old Town Church]] on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]] in the [[Isles of Scilly]]. The newspaper accounts of her death and how the body had been found "floating in her shift" with an infant at her bosom made her a tragic figure for the English press. In September 2008, British divers claimed to have found the wreck of the ''Nancy'', further out from the Isles of Scilly than was previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24600">An '''asymmetric cell division''' produces two daughter [[biological cell|cells]] with different cellular fates. This is in contrast to symmetric [[cell division]]s which give rise to daughter cells of equivalent fates. Notably, [[stem cell]]s divide asymmetrically to give rise to two distinct daughter cells: one copy of the original stem cell as well as a second daughter programmed to differentiate into a non-stem cell fate. (In times of growth or regeneration, stem cells can also divide symmetrically, to produce two identical copies of the original cell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal

In principle, there are two mechanisms by which distinct properties may be conferred on the daughters of a dividing cell. In one, the daughter cells are initially equivalent but a difference is induced by [[Cell signaling|signaling]] between the cells, from surrounding cells, or from the precursor cell.  This mechanism is known as extrinsic asymmetric cell division. In the second mechanism, the prospective daughter cells are inherently different at the time of division of the mother cell. Because this latter mechanism does not depend on interactions of cells with each other or with  their environment, it must rely on [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|''intrinsic'']] asymmetry. The term '''asymmetric cell division''' usually refers to such intrinsic asymmetric divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Garriga | first2 = Gian | year = 1998 | title = Asymmetric cell division: from A to Z | url = | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 12 | issue = 23| pages = 3625–38 | doi=10.1101/gad.12.23.3625| pmid = 9851969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intrinsic asymmetry ==

In multi-celled organisms this mechanism raises two requirements: first, the mother cell must be [[Cell polarity|polarized]]; second, the [[mitotic spindle]] must be aligned with the axis of polarity. The [[cell biology]] of these events has been most traditionally studied in three animal models: the mouse, the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and the fruitfly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. Recent work in [[spiralia]]n development has also discovered insightful mechanisms of asymmetric cell division.

== Asymmetric cell division in ''C. elegans'' development ==

In ''C. elegans'', a series of asymmetric cell divisions in the early embryo are critical in setting up the anterior/posterior, dorsal/ventral, and left/right axes of the body plan.&lt;ref&gt;Gönczy, P. and Rose, L.S. Asymmetric cell division and axis formation in the embryo (October 15, 2005), WormBook, ed. The ''C. elegans'' Research Community, WormBook, doi/10.1895/wormbook.1.30.1, [http://www.wormbook.org]&lt;/ref&gt; After fertilization, events are already occurring in the one cell stage embryo to allow for the first asymmetric cell division. This first division produces two distinctly different blastomeres, termed AB and P1. When the sperm fertilizes the egg, the sperm nucleus and centrosomes are deposited within the egg, which causes a cytoplasmic flux resulting in the movement of the sperm pronucleus and centrosomes towards one pole.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, B, Hird, SN. "Specification of the anteroposterior axis in Caenorhabditis elegans." Development 1996. 122:1467–74.&lt;/ref&gt; The centrosomes deposited by the sperm seem to be responsible for the establishment of the posterior pole within the one cell embryo. Studies have shown that the pole in which the sperm-derived centrosomes reside always becomes the posterior pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cowan | first1 = C | last2 = Hyman | first2 = A | year = 2004 | title = Centrosomes direct cell polarity independently of microtubule assembly in C. elegans embryos | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7004| pages = 92–96 | doi=10.1038/nature02825| pmid = 15343338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sperm with mutant or absent centrosomes fail to establish a posterior pole, while enucleated sperm with intact centrosomes successfully fertilize the egg and set up the posterior pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O' | last2 = Connell | first2 = K.

This series of events allows the single celled zygote to obtain polarity through an unequal distribution of multiple factors.

The single cell is now set up to undergo an asymmetric cell division, however the orientation in which the division occurs is also an important factor. The mitotic spindle must be oriented correctly to ensure that the proper cell fate determinants are distributed appropriately to the daughter cells. The alignment of the spindle is mediated by the PAR proteins, which regulate the positioning of the centrosomes along the A/P axis as well as the movement of the mitotic spindle along the A/P axis.&lt;ref&gt;Gönczy, P. and Rose, L.S.

The ''C. elegans'' Research Community, WormBook, {{DOI|10.1895/wormbook.1.30.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this first asymmetric division, the AB daughter cell divides symmetrically, giving rise to ABa and ABp, while the P1 daughter cell undergoes another asymmetric cell division to produce P2 and EMS. This division is also dependent on the distribution of the PAR proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = SQ | last2 = Bowerman | first2 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cell polarity and the cytoskeleton in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote | url = | journal = Annu Rev Genet | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 221–49 | pmid = 14616061 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.37.110801.142443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asymmetric cell division in ''Drosophila'' neural development ==

[[File:asymmetric cell division neuroblast.jpg|thumb|Numb (blue) is asymmetrically distributed within the neuroblast. Following cell division, the GMC contains the Numb protein which suppresses Notch signaling. The other daughter cell is receptive to Notch signaling, causing distinct cellular responses, and ultimately two distinct cell fates between the daughter cells.]]

In ''Drosophila melanogaster'', asymmetric cell division plays an important role in neural development. Neuroblasts are the progenitor cells which divide asymmetrically to give rise to another neuroblast and a ganglion mother cell (GMC). The neuroblast repeatedly undergoes this asymmetric cell division while the GMC continues on to produce a pair of neurons. Two proteins play an important role in setting up this asymmetry in the neuroblast, Prospero and Numb. These proteins are both synthesized in the neuroblast and segregate into only the GMC during divisions.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matsuzaki | first1 = F | year = 2000 | title = Asymmetric division of ''Drosophila'' neural stem cells: a basis for neural diversity | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 38–44 | doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(99)00052-5| pmid = 10679433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numb is a suppressor of Notch, therefore the asymmetric segregation of Numb to the basal cortex biases the response of the daughter cells to Notch signaling, resulting in two distinct cell fates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guo | first1 = M | last2 = Jan | first2 = LY | last3 = Jan | first3 = YN | year = 1996 | title = Control of daughter cell fates during asymmetric division: interaction of Numb and Notch | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 27–41 | doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80278-0| pmid = 8755476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospero is required for gene regulation in GMCs. It is equally distributed throughout the neuroblast cytoplasm, but becomes localized at the basal cortex when the neuroblast starts to undergo mitosis. Once the GMC buds off from the basal cortex, Prospero becomes translocated into the GMC nucleus to act as a transcription factor.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000" /&gt;

Other proteins present in the neuroblast mediate the asymmetric localization of Numb and Prospero. Miranda is an anchoring protein that binds to Prospero and keeps it in the basal cortex. Following the generation of the GMC, Miranda releases Prospero and then becomes degraded.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ikeshima-Kataoka | first1 = H | last2 = Skeath | first2 = JB | last3 = Nabeshima | first3 = Y | last4 = Doe | first4 = CQ | last5 = Matsuzaki | first5 = F | year = 1997 | title = Miranda directs Prospero to a daughter cell during ''Drosophila'' asymmetric divisions | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 390 | issue = 6660| pages = 625–29 |pmid=9403694|doi=10.1038/37641}}&lt;/ref&gt; The segregation of Numb is mediated by Pon (the partner of Numb protein). Pon binds to Numb and colocalizes with it during neuroblast cell division.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000" /&gt;

The mitotic spindle must also align parallel to the asymmetrically distributed cell fate determinants to allow them to become segregated into one daughter cell and not the other. The mitotic spindle orientation is mediated by Inscuteable, which is segregated to the apical cortex of the neuroblast. Without the presence of Inscuteable, the positioning of the mitotic spindle and the cell fate determinants in relationship to each other becomes randomized. Inscuteable mutants display a uniform distribution of Miranda and Numb at the cortex, and the resulting daughter cells display identical neuronal fates.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000" /&gt;

== Asymmetric cell division in Spiralian development ==

[[Spiralia]] (commonly synonymous with [[lophotrochozoa]]) represent a diverse clade of animals whose species comprise the bulk of the bilaterian animals present today.  Examples include [[mollusk]]s, [[annelid worm]]s, and the [[entoprocta]].  Although much is known at the cellular and molecular level about the other bilateralian clades ([[ecdysozoa]] and [[deuterostomia]]), research into the processes that govern spiralian development is comparatively lacking.  However, one unifying feature shared among spiralia is the pattern of cleavage in the early embryo known as [[Cleavage (embryo)|spiral cleavage]].&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henry | first1 = Jonathan J. | last2 = Martindale | first2 = Mark Q. | year = 1999 | title = Conservation and innovation in spiralian development | url = | journal = Hydrobiologia | volume = 402 | issue = | pages = 255–65 | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2887-4_15| isbn = 978-90-481-5340-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanisms of asymmetric division''' (See Figure, right panel):

[[File:Asymmetric cell division.jpg|thumb|Asymmetric cell division is integral during development. In spiralia, the first cleavage can be either symmetric or asymmetric, as shown in the left panel. Asymmetry can be accomplished through simple unequal segregation of cell fate determinants across a single plane, through sequestration of cell fate determinants in a polar lobe which is absorbed by one of the daughter cells, or a combination of both processes. The right panel summarizes the mechanisms of spiralian asymmetric cleavage discussed here. Red features indicate the molecule(s) implicated in establishing asymmetry.]]

*Tubifex tubifex: The sludge worm ''[[Tubifex tubifex]]'' has been shown to demonstrate an interesting asymmetric cell division at the point of first embryonic cleavage.  Unlike the classic idea of cortical differences at the zygotic membrane that determine spindle asymmetry in the ''C. elegans'' embryo, the first cleavage in tubifex relies on the number of [[centrosome]]s.&lt;ref name=Shimizu&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shimizu | first1 = T. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1998 | title = Unequal Cleavage in the early Tubifex Embryo | url = | journal = Develop. Growth Differ | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 257–66 | doi=10.1046/j.1440-169x.1998.00001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Embryos inherit a single centrosome which localizes in the prospective larger CD cell cytoplasm and emits radial microtubules during anaphase that contribute to both the mitotic spindle as well as cortical asters.  However, the microtubule organizing center of the prospective smaller AB cell emits only microtubules that commit to the mitotic spindle and not cortical bound asters.  When embryos are compressed or deformed, asymmetric spindles still form, and staining for gamma tubulin reveals that the second microtubule organizing center lacks the molecular signature of a centrosome.  Furthermore, when centrosome number is doubled, ''tubifex'' embryos cleave symmetrically, suggesting this monoastral mechanism of asymmetric cell division is centrosome dependent.&lt;ref name=Shimizu /&gt;
*Helobdella robusta: The leech ''[[Helobdella robusta]]'' exhibits a similar asymmetry in the first embryonic division as ''C. elegans'' and ''tubifex'', but relies on a modified mechanism.  Compression experiments on the robusta embryo do not affect asymmetric division, suggesting the mechanism, like tubifex, uses a cortical independent molecular pathway.  In robusta, antibody staining reveals that the mitotic spindle forms symmetrically until metaphase and stems from two biastral centrosomes.&lt;ref name=Ren&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ren | first1 = Xiaoyun | last2 = Weisblat | first2 = David A. | year = 2006 | title = Asymmetrization of first cleavage by transient disassembly of one spindle pole aster in the leech Helobdella robusta | url = | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 292 | issue = 1| pages = 103–15 | doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.12.049| pmid = 16458880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the onset of metaphase, asymmetry becomes apparent as the centrosome of the prospective larger CD cell lengthens cortical asters while the asters of the prospective smaller AB cell become downregulated.  Experiments using [[nocodazole]] and [[taxol]] support this observation.  Taxol, which stabilized microtubules, forced a significant number of embryos to cleave symmetrically when used at a moderate concentration.  Moreover, embryos treated with nocodazole, which sequesters tubulin dimers and promotes microtubule depolymerization, similarly forced symmetric division in a significant number of embryos.  Treatment with either drug at these concentrations fails to disrupt normal centrosome dynamics, suggesting that a balance of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization represents another mechanism for establishing asymmetric cell division in spilarian development.&lt;ref name=Ren /&gt;
*Ilyanasa obsoleta: A third, less traditional mechanism contributing to asymmetric cell division in spiralian development has been discovered in the mollusk ''[[Ilyanasa obsoleta]]''.  [[In situ hybridization]] and [[immunofluorescence]] experiments show that mRNA transcripts co-localize with centrosomes during early cleavage.&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lambert | first1 = J. David | last2 = Nagy | first2 = Lisa M. | year = 2002 | title = Asymmetric inheritance of centrosomally localized mRNAs during embryonic cleavages | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 420 | issue = 6916| pages = 682–86|pmid=12478296|doi=10.1038/nature01241}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Consequently, these transcripts are inherited in a stereotypical fashion to distinct cells.  All mRNA transcripts followed have been implicated in body axis patterning, and in situ hybridization for transcripts associated with other functions fail to exhibit such a localization.  Moreover, disruption of microtubule polymerization with nocodazole, and of actin polymerization with cytochalisin B, shows the cytoskeleton is also important in this asymmetry.  It appears that microtubules are required to recruit the mRNA to the centrosome, and that actin is required to attach the centrosome to the cortex.  Finally, introducing multiple centrosomes into one cell by inhibiting cytokinesis shows that mRNA dependably localizes on the correct centrosome, suggesting intrinsic differences between each centrosomal composition.  It is important to note that these results reflect experiments performed after the first two divisions, yet still demonstrate a different molecular means of establishing asymmetry in a dividing cell.&lt;ref name=Lambert /&gt;

== Asymmetric division in stem cells and progenitors ==

Animals are made up of a vast number of distinct [[cell type]]s. During development, the [[zygote]] undergoes many cell divisions that give rise to various cell types, including embryonic stem cells. Asymmetric divisions of these embryonic cells gives rise to one cell of the same potency ([[self-renewal]]), and another that maybe of the same potency or stimulated to further differentiate into specialized cell types such as neurons. This stimulated differentiation arises from many factors which can be divided into two broad categories: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic factors generally involve differing amounts of cell-fate determinants being distributed into each daughter cell. Extrinsic factors involve interactions with neighboring cells and the micro and macro environment of the precursor cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jan, Y. N. |title=Asymmetric cell division |author2=Jan, L. Y. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Nature|year=1998|volume=392|issue=6678 |pages=775–778|doi=10.1038/33854 |pmid=9572136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the aforementioned Drosophila neuronal example, it was proposed that the macrosensory organs of the Drosophila, specifically the glial cells, also arise from a similar set of asymmetric division from a single progenitor cell via regulation of the [[Notch signaling pathway]] and [[transcription factors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gho, M. |author2=Bellaiche, Y. |author3=Schweisguth, F.|title=Revisiting the Drosophila microchaete lineage: a novel intrinsically asymmetric cell division generates a glial cell|journal=Development|year=1999|volume=126|pages=573–3584}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of how extrinsic factors bring about this phenomenon is the physical displacement of one of the daughter cells out of the original stem cell niche, exposing it to signalling molecules such as [[chondroitin sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes, A. J. |author2=Tudor, D. |author3=Nowell, M. A. |author4=Caterson, B. |author5=Hughes, C. E|title=Chondroitin sulfate sulfation motifs as putative biomarkers for isolation of articular cartilage progenitor cells|journal=J Histochem Cytochem|year=2008|volume=56 |issue=2|pages=125–138|doi=10.1369/jhc.7a7320.2007|pmid=17938280|pmc=2324172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this manner, the daughter cell is forced to interact with the heavily sulfated molecules, which stimulate it to differentiate while the other daughter cell remains in the original niche in a quiescent state.

== Role of asymmetric cell division in disease ==

In normal stem and [[progenitor]] cells, asymmetric cell division balances proliferation and self-renewal with [[Cell cycle|cell-cycle]] exit and differentiation. Disruption of asymmetric cell division leads to aberrant self-renewal and impairs [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], and could therefore constitute an early step in the tumorogenic transformation of stem and progenitor cells. In normal non-tumor stem cells, a number of genes have been described which are responsible for pluripotency, such as [[Bmi-1]], [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]] and [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch]]. These genes have been discovered also in the case of cancer stem cells, and shows that their aberrant expression is essential for the formation of tumor cell mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00018-013-1386-1|pmid=23771628|title=Asymmetric cell division of stem and progenitor cells during homeostasis and cancer|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|volume=71|issue=4|pages=575–97|year=2013|last1=Gómez-López|first1=Sandra|last2=Lerner|first2=Robin G.|last3=Petritsch|first3=Claudia|pmc=3901929}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been shown that [[gastrointestinal cancer]]s contain rare subpopulation of cancer stem cells which are capable to divide asymmetrically. The asymmetric division in these cells is regulated by cancer niche (microenvironment) and Wnt pathway. Blocking the Wnt pathway with IWP2 (WNT antagonist) or siRNA-TCF4 resulted in high suppression of asymmetric cell division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xin | first1 = H. W. | last2 = Ambe | first2 = C. M. | last3 = Ray | first3 = S. | last4 = Kim | first4 = B. K. | last5 = Koizumi | first5 = T. | last6 = Wiegand | first6 = G.

Another [[mutation]] in asymmetric cell divisions which are involved in tumor growth are loss-of-function mutations. The first suggestion that loss of asymmetric cell division might be involved in tumorigenesis came from studies of [[Drosophila]]. Studies of loss-of-function mutations in key regulators of asymmetric cell division including lgl, aurA, polo, numb and brat, revealed hyperproliferative [[phenotypes]] in situ. In these mutants cells divide more symmetrically and generate mis-specified progeny that fail to exit the cell cycle and differentiate, but rather proliferate continuously and form a tumor cell mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gonzalez | first1 = C. | year = 2007 | title = Spindle orientation, asymmetric division and tumour suppression in Drosophila stem cells | url = | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 8 | issue = 6| pages = 462–72 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2103 | pmid = 17510666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Magee''' (born 9 June 1975) is a Northern Irish former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1999 to 2012.&lt;ref name=boxrec&gt;{{Boxrec|14880}}. Retrieved 19 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He held multiple championships at [[super-middleweight]], including the [[World Boxing Association#Super titles|WBA (Regular)]], [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]], [[European Boxing Union|European]], and [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]] titles, as well as having challenged for the British [[light-heavyweight]] title. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] he represented Ireland at the [[1996 Olympics]], reaching the [[middleweight]] quarter-finals. He also won a silver medal at the [[1998 European Amateur Boxing Championships|1998 European Championships]] and bronze at the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]], representing Northern Ireland in the latter.

==Amateur career==
As an amateur Magee fought out of the [[Holy Trinity|Holy Trinity Boxing Club]] in Belfast, and won the Ulster senior title every year from 1995 to 1998.&lt;ref name="Ulster"&gt;{{cite web| author=| title=Ulster Senior Champions 1987–2005| work=Ulster ABA| url=http://www.ulsterboxing.org/resultsarchive/seniorchamps.htm| accessdate=5 January 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725034405/http://www.ulsterboxing.org/resultsarchive/seniorchamps.htm| archivedate=25 July 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magee won a bronze medal for [[Northern Ireland]] at the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]] and silver medal for Ireland at the [[1998 European Amateur Boxing Championships|1998 European Championships]] in [[Minsk, Belarus]].

==Professional career==
Magee turned professional in March 1999, and fought Dean Ashton at the [[Bowlers Exhibition Centre|Bowler's Arena]], Manchester, England on the undercard of a bill that included [[Damaen Kelly]], [[Michael Brodie]] and [[Clinton Woods]]. Magee won his opener [[knockout|knocking out]] the [[Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke]] man inside two rounds.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt;

He won the vacant IBO Intercontinental super middleweight title in January 2001 by defeating Neil Linford from England. He then won the IBO world super middleweight title and defended it successfully eight times. He was then defeated in his attempt for the European title.  In December 2008 he beat undefeated Scottish Stevie Maguire to win the British super middleweight title,&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt; and, after a 13-month break, returned to defeat [[Mads Larsen]] in a seven-round knockout in [[Aarhus]], becoming European champion for the first time.

On 11 September 2010 Brian Magee defended his European Title against Armenia's Roman Aramian with the Armenian not starting the ninth round. Magee challenged IBF Super-Middleweight champion [[Lucian Bute]] in Canada on 19 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/9309905.stm | work=BBC News | title=Magee fights Bute for IBF world title | date=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He lost the fight to [[Lucian Bute]] by TKO in the tenth round.

On 30 July 2011 Magee captured the interim WBA super-middleweight title with a unanimous points win over Jaime Barboza in San Jose, Costa Rica.

===Magee vs. Kessler===
On 8 December 2012. Brian Magee travelled to Denmark to face "The Viking Warrior" [[Mikkel Kessler]] in his home nation with the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Super Middleweight Title at stake. After a quiet 1st round, Magee went to the floor twice in the 2nd after Kessler landed some hard bodyshots. After 24 seconds on the third round it was allover, Kessler landed a hard bodyshot again; Magee never recovered and Kessler became World Champion for the fifth time.

'''Charles Armstrong''' was a 55-year-old labourer from [[Crossmaglen]] who disappeared on 16 August 1981.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Looking for Charlie|author=Rosie Cowan|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/03/northernireland.rosiecowan|date=3 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sunday-tribune-republicans-disappeared&gt;{{cite news|title=Republicans disappeared at least 13 people in the Troubles|newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]]|author=Suzanne Breen|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/jan/18/republicans-disappeared-at-least-13-people-in-the-|date=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a journalist, he was abducted and killed by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]],&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; a victim of [[enforced disappearance]], the reason for which is unclear. Armstrong and his wife Kathleen had five children.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Armstrong's body was retrieved in 2010 and his funeral took place on 18 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armstrong funeral takes place in Armagh|publisher=[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0918/armstrongc.html|date=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0918/breaking5.html|title=Armstrong buried in Armagh|author=Gerry Moriarty|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]|date=18 September 2010|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On the day Armstrong disappeared, his wife walked with their daughters to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], where they had planned to meet him after he drove a friend to it.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; He did not appear and it was only when they got home that they discovered that he had not met their friend. Initially, it was thought that he had had an accident, so his family and friends searched the area, but there was no sign of him. The next day, a friend phoned the family to tell them that his car had been found outside a cinema in [[Dundalk]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

His name did not appear on a list of nine people whose disappearances the [[Provisional IRA]] admitted responsibility for in 1999. [[Gerry Adams]], president of [[Sinn Féin]], denied that the IRA was responsible, but journalist [[Suzanne Breen]] said that she had been contacted by a member of the IRA who said that it was.&lt;!--any reason why--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Put that family out of its misery'|newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]]|author=Suzanne Breen|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/jan/18/put-that-family-out-of-its-misery|date=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searches==
In 2001 a search for his body produced no results.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In July 2010, a group searching for Armstrong announced that they had found human remains in [[County Monaghan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human remains found in Monaghan search for 'Disappeared'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-10810838|date=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains]] said that it had found the remains early on the afternoon of 29 July 2010 in the townland of Aughrim More, on the [[County Monaghan]] side of [[Cullaville]].&lt;ref name=it-remains-found&gt;{{cite news|title=Remains found near Border thought to be those of Troubles victim|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0730/1224275808967.html|date=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This search was carried out after the Commission had received anonymously a map indicating an area which had not been searched before for Armstrong's body.&lt;ref name=it-remains-found/&gt; In September 2010, the Independent Commission confirmed that the remains found were those of Charles Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0916/1224278993336.html|title=Body of 'disappeared' identified|author=Gerry Moriarty|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]|date=16 September 2010|accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}
The '''choking game''' (also known as the '''fainting game''' and a wide variety of slang terms) refers to intentionally cutting off oxygen to the brain with the goal of inducing temporary [[Syncope (medicine)|loss of consciousness]] and [[euphoria]].

==Reasons for practice==
Limited research has been conducted regarding motivations for practicing the fainting game, although [[Thrill seeking|thrill-seeking]] has been identified as a risk factor,&lt;ref name=DrakeEtAl2010&gt;{{citation |year=2010 |author=Drake, Joseph A.|first2=James H.|first3=Nicole|first4=Margaret |title=Association of Adolescent Choking Game Activity With Selected Risk Behaviors |journal=Academic Pediatrics |volume=10 |issue=6|pages=410–416 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187628591000255X |doi=10.1016/j.acap.2010.09.006 |pmid=21075323 |accessdate=26 October 2011|last2=Price |last3=Kolm-Valdivia |last4=Wielinski }}&lt;/ref&gt; as has the perception that it is a low-risk activity.&lt;ref name=MacnabEtAl2011&gt;{{citation |year=2009 |author=Macnab, A.J.|first2=M.|first3=F.|first4=W.G.|first5=T |title=Asphyxial games or "the choking game": a potentially fatal risk behaviour |journal=[[Injury Prevention]] |volume=14 |issue=1|pages=45–49 |url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/15/1/45.abstract |doi=10.1136/ip.2008.018523 |pmid=19190276|accessdate=26 October 2011|last2=Deevska |last3=Gagnon |last4=Cannon |last5=Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotal reasons stated include:

* [[Peer pressure]], a challenge or dare, a [[rite of passage]] into a social group or amusement over erratic behavior.&lt;ref name=Neal2008p311reasons&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zk9Ikmx6JrsC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=%22Anecdotally+stated+reasons%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AgKpTood6f2YBfXdjccP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Anecdotally%20stated%20reasons%22&amp;f=false Neal (2008), p.311]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Curiosity in experiencing an [[altered state of consciousness]], the experience of a [[greyout]], or an imagined approximation to a [[near-death experience]].&lt;ref name=Neal2008p311reasons/&gt;
* A belief that it can induce a brief sense of [[euphoria]] (a rushing sensation or [[altered state of consciousness|high]]).&lt;ref name=DrakeEtAl2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Neal2008p311reasons/&gt;

==Mechanisms of effect==
[[Image:Gray513.png|thumb|The vulnerable [[carotid artery]], (large, red tube), and the [[vagus nerve]] running parallel on its left]]
There are two main mechanisms behind many variations of this practice, both resulting in [[cerebral hypoxia]] (oxygen deprivation to the brain). The two mechanisms tend to be confused with each other or treated as one but are quite dissimilar although both have the potential to cause permanent brain damage or death.  The two mechanisms are ''[[strangulation]]'' and ''[[hypocapnia|self-induced hypocapnia]]''&lt;ref name=Neal2008p313&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ozuXuOSpYscC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=%22only+two+mechanisms%22+hypoxia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8Q2pTsW0DObZmAWm_v3UDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22only%20two%20mechanisms%22%20hypoxia&amp;f=false Neal (2008), pp.312-313]&lt;/ref&gt; and work as follows:

===Strangulation===

A ligature such as a belt or rope around the neck, or hands or arm pressure on the neck compresses the [[internal carotid artery]].  Apart from the direct restriction of blood to the brain there are two other significant responses produced by pressing on the neck:
* Pressing on the carotid arteries also presses on [[baroreceptors]]. These bodies then cause [[vasodilatation]] in the brain leading to insufficient blood to perfuse the brain with oxygen and maintain consciousness.
* A message is also sent via the [[vagus nerve]] to the main [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]] of the [[heart]] to decrease the rate and volume of the heartbeat, typically by a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epedominion.com/HealthSafty/breath.htm |title=Breath Play |publisher=Epedominion.com |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807235542/http://www.epedominion.com/HealthSafty/breath.htm |archivedate=2012-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases there is evidence that this may escalate into [[asystole]], a form of [[cardiac arrest]] that is difficult to treat.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|757257|Asystole|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a dissenting view on the full extent how and when a person reaches a stage of permanent injury, but it is agreed{{By whom|date=June 2011}} that pressure on the vagus nerve causes changes to pulse rate and blood pressure and is dangerous in cases of [[carotid sinus hypersensitivity]].

This method is responsible for most, but not all, of the reported fatalities.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The method is especially dangerous when practiced alone. Involuntary movements can lead to head trauma and other injuries. If standing, loss of consciousness can result in substantial head trauma through falling. In the event that consciousness is not immediately regained, medical help cannot be sought by a third party, observer, or friend. If the administration of CPR or basic life support is needed due to respiratory or cardiac arrest, help would not be available or quickly summonable when unconscious or not breathing. Also this act could be mistaken for suicide when practiced alone, but accidentally observed by a stranger, to whom the motivation behind the apparent 'strangulation'  is not known.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Increased breathing===

The second mechanism requires [[hyperventilation]] (forced overbreathing) until symptoms of [[hypocapnia]] such as tingling, light-headedness or dizziness are felt, followed by a breath-hold. This alone is enough to cause a blackout, but it is widely believed that the effect is enhanced if lung air pressure is increased by holding the breath "hard" or "bearing down" (tightening the diaphragm as in a forced exhalation while allowing no air to escape or having an assistant apply a bear-hug).&lt;ref name=NealHyperventilation&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ozuXuOSpYscC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;dq=%22second+mechanism%22+hyperventilation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rgipTu7OMsr0mAWEhrzVDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22second%20mechanism%22%20hyperventilation&amp;f=false Neal (2008), p.313] (hyperventilation)&lt;/ref&gt; These latter actions may augment the effects of hypoxia by approximating the [[Valsalva maneuver]], causing vagal stimulation.

The hyperventilation leads to an excessive elimination of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) whereas no significant additional amounts of oxygen can be stocked in the body. As only carbon dioxide is responsible for the breathing stimulus, after hyperventilation, breath can be held longer until [[cerebral hypoxia]] occurs. The blood also becomes abnormally alkaline as a result of the excessive elimination of carbon dioxide; this subsequent rise in blood [[pH]] is termed [[alkalosis]].  Alkalosis interferes with normal oxygen utilization by the brain.  The symptoms of alkalosis are neuromuscular irritability, muscular spasms, tingling and numbness of the extremities and around the mouth, and a dizziness, or giddiness, often interpreted as a sense of [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]].

In the body alkalosis generally induces [[vasodilation]] (widening of the blood vessels) but in the brain alone it causes [[vasoconstriction]] (narrowing of the blood vessels){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.  This vasoconstriction appears to be made even worse by a sudden increase in blood pressure caused by squeezing or holding the breath "hard".  The alkalosis-induced euphoria can be followed rapidly by hypoxia-induced unconsciousness. The sequence of events leading to unconsciousness from hyperventilation is as follows{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}:

#Decrease in [[partial pressure]] of [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
#Decrease in partial pressure of [[arterial]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
#Increase in blood pH, (respiratory alkalosis).
#Vasoconstriction of blood vessels supplying brain.
#Pooling of the blood present in the brain at the time.
#Brain rapidly uses up [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) available in the pooled blood.
#O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the brain drops.
#Unconsciousness from hypoxia of cerebral tissue.
 
Because the brain cannot store reserves of oxygen and, unlike other organs, has an exceedingly low tolerance of oxygen deprivation, it is highly vulnerable if vasoconstriction is not reversed. Normally, if the brain is hypoxic, autonomous systems in the body divert blood to the brain at the expense of other organs; because the brain is vasoconstricted this mechanism is not available. Vasoconstriction is only reversed by the build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood through suspension of breathing.

In some versions the bear-hug is replaced by pressure on the neck in which case blackout is a hybrid of strangulation and self-induced hypocapnia.

===Other mechanisms===
Unconsciousness may be induced by other methods although these are controversial: pressure over the [[carotid sinus]] may induce [[fainting|syncope]] (fainting) without any other action at all but this is difficult to reproduce and is not the basis of the game.  For those susceptible to [[carotid sinus syncope]], of which most people would be unaware until it occurred, this can be an exceedingly dangerous game.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

In both ''strangulation'' and ''self-induced hypocapnia'' blackouts the victim may experience dreaming or hallucinations, though fleetingly, and regains consciousness with short-term memory loss and involuntary movement of their hands or feet.  Full recovery is usually made within seconds if the strangulation stops.

==Prevalence==
A 2008 [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] study found that at least 79,000 students in the [[Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]] participated in this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080501/choking_game_080501/20080501|title=Some 79,000 Ont. students play choking game: survey|work=CTV News|accessdate=12 May 2011|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507052927/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080501/choking_game_080501/20080501|archivedate=7 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 Youth Health Risk Behavioral Survey in [[Williams County, Ohio|Williams County]], [[Ohio]] found that 11% of youths aged 12–18 years and 19% of youths aged 17–18 reported ever having practiced it.&lt;ref name=CDCmmwr&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5706a1.htm "Unintentional Strangulation Deaths from the "Choking Game" Among Youths Aged 6--19 Years --- United States, 1995--2007"], ''[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]'' of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], 57(06); 141-144, February 15, 2008 ({{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm5706.pdf |title=PDF version }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injuries and fatalities==
[[Image:Choking game age distribution.png|thumb|Age distribution of youths aged 6–19 years whose deaths were attributed to the "choking game" (n=82) during 1995–2007, compared with youths whose deaths were attributed to suicide by hanging/suffocation (n=5,101) during 1999–2005]]
Any activity that deprives the brain of oxygen has the potential to cause moderate to severe brain cell death leading to permanent loss of neurological function ranging from difficulty in concentration or loss of short term memory capacity through severe, lifelong mental disability to death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.headway.org.uk/effects-of-anoxic-brain-injury.aspx "Headway UK Brain Injury Charity"]&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics on fatalities and neurological damage are controversial; no definitive, empirical study exists although the indications are that the practice is a significant contributor to death and disability, particularly among male [[Minor (law)|juveniles]] in most developed countries.  Many believe that deaths are significantly underreported because of false attributions to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8995984 Kids are passing out for a deadly high] by Michael Okwu, ''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com Today, MSNBC.COM]'', February 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One study by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found sufficient evidence to indicate that since 1995 at least 82 youths between the age of 6 and 19 have died in the United States as a result of the game (being roughly 1% of the deaths attributed to suicide by suffocation in the same age group), see chart on the right.  Of these 86.6% were male, the mean age being 13.3. 95.7% of these deaths occurred while the youth was alone; parents of the decedents were unaware of the game in 92.9% of cases. Deaths were recorded in 31 states and were not clustered by location, season or day of week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|first=(CDC)|title=Unintentional strangulation deaths from the "choking game" among youths aged 6-19 years--United States, 1995-2007.|journal=MMWR.

Incidental, or indirect, injuries may arise from falling or uncontrolled movements and crushing by a ligature or an assistant.  Such injuries may include [[concussion]], bone [[fracture]]s, tongue biting and hemorrhaging of the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/14/AR2008021402089.html?nav=hcmodule "'Choking Game' Turned Deadly for 82 Youths"] by Amanda Gardner, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC encourages parents, educators and health-care providers to familiarize themselves with the signs of the game.&lt;ref name=CDCmmwr/&gt;  These include discussion of the game, bloodshot eyes, marks on the neck, severe headaches, disorientation after spending time alone, ropes, scarves, and belts tied to bedroom furniture or doorknobs or found knotted on the floor, and unexplained presence of things like dog leashes, choke collars and bungee cords.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/Media/pressrel/2008/r080214.htm "CDC Study Warns of Deaths Due to the 'Choking Game'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328170219/http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/2008/r080214.htm |date=2010-03-28 }}, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention press release, 14 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Document mosaicing''' is a process that stitches multiple, overlapping [[wikt:snaphot|snapshot]] images of a document together in order to produce one large, high resolution composite. The document is slid under a stationary, over-the-desk camera by hand until all parts of the document are snapshotted by the camera’s field of view. As the document slid under the camera, all motion of the document is coarsely tracked by the vision system. The document is periodically snapshotted such that the successive snapshots are overlap by about 50%. The system then finds the overlapped pairs and stitches them together repeatedly until all pairs are stitched together as one piece of document.&lt;ref name="MyRef2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anthony | first=Zappalá |author2=Andrew Gee|author3=Michael Taylor

The document mosaicing can be divided into four main processes.
*Tracking
*Feature detecting
*Correspondences establishing
*Images mosaicing.

== Tracking (simple correlation process) ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Document tracking.png|thumb|'''Figure 1''' : The correlation pattern mirrors the text rows. The template is continuously updated so that an incorrect correlation peak results in mild tracking inaccuracy and not total failure.&lt;ref name="MyRef2" /&gt;]] --&gt;
In this process, the motion of the document slid under the camera is coarsely tracked by the system. Tracking is performed by a process called simple [[correlation]] process. In the first frame of snapshots, a small patch is extracted from the center of the image 
as a correlation template as shown in Figure 1. The correlation process is performed in the four times size of the patch area of the next frame. The motion of the paper is indicated by the peak in the correlation function. The peak in the correlation function indicates the motion of the paper. The template is resampled from this frame and the tracking continues until the template reaches the edge of the document. After the template reaches the edge of the document, another snapshot is taken and the tracking process performs repeatedly until the whole document is imaged. The snapshots are stored in an ordered list in order to pair the overlapped images in later processes.s

== Feature detecting for efficient matching ==
Feature detection is the process of finding the transformation which aligns one image with another. There are two main approaches for feature detection.&lt;ref name="MyRef3"&gt;{{cite journal | last=S. | first=Mann |author2=R.W. Picard

 }}
* '''Feature-based approach''' : Motion parameters are estimated from point correspondences. This approach is suitable for the case that there is plenty supply of stable and detectable features.
* '''Featureless approach''' : When the motion between the two images is small, the motion parameters are estimated using [[optical flow]]. On the other hand, when the motion between the two images is large, the motion parameters are estimated using generalised [[cross-correlation]]. However, this approach requires a computationally expensive resources.

Each image is segmented into a hierarchy of columns, lines and words in order to match with the organised sets of features across images. Skew angle estimation and columns, lines and words finding are the examples of feature detection operations.

=== Skew angle estimation ===

Firstly, the angle that the rows of text make with the image [[Raster graphics|raster]] lines (skew angle) is estimated. It is assumed to lie in the range of ±20°. A small patch of text in the image is selected randomly and then rotated in the range of ±20° until the variance of the pixel intensities of the patch summed along the raster lines is maximised.&lt;ref name="MyRef5"&gt;{{cite journal | last=D.S. | first=Bloomberg |author2=G.E. Kopec |author3=L. Dasari
| title =  Measuring document image skew and orientation | journal = SPIE
| url=http://www.leptonica.com/papers/skew-measurement.pdf|year= 1995 | volume=2422 | issue=Document Recognition II | pages=302–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 2.

In order to ensure that the found skew angle is accurate, the document mosaic system performs calculation at many image patches and derive the final estimation by finding the average of the individual angles weighted by the variance of the pixel intensities of each patch.

=== Columns, lines and words finding ===

In this operation, the de-skewed document is intuitively segmented into a hierarchy of columns, lines and words. The sensitivity to illumination and page coloration of the de-skewed document can be removed by applying a [[Sobel operator]] to the de-skewed image and thresholding the output to obtain the binary gradient, de-skewed image.&lt;ref name="MyRef6"&gt;{{cite journal | last=M.J. | first=Taylor|author2=J. Lee
| title =  Interactive text segmentation of greyscale images of documents | journal = Technical Report EPC, Rank Xerox Research Centre
| year= 1997 | volume=104 | issue=Document Recognition II | pages=302–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 3.

The operation can be roughly separated into 3 steps : column segmentation, line segmentation and word segmentation.

# Columns are easily segmented from the binary [[gradient]], de-skewed images by summing pixels vertically as shown in Figure 4.
# Baselines of each row are segmented in the same way as the column segmentation process but horizontally.
# Finally, individual words are segmented by applying the vertical process at each segmented row.

These segmentations are important because the document mosaic will be created by matching the lower right corners of words in overlapping images pair. Moreover, the segmentation operation can organize the list of images in the context of a hierarchy of rows and column reliably.

The segmentation operation involves a considerable amount of summing in the binary [[gradient]], de-skewed images, which done by construct a matrix of partial sums&lt;ref name="MyRef7"&gt;{{cite book | last= F.P.| first=Preparata|author2=M.I. Shamos

&lt;math&gt;p_{iy}=\sum_{u=1}^{i}\sum_{v=1}^{j}b_{uv}&lt;/math&gt;
 
The matrix of partial sums is calculated in one pass through the binary [[gradient]], de-skewed image.&lt;ref name="MyRef7" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{u=u_{1}}^{u_{2}}\sum_{v=v_{1}}^{v_{2}}b_{uv}=p_{u_{2}v_{2}}+p_{u_{1}v_{1}}-p_{u_{1}v_{2}}-p_{u_{2}v_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Correspondences establishing ==
The two images are now organized in hierarchy of linked lists in following structure :
* image   = list of columns
* row       = list of words
* column = list of row
* word     = length (in pixels)

At the bottom of the structure, the length of each word is recorded for establishing correspondence between two images in order to reduce to search only the corresponding structures for the groups of words with the matching lengths.

=== Seed match finding ===

A seed match finding is done by comparing each row in image1 with each row in image2. The two rows are then compared to each other by every word. If the length (in pixel) of the two words (one from image1 and one from image2) and their immediate neighbours agree with each other within a predefined tolerance threshold (5 pixels, for example), then they are assumed to be matched. The row of each image is assumed to be matched if there are three or more word matches between the two rows. The seed match finding operation is terminated when two pairs of consecutive row match are found.

=== Match list building ===

After finishing a seed match finding operation, the next process is to build the match list to generate the correspondences points of the two images. The process is done by searching the matching pairs of rows away from the seed row.

== Images mosaicing ==
[[File:Mosaicing.png|thumb|'''Figure 5''' : Mosaicing of two document images. Blurring is evident in the affine mosaic (b), but not in the mosaic constructed using a plane-to-plane projectivity (a). Close-ups of typical seams of (a) and (b) are shown in (c) and (d) respectively.&lt;ref name="MyRef2" /&gt;]]

Given the list of corresponding points of the two images, finding the transformation of the overlapping portion of the images is next process to be performed. Assuming a [[pinhole camera]] model, the transformation between pixels (u,v) of image 1 and pixels (u0, v0) of image 2 is demonstrated by a plane-to-plane projectivity.&lt;ref name="MyRef8"&gt;{{cite book | last=J.L. | first=Mundy|author2=A.

The projectivity is fine-tuned using correlation at the corners of the overlapping portion in order to obtain four correspondences to sub-pixel accuracy. Therefore, image1 is then transformed into image2’s coordinate system using Eq.1. The typical result of the process is shown in Figure 5.

=== Many images coping ===

Finally, the whole page composition is built up by mapping all the images into the coordinate system of an “anchor” image, which is normally the one nearest the page center. The transformations to the anchor frame are calculated by concatenating the pair-wise transformations which found earlier. The raw document mosaic is shown in Figure 6.

However, there might be a problem of non-consecutive images that are overlap. This problem can be solved by performing Hierarchical sub-mosaics. As shown in Figure 7, image1 and image2 are registered, as are image3 and image4, creating two sub-mosaics. These two sub-mosaics are later stitched together in another mosaicing process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28217">'''Domestic terrorism''' or '''homegrown terrorism''' is [[terrorism]] targeting victims "within a country by a perpetrator with the same citizenship" as the victims.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Gary M. Jackson, ''Predicting Malicious Behavior: Tools and Techniques for Ensuring Global Security'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many [[definitions of terrorism]], and no universally  accepted definition. The [[United States Department of State]] defined terrorism in 2003 as "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience."&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

==Definition==
While there are many potential definitions of domestic terrorism, it is largely defined as terrorism in which the perpetrator targets his/her own country. Enders &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Enders, Walter, Todd Sandler, and Khusrav Gaibulloev| title=Domestic versus transnational terrorism: Data, decomposition, and dynamics.|journal=Journal of Peace Research|edition=3|year=2011|pages=319–337|volume=48|doi=10.1177/0022343311398926}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines domestic terrorism as “homegrown in which the venue, target, and perpetrators are all from the same country. The term “homegrown terrorism” stems from [[Jihadism|jihadi]] terrorism against [[Western world|Westerners]]. Wilner and Dobouloz described homegrown terrorism as "autonomously organized radicalized Westerners with little direct assistance from transnational networks, usually organized within the home or host country, and targets fellow nationals." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Wilner, Alex S., and Claire-Jehanne Dubouloz. "Homegrown terrorism and transformative learning: an interdisciplinary approach to understanding radicalization." Global Change, Peace &amp; Security 22.1 (2010): 33-51.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Congressional Research Service]] report, ''American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat,'' describes homegrown terrorism as a “terrorist activity or plots perpetuated within the United States or abroad by American citizens, permanent legal residents, or visitors radicalized largely within the United States.”&lt;ref name="Bjelopera"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/R41416.pdf |title=p. 1. - Jerome P. Bjelopera and Mark A. Randol, '&amp;#39;American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat,'&amp;#39; (Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, December 7, 2010) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 2001 [[USA Patriot Act]], domestic terrorism is defined as "activities that (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any state; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S."

==Facts &amp; Studies==
Homegrown terrorism is not new to the world. Security analysts have argued that after the end of the [[Cold War]], military conflicts have increasingly involved [[violent non-state actors]] carrying out [[asymmetric warfare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2011/08/29/non-state-conflict-and-the-transformation-of-war/|title=Non-State Conflict and the Transformation of War|work=E-International Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which terror attacks are one part.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/nic/nonstate_actors_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has uncovered a number of alleged terrorist plots that have been successfully suppressed through domestic intelligence and law enforcement. The United States has begun to account for the threat of homegrown terrorism, as shown by increased volume of literature on the subject in recent years and increased number of terrorist websites since [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the leader of al-Qaeda in [[Iraq]], began posting beheading videos in 2003.  A July 2009 document by the [[FBI]] estimated that there were roughly 15,000 websites and web forums that support terrorist activities, with around 10,000 of them actively maintained.  80% of these sites are on U.S.-based servers.&lt;ref name="J Ryan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/suspected-american-terrorists-islamic-ties-causing-concern-law/story?id=11230885&amp;page=1 |title=Jason Ryan, Pierre Thomas, and Xorje Olivares, "American-bred Terrorism Causing Alarm for Law Enforcement," ABC News.com July 22, 2010 |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Congressional Research Service’s study, ''American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat,'' between May 2009 and November 2010, law enforcement made arrests related to 22 homegrown jihadist-inspired terror plots by American citizens or legal residents of the U.S.  This is a significant increase over the 21 plots caught in the seven interim years after the [[September 11 attacks]]. During these seven years, two plots resulted in attacks, compared to the two attacks between May 2009 and November 2010, which resulted in 14 deaths.  This spike post-May 2009 shows that some Americans are susceptible to ideologies that support a violent form of jihad.&lt;ref name="Bjelopera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/terrorism/threat-homegrown-islamist-terrorism/p11509#p4 |title=Toni Johnson, "Threat of Homegrown Islamist Terrorism," Council on Foreign Relations, December 10, 2010 |publisher=Cfr.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly one-quarter of these plots have been linked to major international terrorist groups but an increasing number of Americans are holding high-level operational roles in these terrorist groups, especially [[al-Qaeda]] and its affiliated groups.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bipartisan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/NSPG%20Final%20Threat%20Assessment.pdf |title=Peter Bergen and Bruce Hoffman, "Assessing the Terrorist Threat," Bipartisan Policy Center, September 10, 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;[https://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/2010/RAND_OP292.pdf Brian Michael Jenkins, "Terrorist Radicalization in the United States Since September 11, 2001," RAND Corporation, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] called homegrown terrorism the more serious threat faced by American citizens today.&lt;ref name="Hayden"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yager |first=Jordy |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/110759-former-intel-chief-homegrown-terrorism-is-a-devil-of-a-problem |title=Jordy Yager, "Former intel chief: Homegrown terrorism is a ‘devil of a problem,’" '&amp;#39;The Hill'&amp;#39;, July 25, 2010 |publisher=Thehill.com |date=2010-07-25 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK, likewise, considers homegrown terrorism to be a considerable threat.  On June 6, 2011, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] announced a wide-ranging strategy to prevent British citizens from being radicalized into becoming terrorists while at university.  The strategy is intended to prevent extremist speakers or groups from coming to universities.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/uk/cameron-plans-to-crack-down-on-home-grown-terrorism-1.817900 |title=Brendan Carlin and Abul Taher, "Cameron plans to crack down on home-grown terrorism," gulfnews.com, June 6, 2011 |publisher=Gulfnews.com |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lone Wolf ===
Domestic terrorism is often linked to "lone wolf" terrorism. Sociologist Ramón Spaaij defines lone wolf terrorism as an act of terrorism committed by one person who "acts on his or her own without orders from—or even connections to an organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spaaij|first=Ramón|date=2010|title=The enigma of lone wolf terrorism: An assessment.|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2010.501426|journal=Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism|volume=33|issue=9|pages=854–870.|doi=10.1080/1057610X.2010.501426}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 20th to early 21st century lone wolf terrorism in the United States has been primarily associated with white supremacy, Islamic fundamentalism, anti-social, and anti-government extremists in the United States such as [[Charles Whitman]], [[Timothy McVeigh|Tim McVeigh]], [[Dylann Roof]], [[Ted Kaczynski]], [[Eric Rudolph]], [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris]], [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold#Dylan Klebold|Dylan Klebold]], [[James Holmes (mass murderer)|James Holmes]], [[Omar Mateen]], and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev|Tamerlan]] and [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]]. Many lone wolves share a common trait in that they seek acceptance from other groups but are typically met with rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Springer|first=Nathan R.|date=2009|title=Patterns of radicalization: Identifying the markers and warning signs of domestic lone wolf terrorists in our midst.|url=http://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/4340|journal=Naval Postgraduate School (thesis)|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2007 book ''Hunting the American Terrorist'' former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Terry Turchie and former FBI special agent Kathleen Puckett described six criteria to define a lone wolf:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hunting_the_American_Terrorist.html?id=vXl1AAAACAAJ|title=Hunting the American Terrorist: The FBI's War on Homegrown Terror|last=Turchie|first=Terry D.|last2=Puckett|first2=Kathleen M.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=History Publishing Company|isbn=9781933909349|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The act of terrorism was organized by few or only one person that was not operating with an organized group
# The individual is willing to use lethal violence to achieve their goal
# Their primary goal is ideological, political, or religious in scope
# The individual is willing to accept that [[collateral damage]] may occur
# The individual is not intending to commit suicide, unless the situation calls for it
# The individual is intending to commit homicide in order to get their message public

== Radicalization ==
There is no one path toward violence.  Homegrown terrorists have been high school dropouts, college graduates, members of the military, and cover the range of financial situations. Recent research by Matt Qvortrup in the British ''Journal of Politics and International Relations'' has suggested that domestic terrorism is a result of lack of opportunities for meaningful political engagement. Some domestic terrorists studied overseas and were exposed to radical Islamist thought, while others took their inspiration from the [[internet]].&lt;ref name="Congressional Panel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110310/NEWS08/110310022/2067/Saudi-police-open-fire-during-protest/Congressional-panel-homegrown-terrorism-divided-discussion-?odyssey=mod_sectionstories|title=Associated Press, "Congressional Panel on Homegrown Terrorism Divided on Discussion," March 10, 2011|date=|publisher=Tennessean.com|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marc Sageman]] writes in his book, ''Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century'' that, contrary to popular belief, radicalization into terrorism is not the product of poverty, various forms of brainwashing, youth, ignorance, lack of education, lack of employment, lack of social responsibility, criminality, or mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Sageman, ''Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century,'' (Philadelphia, PA: University Of Pennsylvania Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He says that intermediaries and English-speaking imams, such as the late Yemeni-American cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] (d. 2011), who are often found through the internet on forums, provide key roles in the [[radicalization]] process.  Social networks provided in forums support and build upon an individual’s radical beliefs.  Prison systems are also a concern as a place of radicalization and jihadist recruiting; nearly three dozen ex-convicts who attended training camps in Yemen were believed to have been radicalized in prison.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;  The only constant appears to be "a newfound hatred for their native or adopted country, a degree of dangerous malleability, and a religious fervor justifying or legitimizing violence that impels these very impressionable and perhaps easily influenced individuals toward potentially lethal acts of violence," according to Peter Bergen and Bruce Hoffman's September 2010 paper for the Bipartisan Policy Center.&lt;ref name="Bipartisan" /&gt;

==Training==
Training for potential homegrown terrorists is often very fast paced, or rushed, as some groups under attack by U.S. forces may feel the need to implement operations “more precipitously than they might otherwise occur,” according to [[Bruce Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Hoffman, Bruce. "Rethinking terrorism and counterterrorism since 9/11." Studies in Conflict and Terrorism 25.5 (2002): 303-316.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the case with the failed [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt|Times Square plot]] carried out by [[Faisal Shazad]]. [[Pakistani Taliban]] (TPP) was on record as providing financing and four months of training for Shazad directly prior to his actions in Times Square. Shazad reportedly received only three to five days of training in bomb-making.

Some individuals go abroad to a region containing extremism, predominantly Pakistan, but also Iraq, Afghanistan,Yemen or Somalia.  In the case of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London Underground bombers]], [[Mohammad Sidique Khan]], the operational leader of the cell, received military and explosives training at a camp in [[Malakand District|Malakand]], [[Pakistan]] in July 2003. Later he took [[Shezad Tanweer]] to Karachi, Pakistan, in late 2004 to February 2005 where they crossed the border to receive training at al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homelandsecurity.org/hsireports/Reasons_for_Terrorist_Success_Failure.pdf p. 33 - Edward McCleskey, Diana McCord, and Jennifer Leetz, “Underlying Reasons for the Success and Failure of Terrorist Attacks.” (Arlington, VA: Homeland Security Institute, June 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719234840/http://www.homelandsecurity.org/hsireports/Reasons_for_Terrorist_Success_Failure.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training and usage of recruits is varied.  Some, such as Shahzad, received little training and ultimately failed in their goals. Others, like the sleeper agent [[David Headley]]’s reconnaissance efforts, were essential towards [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]]’s (LeT) success in the November [[2008 Mumbai attacks]].

Scholars say that some lone wolves may achieve objectives, but the vast majority of individual operators fail to execute their plans because of lack of training and planning. There is also a question as to whether such individuals are radical, or suffering other problems. The American convert, Abdulhakim Muhammad (née Carlos Bledsoe), who [[2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting|killed a U.S. military recruiter]] in Little Rock, Arkansas, and wounded another, had many other targets and plans, which went awry. It was not until some time after his arrest that he first claimed to have been working for [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP). But, investigators found no evidence of this. The lead county prosecutor said that, aside from Muhammad's self-serving statements, it was "just an awful killing", like others he had seen.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dao |first=James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/us/17convert.html |title=A Muslim Son, a Murder Trial and Many Questions |location=Arkansas;Yemen |publisher=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bledsoe's father described his son as "unable to process reality."&lt;ref name=nytterror&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp|title=Man Claims Terror Ties in Little Rock Shooting|last=Dao|first=James|date=January 21, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100125152356/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp| archivedate= 25 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with capital murder and related charges, not terrorism, and pleaded guilty.

The American [[Nidal Hasan]], the US Army major and psychiatrist charged in the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]], had come to the attention of colleagues and superiors years before the shootings; they documented their concerns about his mental state. The Department of Defense has classified the event as "workplace violence" rather than terrorism, pending Hasan's court martial. Some observers believe that his personal characteristics are more like those of other [[mass murder]]ers than terrorists; he did not belong to any group.

The Somalian [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabab]] (“the youth”) have recruited strongly in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota.  The 30+ Somali-Americans received training by senior al-Qaeda leaders in [[Somalia]].  Hoffman believes this indicates that radicalization and recruitment is not an isolated, lone-wolf phenomenon unique to Somali-Americans, but that there is terrorist recruitment infrastructure in the United States.&lt;ref name="Hoffmantestimony"&gt;[http://www.homelandsecurity.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20100526101502-95237.pdf Hoffman, Bruce, “Internet Terror Recruitment And Tradecraft: How Can We Address An Evolving Tool While Protecting Free Speech?,”  House Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment, May 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a dozen of 20 American recruits were killed in fighting in Somalia, the number of Americans going to join Al-Shabab has declined since 2007-2008.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmitt |first=Eric |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/nyregion/07shabaab.html?src=mv |title=Al Shabab Recruits Americans for Somali Civil War |publisher= The New York Times |date= June 6, 2010|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the internet==
“The Internet is a driver and enabler for the process of radicalization”, says a report of the Police Department of the City of New York of 2007.&lt;ref name=NYP,2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/files/NYPD_Report-Radicalization_in_the_West.pdf |title="Radicalization in the West: The Homegrown Threat." (New York Police Department, 2007) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=23 November 2014}} (pages 8-9)&lt;/ref&gt; The internet has a wide appeal as it provides an anonymous way for like-minded, conflicted individuals to meet, form virtual relations, and discuss the radical and extremist ideology they encounter.  The virtual network created in message boards or private forums further radicalizes and cements the jihadi-Salafi/racial supremacist message individuals have encountered as they build a community.
The internet acts as an enabler, providing the aspiring jihadist/supremacist with a forum in which they may plan, share information on targets, weapons, and recruit others into their plans.  Much of the resources needed to make weapons can be found on-line.&lt;ref name=NYP,2007/&gt;

===''Inspire''===
''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'' is an online English-language propaganda magazine published by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).  Purported to be created by Samir Khan, a U.S. citizen and cyber-jihadist, the magazine uses American idioms and phrasing and does not appear to have British or South Asian influences in its language.&lt;ref name="stratfor"&gt;{{cite web|author=Security Weekly |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100721_fanning_flames_jihad |title=Scott Stewart, "Fanning the Flames of Jihad." STRATFOR (July 22, 2010) |publisher=Stratfor.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine contains messages calling for western jihadists, like this one from AQAP leader Nasir al-Wahayshi, "to acquire weapons and learn methods of war. They are living in a place where they can cause great harm to the enemy and where they can support the Messenger of Allah... The means of harming them are many so seek assistance from Allah and do not be weak and you will find a way.”&lt;ref name="stratfor" /&gt;

STRATFOR suggests that the magazine is meant to "fan the flames of Jihad."&lt;ref name="stratfor" /&gt;

{{Thermoreg}}
An '''endotherm''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔνδον ''endon'' "within" and θέρμη ''thermē'' "heat") is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, largely by  the use of heat set free by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal's routine [[metabolism]], but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as [[shivering]], and [[Uncoupling protein|uncoupled]] oxidative metabolism such as within [[brown adipose tissue]].
Only [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s are extant universally endothermic groups of animals.  Certain [[Fish#Homeothermy|lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes]] are also endothermic.

In common parlance, endotherms are characterized as "[[warm-blooded]]". The opposite of endothermy is [[ectothermy]], although in general, there is no absolute or clear separation between the nature of endotherms and ectotherms.

==Mechanisms==

===Generating and conserving heat===
[[File:Homeothermy-poikilothermy.png|thumb|right|Sustained energy output of an endothermic animal ([[mammal]]) and an ectothermic animal ([[reptile]]) as a function of core temperature]]
[[File:Thermal Regulation Graph.svg|thumb|This image shows the difference between endotherms and ectotherms. The mouse is endothermic and regulates its body temperature through homeostasis. The lizard is ectothermic and its body temperature is dependent on the environment.]]
Many endotherms have a larger number of [[mitochondria]] per [[cell (biology)|cell]] than ectotherms. This enables them to generate heat by increasing the rate at which they metabolize [[fat]]s and [[sugar]]s. Accordingly, to sustain their higher metabolism, endothermic animals typically require several times as much food as ectothermic animals do, and usually require a more sustained supply of metabolic fuel.

In many endothermic animals, a controlled temporary state of [[hypothermia]] conserves energy by permitting the body temperature to drop nearly to ambient levels. Such states may be brief, regular [[Circadian rhythm|circadian cycles]] called [[torpor]], or they might occur in much longer, even seasonal, cycles called [[hibernation]]. The body temperatures of many small birds (e.g. [[hummingbird]]s) and small mammals (e.g. [[tenrec]]s) fall dramatically during daily inactivity, such as nightly in [[diurnality|diurnal]] animals or during the day in [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] animals, thus reducing the energy cost of maintaining body temperature. Less drastic intermittent reduction in body temperature also occurs in other, larger endotherms; for example human metabolism also slows down during sleep, causing a drop in core temperature, commonly of the order of 1 degree Celsius. There may be other variations in temperature, usually smaller, either endogenous or in response to external circumstances or vigorous exertion, and either an increase or a drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Refinetti | first1 = Roberto | year = 2010 | title = The circadian rhythm of body temperature | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/44906363/The-Circadian-Rhythm-of-Body-Temperature | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 564–594 | doi=10.2741/3634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resting human body generates about two-thirds of its heat through metabolism in internal organs in the thorax and abdomen, as well as in the brain. The brain generates about 16% of the total heat produced by the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Heat Transport|url = http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/H/HeatTransport.html|website = users.rcn.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat loss is a major threat to smaller creatures, as they have a larger ratio of [[Surface-area-to-volume ratio|surface area to volume]]. Small warm-blooded animals have [[thermal insulation|insulation]] in the form of [[fur]] or [[feather]]s. Aquatic warm-blooded animals, such as [[pinniped|seals]], generally have deep layers of [[blubber]] under the [[skin]] and any [[Fur|pelage]] that they might have; both contribute to their insulation. [[Penguin]]s have both feathers and blubber. Penguin feathers are scale-like and serve both for insulation and for streamlining. Endotherms that live in very cold circumstances or conditions predisposing to heat loss, such as polar waters, tend to have [[rete mirabile|specialised structures of blood vessels in their extremities]] that act as [[heat exchanger]]s. The veins are adjacent to the arteries full of warm blood. Some of the arterial heat is conducted to the cold blood and recycled back into the trunk. Birds, especially [[wader]]s, often have very well-developed [[rete mirabile|heat exchange mechanisms]] in their legs&amp;mdash;those in the legs of [[emperor penguin]]s are part of the adaptations that enable them to spend months on Antarctic winter ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = D.B. | last2 = Fordyce | first2 = R.E. | year = 2008 | title = The heterothermic loophole exploited by penguins | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Zoology | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 317–321 | doi = 10.1071/ZO07053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, D.B., D.T. Ksepka and R.E. Fordyce. 2010. Penguin heat-retention structures evolved in a greenhouse Earth. Biology Letters (published online before print December 22, 2010, {{DOI|10.1098/rsbl.2010.0993)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to cold many warm-blooded animals also reduce blood flow to the skin by [[vasoconstriction]] to reduce heat loss. As a result, they blanch (become paler).

===Avoiding overheating===
In [[Tropical rainforest climate|equatorial climates]] and during [[temperate climate|temperate]] summers, overheating ([[hyperthermia]]) is as great a threat as cold. In hot conditions, many warm-blooded animals increase heat loss by panting, which cools the animal by increasing water [[evaporation]] in the breath, and/or flushing, increasing the blood flow to the skin so the heat will [[radiant energy|radiate]] into the environment. Hairless and short-haired mammals, including humans, also [[Perspiration|sweat]], since the evaporation of the water in sweat removes heat. Elephants keep cool by using their huge [[ear]]s like [[radiator]]s in automobiles. Their ears are thin and the [[blood vessel]]s are close to the skin, and flapping their ears to increase the airflow over them causes the blood to cool, which reduces their core body temperature when the blood moves through the rest of the circulatory system.

==Pros and cons of an endothermic metabolism==
The major advantage of endothermy over ectothermy is decreased vulnerability to fluctuations in external temperature. Regardless of location (and hence external temperature), endothermy maintains a constant core temperature for optimum enzyme activity.

Endotherms control body temperature by internal homeostatic mechanisms. In mammals, two separate homeostatic mechanisms are involved in thermoregulation—one mechanism increases body temperature, while the other decreases it. The presence of two separate mechanisms provides a very high degree of control. This is important because the core temperature of mammals can be controlled to be as close as possible to the optimum temperature for enzyme activity.

The overall rate of an animal's [[metabolism]] increases by a factor of about two for every {{convert|10|C-change|F-change|0|abbr=on}} rise in [[temperature]], limited by the need to avoid [[hyperthermia]]. Endothermy does not provide greater speed in movement than ectothermy (cold-bloodedness)—ectothermic animals can move as fast as warm-blooded animals of the same size and build when the ectotherm is near or at its optimum temperature, but often cannot maintain high metabolic activity for as long as endotherms. Endothermic/homeothermic animals can be optimally active at more times during the diurnal cycle in places of sharp temperature variations between day and night and during more of the year in places of great [[season]]al differences of temperature. This is accompanied by the need to expend more energy to maintain the constant internal temperature and a greater food requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=N. A. |last2=Reece |first2=J. B. |year=2002 |title=Biology |edition=6th |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings |page=845 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Endothermy may be important during reproduction, for example, in expanding the thermal range over which a species can reproduce, as embryos are generally intolerant of thermal fluctuations that are easily tolerated by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Parental Care: The Key to Understanding Endothermy and Other Convergent Features in Birds and Mammals.|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/303323|journal = The American Naturalist|date = 2000-03-01|issn = 0003-0147|pages = 326–334|volume = 155|issue = 3|doi = 10.1086/303323|first = C.

G.|last = Farmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endothermy may also provide a protection against [[fungal]] infection. While tens of thousands of fungal species infect insects, only a few hundred target mammals, and often only those with a compromised [[immune system]]. A recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Robert, Vincent A. and [[Arturo Casadevall|Casadevall, Arturo]] |

suggests fungi are fundamentally ill-equipped to thrive at mammalian temperatures. The high temperatures afforded by endothermy might have provided an evolutionary advantage.

[[Ectotherms]] will increase their body temperature mostly through external heat sources such as [[sunlight]] energy, therefore they depend on the occurring environmental conditions to reach operational body temperatures. Endothermic animals mostly use internal heat production through metabolic active organs and tissues (liver, kidney, heart, brain, muscle) or specialized heat producing tissues like [[brown adipose tissue]] (BAT). In general, endotherms therefore have higher metabolic rates than ectotherms at a given body mass. As a consequence they would also need higher food intake rates, which may limit abundance of endotherms more than ectotherms.

Because ectotherms depend on environmental conditions for body temperature regulation, they typically are more sluggish at night and in the morning when they emerge from their shelters to heat up in the first sunlight. Foraging activity is therefore restricted to the day time (diurnal activity patterns) in most vertebrate ectotherms. In lizards, for instance, only a few species are known to be nocturnal (e.g. many geckos) and they mostly use 'sit and wait' foraging strategies that may not require body temperatures as high as those necessary for active foraging. Endothermic vertebrate species are therefore less dependent on the environmental conditions and have developed a high variability (both within and between species) in their diurnal activity patterns.&lt;ref name =Hut&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hut RA, Kronfeld-Schor N, van der Vinne V, De la Iglesia H |title=In search of a temporal niche: environmental factors|journal=Progress in Brain Research|year=2012|volume=199|pages=281–304|pmid=22877672|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-59427-3.00017-4|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444594273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the evolution of endothermia was crucial in the development of [[Eutheria|eutherian]] mammalian species diversity in the Mesozoic period. Endothermia gave the early mammals the capacity to be active during night time while maintaining small body sizes. Adaptations in [[photoreception]] and the loss of UV protection characterizing modern eutherian mammals are understood as adaptations for an originally nocturnal lifestyle, suggesting that the group went through an evolutionary bottle neck (the [[Nocturnal bottleneck|nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis]]). This could have avoided predator pressure from diurnal reptiles and dinosaurs, although some predatory dinosaurs, being equally endothermic, might have adopted a nocturnal live style in order to prey on those mammals.&lt;ref name=Hut/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1098/rspb.2013.0508| volume = 280| issue = 1765| pages = 20130508| last1 = Gerkema| first1 = Menno P.| last2 = Davies| first2 = Wayne I.

Many [[insect]] species are able to maintain a thoracic temperature above the ambient temperature using exercise.

== Regional endothermy ==
Some [[ectotherm]]s, including several species of [[fish]] and [[reptile]]s, have been shown to make use of regional endothermy, where muscle activity causes certain parts of the body to remain at higher temperatures than the rest of the body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Physiology of Animals|last=Willmer|first=Pat|last2=Stone|first2=Graham|last3=Johnston|first3=Ian|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=9781405107242|location=|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for better locomotion and use of the senses in cold environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Contrast between thermodynamic and biological terminology==
Because of historical accident,{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} students encounter a source of possible confusion between the terminology of physics and biology. Whereas the '''thermodynamic''' terms "[[exothermic]]" and "[[endothermic]]" respectively refer to processes that give out heat energy and processes that absorb heat energy, in '''biology''' the sense is effectively inverted. The [[Metabolism|metabolic]] terms "ectotherm" and "endotherm" respectively refer to organisms that rely largely on external heat to achieve a full working temperature, and to organisms that produce heat from within as a major factor in controlling their body temperatures.

The '''Girl of the Uchter Moor''' also known as '''Moora''' is the name given to the female [[Iron Age]] [[bog body]] remains, discovered in 2000 in the marshland near [[Uchte]], [[Germany]]. The remains include [[vertebrae]], hair and skull pieces. The studies of the body began in 2005. The [[radiocarbon dating]] performed at the [[University of Kiel]] showed that Moora had died between 764 and 515 B.C. Despite common Iron Age burial practices,&lt;ref name="The Local"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20110121-32579.html |title=Scientists model ancient bog woman's face |publisher=The Local |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=24 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124013251/http://www.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20110121-32579.html |archivedate=24 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the body was not [[cremated]]. All of the body parts are estimated to have been found except for one [[scapula]].&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1623939,00.html|title=Ancient 'Bog Body' Unearthed in Germany |publisher =All Voices|date=24 January 2011|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before [[DNA]] analysis and [[Radiocarbon Dating]], the body was initially believed to be that of a sixteen-year-old girl, Elke Kerll, who had disappeared in 1969 after going to a dance club.&lt;ref name="The Local"/&gt;&lt;ref name="All Voices"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/7980350-identify-the-remains-of-iron-age-woman|title=Identify the remains of Iron Age woman|publisher=All Voices|date=24 January 2011|accessdate=24 January 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Moora was determined to be between 17 and 19 years old at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="The Local"/&gt; She was [[left-handed]].&lt;ref name="All Voices"/&gt; It is thought that Moora experienced intense physical labour and likely repeatedly carried heavy loads, like water jugs, while roaming through the marshland.&lt;ref name="The Local"/&gt; According to Saring Dennis from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Moora sustained at least two partial skull fractures that gradually healed themselves.&lt;ref name="All Voices"/&gt; Moora also suffered long periods of sickness associated with the hardships of long winters.&lt;ref name="All Voices"/&gt; The bone growth lines showed that during her childhood and adolescence, Moora suffered from chronic [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name="All Voices"/&gt; Moora was also diagnosed to have a [[benign tumor]] at the base of her skull, which led to the spine curvature and chronic inflammation in the leg bones.&lt;ref name="All Voices"/&gt; However Moora's cause of death is unknown. It was only determined that Moora was naked at the time she was deposited into the bog.&lt;ref name="The Local"/&gt;

==Facial reconstructions==
Moora's face has been reconstructed four times, two of which were digital. The two that were created in the traditional way  had been created by molding material over a plastic replica of the skull. The artist had to estimate the shape of the girl's lips, hair color and skin tones, similar to the process of the [[Yde Girl]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pictures: Ancient Bog Girl's Face Reconstructed|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/pictures/110202-ancient-bog-body-moora-girl-face-science-recreation/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital reconstructions were created by Ursela Wittwer-Backofen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of Moora|url=http://deutschland2013.weebly.com/moora.html|publisher=Weebly.com|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6422">{{Evolutionary algorithms}}
'''Grammatical evolution''' is a relatively new [[evolutionary computation]] technique pioneered by Conor Ryan, JJ Collins and Michael O'Neill in 1998&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~wbl/biblio/gp-html/ryan_1998_geepal.html&lt;/ref&gt; at the [http://bds.ul.ie BDS Group] in the [[University of Limerick]].

It is related to the idea of [[genetic programming]] in that the objective is to find an executable program or program fragment, that will achieve a good fitness value for the given [[objective function]]. In most published work on Genetic Programming, a [[LISP]]-style tree-structured expression is directly manipulated, whereas Grammatical Evolution applies [[genetic operator]]s to an integer string, subsequently mapped to a program (or similar) through the use of a grammar. One of the benefits of GE is that this mapping simplifies the application of search to different programming languages and other structures.

== Problem addressed ==

In type-free, conventional [[John Koza|Koza]]-style GP, the function set must meet the requirement of closure: all functions must be capable of accepting as their arguments the output of all other functions in the function set.  Usually, this is implemented by dealing with a single data-type such as double-precision floating point. While modern Genetic Programming frameworks support typing, such type-systems have limitations that Grammatical Evolution does not suffer from.

== GE's solution ==

GE offers a solution to this {{which|date=January 2015}} issue by evolving solutions according to a user-specified grammar (usually a grammar in [[Backus-Naur form]]). Therefore the search space can be restricted, and domain knowledge of the problem can be incorporated. The inspiration for this approach comes from a desire to separate the "genotype" from the "phenotype": in GP, the objects the search algorithm operates on and what the fitness evaluation function interprets are one and the same. In contrast, GE's "genotypes" are ordered lists of integers which code for selecting rules from the provided context-free grammar. The phenotype, however, is the same as in Koza-style GP: a tree-like structure that is evaluated recursively. This model is more in line with how genetics work in nature, where there is a separation between an organism's genotype and the final expression of phenotype in proteins, etc.

GE has a modular approach to it. In particular, the search portion of the GE paradigm needn't be carried out by any one particular algorithm or method. Observe that the objects GE performs search on are the same as that used in [[genetic algorithms]]. This means, in principle, that any existing genetic algorithm package, such as the popular [http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/ GAlib], can be used to carry out the search, and a developer implementing a GE system need only worry about carrying out the mapping from list of integers to program tree. It is also in principle possible to perform the search using some other method, such as [[particle swarm optimization]] (see the remark below); the modular nature of GE creates many opportunities for hybrids as the problem of interest to be solved dictates.

Brabazon and O'Neill have successfully applied GE to predicting corporate bankruptcy, forecasting stock indices, [[bond credit rating]]s, and other financial applications.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} GE has also been used with a classic [[predator-prey model]] to explore the impact of parameters such as predator efficiency, niche number, and random mutations on [[ecological stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alfonseca|first1=Manuel|last2=Soler Gil|first2=Francisco José|title=Evolving a predator-prey ecosystem of mathematical expressions with grammatical evolution|journal=Complexity|date=2 January 2015|volume=20|issue=3|pages=66–83|doi=10.1002/cplx.21507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to structure a GE grammar that for a given function/terminal set is equivalent to genetic programming.

== Criticism ==

Despite its successes, GE has been the subject of some criticism. One issue is that as a result of its mapping operation, GE's genetic operators do not achieve high locality&lt;ref name="rothlauf:2006"&gt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/0125627h52766534/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/pubs/2010/3004/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is a highly regarded property of genetic operators in evolutionary algorithms.&lt;ref name="rothlauf:2006" /&gt;

== Variants ==

Although GE is fairly new, there are already enhanced versions and variants that have been worked out. GE researchers have experimented with using [[particle swarm optimization]] to carry out the searching instead of genetic algorithms with results comparable to that of normal GE; this is referred to as a "grammatical swarm"; using only the basic PSO model it has been found that PSO is probably equally capable of carrying out the search process in GE as simple genetic algorithms are. (Although PSO is normally a floating-point search paradigm, it can be discretized, e.g., by simply rounding each vector to the nearest integer, for use with GE.)

Yet another possible variation that has been experimented with in the literature is attempting to encode semantic information in the grammar in order to further bias the search process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8848">'''A high-risk pregnancy''' is one of greater risk to the mother or her fetus than an uncomplicated pregnancy. Pregnancy places additional physical and emotional stress on a woman’s body. Health problems that occur before a woman becomes pregnant or during pregnancy may also increase the likelihood for a high-risk pregnancy. The NICHD is one of many federal agencies working to improve pregnancy outcome, prevent high-risk pregnancy, and improve health outcomes for pregnant women who are at high risk. The NICHD supports and conducts research on the causes and optimal management of the high-risk pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/high-risk/Pages/default.aspx|title=High-Risk Pregnancy: Overview|website=www.nichd.nih.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-07}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors that put a pregnancy at risk ==

===High blood pressure===
Even though high blood pressure can be risky for mother and fetus, many women with high blood pressure have healthy pregnancies and healthy children. Uncontrolled high blood pressure, however, can lead to damage to the mother’s kidneys and increases the risk for low birth weight or preeclampsia.

===Polycystic ovary syndrome=== 
Polycystic (pronounced pah-lee-SIS-tik) ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder that can interfere with a woman's ability to get and stay pregnant. PCOS may result in higher rates of miscarriage (the spontaneous loss of the fetus before 20 weeks of pregnancy), gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and premature delivery.

===Diabetes===
It is important for women with diabetes to manage their blood sugar levels before getting pregnant. High blood sugar levels can cause birth defects during the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before women even know they are pregnant. Controlling blood sugar levels and taking a multivitamin with 40 micrograms of folic acid every day can help reduce this risk.

===Kidney disease===
Women with kidney disease often have difficulty getting pregnant, and any pregnancy is at significant risk for miscarriage. Pregnant women with kidney disease require additional treatments, changes in diet and medication, and frequent visits to their health care provider.4
Autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases include conditions such as lupus and multiple sclerosis. Some autoimmune diseases can increase a women's risk for problems during pregnancy. For example, lupus can increase the risk for preterm birth and stillbirth. Some women may find that their symptoms improve during pregnancy, while others experience flare ups and other challenges. Certain medications to treat autoimmune diseases may be harmful to the fetus as well.5
Thyroid disease. Uncontrolled thyroid disease, such as an overactive or underactive thyroid (small gland in the neck that makes hormones that regulate the heart rate and blood pressure) can cause problems for the fetus, such as heart failure, poor weight gain, and birth defects.
Infertility. Several studies have found that women who take drugs that increase the chances of pregnancy are significantly more likely to have pregnancy complications than those who get pregnant without assistance. These complications often involve the placenta (the organ linking the fetus and the mother) and vaginal bleeding.

===Obesity=== 
Obesity can make a pregnancy more difficult, increasing a woman’s chance of developing diabetes during pregnancy, which can contribute to difficult births. On the other hand, some women weigh too little for their own health and the health of their growing fetus. In 2009, the Institute of Medicine updated its recommendations on how much weight to gain during pregnancy.9 New recommendations issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggest that overweight and obese women may be able to gain even less than what is recommended and still have a healthy infant.10
HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS damages cells of the immune system, making it difficult to fight infections and certain cancers. Women can pass the virus to their fetus during pregnancy; transmission also can occur during labor and giving birth or through breastfeeding. Fortunately, effective treatments exist to reduce the spread of HIV from the mother to her fetus, newborn, or infant. Women with very low viral loads may be able to have a vaginal delivery with a low risk of transmission. An option for pregnant women with higher viral loads (measurement of the amount of active HIV in the blood) is a caesarean delivery, which reduces the risk of passing HIV to the infant during labor and delivery. Early and regular prenatal care is important. Women who take medication to treat their HIV and have a cesarean delivery can reduce the risk of transmission to 2%.11&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/high-risk/conditioninfo/Pages/factors.aspx|title=What are the factors that put a pregnancy at risk?|website=www.nichd.nih.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-08}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===
[[Teenage pregnancy|Pregnant teens]] are more likely to develop high blood pressure and anemia (lack of healthy red blood cells), and go into labor earlier than women who are older. Teens also may be exposed to a sexually transmitted disease or infection that could affect their pregnancy. Teens may be less likely to get prenatal care or to make ongoing appointments with health care providers during the pregnancy to evaluate risks, ensure they are staying healthy, and understand what medications and drugs they can use.

===First-time pregnancy after age 35===
Older first-time mothers may have normal pregnancies, but research indicates that these women are at increased risk of having:
A cesarean (pronounced si-ZAIR-ee-uhn) delivery (when the newborn is delivered through a surgical incision in the mother’s abdomen)
Delivery complications, including excessive bleeding during labor
Prolonged labor (lasting more than 20 hours)
Labor that does not advance
An infant with a genetic disorder, such as Down syndrome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Lifestyle Factors==

===Alcohol use=== 
Alcohol consumed during pregnancy passes directly to the fetus through the umbilical cord. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that women avoid alcoholic beverages during pregnancy or when they are trying to get pregnant.15 During pregnancy, women who drink are more likely to have a miscarriage or stillbirth. Other risks to the fetus include a higher chance of having birth defects and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). FASD is the technical name for the group of fetal disorders that have been associated with drinking alcohol during pregnancy. It causes abnormal facial features, short stature and low body weight, hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disabilities, and vision or hearing problems.7 
===Cigarette smoking===
. Smoking during pregnancy puts the fetus at risk for preterm birth, certain birth defects, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Secondhand smoke also puts a woman and her developing fetus at increased risk for health problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Conditions of Pregnancy==
Multiple gestation. Pregnancy with twins, triplets, or more, referred to as a multiple gestation, increases the risk of infants being born prematurely (before 37 weeks of pregnancy). Having infants after age 30 and taking fertility drugs both have been associated with multiple births. Having three or more infants increases the chance that a woman will need to have the infants delivered by cesarean section. Twins and triplets are more likely to be smaller for their size than infants of singleton births. If infants of multiple gestation are born prematurely, they are more likely to have difficulty breathing.16
Gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes, also known as gestational diabetes mellitus, GDM, or diabetes during pregnancy, is diabetes that first develops when a woman is pregnant. Many women can have healthy pregnancies if they manage their diabetes, following a diet and treatment plan from their health care provider. Uncontrolled gestational diabetes increases the risk for preterm labor and delivery, preeclampsia, and high blood pressure.
Preeclampsia and eclampsia. Preeclampsia is a syndrome marked by a sudden increase in the blood pressure of a pregnant woman after the 20th week of pregnancy. It can affect the mother's kidneys, liver, and brain. When left untreated, the condition can be fatal for the mother and/or the fetus and result in long-term health problems. Eclampsia is a more severe form of preeclampsia, marked by seizures and coma in the mother.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Radionuclide Cerebral Blood Flow Scan.png|thumb|Radionuclide scan showing no intracranial blood flow. The hot nose sign is manifest.]]
The '''hot nose sign''' refers to increased [[perfusion]] in the nasal region on nuclear medicine cerebral perfusion studies in the setting of [[brain death]]. The absent or reduced flow in the [[Internal carotid artery|internal carotid arteries]] is thought to lead to increased flow within the [[External carotid artery|external carotid arteries]] and subsequent increased perfusion in the nasal region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Amy H.|date=2005-04-01|title=The hot nose sign|journal=Radiology|volume=235|issue=1|pages=216–217|doi=10.1148/radiol.2351030537|issn=0033-8419|pmid=15798171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2008, the [[DARPA|US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] provided a $4 million grant to the [[University of California, Irvine|University of California (Irvine)]], with the intent of providing a foundation for [[synthetic telepathy]]. According to DARPA, the project “will allow user-to-user communication on the battlefield without the use of vocalized speech through neural signals analysis. The brain generates word-specific signals prior to sending electrical impulses to the vocal cords. These '''''imagined speech''''' signals would be analyzed and translated into distinct words allowing covert person-to-person communication.”&lt;ref name="Bogue2010" /&gt;

DARPA's program outline has three major goals:&lt;ref name="Bogue2010" /&gt;
:* To attempt to identify EEG patterns unique to individual words
:* To ensure these patterns are common to different users to avoid extensive device training
:* To construct a [[prototype]] that would decode the signals and transmit them over a limited range

==Methods for detection==
The process for analyzing subjects' ''silent speech'' is composed of recording subjects’ [[Neural oscillation|brain waves]], and then using a computer to process the data and determine the content of the subjects' ''covert speech''.

===Recording===
Subject [[EEG#Waves|neural patterns]] (brain waves) can be recorded using [[Brain-computer_interface#Human_BCI_research|BCI devices]];&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010b" /&gt; currently, use of non-invasive devices,&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010a" /&gt; specifically the EEG, is of greater interest to researchers than [[Brain-computer_interface#Human_BCI_research|invasive and partially invasive types]]. This is because non-invasive types pose the least risk to subject health;&lt;ref name="Bogue2010" /&gt; EEG's have attracted the greatest interest because they offer the most user-friendly approach in addition to having far less complex [[instrumentation]] than that of [[FMRI|functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI’s)]],&lt;ref name="Bogue2010" /&gt; another commonly used non-invasive BCI.&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010b" /&gt;

===Processing===
The first step in processing non-invasive data is to remove [[EEG#Artifacts|artifacts]] such as eye movement and blinking, as well as other [[electromyographic]] activity.&lt;ref name="Porbadnigk2009" /&gt; After artifact-removal, a series of [[algorithm]]s is used to translate raw data into the '''''imagined speech''''' content.&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010a" /&gt; Processing is also intended to occur in real-time—the information is processed as it is recorded, which allows for near-simultaneous viewing of the content as the subject imagines it.

===Decoding===
Presumably, “thinking in the form of sound” recruits auditory and language areas whose activation profiles may be extracted from the EEG, given adequate processing. The goal is to relate these signals to a template that represents “what the person is thinking about”. This template could for instance be the acoustic envelope (energy) timeseries corresponding to sound if it were physically uttered. Such mapping from EEG to stimulus is an example of [[neural decoding]] techniques.

A major problem however is the many variations that the very same message can have under diverse physical conditions (speaker or noise, for example). Hence one can have the same EEG signal, but it is uncertain, at least in acoustic terms, what stimulus to map it to. This in turn makes it difficult to train the relevant decoder.

This process could instead be approached using higher-order (‘linguistic’) representations of the message. The mappings to such representations are non-linear and can be heavily context-dependent, therefore further research may be necessary. Nevertheless, it is known that an 'acoustic' strategy can still be maintained by pre-setting a “template” by making it known to the listener exactly what message to think about, even if passively, and in a non-explicit form. In these circumstances it is possible to partially decode the acoustic envelope of speech message from neural timeseries if the listener is induced to think in the form of sound&lt;ref name="CervantesConstantino_&amp;_Simon_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simon|first2=JZ|year=2018|title=Restoration and Efficiency of the Neural Processing of Continuous Speech Are Promoted by Prior Knowledge|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=56|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2018.00056 |last1=Cervantes Constantino|first1=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Challenges==
In detection of other imagined actions, such as imagined physical movements, greater brain activity occurs in one [[Hemisphere (brain)|hemisphere]] over the other. This presence of asymmetrical activity acts as a major aid in identifying the subject's imagined action. In '''''imagined speech''''' detection however, equal levels of activity commonly occur in both the [[Hemisphere (brain)|left and right hemispheres]] simultaneously. This lack of [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralization]] demonstrates a significant challenge in analyzing neural signals of this type.&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010b" /&gt;

Another unique challenge is a relatively low [[Signal-to-noise ratio|signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]] in the recorded data. A SNR represents the amount of meaningful signals found in a data set, compared to the amount of arbitrary or useless signals present in the same set. Artifacts present in EEG data are just one of many significant sources of noise.&lt;ref name="BrighamKumar2010a" /&gt;

To further complicate matters, the relative placement of EEG electrodes will vary amongst subjects. This is because the [[anatomical]] details of people's heads will differ; therefore, the signals recorded will vary in each subject, regardless of individuals-specific imagined speech characteristics.&lt;ref name="Porbadnigk2009" /&gt;

==Limitations for practical communication==
Foremost, EEG use requires meticulously securing electrodes onto a subject’s head; the electrodes are connected through a web of wires tethered to a [[CPU]]. So, creating an everyday, user-friendly communicator requires a further development of compacting EEGs and their signal-processors into an easy-to-use, lightweight, and fashionable device. (e.g. a headband with [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Bluetooth]])

In addition, current detection methods cannot distinguish between more than two signals (i.e. /ba/ or /ku/, yes or no). Therefore, a significant advancement in EEG processing algorithms is still required. This may suggest that an overall understanding of human-information-processing patterns must be better understood first, as it would offer insight into classifying word-specific neural-patterns common to all people.

'''James Derick Kirkland''' (born March 19, 1984) is an American [[professional boxer]] who held the regional [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]]–[[North American Boxing Organization|NABO]] [[junior middleweight]] title in 2008. He was one of boxing's most prominent junior middleweight prospects in the late 2000s and early 2010s, until an 18-month prison stint set his career back significantly.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web | author=Dan Rafael| title=Peter Quillin takes aim at title shot | work=ESPN | url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/6792080/peter-quillin-dominates-jason-lehoullier-5th-round-tko| accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed the "Mandingo Warrior", Kirkland is known for being a highly aggressive [[southpaw stance|southpaw]] [[pressure fighter]] with formidable punching power, having scored 82% per cent of his victories via [[knockout]].

==Amateur career==
Kirkland has an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] record of 134–12. and won the [[Silver Gloves]] championship four years in a row and lost on a controversial decision to James Patterson in the finals of the [[National Golden Gloves]].

Instead of going to the [[Olympics]], Kirkland turned professional to provide for his family.&lt;ref name="cant beat me"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gabriel Montoya | title=James Kirkland: "No man at 154 can beat me" | work=Boxrec Fighter Page | url=http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Gabriel/Montoya061606.htm| accessdate=15 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Kirkland turned professional in August 2001 in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. In his debut Kirkland defeated fellow debutant Maurice Chalmers with a third-round knockout. Kirkland has been trained by former women's champion [[Ann Wolfe]] since 2001.&lt;ref name="Anne Wolf"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gerald Rice | title=Exclusive Boxing Interview : James Kirkland and Anne Wolf | work=Saddo Boxing| url=http://www.saddoboxing.com/5377-james-kirkland-anne-wolfe.html| accessdate=5 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 22, 2008, Kirkland (24–0, 21 KOs) won an 8th round [[technical knockout]] versus [[Brian Vera]] (16–2, 10 KOs). Kirkland dropped Vera twice in Round 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/columns/story?columnist=rafael_dan&amp;id=3720561 |title=Ricky Hatton exorcises demons, erases memory of loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr. - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-11-23 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 7, 2009, Kirkland defeated [[Joel Julio]] on [[HBO]]'s Boxing After Dark at the [[HP Pavilion at San Jose|HP Pavilion]] in [[San Jose, CA|San Jose]] by TKO after Round 6.

=== Return to boxing ===
On March 5, 2011, Kirkland returned to the ring after an almost 2-year layoff to defeat Ahsandi Gibbs via first-round KO. 
On April 9, 2011, Kirkland faced [[Nobuhiro Ishida]] of [[Japan]], in what was supposed to be a stay-busy fight for Kirkland. However, in a stunning upset, the previously undefeated Kirkland was stopped in the first round by the Japanese fighter, who isn't known for being a big puncher having only 7 KO's in 29 fights, getting knocked down 3 times. After the loss, Kirkland split with trainer Kenny Adams and reunited with Ann Wolfe. Kirkland and Wolfe had broken up after Kirkland went to prison.

Kirkland came back from his first-round knockout loss to score three knockdowns over Alexis Hloros en route to a second-round knockout. He entered the fight his usual aggression, looking to mix it up immediately and scored two knockdowns in the opening round. First, Hloros went down during a flurry and then he took a knee during another stream of punches.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

====Kirkland vs. Angulo====
On November 5, 2011, in a highly exciting fight, Kirkland rose from a first round knockdown to defeat Angulo via 6th-round TKO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7202480/james-kirkland-comes-beat-alfredo-angulo |title=James Kirkland comes from behind to beat Alfredo Angulo - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/chris_mannix/11/02/mailbag/ |title=Kirkland vs. Angulo, Pacquiao's next opponent and more - Chris Mannix - SI.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2011-11-02 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his aforementioned victories over Angulo, Kirkland's other notable wins have been against Brian Vera (TKO8), who just lost a controversial decision to Julio Cesar Chavez, Jr., Joel Julio (TKO6) and Eromosele Albert (TKO1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/news/tss-press-releases/17412-james-kirkland-signs-with-50-cent-fights-dec-7 |title=James Kirkland Signs With 50 Cent, Fights Dec. 7 |publisher=Thesweetscience.com |date=2011-11-02 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2013 it was announced that Kirkland, has signed with promoter/rap star [[50 Cent]] and his company SMS Promotions and has his next fight lined up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/9834367/james-kirkland-joins-50-cent-sms-promotions |title= 50 cent signs James Kirkland  - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2013, Kirkland continued his winning ways with a sixth-round TKO of 23-year-old prospect Glen Tapia at the [[Boardwalk Hall]] in [[Atlantic City]].

==Outside the ring==
As of 2009, Kirkland was on probation for an armed robbery conviction in 2003, for which he spent 30 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailysportsherald.blogspot.com/2009/03/prospect-watch-james-kirkland.html |title=The Daily Sports Herald: Prospect Watch: James Kirkland |publisher=Thedailysportsherald.blogspot.com |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, April 19, 2009, Kirkland was stopped in Austin traffic and arrested for possession of a firearm by a [[felon]], with a possibility of prison time if he is convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=4084358 |title=James Kirkland held in custody on weapons charge - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-04-20 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Wednesday, September 23, 2009, Kirkland was sentenced to 24 months in prison after pleading guilty to the firearm charge.   Kirkland was released from prison in September 2010 and spent several more months in a halfway house in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/james-kirkland-released-from-prison-returns-11-6--31393 |title=James Kirkland Released From Prison, Returns 11/6 - Boxing News |publisher=Boxingscene.com |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Kirkland was again arrested - this time for assault - and jailed in Texas. Ring observers believe that these legal troubles will negatively impact Kirkland's career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badlefthook.com/2013/6/16/4436814/james-kirkland-arrested-and-jailed-for-assault-in-texas&lt;/ref&gt;

'''King''' (1932–1958), often known as '''King P-234''', was an outstanding early [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horse]] [[stallion]] who influenced the breed throughout the early years of the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (or AQHA).

==Life==

King was born June 25, 1932, the offspring of Zantanon and Jabalina.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;Holmes ''King P-234'' p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named Buttons by his breeder,&lt;ref name=Volpe&gt;Volpe "Breeder of King P-234" ''The Cattleman'' pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt; he was renamed King when he was registered with the AQHA as number 234. He was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]], bred by Manuel Benavides Volpe of [[Laredo, Texas]] and owned at the time of registration by Jess L. Hankins of [[Rocksprings, Texas]].&lt;ref name=StudBook&gt;AQHA ''Official Stud Book and Registry Combined 1–5'' p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The AQHA gave his sire as Zantanon by Little Joe by [[Traveler (horse)|Traveler]] and his dam as Jabalina by Strait Horse by Yellow Jacket by Little Rondo (Bunton Horse).&lt;ref name=StudBook/&gt; His second dam was a mare by Traveler, making him linebred to Traveler.&lt;ref name=Pedigree&gt;[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/king6 All Breed Pedigree Pedigree of King] retrieved on June 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FoundDam&gt;Denhardt ''Foundation Dams'' pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

Volpe sold Buttons/King to Charles Alexander of Laredo as a weanling for $150. Later, Byrne James of [[Encinal, Texas]] bought King from Alexander for $325. It was James' wife that changed the horse's name from Buttons to King.&lt;ref name=Volpe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beckman&gt;Beckman "King" ''Quarter Horse Journal'' pp. 36, 174–179&lt;/ref&gt; James broke King and used him for [[Team roping|roping]] and other ranch work, but when James joined the [[New York Giants]] organization to play baseball, King was sold to Winn DuBose of [[Uvalde, Texas]] for $550.&lt;ref name=Beckman/&gt; However, eventually DuBose sold King to Jess Hankins of [[Rocksprings, Texas]] on July 5, 1937 for the sum of $800.&lt;ref name=Beckman/&gt;

King died on March 24, 1958 of heart failure.&lt;ref name=Beckman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;Simmons, ''Legends: Outstanding Quarter Horse Stallions and Mares'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

King was the sire of many famous Quarter Horses including Brown King H, Martha King, [[Royal King (horse)|Royal King]], King's Pistol, Gay Widow, Black Gold King, Power Command, [[Poco Bueno]], Continental King, and LH Quarter Moon.&lt;ref name=Pitzer&gt;Pitzer ''Most Influential Quarter Horse Sires'' p. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his sons were inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame, those being Poco Bueno and Royal King.&lt;ref name=HOF&gt;{{cite web |title=King P-234 |url=https://www.aqha.com/museum/hall-of-fame/horses/k/king-p234/ |work= AQHA Hall of Fame |author=American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |accessdate=September 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Taboo was the dam of [[Joe Cody (horse)|Joe Cody]], another member of the AQHA Hall of Fame.

King was inducted into the [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame|AQHA Hall of Fame]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=HOF/&gt;

'''Kirsty Anna MacColl''' (10 October 1959 – 18 December 2000) was a [[British people|British]] singer and songwriter. She recorded several pop hits in the 1980s and 1990s, including "[[There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis]]" and cover versions of [[Billy Bragg]]'s "[[A New England#Kirsty MacColl version|A New England]]" and [[The Kinks]]' [[Days (The Kinks song)#Kirsty MacColl version|"Days"]]. Her song "[[They Don't Know (Kirsty MacColl song)|They Don't Know]]" was covered with great success by [[Tracey Ullman]]. MacColl also sang on recordings produced by her husband [[Steve Lillywhite]], most notably "[[Fairytale of New York]]" by [[The Pogues]].

==Early career==
Kirsty MacColl was the daughter of [[folk music|folk]] singer [[Ewan MacColl]] (1915–1989) and dancer Jean Newlove (1923–2017). Her father had [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry. She and her brother, Hamish MacColl, grew up with their mother in [[Croydon]], where Kirsty attended Park Hill Primary School, Monks Hill High School and John Newnham High School, making appearances in school plays. At the time of her birth, her father had been in a relationship with folk singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter [[Peggy Seeger]] since 1956 (a relationship that would continue until his death in 1989), and already had a son with her.

She came to notice when [[Chiswick Records]] released an EP by local [[punk rock]] band the Drug Addix with MacColl on backing vocals (''The Drug Addix Make A Record'') under the pseudonym Mandy Doubt (1978). [[Stiff Records]] executives were not impressed with the band, but liked her and subsequently signed her to a solo deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary Kirsty MacColl|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/20/guardianobituaries.adamsweeting|work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debut single==
Her debut solo single "[[They Don't Know (Kirsty MacColl song)|They Don't Know]]", released in 1979, peaked at number two on the Music Week airplay chart.&lt;ref name=airplay&gt;{{Citation | title = REVIEW: Kirsty MacColl, Galore (I.R.S.) | url = http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1995/Feb27.1995/revkirst.html | first = Bob | last = Gajarsky | date = 27 February 1995 | accessdate = 4 February 2011 | publisher = Consumable on line | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120630070910/http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1995/Feb27.1995/revkirst.html | archivedate = 30 June 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/information/articles/1979-1984/nme81/index.htm|title=NME or Melody Maker, 1981|last=Soave|first=Daniela|year=1995|publisher=The Kirsty MacColl web site|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a distributors' strike prevented copies of the single getting into [[record store]]s, and the single consequently failed to appear on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

MacColl recorded a follow-up single, "You Caught Me Out", but felt she lacked Stiff's full backing, and left the label shortly before the song was to be released.  The single was pulled, and only a few "white label" promo copies of the single are known to exist.

MacColl moved to [[Polydor Records]] in 1981. She had a UK number 14 hit with "[[There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis]]", taken from her critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Desperate Character]]''. In 1983, Polydor dropped her just as she had completed recording the songs for a planned second album (to be called ''Real'') which used more synthesizers and had new wave-styled tracks. She returned to Stiff, where pop singles such as "[[Terry (Kirsty MacColl song)|Terry]]" and "He's On the Beach" were unsuccessful but a cover of [[Billy Bragg]]'s "[[A New England]]" in 1985 got to number 7 in the UK charts. This included two extra verses specially written for her by Bragg. Also around this time, MacColl wrote and performed the theme song "London Girls" for [[Channel 4|Channel 4's]] short-lived sitcom ''[[Dream Stuffing]]'' (1984).

In the United States, MacColl was probably most recognisable as the writer of "They Don't Know". [[Tracey Ullman]]'s version reached #2 in the UK in 1983 and #8 in the United States in early 1984.  MacColl also sang back-up on the track, providing the "Baay-byy" because it was too high a pitch for Ullman.  It was played over the closing credits of Ullman's HBO show ''[[Tracey Takes On...|Tracey Takes On]]''... in 1996. Ullman also recorded three more of MacColl's songs, "You Broke My Heart In 17 Places" and "You Caught Me Out", as the title tracks of her first and second albums respectively, and "Terry" which was released as a single in 1985.

==Chart re-emergence==
When Stiff went bankrupt in 1986, MacColl was left unable to record in her own right, as no record company bought her contract from the [[Official Receiver]]. However, she had regular session work as a backing vocalist, and she frequently sang on records produced or engineered by her husband, [[Steve Lillywhite]], including tracks for [[Robert Plant]], [[The Smiths]], [[Alison Moyet]], [[Shriekback]], [[Simple Minds]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Big Country]], [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] (of [[ABBA]]) and [[The Wonder Stuff]] among others.  She appeared in the videos "[[Welcome to the Cheap Seats]]" for The Wonder Stuff and "[[(Nothing But) Flowers]]" for Talking Heads (along with ex-[[The Smiths]] guitarist [[Johnny Marr]]). MacColl also set the track sequencing for [[U2]]'s acclaimed breakthrough album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', for which Lillywhite provided mixes.

MacColl re-emerged in the British charts in December 1987, reaching Number 2 with [[The Pogues]] on "[[Fairytale of New York]]", a duet with [[Shane MacGowan]]. This led to her accompanying The Pogues on their British and European tour in 1988, an experience which she said helped her temporarily overcome her [[glossophobia|stage fright]].&lt;ref name=RoughGuide&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Jonathan|title=Rock : the rough guide|year=1999|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=978-1-85828-457-6|pages=622–623|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC&amp;lpg=PA1715&amp;dq=Kirsty%20MacColl%20stage%20fright&amp;pg=PA1715#v=onepage&amp;q=Kirsty%20MacColl%20stage%20fright&amp;f=false|edition=2. ed., expanded and complety rev.|accessdate=15 December 2011|quote=...she toured Ireland and suffered from stage fright...}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In March 1989, MacColl sang backing vocals on the [[Happy Mondays]]' ''[[Hallelujah (Happy Mondays album)|Hallelujah]]'' EP.

After the contract issue was resolved, MacColl returned to recording as a solo artist and received critical acclaim upon the release of ''[[Kite (Kirsty MacColl album)|Kite]]'' (LP) in 1989. The album was widely praised by critics, and featured collaborations with [[David Gilmour]] and [[Johnny Marr]]. MacColl's lyrics addressed life in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain on "[[Free World (song)|Free World]]", ridiculed the vapidity of fame in "Fifteen Minutes", and addressed the vagaries of love in "[[Don't Come The Cowboy With Me Sonny Jim!]]" Although ''Kite'' contained many original compositions, MacColl's biggest chart success from the album was the cover of [[The Kinks]]' song "[[Days (The Kinks song)|Days]]", which gave her a UK Top 20 hit in July 1989. A bonus track on the CD version of ''Kite'' was a cover of [[the Smiths]] song "You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby".

During this time, MacColl featured on the British TV sketch comedy ''[[French and Saunders]]'', appearing as herself, singing songs including "15 Minutes" and "Don't Come The Cowboy With Me Sunny Jim!" (from ''Kite''), "Still Life" (the B-side of the "Days" single), "Girls On Bikes" (a reworking of B-side "Am I Right?") and, with comedy duo Raw Sex, the [[Frank Sinatra|Frank]] and [[Nancy Sinatra]] hit "[[Somethin' Stupid]]". She continued to write and record, releasing the album ''[[Electric Landlady]]'' in 1991. The album's title was coined by [[Johnny Marr]] as a play on the [[Jimi Hendrix]] album title ''[[Electric Ladyland]]''. It included her most successful chart hit in North America, "[[Walking Down Madison]]", co-written with Marr and a Top 30 hit in the UK. Despite the song's U.S. chart success, ''Landlady'' was not a hit for Virgin Records and in 1992, when Virgin was sold to EMI, MacColl was dropped from the label.

==Later work==
She released ''[[Titanic Days]]'', informed by her failing marriage with Lillywhite,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,101956,00.html Time Entertainment: Elegy for a One-Woman Girl Group ]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993, but [[ZTT Records]] had agreed only to release the album as a "one-off" and declined to sign her to a contract. In 1995, she released two new singles on Virgin, "Caroline" and a cover of [[Lou Reed]]'s "[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]" (a duet with [[Evan Dando]]), together with the "best of" compilation ''[[Galore (Kirsty MacColl album)|Galore]]''.

''Galore'' became MacColl's only album to reach the top 10 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], but neither of the new singles, nor a re-released "Days", made the Top 40. MacColl did not record again for several years; her frustration with the music business was exacerbated by a lengthy case of writer's block. MacColl herself admitted that she was ready to give up her music career and become an English teacher in South America.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In 1998, the album ''What Do Pretty Girls Do?'' was released, containing BBC Radio 1 live sessions (featuring [[Billy Bragg]] on two songs) that were broadcast between 1989 and 1995.

After several trips to Cuba and Brazil, MacColl recorded the [[world music]]-inspired (particularly Cuban and other Latin American forms) ''[[Tropical Brainstorm]]'', which was released in 2000 to critical acclaim.  It included the song "In These Shoes?", which garnered airplay in the U.S., was covered by [[Bette Midler]] and featured in the HBO show ''[[Sex and the City]]''. After MacColl's death it was adopted by [[Catherine Tate]] as the theme tune for her [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] [[The Catherine Tate Show|TV show]] and featured on the soundtrack to film ''[[Kinky Boots (film)|Kinky Boots]]''.

However, prior to her death, despite the relative success of ''[[Tropical Brainstorm]]'' album MacColl had been been dropped by [[V2 Records]].

==TV work==
MacColl featured regularly in the third series of the ''[[French and Saunders]] Show'', a comedy show on the BBC. Unlike other guests on the show, she was not part of any of the sketches but sang her songs whilst performing as in a music video. She also made regular appearances on [[Jools Holland]]'s TV shows, also on the BBC, singing during the 1995 ''[[Hootenanny (UK TV series)|Hootenanny]]'' a rendition of "Miss Otis Regrets" with the Pipes and Drums of the [[Irish Guards]].

MacColl appeared in the 1991 Channel 4 historic musical fantasy ''The Ghosts of Oxford Street'' as [[Kitty Fisher]], performing "Fairytale of New York" opposite Shane MacGowan as the Duke of York.

==Death and its aftermath==

===Death===
In 2000, following her participation in the presentation of a radio programme for the [[BBC]] in [[Cuba]],&lt;ref name="bbc-death"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacColl took a holiday in [[Cozumel]], [[Mexico]], with her sons and her partner, musician James Knight. On 18 December 2000, she and her sons went diving at the Chankanaab reef, part of the National Marine Park of Cozumel, in a designated diving area that watercraft were restricted from entering. With the group was a local veteran divemaster, Iván Díaz. As the group were surfacing from a dive, a powerboat moving at high speed entered the restricted area. MacColl saw the boat coming before her sons did; Louis (then 13) was not in its path, but Jamie (then 15) was. She was able to push him out of the way (he sustained minor head and rib injuries), but she was struck by the boat which ran over her. MacColl suffered severe chest injuries and died instantly.&lt;ref name="Kirsta"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacColl's body was repatriated to the United Kingdom, and was cremated after a [[Secular humanism|humanist]] funeral at [[Mortlake Crematorium]] in [[Kew]].

===Aftermath===

The powerboat involved in the accident was owned by Guillermo González Nova, multimillionaire president of the [[Comercial Mexicana]] supermarket chain, who was on board with members of his family. One of his employees, boathand José Cen Yam, stated that he was in control of the boat at the time of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Caroline|last2=Tuckman|first2=Jo|title=Kirsty MacColl's mother ends campaign for justice after nine years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/11/kirsty-maccoll-campaign-anniversary-death|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyewitnesses said that Cen Yam was not at the controls and that the boat was travelling much faster than the speed of one [[knot (unit)|knot]] that González Nova said.

Cen Yam was found guilty of [[culpable homicide]] and was sentenced to 2 years 10 months in prison. He was allowed under Mexican law to pay a [[Punitive damages|punitive fine]] of 1,034 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] (about €63, £61 or US$90) in lieu of the prison sentence. He was also ordered to pay approximately US$2,150 in restitution to MacColl's family, an amount based on his wages. People who said they spoke to Cen Yam after the accident said he received money for taking the blame.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wynne-Jones"&gt;{{cite news

====Justice for Kirsty campaign====
MacColl's family launched the Justice for Kirsty campaign in response to the events surrounding her death. Among the group's efforts:
* Lawyers for MacColl's family and the group campaigned for a judicial review into the events surrounding her death. They were in repeated contact with the Mexican government, and made an application to the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights|Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]].
* MacColl's friends and family were critical of what they perceived as a lack of cooperation from the Mexican authorities. In May 2006, Emilio Cortez Ramírez, a federal prosecutor in Cozumel, was found liable for breach of authority in conjunction with his handling of the MacColl case.&lt;ref name="prosecutor-liable"&gt;{{cite web

In December 2009, it was announced that the Justice For Kirsty campaign was being ended since "the committee was successful in achieving most of its aims" and "it is unlikely that any more could be achieved". The campaign's remaining funds were to be divided between two charities, Casa Alianza México and Cuba Music Solidarity, of which "Kirsty would have approved".&lt;ref name="campaignend"&gt;{{cite web

==Legacy==
{{Multiple image | direction = vertical| image1=Empty bench in Soho Square.jpg|width=200|image2=Empty bench close-up.jpg|caption1=Kirsty MacColl [[memorial bench]] in Soho Square|caption2=A close-up of the engraved lyrics}}
Since MacColl's death, [[Billy Bragg]] has always included her extra verses when performing "[[A New England]]". She was honoured in 2002 with a memorial concert in London at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], featuring a number of musicians who had worked with her or been influenced by her.  A similar memorial concert took place on her birthday (10 October 2010) at the  [[O2 Shepherds Bush Empire]], to support her favourite charity, The Music Fund for Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=1041915&amp;c=1 Music Week – MacColl memorial gig to benefit Cuban artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a bench was placed by the southern entrance to London's [[Soho Square]] as a memorial to her, after a lyric from one of her most poignant songs: "One day I'll be waiting there / No empty bench in Soho Square". Every year on the Sunday nearest to MacColl's birthday, 10 October, fans from all over the world hold a gathering at the bench to pay tribute to her and sing her songs.

MacColl continues to receive media exposure; in 2004, ''Kirsty MacColl: The One and Only,''  a biography of MacColl written by Karen O'Brien, was published. A retrospective three-CD set spanning her full career, ''From Croydon To Cuba,'' was released in 2005. ''Titanic Days'' was re-released in 2005 as a deluxe 2-CD set, and ''Kite'' and ''Electric Landlady'' were also remastered and rereleased with additional tracks. Her first album, ''Desperate Character,'' was given its first CD issue in 2012 on the Salvo label. On 7 August 2005, ''The Best of Kirsty MacColl,'' a single-disc compilation that included a "new" single, "Sun on the Water", made its debut on the UK album charts at number 17, climbing to #12 a week later.

MacColl's collaboration with the Pogues, "[[Fairytale of New York]]", remains a perennial Christmas favourite. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, it was voted favourite Christmas song in a poll by music video channel [[VH1]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The song was re-released in the UK in December 2005, with proceeds being split between the Justice for Kirsty Campaign and charities for the homeless. The re-release reached  number 3 on the UK charts, and spent five weeks in the top 75 over the Christmas and New Year period. It reached the top 10 for the third time in its history in 2006, peaking at number 6, and charted yet again in December 2007, when there was brief controversy over the use of the word '[[faggot (epithet)|faggot]]' in the lyrics, which BBC Radio 1 dubbed out "to avoid offence", 20 years after it had first passed over the airwaves without comment (or apparent offence, although the rhyme had been changed to "haggard" for a St. Patrick's Day concert in 1998); following criticism from listeners and MacColl's mother, Radio 1 reversed their decision later in the day.&lt;ref name="bbc-backs-down"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song has also made the Top 20 in subsequent years, and has now spent more time in the top 20 than any other song. With the exception of the 2005 and 2012 re-releases, the seasonal re-charting in the 21st century is due to download sales, and not due to further releases (download sales counting toward the singles chart since 2005). A 7" single was produced in 2012 to mark the 25th anniversary of its original appearance (Rhino Records WEA400), backed with an instrumental version.

'''Landlord harassment''' is the willing creation, by a [[landlord]] or his agents, of conditions that are uncomfortable for one or more [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in order to induce willing abandonment of a [[Real estate contract|rental contract]].   Such a strategy is often sought because it avoids costly legal [[expenses]] and potential problems with [[eviction]].  This kind of activity is common in regions where [[rent control]] laws exist, but which do not allow the direct extension of rent-controlled prices from one tenancy to the subsequent tenancy, thus allowing landlords to set higher prices.  Landlord [[harassment]] carries specific legal penalties in some [[jurisdiction]]s, but enforcement can be very difficult or even impossible in many circumstances.  However, when a [[crime]] is committed in the process and motives similar to those described above are subsequently proven in court, then those motives may be considered an [[Attendant circumstance|aggravating factor]] in many jurisdictions, thus subjecting the offender(s) to a stiffer [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

==Types==
Various methods may be employed in cases of landlord harassment, such as, but not limited to the following:
* Withholding maintenance on the [[property]], such as [[Waste collection|garbage collection]], [[landscaping]], or repair of broken fixtures
* Verbal and written complaints, imagined or exaggerated, of tenant's supposed improper conduct (see [[notice to quit]])
* Deliberate [[Defacement (vandalism)|defacing]] of the rented facilities or the property of the tenant
* Creating a [[nuisance]] for the tenant (for example, by generating loud noise)
* [[Intimidation]] and [[threats]] of physical or financial injury directed at the tenant
* [[Physical assault]] or other direct [[criminal activity]] directed against the tenant
* Attempt to enter apartment or housing without cause, or without emergency need to check on premises or on tenant activity
* Claiming emergency when no emergency exists to enter apartment, housing, dwelling etc., without proper notice.
* Not letting tenant peace on property via repeated attempts to enter dwelling.
* Harassment about Rent Not Paid, or Not paid in full.
* Disconnecting water supply or electricity, without proper notice

==Protections==
{{Main|Nuisance}}
At [[common law]] tenants were entitled to the "quiet enjoyment" of leased premises.&lt;ref name="Kroll"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kroll, David G.|year=1992|title=The Landlord/Tenant Warranty of Habitability and the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment|journal=Colorado Lawyer|volume=21|issue=June|page=1159}}&lt;/ref&gt; American common law has also adopted the "warranty of habitability" which ensures that residential premises remain in repair.&lt;ref name="Kroll" /&gt;

In the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] may provide a basis to establish what is fair and reasonable between tenant and landlord.  The [[right]] to [[Right to privacy|private]] and family life, and the right to [[Property rights|enjoy one's possessions]], are enshrined in this law.  The right to an effective [[Legal remedy|remedy]] and the right to express oneself freely should give the tenant the confidence to seek timely and reasonable resolution should they be suffering or under [[duress]].  Although [[human rights]] legislation is generally only enforceable against [[public bodies]], it provides a framework of [[Reasonable person|reasonability]].

Depending on the specific circumstances, United Kingdom legislation such as the [[Public Order Act 1986]] and the [[Fraud Act 2006]] may provide specific remedies.  Both common law and public order legislation makes it an offence for persons to behave wrongfully in a dwelling e.g. [[breach of the peace]].  Fraud legislation makes it an offence for a person to make a wrongful or forced gain (monetary or other) personally or for the body they represent.

Many local jurisdictions have very specific landlord-tenant legislation that sets out the duties of the landlord, a breach of which may be considered "harassment".  For example, in [[California]], Civil Code Section 1954, limits the landlord's right of entry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Landlord and Tenant|publisher=California Department of Real Estate|url=http://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/refbook/ref09.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[New Mexico]], there is an extensive "Owner-Resident Relations Act"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Obligations of Landlords and Tenants for Safety, Maintenance and Repairs|publisher=Law Help New Mexico, New Mexico Legal Aid|url=http://www.lawhelpnewmexico.org/?q=content/obligations-landlords-and-tenants-safety-maintenance-and-repairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasonable entry by the landlord==
The conduct of business inside or at a [[dwelling]] must depend upon the reasonableness and willingness of the parties.  If a landlord desires to inspect the dwelling at reasonable intervals and at reasonable times, it is advisable to have this in a contract proper--- Regardless, the purpose of the inspection must be clear, and the conduct of the inspection must be properly regulated.  The purpose of any inspection is surely to ensure the integrity and good maintenance of the property, and the adherence to the agreement that exists between landlord and tenant.  Entry into a dwelling does not give the landlord the right to gather information on, or to investigate, or interfere with, the privacy of the tenant.  If the tenant is not comfortable dealing with the landlord or agent, then the tenant may wish to appoint a representative or friend.  In either case, a simple and sensible record should be made.

The time taken to carry out the task should be reasonable.  The tenant may not wish to conduct business inside a dwelling, and can reasonably ask the landlord to meet or transact business at an alternate place or address.

For example, the landlord (or agent) may attend at the premises to carry out an inspection which will normally take only a matter of minutes.  The parties may then agree to exchange a simple written [[Agreed statement|statement of facts]], and then meet at a neutral place to discuss the matter or remedy.

==Frequency of landlord visits==
In carrying out repairs, replacements and other work, the landlord should make reasonable efforts to limit the frequency of entries to those actually necessary to accomplish the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltb.gov.on.ca/en/Law/STDPROD_078964.html|title=Landlord and Tenant Board - SJTO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sake of retention of one’s tenants and the avoidance of strife during tenancy, the keys to exercise of the right to entry are as follows.  1.  Enter as infrequently as possible.  2.  Always give ample notice and, if possible, allow rescheduling of the entry at least once to accommodate the tenant.  3.  Always enter with a clearly defined objective in mind, and notify the tenant of it unless there is a strong reason not to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landlord.com/landlord_right_of_entry_by_state.htm#ARIZONA:_|title=Landlord.com Government Housing|website=www.landlord.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landlord entering the unit==
Legally, even a rented home is the tenant's castle, and the landlord does not have an unlimited right of access. Once an individual has rented an [[apartment]], they have legal possession of it for the duration of their tenancy.  The landlord must give the tenant reasonable notice, before he can enter the tenant's private home.

Originally, in an [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]], the law expected the landlord to rent the property to a tenant and then leave the tenant alone.  It gave the landlord no right of access, but also no responsibility for repairs.  The modern [[Urban area|urban]] tenancy, especially in a multi-unit [[building]] with many building-wide systems, has forced that law to change.  The landlord now has an [[obligation]] to make repairs and gets a right of access for that purpose.  But that does not supersede the [[Tenant rights|tenant's rights]] to privacy and to "quiet enjoyment" of the premises.

One of the most common landlord-tenant disputes involves access for making repairs.  State [[Sanitary]] [[Legal code (municipal)|Codes]]{{which|date=February 2013}} require tenants to allow the landlord "reasonable access" at reasonable times to repair code violations.  What is "reasonable", however, is the subject of frequent disputes.  A tenant may insist on giving the landlord access only by appointment, but they must be reasonable about scheduling appointments.  To give an extreme example, since the landlord usually must schedule tradespeople during the normal working day, it is not reasonable for the tenant to insist that the [[plumber]] can only come in on [[Sunday]] evening.  Plumbers, [[carpenter]]s, [[House painter and decorator|painter]]s, and other tradesmen sometimes operate on unpredictable or busy schedules, so if they fail to keep appointments, tenants are encouraged to document the missed appointment in writing to the landlord, in a letter or e-mail, and keep a copy.  Because some landlords may use lack of access as an excuse, tenants are also encouraged to keep scheduled appointments and maintain a good written record of their efforts to allow the landlord access to their property to make the desired repairs.  In addition, because of documented cases{{which|date=February 2013}} of tradesmen [[stealing]] property, making [[Long-distance call|long-distance phone call]]s, or committing other abuses while making repairs, tenants are also urged to make sure that the landlord or a representative be with repairmen at all times when they are in the tenant's property during the tenant's absence.

Housing courts can often be helpful in [[Mediation|mediating]] disputes over access.  The tenant's credibility in court will be improved if he or she has consistently cooperated reasonably with the landlord's need for access, and has documented their cooperation with careful record-keeping.  If necessary, with a particularly difficult landlord, the tenant may benefit from asking a [[witness]] to observe interactions, and later [[testify]] about the landlord's conduct.

Many leases give the landlord certain entry rights.  For example, under [[Massachusetts General Laws]], ch.186, §15B, a rental agreement may only provide for the following rights to access:
* to inspect the premises;
* to make repairs;
* to show the premises to a prospective tenant, purchaser, [[mortgagee]], or its agent.

The landlord may also enter the premises in accordance with a [[court order]] or if the tenant appears to have [[Abandoned property|abandoned]] the premises.  If a lease allows the landlord to enter for any other reason, that provision is illegal and [[Void (law)|void]].  In addition, the landlord's right to inspect the premises or to show them to a prospective purchaser does not mean that he or she can do it twice every day; the tenant can limit inspections to reasonable frequency.  Unless the lease provides that the tenant must give the landlord a key to their property, the landlord has no right to one.  The fact that a lease allows the landlord a right to enter for certain purposes also does not mean that the landlord may enter a private residence at any time without an appointment.

The right of the landlord to enter if the tenant appears to have abandoned the premises sometimes causes a problem when tenants are [[Moving (address)|moving out]].  The tenant may have moved out most of their [[furniture]] and intend to return to pick up the last few things and clean up the apartment before turning in the keys.  If the landlord believes the tenant has [[vacated]] the premises, however, he or she may come in ahead of the tenant, remove the remaining property, and attempt to charge the tenant for the "mess" they left.  To avoid this situation, tenants are encouraged to be clear with landlords about plans to vacate, and to do so in writing.  In one documented case,{{which|date=February 2013}} a tenant came back from his [[vacation]] and found someone else living in his apartment, with his furniture stored in the [[Basement|cellar]].  He wasn't behind on his [[Renting|rent]], but he had been away for a while, and the landlord concluded that he had abandoned the apartment.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  To preclude any perception of abandonment, a tenant who is going out of town may benefit from informing his or her landlord of the trip, preferably in writing.  If the tenant is away for an extended time, does not pay the rent, and does not respond to inquiries from the landlord, a [[court]] may find the landlord justified in concluding that the tenant has abandoned the property.

==Retaliation==
A landlord cannot [[Retaliatory eviction|try to evict]] a tenant, raise the rent, or change the terms of tenancy because the tenant has complained in writing to the landlord, or to any government agency, regarding conditions.  The landlord also cannot retaliate in this fashion because a tenant has organized or joined a [[tenant union]], or engaged in certain other protected activities.  Within six months after a tenant has engaged in any of these protected activities, any act by the landlord of raising the rent, attempting eviction (except for non-payment), or making any change in any of the terms of tenancy is presumed to be a retaliation.  This means that in any court proceeding, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden]] will be on the landlord to prove that he or she is not retaliating against the tenant.  In order to defeat a retaliation claim, a landlord must convince the court that he or she took the action for reasons independent of the tenant's protected action, and that he or she would have done the same thing at the same time even if the tenant hadn't engaged in the protected activity.  If the landlord waits until six months after protected actions, retaliation may still be found, but the burden of proof is on the tenant.

If a landlord is found to be retaliating, he or she will not be able to evict the tenant, who may also be awarded [[damages]] from the landlord of one to three months' rent plus [[Lawyer|attorney]]'s fees.  The landlord also cannot willfully deprive the tenant of [[Heating|heat]], [[hot water]], [[gas]], [[electricity]], [[Light fixture|lights]], [[water]], or [[refrigeration]] service.  Nor can the landlord lock out the tenant or remove him/her from their apartment without going through the proper court procedure.  The tenant can ask the court to issue a [[restraining order]], [[Filing (legal)|file]] a [[criminal complaint]] against the landlord, or sue him/her for money damages and attorney's fees.  Because of these options for recourse, it may be to the tenant's advantage to complain about code violations in writing before the landlord issues a notice of an eviction or a rent increase.  If a tenant attempts to claim retaliation, but did not complain about violations until after he or she received notice from the landlord, the tenant will be found to have no valid claim.  The court will not find that the landlord was retaliating against the tenant for an action he or she had not yet taken.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Consumer protection law==
[[Consumer protection laws]] also provide some protection against landlord harassment in some states.  One such statute is Chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws, commonly called the "Consumer Protection Law".  Like the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] on which it is based, and similar "baby [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]]" laws in other states, it prohibits the use of any unfair and deceptive acts and practices in the conduct of any trade or business.  Housing rental is generally considered to be a trade or business, and the [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] has issued [[regulation]]s which define unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the rental housing field.  Practices defined as unfair include failure by the landlord to disclose, to a tenant or prospective tenant, any fact of the disclosure of which may have influenced the latter not to enter into the transaction.  Also defined as an unfair practice is any violation of any law meant to protect consumers, and any act which is oppressive or otherwise unconscionable in any respect.  While the Consumer Protection Law provides some protections for tenants.  If a landlord is the owner-occupant of a two-family or three-family house and owns no other rental property, he or she is not considered to be engaged in a trade or business, and is not subject to this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93a|title=Chapter 93A|website=www.malegislature.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Zimbabwe]], a country in [[southern Africa]], is suffering widespread [[malnutrition]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicef.org/zimbabwe/media_18004.html Unicef.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and diseases, such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]]. "One in four human beings is malnourished" in [[Africa]], but Zimbabwe is near the deep end with almost 12,000 children alone suffering from severe [[malnutrition]] (Turner 8).  Zimbabweans suffer from lack of food, [[sustenance]], and the politicization of food, but these can be fixed by the fortification of basic foods, the resolution of the political problems in Zimbabwe, and continuing aid from [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs).

'''Mealworms''' are the larval form of the '''mealworm beetle''', ''Tenebrio molitor'', a species of [[darkling beetle]]. Like all [[holometabolism|holometabolic]] [[insect]]s, they go through four life stages: [[egg (biology)|egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]], and [[imago|adult]]. Larvae typically measure about 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm or more, whereas adults are generally between 1.25 and 1.8&amp;nbsp;cm in length.

== Reproduction ==
The mealworm beetle breeds prolifically. Mating is a three-step process: the male chasing the female, mounting her and inserting his [[aedeagus]], and injecting a sperm packet. Within a few days the female burrows into soft ground and lays about 500 eggs.

After four to 19 days the eggs hatch. Many predators target the eggs, including reptiles.

During the larval stage, the mealworm feeds on vegetation and dead insects and [[moulting|molts]] between each larval stage, or [[instar]] (9 to 20 instars). After the final molt it becomes a [[pupa]]. The new pupa is whitish, and it turns brown over time. After 3 to 30 days, depending on environmental conditions such as temperature, it emerges as an adult beetle.

===Sex pheromones===
A sex [[pheromone]] released by male mealworms has been identified.&lt;ref name="pmid16273437"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryning GP, Chambers J, Wakefield ME |title=Identification of a sex pheromone from male yellow mealworm beetles, ''Tenebrio molitor'' |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=2721–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16273437 |doi=10.1007/s10886-005-7622-x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inbreeding]] reduces the attractiveness of sexual pheromone signaling by male mealworms.&lt;ref name="pmid22237501"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pölkki M, Krams I, Kangassalo K, Rantala MJ |title=Inbreeding affects sexual signalling in males but not females of ''Tenebrio molitor'' |journal=Biology Letters |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=423–5 |year=2012 |pmid=22237501 |pmc=3367757 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2011.1135 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females are more attracted to the odors produced by [[heterosis|outbred]] males than the odors produced by inbred males. The reduction of male signaling capability may be due to increased expression of homozygous deleterious recessive alleles caused by inbreeding.&lt;ref name="pmid3324702"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE |title=The molecular basis of the evolution of sex |journal=Advances in Genetics |volume=24 |issue= |pages=323–70 |year=1987 |pmid=3324702 |doi= 10.1016/S0065-2660(08)60012-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with humans ==
''Tenebrio molitor'' is often used for biological research. Its relatively large size, ease of rearing and handling, and status as a non-[[model organism]] make it useful in [[proof of concept]] studies in the fields of basic biology, biochemistry, evolution, immunology and physiology.

=== As pests ===
Mealworms have generally been considered pests, because their larvae feed on stored grains. Mealworms probably originated in the [[Mediterranean]] region, but are now present in many areas of the world as a result of human trade and colonization. The oldest archaeological records of mealworms can be traced to [[Bronze Age]] [[Turkey]]. Records from the British Isles and northern Europe are from a later date, and mealworms are conspicuously absent from archaeological finds from ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panagiotakopulu E | year = 2001 | title = New records for ancient pests: archaeoentomology in Egypt | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 28 | issue = 11| pages = 1235–1246 | doi=10.1006/jasc.2001.0697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As food ===
{{main|Entomophagy}}
Mealworms are edible for humans, and are commonly consumed in a practice known as [[entomophagy]]. Mealworms have historically been consumed in many Asian countries, particularly in Southeast Asia. They are commonly found in food markets and sold as street food alongside other edible insects. Baked or fried mealworms have been marketed as a healthy snack food in recent history, though the consumption of mealworms goes back centuries. They may be easily reared on fresh oats, wheat bran or grain, with sliced potato, carrots, or apple as a moisture source. The small amount of space required to raise mealworms has made them popular in many parts of Southeast Asia.

Mealworms have been incorporated into [[tequila]]-flavored novelty candies. Mealworms are not traditionally served in tequila, and the "tequila worm" in certain [[mezcal]]s is usually the larva of the [[moth]] ''[[Hypopta agavis]]''.

Mealworms are typically used as a [[pet food]] for captive [[reptile]]s, [[fish]],  and [[bird]]s. They are also provided to wild birds in [[bird feeder]]s, particularly during the nesting season. Mealworms are useful for their high protein content. They are also used as [[fishing bait]].

They are commercially available in bulk and are typically available in containers with [[bran]] or [[oatmeal]] for food. Commercial growers incorporate a [[juvenile hormone]] into the feeding process to keep the mealworm in the larval stage and achieve an abnormal length of 2&amp;nbsp;cm or greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Finke, M. | author2 = D. Winn | year = 2004 | title = Insects and related arthropods: A nutritional primer for rehabilitators | journal = Journal of Wildlife Rehabilitation | volume = 27| pages = 14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nutrient Composition ====
Mealworm larva contain significant nutrient content, a feature that has made them viable as food and feed. For every 100 grams of raw mealworm larva, 206 calories and anywhere from 14 to 25 grams of protein are contained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3253e/i3253e06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Mealworm larva contain levels of potassium, copper, sodium, selenium, iron and zinc that rival that of beef. Mealworms contain essential linoleic acids as well. They also have greater vitamin content by weight compared to beef, B12 not included.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3253e/i3253e06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===In waste disposal===
In 2015, it was discovered that mealworms are capable of degrading [[polystyrene]] into usable organic matter at a rate of about 34-39 milligrams per day. Additionally, no difference was found between mealworms fed only styrofoam and mealworms fed conventional foods, during the one-month duration of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Rob|title=Plastic-eating worms may offer solution to mounting waste, Stanford researchers discover|url=https://news.stanford.edu/pr/2015/pr-worms-digest-plastics-092915.html|website=Stanford News Service|publisher=Stanford News Service|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism behind this is currently unknown, and no attempts to commercialize this discovery have been made.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

'''Mick the Miller''' (29 June 1926 – 6 May 1939) was a male [[brindle]] [[Greyhound]]. He is celebrated as the first great [[greyhound racing|racing greyhound]] to compete in England (although he was born in Ireland). Despite a short three year racing career, his achievements were highly publicised around the world and by the end of his career he had become an icon in the sport. His achievements include winning nineteen races in a row, including the [[English Greyhound Derby]] on two successive occasions. He suffered an injury at [[Wimbledon Stadium]] whilst racing which broke the streak in 1931, and once recovered was beaten in the attempt to win a third Derby title. He went on to appear in films, and is still considered one of the greatest sporting heroes in the UK.

==Early life==
Mick, a male [[brindle]] [[Greyhound]], was born in [[Killeigh]], [[County Offaly]], Ireland before the introduction of [[Greyhound racing|Greyhound track racing]] in Ireland, and before the sport became popular in Britain.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt; The smallest of a litter of ten puppies, his father was a direct descendant of [[Master McGrath]], a famous Irish Greyhound who won the [[Waterloo Cup]] on three occasions.&lt;ref name=greyhoundtale /&gt; Originally expected to be used for [[hare coursing]], a deal was discussed with dog owner Moses Rebenschied to take Mick to America to compete in the Greyhound racing circuit. However, before the deal could go through a tornado struck [[St. Louis, Missouri]], killing 27 of Rebenschied's Greyhounds when the roof was blown off their kennel, and a further four dogs died when a van driven by his son was overturned by the storm. In a letter from Rebenschied calling off the deal he stated his reason, "I repeat, the hand of God is warning me against greyhounds."&lt;ref name="observerspecial"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports Book Special: Mick the Millers Glory Days|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=4 January 2004|page=12|publisher=Guardian Newspapers Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Catholic priest, Father Martin Brophy, brought Mick to race in England, although nearly sold the dog as a puppy to another priest, Father Maurice Browne. Although the [[Catholic Church in Ireland]] had no issues with Greyhound racing, the [[Catholic Church in Great Britain]] at the time was against it, having published a pamphlet entitled ''Dog Racing'' which called it a "threat to Sunday dinners", and described gambling that "the distribution of losses and dividends had an anti-social character because the poorest, the most unhappy, the physically and emotionally handicapped, are made to pay for the professionals and semi-professionals who get hold of intimate knowledge."&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt;

==Racing career==

===1928===
He made his debut at [[Shelbourne Park]] on 18 April 1928 winning the Punchestown Stakes.&lt;ref name=JB&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He raced five times during 1928, winning four times and equalled the 500 metres world record after recording 28.80 at Shelbourne.&lt;ref name=JB/&gt; The day after competing in the Abercorn Cup final he suffered a serious illness and was diagnosed with distemper. He nearly died but was nursed back to health by the Shelbourne Park veterinary surgeon Arthur 'Doc' Callanan.&lt;ref name=DMGFF&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File, pages 369-382|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1929===
He reached the [[Easter Cup (greyhounds)|Easter Cup final]] at Shelbourne and won the Spring Cup final at [[Harold's Cross Stadium]] and National Cup final at Shelbourne before travelling to England for the first time.&lt;ref name=JB/&gt; In a solo trial prior to the [[1929 English Greyhound Derby]] on 25 July, Mick broke the track record, reducing his odds from an initial 25–1 to becoming the 4–7 favorite to win by the time of the final, despite still being new off the board from Ireland. He was housed at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim for the duration of the Derby.&lt;ref name=JB/&gt; In the first round, Mick pulled away down the back straight, beating Captured Half by eight lengths and setting a time of 29.82, a new world record over that length. Father Browne sold Mick for £800, plus any prize money that the dog would win on the night,&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt; which at the time was more than the cost of buying a house in nearby [[Shepherd's Bush]].&lt;ref name=greyhoundtale /&gt; By 8:45pm, when the final took place, some 40,000 spectators were in the ground. The lineup was four dogs; in trap one was Beadsman at 20–1; trap two was Palatinus at 3–1; trap three was Entomb at 9–2, and finally Mick the Miller in trap four, wearing the black jacket. Palatinus made the best start, at the first bend both Mick and Entomb attempted to move inside to the rail, but Beadsman collided with both of them, sending all three dogs sprawling. The no–race klaxon went off, and the race had to be restarted. None of the dogs was allowed to leave the track with until the race was re–run at 9:15pm, the only comfort given to Mick on a particularly hot summer's evening was a [[handkerchief]] soaked in cold water.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt;

The re–run began, with Palatinus again getting away first, however at the first corner, Mick pursued him around the first corner alone. Catching him down the back straight, Mick pulled away around the third bend going on to beat him by three lengths in a time of 29.96. Although Palatinus completed the first run through, his time was one fifth of a second slower than that made by Mick in the second. When villagers in his home town of Killeigh heard of his success, an impromptu bonfire party was held.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt;

After the Derby he went on to win the International at [[West Ham Stadium]] on 5 August and finished runner-up in the London Cup final on 26 November. He finished 1929 with a record of 26 wins from 32 races.&lt;ref name=JB/&gt; He joined Wimbledon trainer [[Sidney Orton]] in December 1929 at the Burhill kennels in [[Hersham]].

===1930===
He started 1930 well by finishing runner-up in the Champion Stakes at Wimbledon on 1 January and then won the Spring Cup at [[Wembley Greyhounds|Wembley]] on 22 March. He then won the [[1930 English Greyhound Derby|Derby]] again in front of 50,000 spectators including King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]]. His victory there was his eleventh in succession.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt; Mick then won the [[Cesarewitch (greyhounds)|Cesarewitch]] at West Ham and the [[Welsh Greyhound Derby]] at the [[White City Stadium, Cardiff|Sloper Road Stadium]], setting the world record again, this time at 29.55&amp;nbsp;seconds over {{convert|525|yd|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Brian|title=Cardiff Remembered: Postcard king warranted a mention|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/columnists/2009/01/09/cardiff-remembered-postcard-king-warranted-a-mention-91466-22658060/|accessdate=9 September 2011|newspaper=WalesOnline|date=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His run extended nineteen successive victories before he tore a shoulder muscle in a race at [[Wimbledon Stadium]]. During the run, he broke world records on four occasions and newspaper editors stopped using the headline of "Wonder Dog", instead replacing it with simply "Invincible".&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt; He finished the year winning 20 times from 23 races.&lt;ref name=JB/&gt;

===1931===
A comeback was attempted in February 1931, again at Wimbledon, however Mick suffered a torn [[dewclaw]] in a trial,&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt; setting back his return until March when he won the Spring Cup again at Wembley breaking the track record in the final before he returned to White City with the aim of winning a third Derby.

He suffered shock defeats by Mick's Fancy in the eleventh heat of the [[1931 English Greyhound Derby]], and again by five lengths in the second round by a new Irish import, a dog called Ryland R who weighed over {{convert|80|lb|kg}}. Mick had still been favourite in that race, but for the first time in some 25 races, he was not odds on. Ryland R and Mick met again in the semi finals on 20 June, the second time in 48 races that Mick was not the favourite since coming over from Ireland. Coming out the first turn, Mick was fifth, but was bumped so wide that Ryland opened up a fifteen length lead over his at one point. However, Mick sped on, and overtook the other dogs until only Ryland remained. As they crossed the line, Ryland took the victory, but by only half a length. The [[The Evening News (London newspaper)|Evening News]] stated that "Mick has never run a better race".&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt; However, this was the first time that Mick had ever lost three consecutive races, but at least qualified for the final.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt;

The final took place on 27 June 1931, with 70,000 spectators attending to see Mick the Miller take on "The Black Express" Ryland R. The two dogs were both matched as joint favourites for the final at odds of 13–8. The other four dogs in the race were Golden Hammer, Mick's Fancy, Seldom Lad and Brunswick Bill. Just after 9pm, Ryland is out of the traps ahead of the others once again, with Mick in last position as they go around the first bend. Ryland led all the way until the final turn where Seldom Lad closed on him. The two dogs made contact and swung wide, the race steward spotted that Ryland had turned to snap at Seldom Lad and set off the no–race klaxon. The noise is drowned out by the crowd as Mick the Miller is suddenly coming through the pack. Despite being bumped earlier in the race, he found the inside rail and moved up past the others, beating Golden Hammer by a head at the line. The announcer repeats that it is a no race to the disappointment of the crowd. Ryland R was disqualified for "nosing and impeding" another dog. Phiddy Kempton, Mick's owner at the time, broke down into tears, "Mick has won! My darling Mick has won!" he cried.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt; A re–run was ordered for 9:55pm, while the crowd began to get unruly. Kempton was refusing to allow Mick to compete in the re–run, adamant he had already run the Derby. The directors of the [[Greyhound Racing Association]] were in attendance, and knowing the effect that both the two favourites not running in the final of the Derby would mean for the sport, convinced Kempton to run Mick.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt;

The race was re–run, and the tired Mick was never close to placing. He slipped at the first bend whilst attempting to take the inside. Seldom Lad overtook Golden Hammer and won the race unchallenged, with Mick finishing in fourth place. Mick's time in the voided race was 29.89&amp;nbsp;seconds, some two and a half lengths faster than Seldom Lad's time in the second. Mick lost a fourth race in a row for the first time ever, and the Derby trophy was awarded to Seldom Lad's owners amid a host of boos from the crowd.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt;

The circumstances of the third derby changed the public perception of Mick. He was no longer simply a racing Greyhound, he had become a public icon and became the embodiment of the sport at an international level. The ''Greyhound Mirror and Gazette'' proclaimed of Mick, "Greyhound racing is still in its infancy, but already it has produced a popular favourite as idolised as any horse, cinema star, footballer or boxer in history."&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt; He was featured in articles around the world including ''Welt im Bild'' (Germany), the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' (Australia) and ''[[The American Weekly]]'' (USA). Mick continued to race for most of the rest of the year, with his final race being the [[St Leger (greyhounds)|St Leger Stakes]] in October at what was then called the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Empire Stadium]], winning the race whilst watched by 40,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt; This race was later described as the greatest race ever staged at Wembley, which would go on to hold Greyhound racing until 1998 prior to its demolition to make room for the new [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref name="dogdogswembley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Laura|title=Wembley's dog days at an end Mick the Miller broke four world records there, but tonight the last dog will leave Wembley's traps. Laura Thompson recalls the golden age of racing at London's famous stadium|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 December 1998|page=8|publisher=Guardian Newspapers Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; In qualifying for the final of that race, he beat Seldom Lad on three occasions.&lt;ref name=greyhoundtale /&gt; His retirement was announced in December 1931.&lt;ref name=observerspecial/&gt;

==Later life==
Mick spent the next two years at stud with Jack Masters at Mill Farm, near Dereham in Norfolk,&lt;ref name="whateverhappenedto?"&gt;{{cite news|title=Whatever happened to? Mick the Miller, Greyhound champion, 1928-31|newspaper=Observer Sport Monthly|date=3 February 2002|page=46|publisher=Guardian Newspapers Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the most expensive dog advertised at stud demanding 50 guineas.

Social tags are arguably more important in [[exploratory search]], in which the users may engage in iterative cycles of goal refinement and exploration of new information (as opposed to simple fact-retrievals), and interpretation of information contents by others will provide useful cues for people to discover topics that are relevant. 
One significant challenge that arises in social tagging systems is the rapid increase in the number and diversity of the tags. As opposed to structured annotation systems, tags provide users an unstructured, open-ended mechanism to annotate and organize web-content. As users are free to create any tag to describe any resource, it leads to what is referred to as the vocabulary problem.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Furnas, T. K. Landauer, L. M. Gomez, and S. T. Dumais, "The vocabulary problem in human-system communication," Communications of the ACM, vol. 30, no. 11, pp. 964-971, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Because users may use different words to describe the same document or extract different topics from the same document based on their own background knowledge, the lack of a top-down mediation may lead to an increase in the use of incoherent tags to represent the information resources in the system. In other words, the inherent "unstructuredness" of social tags may hinder their potential as navigational cues for searchers because the diversities of users and motivation may lead to diminishing tag-topic relations as the system grows. However, a number of studies have shown that  structures do emerge at the semantic level&lt;ref&gt;

== The distinction between descriptive and predictive models ==
Just like any [[social phenomena]], [[behavioral pattern]]s in social tagging systems can be characterized by either a [[Descriptive statistics|descriptive]] or [[predictive model]]. While descriptive models ask the question of "what", predictive models go deeper to also ask the question of "why" by attempting to provide explanations to the aggregate behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hedstrom|Hedstrom, Peter]] (2005). Dissecting the social. On the principle of analytic sociology. Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be no general agreement on what an acceptable explanation should be like, many believe that a good explanation should have certain level of predictive accuracy. Descriptive models of social tagging typically are not concerned with explaining the actions of single individuals but describing the patterns that emerge as individual behavior is aggregated in a large social information system. Predictive models, however, attempt to explain aggregate patterns by analyzing how individuals interact and link to each other in ways that bring about similar or different emergent patterns of social behavior. In particular, a mechanism-based predictive model assumes a certain set of rule that individuals interact with each other, and understand how these interactions could produce aggregate patterns as observed and characterized by descriptive models. Predictive models can therefore provide explanations to why different system characteristics may lead to different aggregate patterns, and can therefore potentially provide information on how systems should be designed to achieve different social purposes.

== Descriptive models of social tagging ==
=== Information theory models ===

For most tagging systems the total number of tags in the collective vocabulary is much less than the total number of objects being tagged. Given this multiplicity of tags to documents, a question remains: how effective are the tags at isolating any single document? Naively, if we specify a single tag in this system we would uniquely identify lots of documents – thus the answer to our question is "not very well!". However this method carries a faulty assumption; not every document is equal. Some documents are more popular and important than others, and this importance is conveyed by the number bookmarks per document. Thus, we can reformulate the above question to be: how well does the mapping of tags to documents retain about the distribution of the documents?  [[Information theory]] provides a natural framework to understand the amount of shared information between two random variables. The conditional entropy measures the amount of entropy remaining in one random variable when we know the value of a second random variable.  Work done by Chi and Mytkowicz&lt;ref&gt;Ed H. Chi, Todd Mytkowicz. Understanding the Efficiency of Social Tagging Systems using Information Theory. In Proc. of ACM Conference on Hypertext 2008. (to appear). ACM Press, 2008. Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; show that the entropy of documents conditional on tags, H(D|T), is increasing rapidly. What this means is that, even after knowing completely the value of a tag, the entropy of the set of documents is increasing over time. Conditional Entropy asks the question: "Given that I know a set of tags, how much uncertainty regarding the document set that I was referencing with those tags remains?" The fact that this curve is strictly increasing suggests that the specificity of any given tag is decreasing. That is to say, as a navigation aid, tags are becoming harder and harder to use. We are moving closer and closer to the proverbial "needle in a haystack" where any single tag references too many documents to be considered useful. 

Another way to look at the data is to think about [[mutual information]], which is a measure of independence between the two variables. Full independence is reached when I(D;T) = 0. Chi and Mytkowicz research on delicious social tagging data show that as a measure of usefulness of the tags and their encoding, there is a worsening trend in the ability of users to specify and find tags and documents when they are engaged in simple fact retrieval. This suggests that we need to build search and recommendation systems that help users sift through resources in social tagging systems, especially when we are engaged in more than simple fact retrieval as characterized by the information theory. In fact, although the number of documents associated with any given tag is increasing, there are many ways contextual information can help users to look for relevant information. This is in fact one of the major weakness of the simple information theory in explaining usefulness of tags – it ignores the fact that humans can extract meanings from a set of tags assigned to a document, and this semantic extraction process is exactly the reason why humans are able to communicate efficiently even though the size of our vocabulary is increasing ever since language was developed. For example, the work by Cattuto et al. (2007),&lt;ref name="Cattuto, C. 2007"&gt;Cattuto, C., Loreto, V., and Pietronero, L., Semiotic Dynamics and Collaborative Tagging. Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, (2007), 104, 1461-1464.&lt;/ref&gt; published in PNAS, show that while the number of tags are increasing, the general growth pattern is scale-free – the general distribution of tag-tag co-occurrences follows a power-law. Cattuto also finds that the characteristics of this scale-free distribution are dependent on the semantics of the tag – tags that are semantically general (e.g., blogs) tend to co-occur with many tags, while semantically narrow tags (e.g., Ajax) tend to co-occur with few number of tags across a wide set of documents in a social tagging system. What this means is that the assumption of the information theory approach is too simple – when the semantics of the set of tags assigned to documents are taken into account, the predictive value of tags on contents of documents are relatively stable. This finding is important for development of [[recommender system]]s – discovering these higher level semantic patterns is important in helping people to find relevant information (also see semantic imitation model below).

=== Tag convergence ===
 
Despite this potential vocabulary problem, recent research has found that at the aggregate level, tagging behavior seemed relatively stable and that the tag choice proportions seemed to be converging rather than diverging. While these observations provided evidence against the proposed vocabulary problem, they also triggered a series of research investigating how and why tag proportions tended to converge over time. 

One explanation for the stability was that there was an inherent propensity for users to "imitate" word use of others  as they create tags. This propensity may act as a form of social cohesion that fosters the coherence of tag-topic relations in the system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leads to stability in the system. Golder and Huberman showed that the stochastic urn model by Eggenberger and Pólya&lt;ref&gt;F. Eggenberger and G. Pólya, Uber Die Statistik Verketter Vorgage. Zeit. Angew. Math. Mech, (1923), 1,   279-289.&lt;/ref&gt; was useful in explaining how simple imitation behavior at the individual level could explain the converging usage patterns of tags. Specifically, convergence of tag choices was simulated by a process in which a colored ball was randomly selected from an urn and was replaced in the urn along with an additional ball of the same color, simulating the probabilistic nature of tag reuse. The simple model, however, does not explain why certain tags would to be "imitated" more often than others, and therefore cannot provide a realistic mechanism for tag choices and how social tags could be utilized as navigational cues during exploratory search, not to mention the obviously over-simplified representation of individual users by balls in an urn.

=== Complex systems dynamics and emergent vocabularies===

Other research, using data from the social bookmarking website [[Del.icio.us]], has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of [[complex system]]s (or [[Self-organization|self-organizing]]) dynamics.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref" &gt;Harry Halpin, Valentin Robu, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602 The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging], Proceedings 6th International Conference on the World Wide Web (WWW'07), Banff, Canada, pp. 211-220, ACM Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable [[power law]] distributions.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref" /&gt; Once such stable distributions form, examining the [[correlation]]s between different tags can be used to construct simple [[folksonomy]] graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtain a form of community or shared vocabularies.&lt;ref name="TWEB-ref" &gt;Valentin Robu, Harry Halpin, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1594173.1594176 Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems], ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), article 14, ACM Press, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Such vocabularies can be seen as emerging from the decentralised actions of many users, as a form of [[crowdsourcing]].

=== Tag choice by stochastic process ===

The memory-based Yule-Simon (MBYS) model of Cattuto&lt;ref name="Cattuto, C. 2007"/&gt; attempted to explain tag choices by a stochastic process. They found that the temporal order of tag assignment influences users' tag choices. Similar to the stochastic urn model, the MBYS model assumed that at each time step a tag would be randomly sampled: with probability p the sampled tag was new, and with probability 1-p the sampled tag was copied from existing tags. When copying, the probability of selecting a tag was assumed to decay with time, and this decay function was found to follow a power law distribution. Thus, tags that were recently used had a higher probability of being reused than those used in the past. One major finding by Cattuto et al. was that semantically general tags (e.g., "blog") tended to co-occur more frequently with other tags than semantically narrower tags (e.g., "ajax"), and this difference could be captured by the decay function of tag reuse in their  model. Specifically, they found that a slower decay parameter (when the tag is reused more often) could explain the phenomenon that semantically general tags tended to co-occur with a larger set of tags. In other words, they argued that the "semantic breadth" of a tag could be modeled by a memory decay function, which could lead to different emergent behavioral patterns in a tagging system.

== Predictive models of social tagging ==
=== Semantic imitation model of social tag choices ===
Descriptive models mentioned above were based on analyses of word-word relations as revealed by the various statistical structures in the organization of tags (e.g., how likely one tag would co-occur with other tags or how likely each tag was reused over time). These models are therefore descriptive models at the aggregate level, and have little to offer about predictions at the level of interface interactions and cognitive processes of individual. 
Rather than imitating other users at the word level, one possible explanation for this kind of social cohesion could be grounded on the natural tendency for people to process tags at the semantic level, and it was at this level of processing that most imitation occurred. This explanation was supported by research in the area of reading comprehension,&lt;ref&gt;Kintsch, W. (1988). The role of knowledge in discourse comprehension: A construction-integration model. Psychological Review, 95, 163–182.&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that people tended to be influenced by meanings of words, rather than the words themselves during comprehension. Assuming that background knowledge of people in the same culture tend to have shared structures (e.g., using similar vocabularies and their corresponding meanings in order to conform and communicate with each), users of the same social tagging system may also share similar semantic representations of words and concepts, even when the use of tags may vary across individuals at the word level. In other words, we argued that part of the reason for the stability of social tagging systems can be attributed to the shared semantic representations among the users, such that users may have relatively stable and coherent interpretation of information contents and tags as they interact with the system. Based on this assumption, the semantic imitation model&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicts how different semantic representations may lead to differences in individual tag choices and eventually different emergent properties at the aggregate behavioral level. The model also predicts that the folksonomies (i.e., knowledge structures) in the system reflect the shared semantic representations of the users.

Semantic imitation has important implication to the general vocabulary problem (see work by, e.g., [[Susan Dumais]]) in information retrieval and human-computer interaction – the creation of large number of diverse tags to describe the same set of information resource. The finding that semantic imitation occurs implies that the unit of communication among users is more likely at the semantic level, not at the word level. Thus, although there may not be strong coherence in the choice of words in describing a resource, at the semantic level there seems to be a stronger coherence force that guides the convergence of descriptive indices. This is in sharp contrast to conclusions derived based on a purely information-theoretical approach, which assumes that humans search and evaluation information at the word level. Instead, the process of semantic imitation in social tagging implies that the information-theoretic approach is at most incomplete, as it does not take into account the basic unit of human information processing. Similar to the fact that human communication occurs at the semantic level, the fact that people may use different words or syntax does not affect the effectiveness of communication, so long as the underlying "common ground" between the two persons is the same.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, H. H. (1996). Using language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the social tagging case, so long as users share similar understanding of the contents of the information resources, the fact that the information value of tag-document decreases (that humans have more words in their languages) do not imply that it will always be harder to find relevant information (similarly, the fact that there are more words in our languages does not mean that our communication becomes less effective). However, it does point to the notion that one needs to effectively present these semantic structures in the information system so that people can effectively interpret the semantics of the tagged documents. Intelligent techniques based on statistical models of language such as [[latent semantic analysis]], probabilistic topics model, etc. are promising aspects that will overcome this vocabulary problem.

'''Murder of Jagendra Singh''' refers to the killing of a journalist in [[India]] by setting him on fire on 1 June. Jagendra Singh was an [[India]]n [[journalist]] from [[Shahjahanpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]. He died on 8 June 2015 from [[burn injuries]]. He had allegedly been set on fire on 1 June 2015 by some local policemen and [[Criminal|criminals]] allegedly under the directions of Uttar Pradesh Minister [[Rammurti Singh Verma]].&lt;ref name=BurntAliveTOI&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalist burnt alive; UP minister, cops charged|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Journalist-burnt-alive-UP-minister-cops-charged/articleshow/47607739.cms|accessdate=13 June 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh had worked for [[Hindi language]] media for 15 years.&lt;ref name=LinkedNYT/&gt;

==Background==
Singh used to run a [[Facebook]] page called ''Shahjahanpur Samachar''. It had a number of followers and Singh had written posts about Verma's alleged links to corruption and [[Mining scams in India|illegal mining]].&lt;ref name=WhyDidDNA/&gt; But, he had not backed the claims by posting evidence.&lt;ref name=9OthersHT/&gt;

On 4 May 2015, Rammurti Verma and some of his henchmen allegedly had raped a female [[Anganwadi]] worker. She later told a local court that a [[First Information Report]] (FIR) was being refused to be filed against Ram Murti Verma. Jagendra Singh had taken up the news. Verma had claimed that it was a political ploy by his rivals and Singh to plant the fake case against him.&lt;ref name=BurntAliveTOI/&gt; On 22 May 2015, Singh wrote a post saying that he was being harassed by policemen, criminals, politicians and that he feared that he might be killed by Verma.&lt;ref name=LinkedNYT/&gt;

On 1 June 2015, according to his family members, a group of policemen and goons came in two cars in late afternoon and barged into his house in [[Shahjahanpur]]. Initially, they got into an argument with him reminding him that he had been repeatedly told not to write anything against Verma. Then they pinned him down, poured [[petrol]] on him and set him on fire.&lt;ref name=BurntAliveTOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=LinkedNYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian Journalist Who Linked Official to Graft Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/asia/indian-journalist-who-linked-official-to-graft-dies.html|accessdate=13 June 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to the district hospital in Shahjahanpur initially. Later, he was shifted to [[King George's Medical University]] in [[Lucknow]] where he died.&lt;ref name=9OthersHT/&gt;

Initially, the Superintendent of Police of Shahjahanpur, Babloo Kumar, had claimed that Singh was not a journalist, and had committed suicide.&lt;ref name=LinkedNYT/&gt; The police had also said he had an ongoing investigation against him and they had gone to arrest him when he attempted suicide.&lt;ref name=LinkedNYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian Journalist Who Linked Official to Graft Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/asia/indian-journalist-who-linked-official-to-graft-dies.html|accessdate=13 June 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnFireIndUK&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalist set on fire in India after Facebook post making allegations against local politician|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/journalist-set-on-fire-in-india-after-facebook-post-making-allegations-against-local-politician-10307785.html|accessdate=13 June 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BurntIBN&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalist allegedly burnt to death for Facebook posts against Samajwadi Party MLA Ram Murti in UP|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/journalist-allegedly-burnt-to-death-for-facebook-posts-against-samajwadi-party-mla-ram-murti-in-up-1003652.html|accessdate=13 June 2015|work=[[IBNLive]]|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said they knocked on the door and waited.

==Death==
In his [[dying declaration]], Singh held Verma responsible for the attack and added that another attempt had been made on his life on 28 April 2015. He died of his injuries in a [[Lucknow]] hospital on 8 June.&lt;ref name=BurntAliveTOI/&gt; Soon afterwards, a video appeared on the internet which a badly burned Singh lying on his hospital bed talking to the camera.

Following Singh's death, his son Raghvendra Singh filed a police case. A FIR was filed against minister [[Ram Murti Verma]], a [[police inspector]] Prakash Rai of Kotwali police station and four others. They were charged under Sections 302 ([[murder]]), 120B ([[criminal conspiracy]]), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke [[breach of the peace]]) and 506 ([[criminal intimidation]]) of the [[Indian Penal Code]].&lt;ref name=WhyDidDNA&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalist burnt alive: Why did they burn me, asked Jagendra Singh lying on hospital bed|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-journalist-burnt-alive-why-did-they-burn-me-asked-jagendra-singh-lying-on-hospital-bed-2095130|accessdate=13 June 2015|work=[[DNA India]]|date=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June 2015, 5 policemen suspected to be involved in the case were suspended, among them was Sri Prakash Rai.&lt;ref name=ScribeTOI&gt;{{cite news|title=Scribe murder: 5 cops suspended, but minister, aides still at large|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Scribe-murder-5-cops-suspended-but-minister-aides-still-at-large/articleshow/47660332.cms|accessdate=14 June 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2015, ''[[The Hindu]]'' newspaper reported that according to its sources the forensic report says that the burns were self-inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/forensic-report-terms-up-scribes-burns-selfinflicted/article7347799.ece |title=Scribe burnt himself, says forensic report |author=Mohammad Ali |date=24 June 2015 |newspaper=The Hindu |accessdate= 27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The Chairman of the [[Press Council of India]], [[Chandramauli Kumar Prasad]], on 10 June called it an attack on the [[freedom of press]] and asked the state government to form a Special Investigative Team (SIT) consisting of officers of good character to handle the case.&lt;ref name=WhyDidDNA/&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] urged the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] to start an independent inquiry into the case.

On 12 June 2015, [[Ram Gopal Yadav]], the General Secretary of [[Samajwadi Party]] to which the prime accused belonged, told media persons that Verma will not be removed from state cabinet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40122">'''''Mycoplasma laboratorium''''' is a designed, partially [[synthetic biology|synthetic]] species of [[bacterium]] derived from the [[genome]] of ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]''. This effort in [[synthetic biology]] is being undertaken at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] by a team of approximately 20 scientists headed by [[Nobel laureate]] [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith]] and including [[DNA]] researcher [[Craig Venter]] and [[microbiologist]] [[Clyde A. Hutchison III]].  ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' was chosen as it was the species with the smallest number of genes known at that time.

On May 21, 2010, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] reported that the Venter group had successfully synthesized the genome of the bacterium ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' from a computer record and transplanted it into an existing cell of ''[[Mycoplasma capricolum]]'' that had its DNA removed. The team used ''M. mycoides'' instead of ''M. genitalium'' because it grew faster. The new bacterium was viable—that is, capable of [[bacterial replication|replicating]] billions of times—but not, strictly speaking, a truly synthetic life form.&lt;ref group="b"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists create synthetic cell, version 1.0|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20005533-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

It is estimated that the synthetic genome cost US$40 million and 200 [[man-hour#Similar units|man-years]] to produce.&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"/&gt; Despite the controversy, Venter's company [[Synthetic Genomics]] has secured over $110 million in investment capital and inked a $300 million deal with [[Exxon Mobil]] to design [[algae fuel|algae for diesel fuel]].&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"/&gt;

==''Mycoplasma''==
{{main|Mycoplasma}}

''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' was chosen as it was the species with the smallest number of genes known at that time.

''Mycoplasma'' is a genus of [[bacteria]] of the class [[Mollicutes]] in the division [[Tenericutes]], characterised by the lack of a [[cell wall]] (making it [[Gram negative]]) due to its [[parasitism|parasitic]] or [[commensalism|commensal]] lifestyle.
In [[molecular biology]], the genus has received much attention, both for being a notoriously difficult-to-eradicate (immune to [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam]] and other [[antibiotics]]) contaminant in mammalian [[cell culture]]s,&lt;ref group="a"&gt;Young L, Sung J, Stacey G, Masters JR. "Detection of ''Mycoplasma'' in cell cultures". ''Nat Protoc.'' 2010 '''5'''(5): 929–34. Epub 2010 Apr 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and for its potential uses as a [[model organism]]: the second published complete bacterial genome sequence was that of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'', which has one of the smallest [[genome]]s of any free-living (non-[[parasitic]]) organism.&lt;ref group="a" name=Fraser&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Fraser CM, Gocayne JD, White O, etal |title=The minimal gene complement of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=270 |issue=5235 |pages=397–403 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7569993 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5235.397|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7569993|bibcode = 1995Sci...270..397F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''M. pneumoniae'' genome sequence was published soon afterward and was the first genome sequence determined by [[primer walking]] of a [[cosmid]] library instead of the [[whole-genome shotgun]] method.&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Himmelreich R, Hilbert H, Plagens H, Pirkl E, Li BC, Herrmann R |title=Complete sequence analysis of the genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=24 |issue=22 |pages=4420–49 |date=November 1996 |pmid=8948633 |pmc=146264 |doi= 10.1093/nar/24.22.4420|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8948633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, this species was chosen as a model for the [[artificial cell|minimal cell]] project,&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Hutchison CA, Montague MG | chapter = Mycoplasmas and the minimal genome concept | title=Molecular Biology and Pathogenicity of Mycoplasmas (Razin S, Herrmann R, eds.)| pages=221–54 | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum | location=New York |year = 2002 | chapter-url = | isbn = 978-0-306-47287-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; catalog the entire protein content of a cell.&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Regula JT, Ueberle B, Boguth G, etal |title=Towards a two-dimensional proteome map of Mycoplasma pneumoniae |journal=Electrophoresis |volume=21 |issue=17 |pages=3765–80 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11271496 |doi=10.1002/1522-2683(200011)21:17&lt;3765::AID-ELPS3765&gt;3.0.CO;2-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other genera==
''[[Pelagibacter ubique]]'' (an [[Alphaproteobacteria|α-proteobacterium]] of the order [[Rickettsiales]]) has the smallest known genome (1,308,759 base pairs) of any free living organism and is one of the smallest self-replicating cells known. It is possibly the most numerous bacterium in the world (perhaps 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; individual cells) and, along with other members of the [[Pelagibacterales|SAR11 clade]], are estimated to make up between a quarter and a half of all bacterial or [[archaea]]l cells in the ocean.&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Morris RM, etal | title=SAR11 clade dominates ocean surface bacterioplankton communities |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=420 |pages=806–10 | year=2002 | doi=10.1038/nature01240 | pmid=12490947 | issue=6917|bibcode = 2002Natur.420..806M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this species was identified only in 2002 by [[16S ribosomal RNA|rRNA sequences]] and was fully sequenced in 2005,&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Stephen J.

&lt;!-- There reason why 3 extra species are present is that N. equitans is smaller in size but has more genes, the other sequenced species are Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, Blochmannia genus, many Buchnera and many mycoplasmata and Ureaplasma, so not that interesting.  --&gt;

==Minimal genome project==
The team started with the bacterium ''M. genitalium'', an [[obligate intracellular parasite]] whose [[genome]] consists of 482 [[gene]]s comprising 582,970 [[base pairs]], arranged on one circular [[chromosome]] (the smallest genome of any known natural organism that can be grown in free culture). They then systematically removed genes to find a minimal set of 382 genes that can sustain life.&lt;ref group="a" name="minimal"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This effort was also known as the '''Minimal Genome Project'''.

The team intends to synthesize chromosome DNA sequences consisting of these 382 genes. Once a version of the minimal 382-gene chromosome has been synthesized, it is intended to be transplanted into a ''M. genitalium'' cell to create Mycoplasma laboratorium.

The resulting Mycoplasma laboratorium bacterium is expected to be able to [[DNA replication|replicate]] itself with its man-made DNA, making it the most synthetic organism to date, although the molecular machinery and chemical environment that would allow it to replicate would not be synthetic.&lt;ref group="b" name="pilk"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003, the team had reported a fast method of synthesizing a genome from scratch, producing the 5386-base genome of the [[bacteriophage]] [[Phi X 174]] in about two weeks.&lt;ref  group="a" name="virus"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the genome of Mycoplasma laboratorium is about 50 times larger. In January 2008, the team reported to have synthesized the complete 582,970 base pair chromosome of ''M. genitalium'', with small modifications so that it won't be infectious and can be distinguished from the [[wild type]].

Venter hopes to eventually synthesize bacteria to manufacture [[hydrogen]] and [[biofuel]]s, and also to absorb [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es. [[George M. Church]], another pioneer in [[synthetic biology]], holds that ''[[E. coli]]'' is a more efficient organism than ''M. genitalium'' and that creating a fully synthetic genome is not necessary and too costly for such tasks; he points out that synthetic genes have already been incorporated into ''E.coli'' to perform some of the above tasks.&lt;ref group="b" name=sciam&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=longest-piece-of-dna-yet Longest Piece of Synthetic DNA Yet], ''Scientific American News'', 24 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--copypaste--&gt;
On June 28, 2007, a team at the J. Craig Venter Institute published an article in ''Science Express'', saying that they had successfully transplanted the natural DNA from a ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' bacterium into a ''[[Mycoplasma capricolum]]'' cell, creating a bacterium which behaved like a ''M. mycoides''.&lt;ref group="a" name="transfer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On Oct 6, 2007, Craig Venter announced in an interview with UK's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper that the same team had synthesized a modified version of the single [[chromosome]] of ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' [[Artificial gene synthesis|chemically]]. The chromosome was modified to eliminate all genes which tests in live bacteria had shown to be unnecessary. The next planned step in this ''minimal genome project'' is to transplant the synthesized minimal genome into a bacterial cell with its old DNA removed; the resulting bacterium will be called Mycoplasma laboratorium. The next day the Canadian [[bioethics]] group, [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] issued a statement through their representative, [[Pat Roy Mooney|Pat Mooney]], saying Venter's "creation" was "a chassis on which you could build almost anything". The synthesized genome had not yet been transplanted into a working cell.&lt;ref group="b" name="pilk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/oct/06/genetics.climatechange|publisher=The Guardian|date=6 Oct 2009 | accessdate=23 Nov 2012 | title=I am creating artificial life, declares US gene pioneer | location=London | first=Ed | last=Pilkington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2010, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] reported that the Venter group had successfully synthesized the genome of the bacterium ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' from a computer record, and transplanted the synthesized genome into the existing cell of a ''Mycoplasma capricolum'' bacterium that had had its DNA removed. The "synthetic" bacterium was viable, i.e. capable of replicating billions of times. The team had originally planned to use the ''M. genitalium'' bacterium they had previously been working with, but switched to ''M. mycoides'' because the latter bacterium grows much faster, which translated into quicker experiments.&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They have also shown that the natural genome of ''M. mycoides'' can be transplanted but has yet to show that the same could be done for ''M. genitalium''.&lt;ref group="b" name="kwok"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genomics: DNA's master craftsmen |author= Roberta Kwok |journal= Nature |year= 2010 |volume=468|issue=7320|pages=22–5 |doi= 10.1038/468022a |pmid=21048740 |bibcode = 2010Natur.468...22K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter describes it as "the first species.... to have its parents be a computer".&lt;ref group="b"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8695992.stm |title=How scientists made 'artificial life' |accessdate=2010-05-21 | work=BBC News | date=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformed bacterium is dubbed "Synthia" by ETC.  A Venter spokesperson has declined to confirm any breakthrough at the time of this writing, likely because similar genetic introduction techniques such as [[transfection]], [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]], [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] and [[protofection]] have been a standard research practice for many years.

Now that the technique has been proven to work with the ''M. mycoides'' genome, the next project is presumably to go back to the minimized ''M. genitalium'' and transplant it into a cell to create the previously mentioned Mycoplasma laboratorium.

The creation of a new synthetic bacterium was announced in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] on March 25, 2016.  It has only 473 genes, the fewest genes of any freely living organism.   
This fast growing new cell, called Syn 3.0, was created by transplanting the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, with all the unessential DNA removed, into a Mycoplasma capricolum, which had been emptied of its own DNA.

M. genitalium was not used because it reproduces too slowly.

==Bacterial genome transplantation==
In order to propagate a synthetic genome, the technique to transplant an intact whole bacterial genome into another had to be developed.
Oswald Avery's pioneering experiments in the 1940s showed that some bacteria could take up naked DNA,&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avery OT, Macleod CM, McCarty M | title=Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcal Types : Induction of Transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated From Pneumococcus Type III | journal=J Exp Med | date=Feb 1, 1944 | volume=79| issue=2 |pages=137–58 | doi=10.1084/jem.79.2.137 | pmid=19871359 | pmc=2135445}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the advent of [[Molecular cloning|molecular cloning techniques]] DNA elements could be transformed into [[competent cells]], typically [[cloning vectors]], around 5-20 kbp long,  and even [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s can be maintained.
In 2007, Venter's team reported that they had managed to transfer the chromosome of the species ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' to ''Mycoplasma capricolum'' by means of:
* isolating the genome of ''M. mycoides'': gentle lysis of cells trapped in agar—molten agar mixed with cells and left to form a gel—followed by [[PFGE|pulse field gel electrophoresis]] and the band of the correct size (circular 1.25Mbp) being isolated;
* making the recipient cells of ''M. capricolum'' competent: growth in rich media followed starvation in poor media where the nucleotide starvation results in inhibition of DNA replication and change of morphology; and
* [[polyethylene glycol]]-mediated transformation of the circular chromosome to the DNA-free cells followed by selection.&lt;ref group="a" name="transfer"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Lartigue C, Glass JI, Alperovich N, Pieper R, Parmar PP, Hutchison CA 3rd, Smith HO, Venter JC | title= Genome transplantation in bacteria: changing one species to another | journal=Science | date=Aug 3, 2007 | volume=317 |issue=5838 |pages=632–8|bibcode = 2007Sci...317..632L |doi = 10.1126/science.1144622 | pmid=17600181| citeseerx= 10.1.1.395.4374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] is used to refer to insertion of a vector into a bacterial cell (by electroporation or heatshock). Here, transplantation is used akin to [[Nuclear transfer|nuclear transplantation]].

The switch from ''M. genitalium'' to ''M. mycoides'' was spurred due to the faster growth of the latter.&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"/&gt;

==Bacterial chromosome synthesis==
It is possible to create DNA sequences with the use of chemicals ([[oligonucleotide synthesis]]) which is achieved by successive rounds of [[Protective group|deprotection and coupling]] of protected [[Phosphoramidite|phosphoramidite nucleotides]] with geometrically decreasing yields to length, making sequences longer than 1000 base-pairs unfeasible. For longer sequences, DNA ligation is required. In 2008 Venter's group published a paper showing that they had managed to create a synthetic genome (a copy of ''M. mycoides'' sequence [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/256384469 CP001621]) by means of a hierarchical strategy:&lt;ref group="a"  name="synthesis"/&gt;
*Synthesis → 1kbp: The genome sequence was synthesized by [http://www.blueheronbio.com/ Blue Heron] in 1078 1080bp cassettes with 80bp overlap and NotI restriction sites (inefficient but rare cutter).
*Ligation → 10kbp: 109 Groups of a series of 10 consecutive cassettes were ligated and cloned in E.coli on a plasmid and the correct permutation checked by sequencing, this would follow a [[geometric distribution]] with expected number of trials of 10.
*Multiplex PCR → 100kbp: 11 Groups of a series of 10 consecutive 10kbp assemblies (grown in yeast) were joined by multiplex PCR, using a primer pair for each 10kbp assembly.
*Isolation and recombination → secondary assemblies were isolated by means of the plug method above and joining and transformed into yeast spheroplasts without a vector sequence (present in assembly 811-900).

==Synthetic genome==

In 2010, using the  methods described above, Venter and colleagues created a strain of Mycoplasma mycoides called '''JCVI-syn1.0''' with a synthetic genome.&lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibson|first1=D. G.|last2=Glass|first2=J. I.|last3=Lartigue|first3=C.|last4=Noskov|first4=V. N.|last5=Chuang|first5=R.-Y.|last6=Algire|first6=M. A.|last7=Benders|first7=G. A.|last8=Montague|first8=M.

Given the fact that the natural genome worked, the cause of the failed growth was an frameshift mutation in [[DnaA]], a [[Initiation factor|replication initiation factor]], which, once corrected, worked and was verified.&lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"/&gt;

The construction of a cell with a synthetic genome was done to test the methodology—allowing more modified genomes to be created in the future. To minimize sources of failure, the genome was created using a natural genome as a template. Due to the large size of a genome, apart from the elements required for propagation in yeast and residues from restriction sites, several differences are present in ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' JCVI-syn1.0 notably an ''E.coli'' transposon IS1 (an infection from the 10kb stage) and an 85bp duplication.&lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"/&gt;

However, the project has received heavy criticism as it claims to have created a synthetic organism. This claim arises from the fact that the genome was synthesized chemically in many pieces (a synthetic method), joined together by means of molecular biological techniques (an artificial method), and transplanted into the cytoplasm of a natural cell (after a few generations, though, the original protein content is undetectable){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.
The two species used as donor and recipient are of the same genus as the more distant two species are, the less the correct protein interactions are maintained, such as binding factors and binding sites, which mutate together ([[epistasis]]).&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Povolotskaya | first1 = IS | last2 = Kondrashov | first2 = FA | date = Jun 2010 | title = Sequence space and the ongoing expansion of the protein universe | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7300| pages = 922–6 | doi=10.1038/nature09105 | pmid=20485343| bibcode = 2010Natur.465..922P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, [[Paul Keim]] (a molecular geneticist at [[Northern Arizona University]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]) notes that "there are great challenges ahead before genetic engineers can mix match, and fully design an organism's genome from scratch" &lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pennisi E |title=Genomics.

DNA is the template for protein construction and requires proteins as helper molecules to do so, a chicken-and-egg conundrum solved by the [[RNA world hypothesis]], consequently synthetic naked DNA would require several proteins to create a viable cell. In 2000 and 2002 teams synthesized replicating [[hepatitis C virus]] (about 9600 nucleotides long)&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Efficient initiation of HCV RNA replication in cell culture |vauthors=Blight KJ, Kolykhalov AA, Rice CM | journal=Science | date=Dec 8, 2000 | volume=290 | issue=5498 | pages=1972–4| pmid= 11110665|bibcode = 2000Sci...290.1972B |doi = 10.1126/science.290.5498.1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[poliovirus]] (about 7500 nucleotides long),&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cello | first1 = J | last2 = Paul | first2 = AV | last3 = Wimmer | first3 = E | date = Aug 2002 | title = Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template | url = | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5583| pages = 1016–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1072266 | pmid=12114528| bibcode = 2002Sci...297.1016C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viruses, however, replicate by utilising host protein expression machinery. Furthermore, whereas DNA can easily be replicated (using [[DNA polymerase]]), transcribed (using [[RNA polymerase]]), and translated (using [[ribosomes]] and many other factors)—all ''in vitro'', such reactions, so far, use cell extracts and most components have not been synthesized de novo—that is from inorganic or synthetically made organic chemicals only.

===Watermarks===
[[File:Hidden watermark.jpg|thumb|A hidden watermark on a semiconductor chip from 1976, acting as a signature of its creators. In an analogous way, JC Venter and his team added watermarks using [[stop codon]]s to sign their creation.]]
A much publicised feature of the Mycoplasma laboratorium is the presence of watermark sequences as an ultimate proof of the achievement and as a publicity stunt—similar to the tradition of [[chip art]], inscriptions on unused portions of microchips visible only by electron microscopy. The 4 watermarks (present in figure 1 in supplementary material of &lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"/&gt;) are coded messages in the form of DNA [[base pair]]s, of 1246, 1081, 1109 and 1222 base pairs respectively, in natural [[peptide sequence|peptides]] the 4 [[nucleotide]]s encode in [[codon|sets of 3]] the 20 natural amino acids by means of the [[genetic code|standard genetic code]]. Each amino acid ''by convention'' is represented by a letter, but in nature there is nothing which ties [[alanine]], a molecule, to the Latin letter [[A]], a vowel, so this convention was disregarded in the latter watermarks. In the minimal genome organism the watermark were encoded as amino acids, with [[V]] as [[U]], both in reference to Latin inscriptions and the lack of a standard amino acid for U containing the names of the researchers:
(VENTERINSTITVTE, CRAIGVENTER,  HAMSMITH,  CINDIANDCLYDE,  GLASSANDCLYDE).  In the synthetic organism, instead the Latin alphabet—which in English has 26 letters, which is covered only in base 4 with 3 or more digits—was encoded by an undisclosed encoding. The encoding is fixed and 3 digits make an uppercase letter or {{small caps|Ascii}} symbol, possibly randomly allocated (not [[ASCII table|{{small caps|Ascii}} table]], frequency or [[Keyboard layout|keyboard order]]).&lt;ref group="b"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Shirriff |url=http://www.arcfn.com/2010/06/using-arc-to-decode-venters-secret-dna.html |title=Using Arc to decode Venter's secret DNA watermark |publisher=Ken Shirriff's blog |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the watermarks is as follows:
# watermark 1 an {{Small caps|Html}} script which reads to a browser as  text congratulating the decoder with an email link to click to prove the decoding.
# watermark 2 contains a list of authors and a quote from [[James Joyce]]: "To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life".
# watermark 3 contains more authors and a quote from [[Robert Oppenheimer]] (uncredited): "See things not as they are, but as they might be".
# watermark 4 contains yet more authors and a quote from [[Richard Feynman]]: "What I cannot build, I cannot understand".

==Concerns and controversy==

===Press coverage===
The main controversy from the project is the undue amount of publicity it received from the press due to Venter's showmanship, to the degree that [[Jay Keasling]], a pioneering synthetic biologist and founder of Amyris says "The only regulation we need is of my colleague's mouth".&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"&gt;Andrew Pollack, His Corporate Strategy: The Scientific Method, NYTimes, September 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
Despite the funding for practical applications, as stressed by [[George M. Church]], one of the main players in the field of synthetic biology, a few changes are required to obtain useful organisms now, such as [[Biofuel from algae|biofuel production]] or [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"/&gt; However, speculation about the distant future's possible applications is rife.
Venter himself is prone to such speculations, having asked for example, "What if we can make algae taste like beef?"&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"/&gt; If it were possible to create  a synthetic cell without the use of preexisting recipient cells, however, many applications would become achievable which would be otherwise unattainable, such as a completely overhauled bacterium that works in a logically controlled way—removing what has been described as 'evolutionary messiness'&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tawfik | first1 = Dan S | year = 2010 | title = Messy biology and the origins of evolutionary innovations | url = | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 10| pages = 692–696 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.441 | pmid=20852602}}&lt;/ref&gt;—with lower mutation rates, categorical gene arrangement (colinearity), the possibility of adding [[Nucleic acid analogues|novel nucleotides]] to increase encoding (a feat achieved in vitro (PCR)); or with a completely novel genetic code, such as has been achieved by experiments in which a few [[Expanded genetic code|additional non-canonical amino acids]] were added.

The '''PanCam''' (Panoramic Camera) assembly is a set of two wide angle cameras for multi-spectral stereoscopic panoramic imaging, and a high resolution camera for colour imaging that has been designed to search for textural information or shapes that can be related to the presence of microorganisms on [[Mars]]. This camera assembly is part of the science payload on board the [[European Space Agency]]{{'s}} [[ExoMars rover]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/34664-exomars-facts.html ExoMars: Searching for Life on Mars]. Elizabeth Howell, ''Space.com''. March 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked to search for [[biosignature]]s and [[biomarker]]s on Mars. The rover is planned to be launched in July 2020 and [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in March 2021.

== Overview ==

This instrument will provide stereo [[multispectral image]]s, of the terrain nearby. PanCam are the "eyes" of the rover and its primary navigation system. PanCam will also provide the geological context of the sites being explored and help support the selection of the best sites to carry out exobiology studies, as well as assist in some aspect of atmospheric studies.&lt;ref name='PanCam Home'&gt;[http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/?fbodylongid=2127 PanCam - the Panoramic Camera]. [[ESA]]. Accessed 24 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  This system will also monitor the sample from the drill before it is crushed inside the rover, where the analytical instruments will perform a detailed chemical analysis.&lt;ref name='PanCam Home'/&gt;

The Principal Investigator is Andrew Coates of the [[University College London]] in United Kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">'''Pando the Rapacious''' ({{lang-it|Pandone il Rapace}}; died 862 or 863) was the second son of [[Landulf I of Capua]] and brother of [[Lando I of Capua|Lando I]]. When his father died (843), Lando succeeded to the countship, but Pando and their younger brother [[Landulf II of Capua|Landulf]] were associated as co-rulers (with no real power). In fact, he went to [[Salerno]], where he became a ''[[marepaphias]]'' (or ''marepahissatum''/''marepahis'', a Byzantine function).

On Lando's death, his son, [[Lando II of Capua|Lando II]] succeeded him, but Pando deposed him (861) and sent him to govern [[Caiazzo]], taking up the countship of Capua and declaring himself independent from the [[Prince of Salerno]] (862). He did not reign for long, however, and his reign was spent mostly in war for his usurped throne; wars in which he was "rapacious". He destroyed the city of [[Caserta]] (c.863) and captured his nephew Landenulf (Lando II's brother) and forty other ''primarii'' (leading men) of the city. He then built a large, defensive tower around which modern Caserta was built. That tower is now included in the Palazzo della Prefettura, once seat of the counts of Caserta and, later, a royal residence.

Pando died in battle and was succeeded by his son [[Pandenulf of Capua|Pandenulf]], who was deposed, while his younger son [[Landenulf of Capua|Landenulf]] became bishop of Capua in 879. Pandenulf later became the first of a line of counts of Caserta.

'''Parley Parker Pratt Sr.''' (April 12, 1807 – May 13, 1857) was an early leader of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] whose writings became a significant early nineteenth-century exposition of the Latter Day Saint faith. Named in 1835 as one of the first members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], Pratt was part of the Quorum's successful mission to Great Britain from 1839 to 1841. Pratt has been called "the Apostle Paul of Mormonism" for his promotion of distinctive Mormon doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt explored and surveyed [[Parley's Canyon]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] (named in his honor), and subsequently built and maintained the first road for public transportation in the canyon.

Pratt practiced [[plural marriage]]. He was murdered in 1857 by the estranged husband of his twelfth wife. Pratt fathered thirty children. His living descendants in 2011 were estimated to number 30,000 to 50,000. He is the great-great-grandfather of [[Mitt Romney]], the 2012 Republican candidate for President of the United States, and the great-great-great-grandfather of [[Jon Huntsman Jr.]], diplomat and former [[Governor of Utah]], who is currently serving as the [[U.S. Ambassador to Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Jason (March 4, 2011). "Presidential hopefuls Huntsman, Romney share Mormonism and belief in themselves," ''The Washington Post''. Retrieved May 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Pratt was born in [[Burlington, New York]], to Jared Pratt (1769–1839) and his wife, Charity Dickinson (1776–1849), a descendant of [[Anne Hutchinson]].&lt;ref name="Ancestry of Mitt Romney"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/political/romney.html |title= The Ancestors of Mitt Romney |first= William Addams |last= Reitwiesner |authorlink= William Addams Reitwiesner |date= |work= |publisher= William Addams Reitwiesner Genealogical Services (wargs.com) |accessdate= 2011-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Thankful Halsey in [[Canaan, New York]], on September 9, 1827.

The young couple migrated west, where they settled near [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where Pratt purchased land and constructed a home. In Ohio, Pratt became a member of the [[Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)|Reformed Baptist Society]], also called "Disciples of Christ", influenced by the preaching of [[Sidney Rigdon]]. Pratt soon left his property to take up the ministry as a profession.

==Early Latter Day Saint service==
While traveling to visit family in western New York, Pratt read a copy of the [[Book of Mormon]] owned by a Baptist [[deacon]]. Convinced of its authenticity, he traveled to [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]], and spoke to [[Hyrum Smith]]. Pratt was [[Baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptized]] in [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]] by [[Oliver Cowdery]] on or about September 1, 1830, formally joining the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Latter Day Saints church]]. He was ordained to the office of an [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]] in the church. Continuing on to his family's home, he introduced his younger brother, [[Orson Pratt]], to Mormonism and baptized him on September 19, 1830.

Arriving in [[Fayette, New York]], in October 1830, Pratt met [[Joseph Smith]] and was asked to join a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] group assigned to preach to the Native American tribes on the [[Missouri]] frontier. During the trip west, he and his companions stopped to visit Sidney Rigdon. They were instrumental in converting Rigdon and approximately 130 members of his congregation within three weeks. Pratt became close friends with the Smiths, particularly Joseph, with whom he would later experience persecution and imprisonment, including incarceration at [[Liberty Jail]].

In early 1833, Pratt served as a missionary in Illinois. He went to [[Jackson County, Missouri]], where through the summer he headed the School of the Elders, a gathering of about 60 men who studied religious and secular subjects, similar to the [[School of the Prophets]] in [[Kirtland, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=59–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1833, he served as president of the Mormon branch number 8 in Jackson County and as a leader in the Mormon militia. He was among those Latter Day Saints driven into [[Clay County, Missouri]], by mob violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=61–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1834, Pratt and [[Lyman Wight]] headed back to Kirtland to report on the events in Missouri to Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From Kirtland, Pratt traveled with Smith in Pennsylvania and western New York, preaching and trying to recruit people to serve in [[Zion's Camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After traveling together for three weeks, during some of this time with Pratt serving as Smith's scribe, Smith returned to Kirtland from [[Geneseo, New York]], for a court case. Pratt continued his missionary efforts along with Henry Brown. Pratt and Brown went to eastern New York to give his family members money to move to Kirtland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They went to [[Richland, New York]], where Pratt convinced [[Wilford Woodruff]], who had been baptized three months before, to join Zion's Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt returned to Missouri later in 1834 as a member of Zion's Camp.&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt; After Zion's Camp broke up, Pratt rejoined his wife, Thankful, who had remained in Clay County while he had been traveling. While working as a day laborer, Pratt served on the Missouri [[High council (Latter Day Saints)|High Council]]. Thankful had run up large debts in Pratt's absence, and when he returned with her to Ohio, some felt he was trying to flee his creditors and criticized him for it.&lt;ref name = givens7071&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=70–71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt settled in New Portage, Ohio (now part of [[Barberton, Ohio|Barberton]]), where he was the leader of a group of Latter Day Saints there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missionary==
In 1835, after his call as an [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]], Pratt served with other apostles in a mission to New York, New England, and eastern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=77–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt preached in [[Upper Canada]], in and around [[Toronto]], in 1836.  In 1837 and 1838, he preached in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt;

Pratt later served as a missionary in the southern United States and in England, the Pacific islands, and South America. He moved to Chile to begin missionary work in [[Valparaíso]]. In 1852, Pratt and his family left Chile after the death of their child, Omner, without having had much success among the country's Catholic residents.

In addition to having converted his brother Orson and preacher [[Sidney Rigdon]], Parley Pratt introduced the Mormon faith to several future church leaders, including [[Frederick G. Williams]], [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] and his wife, Leonora, [[Isaac Morley]], and [[Joseph Fielding]], along with his sisters, [[Mary Fielding Smith|Mary]] and Mercy.

==Apostle==
In 1835, Pratt entered the leadership of the early Latter Day Saint movement when he was selected as one of the original Quorum of Twelve Apostles. While on a mission to the British Isles in 1839, Pratt edited the newly created periodical, ''[[Millennial Star]]''. While presiding over the church's branches and interests in New England and the mid-Atlantic states, Pratt published a periodical entitled ''The Prophet'' from his headquarters in New York City.&lt;ref name="Givens &amp; Grow 2011 172"&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=172}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missouri War==
After serving as a missionary in New York City, Pratt returned to church headquarters in Missouri in 1838. He was arrested in November 1838, along with Joseph Smith, and was held in prison in [[Richmond, Missouri|Richmond]] and then [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] until escaping on July 4, 1839.&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt; His writings during this and other imprisonments with Smith comprise many first accounts and stories preserved about Smith.

==Writer==
Pratt was a noted religious writer and poet. Many of Pratt's writings are the only credible or lasting accounts from important American and Mormon events, such as the Hauns Mill Massacre and the events and conditions of imprisonment with Smith at Liberty Jail.

Pratt's first printed work was "'The Mormons' So Called", a 5500-word account of the persecution of Mormons in Jackson County in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt wrote [[Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt|an autobiography]], published after his death but likely his most widely read work in the 21st century.&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the autobiography Pratt said that he was a good friend of [[Pantheist]] and [[Freethought|freethinker]] [[John Shertzer Hittell]], author of ''Evidences Against Christianity''. {{cite web|title=Chapter 50 and 51 in Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt|url=http://www.gordonbanks.com/gordon/family/ppprattauto.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a book of poetry in 1835, the first collection of poems by a Latter Day Saint.&lt;ref name = Crawley&gt;Crawley, "Parley P. Pratt", in [[Arnold K. Garr]], [[Donald Q. Cannon]], and [[Richard O. Cowan]] (eds), ''Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 2000) pp. 941–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his poems have become staple [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hymns|Latter Day Saint hymns]], some of which are included in the current [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|hymnal]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Pratt wrote many of these hymns in 1839 while sailing to England to serve as a missionary.&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt; He was involved in compiling a hymnal with 40 hymns of his own work while editor of the ''Millennial Star''.

In 1835, Pratt published a pamphlet about his missionary efforts in [[Mentor, Ohio]].&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt; This work, entitled "A Short Account of a Shameful Outrage", was the first pamphlet ever published by a Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=74–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Pratt's most influential works was a book entitled ''A Voice of Warning'' (1837), first published in New York City.&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt; Givens and Grow say the book was "a work that served the church as its most powerful proselytizing tool—after the Book of Mormon—for more than a century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt made substantial revisions between the first and second editions after Joseph Smith voiced some reservations about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition of ''A Voice of Warning'' was published in 1839.

In 1837, Pratt, along with John Goodson, published the second edition of the [[Book of Mormon]]. It included Pratt's testimony, along with that of the [[Three Witnesses|three]] and [[Eight Witnesses|eight]] witnesses to the [[golden plates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=90–91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of 1837, Pratt published ''Mormonism Unveiled: Zion's Watchman Unmasked'', which is the earliest surviving response by a Mormon to an [[anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] writer.&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt;

Pratt also wrote one of the earliest Mormon works of fiction. His "[[A Dialogue between Joseph Smith and the Devil]]", was published on January 1, 1844, in the ''[[New York Herald]]''. It was a religious treatise in fictional form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Cracroft]] and [[Neal E. Lambert]] (eds), ''A Believing People: Literature of the Latter-day Saints'' (Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1974) pp. 331, 333&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt's most well-known theological work was ''A Key to Science of Theology,'' which was published in 1855.&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt;  Other works by Pratt included ''Late Persecutions'', ''Millennium and Other Poems'', at least ten tracts published while he served as editor of the ''Millennial Star'', and "Proclamation to the People of the Coasts and Islands of the Pacific", written by Pratt in the summer of 1851 in San Francisco, California, and published by W. C. Wandell in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref name = Crawley/&gt;

Pratt's Visions and Poetry also serve as the text for many songs now found in the Latter Day Saint Hymnal.  Pratt's writings also corroborate many events and revelations which are found in a book of Latter Day Saint scripture known as the [[Doctrine and Covenants]].

In total, Pratt is known to have written 31 published works, not including his posthumous autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=398–400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journey to Utah==
After the [[death of Joseph Smith]], Pratt and his family were among the Latter Day Saints who emigrated to what would become [[Utah Territory]]. They continued as members of LDS Church, under the direction of [[Brigham Young]]. Pratt helped establish the refugee settlements and fields at both [[Garden Grove, Iowa|Garden Grove]] and [[Mount Pisgah (Iowa)|Mt. Pisgah, Iowa]]. He personally led a pioneer company along the [[Mormon Trail]] to the Salt Lake Valley.

==Life in Utah==
In 1849, Pratt was appointed one of the justices of the anticipated [[state of Deseret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=275–76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He later served in the legislature of the provisional state of Deseret beginning in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=276–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During this same time, as one of the seven members of the Quorum of the Twelve in Utah, he was among those who oversaw the division of Salt Lake City into [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]] and the organization of other wards in Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime in the mid-1850s, working with [[George D. Watt]], Pratt helped develop the [[Deseret alphabet]]. In 1854, Pratt went to San Francisco, California, to preside over the LDS Church's Pacific [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]]

In 1856, Pratt served as chaplain of the [[Utah Territorial Legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=367}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Parley Parker Pratt's Gravesite.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Parley P. Pratt's grave]]
In 1856, Pratt went on a mission to the eastern United States. At that time, troubles were brewing in Pratt's life. Hector McLean was the estranged husband of one of Pratt's [[plural marriage|plural wives]], Eleanor McLean. Pratt had met Eleanor in San Francisco, where he presided over a church mission. In San Francisco, Eleanor had joined the LDS Church and had also had her oldest sons baptized. Hector rejected Mormonism and opposed his wife's membership in the church. Though they did not divorce, the dispute led to the collapse of their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagley|2002|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing that Eleanor would abscond to [[Utah Territory]] with their children, Hector sent his sons and daughter to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], to live with their maternal grandparents.&lt;ref name= bagley2002p9&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagley|2002|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleanor followed the children to New Orleans, where she lived with them for three months at her parents' house. Eventually, she and the children left for Utah Territory, via Texas; they arrived in [[Salt Lake City]] on September 11, 1855.&lt;ref name = bagley2002p9/&gt; She worked in Pratt's home as a schoolteacher. On November 14, 1855, she and Pratt underwent a "[[celestial marriage]]" [[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing ceremony]] in the [[Endowment House]].&lt;ref name = bagley2002p9/&gt; She was the twelfth woman to be sealed to Pratt. For religious and cultural reasons, Eleanor considered herself unmarried at the time of her sealing to Pratt, but she had not legally divorced from Hector.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Millennial Star]]'' '''19''':432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York World]]'', 23 November 1869, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pratt|1975|pp=6, 9, 24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Pratt was serving a mission in the eastern states, Eleanor went to New Orleans to get her children. Eleanor then took the children from her parents and headed to Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=373}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was at the same time that Pratt was serving as a missionary in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Because Eleanor took the children, Hector blamed Pratt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=372–73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hector pressed criminal charges, accusing Pratt of assisting in the kidnapping of his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratt|1975|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt managed to evade him and the legal charges, but was finally arrested in [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]) in May 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagley|2002|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt and Eleanor McLean were charged with theft of the clothing of McLean's children.&lt;ref name = bagley2002p70&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagley|2002|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (The laws of that time did not recognize the kidnapping of children by a parent as a crime.) Tried before Judge [[John B. Ogden]], Pratt was acquitted because of a lack of evidence and Ogden's own feelings after interviewing Eleanor.&lt;ref name = bagley2002p70/&gt; Ogden sympathized with Eleanor and Pratt, because he was so disgusted by Hector's drinking and wife-beating.&lt;ref name="Doug Gibson"&gt;{{cite news |last= Gibson |first= Doug |date= August 30, 2011 |contribution= Mormon apostle Pratt suffered a violent death at the hands of a cuckold |url= http://blogs.standard.net/the-political-surf/2011/08/30/mormon-apostle-pratt-suffered-a-violent-death-at-the-hands-of-a-cuckold/ |title= The Political Surf |newspaper= [[Standard-Examiner]] |access-date= May 5, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140503190212/http://blogs.standard.net/the-political-surf/2011/08/30/mormon-apostle-pratt-suffered-a-violent-death-at-the-hands-of-a-cuckold/ |archivedate= May 3, 2014 |df  =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being secretly released, on May 13, 1857, Pratt was shot and stabbed by Hector on a farm northeast of [[Van Buren, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name = bagley2002p70/&gt; He died two and a half hours later from loss of blood.&lt;ref name = bagley2002p70/&gt;

As Pratt was bleeding to death, a farmer asked what he had done to provoke the attack. Pratt said, "He accused me of taking his wife and children. I did not do it. They were oppressed, and I did for them what I would do for the oppressed any where."&lt;ref name = bagley2002p70/&gt; Pratt was buried near [[Alma, Arkansas]], despite his desire to be buried in [[Utah Territory]].

Some writers have viewed Pratt's death as the act of a jealous husband, deeply angered by a man who had "run off" with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Wayne Atilio |last= Capurro |title= White Flag: America's First 9/11 |page= 40 |publisher= [[AuthorHouse]] |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-1-4259-9565-2 |oclc= 169899686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 ''[[Provo Daily Herald]]'' newspaper article characterized McLean as a man who had "hunted down" Pratt in retribution for "ruining his marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/article_ca8110b7-dd43-5d09-9a9d-a41914b8f604.html |title= No remains found in dig for Parley P.

Many Mormons viewed Pratt's death as a [[martyrdom]]; his dying words were said to be, "I am dying a martyr to the faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pratt|1975|p=248}} ("I am dying a martyr to the faith").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Peel, "Dying Remarks of Parley P. Pratt," LDS Church Archives. "Peel was in Van Buren at the time of the murder, but his statement was not taken down by Frank Poneroy until 1895."&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 article in the ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'' said that "Pratt was killed near Van Buren, Ark., in May 1857, by a small Arkansas band antagonistic toward his teachings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Carrie A. |last= Moore |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,660211702,00.html?pg=1 |title= LDS-tied events to bisect in Arkansas |newspaper= Deseret Morning News |date= 14 April 2007 |access-date= March 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Will Bagley]] reports that McLean and two friends tracked Pratt after he was released by Van Buren's magistrate.&lt;ref name="bagley2002p70"/&gt; Brigham Young compared Pratt's death to [[death of Joseph Smith|those of Joseph and Hyrum Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;"Reminiscences of Mrs. A. Agatha Pratt", January 7, F564, #16, LDS Church Archives (stating that Young said, "Nothing has happened so hard to reconcile my mind to since the death of Joseph.").&lt;/ref&gt; Other Mormons blamed the death on the state of Arkansas, or its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1950|pp=36–37}}; {{Harvnb|Linn|1902|pp=519–20}} ("It was in accordance with Mormon policy to hold every Arkansan accountable for Pratt's death, just as every Missourian was hated because of the expulsion of the church from that state.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Pratt's personal popularity and his position in the Quorum of the Twelve, his murder was a significant blow to the Latter-day Saint community in the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church leaders learned about the death on June 23, 1857 (''Wilford Woodruff Journal''). The murder was first reported in the ''[[Deseret News]]'' on July 1, 1857.&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt's violent death may also have played a part in events leading up to the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagley|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the massacre, some Mormons circulated rumors that one or more members of the party had murdered Pratt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagley|2002|p=98}} (identification by the widow Pratt).&lt;/ref&gt; poisoned creek water that subsequently sickened Paiute children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagley|2002|pp=105–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed their cattle to graze on private property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagley|2002|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt was one of the better known Mormons among other Americans; for instance, in his 1864-published visit to the Mormons, [[Fitz-Hugh Ludlow]], in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' made a joke about "Mrs. Deacon Pratt" and referred to "[[Parley's Cañon]] (named after the celebrated Elder, Parley Pratt)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Fitz-Hugh Ludlow | date=April 1864 | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1864/04/among-the-mormons/306013/?single_page=true | title=Among the Mormons: A nineteenth-century writer meets Brigham Young and explores the 'City of Saints' (republication) | website=TheAtlantic.com | access-date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
{{main|Pratt family}}
Pratt practiced [[plural marriage]] and had 12 wives, 30 children, and 266 grandchildren. In 2011, Pratt's living descendants were estimated to number 30,000 to 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens|2011|p=342}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife, Thankful Halsey Pratt, died following childbirth in March 1837. (Thankful was a widow ten years older than Pratt when she married him.) Pratt did, however, marry women averaging ten years younger than himself, the greatest age difference occurring with his marriage to his Ann Agatha Walker who was 18 to his 40 years.

On May 14, 1837, Pratt married his second wife, [[Mary Ann Frost Stearns Pratt|Mary Ann Frost Stearns]] (1808–1891), a widow with a daughter. The marriage was performed by [[Frederick G. Williams]].&lt;ref name = Givens95/&gt; Mary Ann was a native of [[Bethel, Maine]] (part of Massachusetts until 1820) whose first relative to join the church was [[Patty Bartlett Sessions]], later a prominent midwife in Utah. Mary Ann was baptized by [[David W. Patten]]. She had come to Kirtland as a widow in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Smith later condemned Latter Day Saints for "marrying in five or six weeks, or even in two or three months, after the death of their companion."&lt;ref name = Givens95&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt may have married Mary Ann so quickly to get back his infant son, although he remained in the care of [[Mary Ann Young]] for nearly a year after Pratt remarried.&lt;ref name = Givens95/&gt; Mary Ann and Pratt at times demonstrated a deep companionship in their marriage, most fully shown by her joining her husband in prison in Missouri.&lt;ref name = Givens318&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After Pratt began practicing [[plural marriage|polygyny]], they became estranged. Pratt suggested his falling out with Mary Ann was "stung by falsehoods which are circulated in the Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=317}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources state that in 1843, Mary Ann Pratt [[List of Joseph Smith's wives|married Joseph Smith]], the church's founder.  This marriage, however, does not appear on most lists of Smith's marriages. That same year, Smith married at least 17 other women—including Mary Ann's sister, Olive Grey Frost. Olive would marry Smith's successor, [[Brigham Young]], after Smith's death in 1844.

Pratt made several attempts to get Mary Ann to join him in traveling west in 1846 and 1847, but after spending the winter of 1846–47 in an abandoned [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], she chose to return to Maine. Pratt provided her with clothes and money upon her return to Maine. She received some of the proceeds from the sale of Pratt's home to a Roman Catholic priest; the Nauvoo home is still used as a residence for Catholic priests.&lt;ref name = Givens318/&gt; In 1852, Mary Ann traveled to Utah Territory, but she and Pratt did not see eye to eye on how to raise their children. Mary Ann received a divorce decree issued by [[Brigham Young]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=317–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Ann then settled in what is now [[Pleasant Grove, Utah]]. She worked as a midwife, remained in the LDS Church and became a leading advocate for Mormon women against the attacks of those opposed to polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=318–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1853, Pratt had seven living wives. These wives were:

*Elizabeth Brotherton (1817–1897). Married Pratt July 24, 1844. They adopted one child.
*Mary Wood (1818–1898). Married Pratt September 9, 1844. Four children including [[Helaman Pratt]].
*Hannahette Snively (1812–1898). Married Pratt November 2, 1844. Three children.
*Belinda Marden (1820–1894). Married Pratt November 20, 1844. Five children.
*Sarah Houston (1822–1886). Married Pratt October 15, 1844. Four children.
*Phoebe Elizabeth Soper (1823–1887). Married Pratt February 8, 1846. Three children.
*Ann Agatha Walker (1829–1908). Married Pratt April 28, 1847. Five children. Agatha ran a millinery business in Salt Lake City.&lt;ref name = Givens323&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=323}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wives of Pratt:
*Martha Monks (1825–?). Married Pratt April 28, 1847. One child who died shortly after birth. After this Martha abandoned Pratt in early 1849 and moved to California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|pp=277–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Keziah Downes (1812–1876). Married Pratt December 27, 1853. They did not have any children. She lived in the same house as five of Pratt's other wives and helped them in raising their children.&lt;ref name = Givens323/&gt;
*Eleanor Jane McComb (1817–1874). Married Pratt November 14, 1855.

Pratt's constant missions left him little time with his family. After he started practicing plural marriage, the longest period of time he had with his family were the 18 months following his return from a mission to Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Terryl Givens|Terryl L. Givens]] and [[Matthew Grow|Matthew J. Grow]], Pratt's "highest happiness was to be surrounded by a teeming domestic world of multiple wives and offspring."&lt;ref name = Givens396&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=396}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that he also had an "antisocial bent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens &amp; Grow|2011|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Pratt's grandsons, William King Driggs, was the father of the [[King Sisters]].

[[Mitt Romney]], the Massachusetts governor (2003–07) and the 2012 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee for the [[President of the United States|U.S. presidency]], is one of Pratt's great-great-grandsons.&lt;ref&gt;Romney is descended from [[Helaman Pratt]], a son of Pratt's fourth wife, Mary Wood ([[Glasgow]], 18 June 1818 – [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], 5 March 1898). She was the daughter of Samuel Wood ([[baptized]] [[Dumfries]], 8 July 1798) and wife (m. [[Mungo, Dumfriesshire]], 18 July 1816) Margaret Orr ([[baptized]] [[Inverchaolin]], [[Argyllshire]], 15 August 1793 – 1852.){{cite news |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/660198565/Polygamy-was-prominent-in-Romneys-family-tree.html |title= Polygamy was prominent in Romney's family tree |first1= Jennifer |last1= Dobner |first2= Glen |last2= Johnson |date= 25 February 2007 |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] ''([[Associated Press|AP]])'' |accessdate= 2011-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antenatal perineal massage''' (APM) or '''birth canal widening''' (BCW) is the [[massage]] of a [[pregnant]] woman's [[perineum]] around the opening to the [[vagina]], performed anywhere in the 4 to 6 weeks before [[childbirth]] and usually on 4-6 separate occasions. The practice aims to more gently mimic the massaging action of a baby's head on the opening to the birth canal prior to birth, which enables some of the hard work of labour to be done before the start of labour. The intention is to attempt to prevent tearing of the perineum during birth, and reduce the need for an [[episiotomy]] or an instrument ([[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]] or [[Ventouse|vacuum extraction]]) delivery.

==Description==
The Oxford Radcliffe NHS Trust Document "Antenatal Perineal Massage" 2011 describes the use of the pregnant mother's '''thumbs being placed just inside the birth canal''', whilst she stands with one foot supported on the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~umperl/massage.htm| title=Promoting Effective Recovery from Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ouh.nhs.uk/patient-guide/leaflets/files%5C090924perinealmassage.pdf|title=The Oxford Radcliffe NHS Trust Document "Antenatal Perineal Massage" information document for women}}&lt;/ref&gt; She '''pulls backwards towards her spine''', whilst relaxing her pelvic floor, progressively increasing the pressure under her finger tips until this starts to feel uncomfortable. '''On the next occasion she uses both thumbs pulling backwards and then sideways, thumbs away from each other,''' to enlarge the 2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter opening of the birth canal progressively over time to 10&amp;nbsp;cm. It is not possible to stretch this opening further causing damage, because this will be limited by the distance between the bony walls of the pelvis.

==Purposes==
The goal of APM is to prevent the baby's head from undergoing excessive strain during the last 30 minutes of labour. It seeks to train the mother to relax her pelvic floor to allow the baby's head to pass through the opening, to stretch the two fibrous layers within the Uro-Genital Membrane, a triangular shaped muscular shelf at the front half of the opening of the bony pelvis, through which the 2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter birth canal and urethra pass, and to transform the fat packed rigid skin at the opening to the birth canal into paper thin stretchy elastic skin, all without using the baby's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Ax3rLFc6M|title=Pelvic Floor Part2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
If the external skin (perineal skin) opening has been stretched before birth, to 10&amp;nbsp;cm, then there is no reason to perform an episiotomy to increase the diameter of the opening of the birth canal. Tearing is less likely as the external skin at the opening has been stretched already and is lax, whilst the underlying muscular pelvic floor has not been damaged. Episiotomy permanently damages the pelvic floor muscle, as the episiotomy cuts through the nerve supply to this muscle, so the larger part of the pelvic floor muscles atrophies and becomes replaced by scar tissue, increasing the mother's chance of developing a prolapse in the future. Antenatal Perineal Massage does not damage the pelvic floor, so protects against a prolapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/0091-2182(86)90148-5/full|title=Effect of Perineal Massage on the incidence of episiotomy and perineal laceration 1986 | doi=10.1016/0091-2182(86)90148-5 | volume=31|journal=Journal of Nurse-Midwifery|pages=128–134|author=Avery M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Antenatal perineal massage or pre-birth obstetric massage (birth canal widening) has been used for many generations both by Chukchi Eskimos in Siberia and by African tribal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epi-no.com.au/the-epi-no-story/|title=Epi-no story Inspired by an African experience}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Using index fingers pulling away from each other, and progressing to index and middle; and then index middle and ring; and then index middle ring and little fingers, pulling away from each other, painlessly''', performed by the pregnant mother's spouse, after sexual intercourse, when the mother is relaxed has also been described{{by whom|date=September 2014}} enabling the father to take an active role in aiding the birth.  Glass bottles of increasing sizes have also been used as the instrument of massage.

The German obstetrician Mr Welheim Horkel, when visiting a medical mission in the mid-1980s, learned that African tribes used gourds of increasing sizes as instruments of massage, with mothers aiding their daughters' labours in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epi-no.com.au/the-epi-no-story/|title=Epi-no story From Starnberg to over 20 countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Berkshire England performed an Antenatal Massage trial in 1984, and many small trials have been performed worldwide since. Cochrane Collaborate Reports since 2006 have advised that women should be informed that episiotomy is avoidable if they employ digital Antenatal Perineal Massage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckmann|first=Michael M|last2=Stock|first2=Owen M|date=2013-04-30|title=Antenatal perineal massage for reducing perineal trauma|url=https://www.cochrane.org/CD005123/PREG_antenatal-perineal-massage-for-reducing-perineal-trauma|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005123.pub3|issn=1465-1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
A randomized clinical trials of perineal massage found similar results in the massage and control groups. They did find a reduced rate of class two and three level tears but did not find a reduction in the risk of pain, [[Urinary incontinence|urinary]] or [[fecal incontinence]], or [[dyspareunia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stamp|first=Georgina|last2=Kruzins|first2=Gillian|last3=Crowther|first3=Caroline|date=2001-05-26|title=Perineal massage in labour and prevention of perineal trauma: randomised controlled trial|journal=BMJ : British Medical Journal|volume=322|issue=7297|pages=1277–1280|issn=0959-8138|pmid=11375230|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26468">Ethics in the public sector is a broad topic that is usually considered a branch of [[political ethics]]. In the public sector, ethics addresses the fundamental premise of a public administrator's duty as a "steward" to the public. In other words, it is the moral justification and consideration for decisions and actions made during the completion of daily duties when working to provide the general services of government and [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organizations. Ethics is defined as, among others, the entirety of rules of proper moral conduct corresponding to the ideology of a particular society or organization (Eduard). '''Public sector ethics''' is a broad topic because values and morals vary between cultures. Despite the differences in ethical values, there is a growing common ground of what is considered good conduct and  correct conduct with ethics.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Ethics are an accountability standard by which the public will scrutinize the work being conducted by the members of these organizations. The question of ethics emerges in the public sector on account of its subordinate character.

Decisions are based upon ethical principles, which are the perception of what the general public would view as correct. Ensuring the ethical behavior in the public sector requires a permanent reflection on the decisions taken and their impact from a moral point of view on citizens. Having such a distinction ensures that public administrators are not acting on an internal set of ethical principles without first questioning whether those principles would hold to public scrutiny. It also has placed an additional burden upon public administrators regarding the conduct of their personal lives. Public sector ethics is an attempt to create a more [[Open government|open atmosphere]] within governmental operations.

==Government ethics==

'''Government ethics''' constitutes the application of [[ethics|ethical]] rules to [[government]]. It is that part of practical [[jurisprudence]], or the [[philosophy of law]], that governs the operation of government and its relationship with the people that it governs. It covers issues of honesty and [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] in government, dealing with matters such as [[bribery]], [[political corruption]], [[police corruption]], [[legislative ethics]], [[regulatory ethics]], [[conflict of interest]], avoiding the [[appearance of impropriety]], [[open government]], and [[legal ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Santa Clara University, Markkula Centre for Applied Ethics, [http://www.scu.edu/ethics/articles/articles.cfm?fam=GOVN Focus Area Articles] on Government Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

The US office of government ethics was initiated by the [[Ethics in Government Act|Ethics in Government Act of 1978]] to provide overall leadership and policy direction for an ethics program in the Executive branch of government. This same picture is mirrored, albeit in a patchy way, across US state administrations. Altogether the US model of Public sector ethics has become highly regulated and, some would say, cumbersome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Local Government, Public Enterprise and Ethics|last = Preston|first = N|date = 2000|journal = The Federation Press|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials serve the people, managing the resources of others.  Along with this stewardship, there is an expectation from the public that in conducting daily activities, the officials will practice fairness and equality.  They are also expected to maintain openness in their workings to ensure that they are operating within the public's perception of what is "right."  This concept of [[ethics]], a branch of philosophy which seeks to address morality, is not a relatively new idea within government.  [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] wrote ''[[The Prince]]'', which serves as a manual to illustrate what a monarchy should do to maintain power.  This treatise is often viewed as a tool of how a public official should not act in modern society, as it is an enumeration of the specific steps one should take to maintain control and power.  This idea of control and power conflicts with the underlying principle of being a steward to the general public.  As such, this treatise is a springboard for ethical issues in modern-day times.

[[Paul Douglas]], a former United States Senator from Illinois, argues that while many may secretly follow Machiavelli in their heart, most do not.  “Instead, most men want a life of integrity and goodwill in which public officials are stewards rather than masters and treat their jobs as a means of helping people rather than dominating them”.&lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;Douglas, P. (1952). ''Ethics in government''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas further argues why ethical practices are needed.  “Our government is now so huge and affects our lives so directly that we cannot be content with merely a moderately decent level of behavior on the part of our public officials.  For even a small percentage of misbehavior on the part of these officials can do a vast amount of harm”.&lt;ref name="douglas" /&gt;

'''Regulatory ethics''' is a body of [[law]] and practical [[political philosophy]] that governs the conduct of civil servants and the members of regulatory agencies. It addresses issues such as bribery and the relationship of civil servants with the businesses in the industries they regulate, as well as concerns about transparency, freedom of information and sunshine laws, and conflict of interest rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An Introduction to Government Ethics|url = http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/government_ethics/introduction/|website = www.scu.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Machiavelli and Douglas are distant in time, the two opposing viewpoints of the types of public administrators, and the ethical stance of the decisions they make, are very relevant today.  Further illustrating the bifurcation of thought on ethics in government, Cody and Lynn discuss the two opposing factors: utilitarian's and deontologists.&lt;ref name="codyandlynn"&gt;Cody, W. J. M. &amp; Lynn, R. R. (1992). ''Honest government: An ethics guide for public service''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarians]]''': Believe that the end sought justifies the means to that end.  In other words, if an ethical solution is more costly, a utilitarian will argue from a standpoint of efficiency or effectiveness to justify a less ethical solution.

'''[[Deontological ethics|Deontologists]]''': Believe that certain absolute principles should be obeyed, regardless of the consequences.  An example of an absolute principle would be honesty.

The definition of these two behavioral models is not necessarily exclusive.  It is possible for a person to make a decision based upon a utilitarian stance and then follow a deontological stance for a separate decision.  This is because the concept of ethics is vague and ultimately is based upon principles and values, which will differ among situations and people.

== Public Sector Ethics vs. Government Ethics ==

Public sector ethics deals with ethics for those who serve in the public sector- primarily governmental and elected officials focusing on the public, whom they serve. While public sector ethics overlaps in part with government ethics, it can be considered a separate branch in that government ethics is only focused on moral issues relating to governments, including [[bribery]] and [[corruption]], whilst public sector ethics also encompasses any position included in the [[public administration]] field. Public administration ethics does cover relations among politicians, but it also covers politicians and the concerned parties in the outside world: elected public servants, the media, public sector entities, and individuals.&lt;ref name="douglas" /&gt;

==Ethical standards==

[[John Rohr]], in defining bureaucrats as public administrators, approaches ethic standards in government as a requirement due to the nature of the work of administrators.  He writes, “because bureaucrats govern through authority that is discretionary, and because they are not elected, the ordinary means of popular control are inapplicable”.&lt;ref name="rohr"&gt;Rohr, J. A. (1978). ''Ethics for bureaucrats: An essay on law and values''. New York, NY: Marcel Dekker, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rohr assumes that public administrators are working to benefit the general public’s needs.  When an elected official does not act in line with the public’s expectations, they can be removed from office.  However, public administrators are protected with due process rights as government employees, and ethical violations can be difficult to justify the removal of a person from an office.

Many questions about how ethics should be addressed in government exist.  According to Cody and Lynn, the debate centers on the extent to which one would like to detail ethical standards.  For example, they cite the general [[Litmus|litmus test]] for administrators regarding whether or not they would like to hear about their actions on the front page of tomorrow’s newspaper.&lt;ref name="codyandlynn" /&gt;  That is, a public official should gauge their decisions by how he/she would interpret the public scrutiny should his/her decision appear on the front page of the next day's newspaper.  If it would be viewed as a problem by the public, then the administrator should refrain from the action in question.

'''The Honest Person Rule''': Unless there is an underlying honesty within people, a set of ethical rules is meaningless.  This supporting argument for the general guidelines maintains that for ethical standards to be practical an individual must be ethically sound from the beginning.  As Cody and Lynn point out, it is possible for a public official to act unethically, but not be personally dishonest.&lt;ref name="codyandlynn" /&gt;

The litmus test example and the Honest Person Rule are broad standards without much definition.  As a consequence, broadly defined ethical standards are difficult to assess regarding concerns of ethical violations.  In order to have greater accountability, more specific standards are needed, or a statement of [[applied ethics]].

To further provide some definition, Rohr classifies ethics in government with some of the approaches that have been taken.  The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] devised a system where employees were asked questions and then asked to rank the actions as permissible, not permissible, and permissible with prior written approval.  Rohr argues that this type of approach, known as the '''Low Road''' merely places an understanding of what not to do in order to steer clear of trouble (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;53–54).&lt;ref name="rohr" /&gt;  This approach does not assist an employee in providing a standard for what is truly ethical behavior.

The '''High Road''', according to Rohr, is the basis of decisions upon a pursuit for [[social equity]], which is based upon [[political philosophy]] and [[humanistic psychology]].

Rohr finds problems with both the Low Road and High Road approaches and bases his argument on '''regime values''', or “the values of that political entity that was brought into being by the ratification of the Constitution that created the present American republic” (1978, p.&amp;nbsp;59).&lt;ref name="rohr" /&gt;  He contends that regime values are built upon three considerations:
# Ethical norms should be derived from the salient values of the regime;
# These values are normative for bureaucrats because they have taken an oath to uphold the regime; and
# These values can be discovered in the public law of the regime.
The basic contention upon which Rohr builds his argument is that rulings by the Supreme Court are sufficient measures upon which an ethical framework can be constructed.  Rohr argues that this framework for ethical standards is strong because it relies upon a system of checks and balances in the judicial system and because it is built upon the interpretation of framers' intents of how and why government exists.

==Levels of ethical decision-making==

Terry Cooper is an often-cited author in the field of public administration ethics.  His book, ''The Responsible Administrator'', is an in-depth attempt to bridge the philosophical points of ethics and the complex workings of public administration.  While not revolutionary, his work has become a focal point around which ethical decision-making in the public sector are made.  In ''The Responsible Administrator'', he states that public administrators make decisions daily according to a distinctive four-level process.  The four levels are:

'''The Expressive Level''': At this stage, a person responds to a situation with "spontaneous, reflective expressions of emotion ... which neither invite a reply nor attempt to persuade others".&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;Cooper, T. L. (1990). ''The responsible administrator: An approach to ethics for the administrative role, Third edition''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, Inc. Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Level of Moral Rules''': This is the first level at which we begin to question actions and begin to look for alternatives and consequences.  The responses at this level are often built upon "moral rules we acquire through the socialization process from our families, religious affiliations, education and personal experiences."  Decisions on how to handle the situation are then whittled down based on what we feel is the most appropriate action within our own personal moral bank.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

'''The Level of Ethical Analysis''': There are times when a personal moral code will seem inadequate for the situation, or that the alternatives and consequences do not feel right.  When this occurs, a person has entered this level and begins to examine their '''ethical principles''', or "statements concerning the conduct or state of being that is required for the fulfillment of a value; it explicitly links a value with a general mode of action".&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;  Particularly, at this level, one begins to reexamine their personal values, and may eventually disagree with actions to such an extent that they will become "whistleblowers."

'''The Post-ethical Level''': At this level, questions arise about one's view of the world and human nature, how we know anything to be true, and the meaning of life.  Here there is a philosophical examination as to why ethical standards are important and relevant to the individual.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

These levels are progressive and as an individual begins to move from level to the next, they will begin to question increasingly more the fundamental assumptions upon which the decision-making process is built.  It is important to understand the level of thinking upon which a decision is made to ensure that a decision has been tested for strength and a public sense of validity.

==Cooper's decision-making model==

Cooper devised a method of moving from an ethical problem to appropriate alternatives and consequences.  This model follows a sequential, rational approach to ethical decision-making.  This method utilizes '''description''' and '''prescription''', where public administrators begin to describe to themselves and others an objective state of affairs, and then begin to suggest steps to change the situation.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

The steps to this process are as follows:

# '''The Descriptive Task''': A problem is often presented in a fragmented, distorted fashion coupled with judgmental language and inflections.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;  Cooper contends that the administrator is in a position to have more complete knowledge when an issue is brought forward.  Additionally, an administrator should attempt to describe questionable situations void of personal feelings (moving beyond the expressive level).
# '''Defining the Ethical Issue''': Often the most misinterpreted step, with defining the ethical issue, an administrator is not charged with defining the problem.  Instead, there is an examination of what is the underlying ethical value that is being addressed.  Often, there is a decision made because of a problem, without examination of the ethical issue.  This is damaging to the process of decision-making because it harms one's ethical analysis skills and ethical identity.  This is true because situations can differ, and practical decision-making may lead to inconsistencies without an ethical base (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;20).&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;
# '''Identifying Alternative Courses of Action''': Using a rationalistic approach, an administrator, with as complete knowledge of the situation as possible and an assessment of the ethical issue at hand, identifies all the plausible courses of action in response to the situation.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;
# '''Projecting the Possible Consequences''': In this stage, all positive and negative results of each alternative are examined.  When discovering the possible positive and negative outcomes of an action, administrators use their '''moral imagination''', or the imagined enactment of how alternatives will play out.  Ideally, as more consequences are enumerated, the ethical decision-making process will be strengthened.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;
# '''Finding a Fit''': The appropriate solution or alternative is a balance of four elements:&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;
## ''Moral Rules'': Those basic standards that can be attributed to the alternatives and their consequences.
## ''Rehearsal of Defenses'': The assessment and alignment of alternatives with the accepted norms of the wider professional organization and political communities of which we are a part.
## ''Ethical Principles'': In assessing the moral rules, it may become clear that certain moral values are competitive.  Therefore, it becomes difficult to say that an alternative which support social justice is more correct than the security of an individual or the organization.  Here, an administrator assesses alternatives and their moral values under the light of the level of ethical analysis - deciding how the hierarchy of moral rules is structured and ultimately influencing the final decision.
## ''Anticipatory Self-Appraisal'': Simply put, this analysis of alternatives requires an internal reflection of whether an administrator feels that an alternative fits within what he or she perceives to be their own personality.  This is an examination of whether an alternative will meet our need to feel satisfied with the decision.

By following Cooper's model of ethical decision-making, a public administrator is able to create a more concrete process by which to assess individual steps that were taken in reaching a decision.  This ensures that at each point, an effort was made by the administrator to uphold ethical principles and that fairness and equality were the standard.  An administrator's decision must be able to withstand scrutiny to ensure that there is a continued trust and respect for [[accountability]] among employees and the public in the administrator's ability to conduct his/her duties.

==Politics and ethics==

Public administrators act independently of legislators and most elected officials.  This ensures that those on elections boards can operate independently of political influence.  This is also true of law enforcement.  Unfortunately, enforcing ethical violations can lead to consequences for the public administrator.  While an officer can enforce a law against an elected official, the elected official can place pressure on others to force the officer to work a night shift or decrease the department.

Rohr would argue that politics and administration are not separate, but are present at the same time when a public administrator makes decisions.  He states that the problem with public administrators “is not that bureaucrats are excessively involved in policy formulation but that they are involved at all.  This is a problem for a democratic society because to influence public policy as a public official is to govern”.&lt;ref name="rohr" /&gt;  In other words, those officials who are influencing decisions are taking on the role of those elected by the public without a responsibility of having to answer to the public for decisions made.

However, because there can be large political obstacles, it can be difficult for an administrator to overcome ethical concerns within an organization.  Sometimes, the culture of an organization is unethical, at which time, it would be useless to bring up ethical concerns within the organization.  In the public sector and [[Non-profit organization|nonprofits]], when this is the case, individuals will often attempt to bring outside scrutiny on to the organization.  This is typically done by leaking the ethical concerns to the general media.  Such an act is known as ''whistleblowing''.

'''[[Whistleblower|Whistleblowing]]''': After using all available means for working within the system, an employee of a governmental agency reports a problem to other governmental agencies or to the general public directly.  The problem for whistleblowing on all levels of government (federal, state, and local) is that there are very few protections for these individuals.&lt;ref name="codyandlynn" /&gt;

==Ethics and the personal life of administrators==

There are several factors of a person’s private life that are often viewed as something that is not made available to the public.  When a person enters into a public life, often, aspects of their private life are made public.

'''Health''': It is important, in the public’s eye, that a public official be physically sound when conducting the duties of their office.  For example, when [[Ronald Reagan]] had an [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]], he was often reporting how healthy he was.  This may have been an attempt to prevent the transfer of powers to his Vice President.  However, because of the mandate of a transfer of powers, it was necessary for the public to understand his overall condition.&lt;ref name="codyandlynn" /&gt;

'''Finances''': A public official may be a strong steward of public funds, but may have personal financial issues (i.e. failure to pay taxes, etc.).  [[Financial disclosure of public servants|Disclosure of finances]] is particularly important, ethically, for the public to decide an official’s ability to properly manage public funds and to assess an individual’s potential for giving into politically charged financial pressure.  Opposing viewpoints to this argue that public officials should not have to [[Financial disclosure of public servants|disclose financial information]] because they are sometimes linked to personal contacts that prefer to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="codyandlynn" /&gt;

'''Sexual Misconduct''': The common view is that a public official’s sexual life is subject to scrutiny.  This is due to the assumption that any [[Sexual ethics|sexual misconduct]] may lead to the manipulation of the official’s daily decisions.  It is thereby often the subject of attention when sexual misconduct becomes known to the public.&lt;ref name="codyandlynn" /&gt;

'''[[Appearance of impropriety|Appearance of Impropriety]]''': Officials should make public any possible [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] prior to their actions, in order to avoid public scrutiny when making decisions that could be construed in favor of a personal interest.

== Ethical Climate in the Public Sector ==

Ethical climate in the public sector refers to the psychological conditions present in the public sector workplace and how those conditions influence a public sector employees ethical decision making. One way of interpreting public sector ethics  from a theoretical perspective is to view a workers behavior as a function of their psychological field. It is theorized that understanding the ethical climate in which one works explains ones decisions making and can differentiate between and explain why one would make ethical or unethical choices. A study was done examining the ethical climate in the sector through analyzing surveys in which public sector employees responded to a variety of different scenarios where ethical decision making came into play. The researchers looked for correlations between ethical climate environments and the responses to this survey and found that certain ethical climates were linked to positive ethical decision making and some were linked to worse ethical decision making, supporting the researchers thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ethical Climate Type, Self-Efficacy, And Capacity to Deliver Ethical Outcomes in Public Sector Human Resource Management|last = Shacklock, Manning, Holt|first = Arthur, Mark, Linda|date = 2011|journal = Journal of New Business Ideas &amp; Trends|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Puppy Luv''''' is a [[simulation video game]] for the [[Wii]] and [[Windows]] released on October 25, 2007. The Wii version was developed by Game Mill and published by [[Activision]]. It was developed and published for [[Windows]] by Canadian studio [[Gogii Games]].

==Gameplay==
''Puppy Luv'' is a [[sim game]] designed for one player and revolving around caring for a puppy.

It contains:
*Six breeds: [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]], [[Beagle]], [[Golden Retriever]], [[Labrador Retriever]], [[German Shepherd]], [[German Short-haired Pointer]]
*Ten tricks
*Six Competitions

After the player picks a puppy, he/she cares for it by feeding, grooming, and training it which also earns the player money to buy things. The player is able to take their puppy for walks to allow to relieve itself.

==Reception==
The game has received largely negative reviews.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It has been criticized for the low choice in breeds (only 6 compared to similar sims with 30+), choppy animation that could easily have been fixed, and unrealistic movements such as when feeding a puppy it would pick the food up in its mouth and tilt its head back much in the manner of geese and ducks without chewing or swallowing. Some parts of the game will be inaccessible or will not allow the player to do anything else until they can get their puppy to perform a trick correctly which may become impossible due to hiccups and bugs in the game, most notably the roll over trick.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''Raj`a''' ({{Lang-ar|الرجعة|lit=Return|translit=āl  rj'ah}}) (alternatively '''rjaa''', '''raja'a, raj'at''') in [[Islamic terminology]], refers to the [[Second Coming]], or the return to life of a given past historical figure after that person's physical death.&lt;ref name="Momen2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Shi%CA%BBi_Islam.html?id=B0OL5Z8S-V0C|title=An Introduction to Shi`i Islam: The History and Doctrines of Twelve|last1=Momen|first1=Moojan|date=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300035314}}&lt;/ref&gt; While primarily used in Shia Muslim terminology, variations on the doctrine exist in Sunni Islam and the Bahá'í Faith, and ''raj`a'' is used to describe certain Christian doctrines in Arabic.

==Etymology==
The Raj`a doesn't refer exclusively to the theological meaning, but is used in Arabic for other cases such as: remarriage of divorced spouses after a [[Iddah|period of waiting]], the reappearance of [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]] after his [[Occultation (Islam)|occultation]], and the reestablishment of an [[Islamic state]] in the modern world.&lt;ref name="Sadeghi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sadeghi|first1=Hadi|title=Raj'a|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/896538/%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%B9%D8%AA|website=noormags|publisher=Hadith science journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differing views==

===In Shia Islam===
[[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] believe that the 12th Imam, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], is currently living and is removed from access by his followers in a state called the major occultation. In Twelver belief, the 12th Imam is identical with the figure of the Mahdi whose appearance is still awaited by other Muslim sects. It is believed that before the Day of Judgement, Muhammad al-Mahdi will return with a group of chosen companions. This return is more properly known as ''zuhur'' or 'appearance', as the Hidded Imam is believed to have remained alive during his occultation since the year 874.&lt;ref name="Momen2"/&gt;

After his reappearance Shia eschatology predicts that the Mahdi will do battle against [[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal|Dajjal]] and [[Sufyani]]. After this battle it is believed that the Imam Mahdi will be joined by the [[Second Coming|return of Christ]], and of the [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Husayn]], along with other historical figures such as the prophets and saints of the past. The return of these historical figures will herald the beginning of the [[Last Judgment]]. The purpose of this return is the establishment of justice for those who were oppressed and died oppressed: the oppressors are punished directly by the oppressed during this future reappearance.  Shias base this belief on several verses in the Quran where it is mentioned that some people will die twice and live twice.&lt;ref&gt;Islam and the Modern Age, Volume 24, Page 61, Zakir Hussain Institute of Islamic Studies, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Sunni Islam===
After 260 AH, belief in Raj’a was treated  by Sunni authors as a distinctive trait distinguishing [[Shia LaBeouf|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims, with many books written addressing this distinction.  ''Releasing from Irreversibility with the Proof of Raj’a'' (in [[Arabic]]: الايقاظ من الهجعة بالبرهان علي الرجعة) was the most extensive book, with reference to more than 670 [[hadith]]s, [[Ayah|Qur'anic verses]] and rationale.&lt;ref name="Nik Tab'a"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nik Tab'a|first1=Sedigheh|title=Raj'a|url=http://lib.eshia.ir/10244/101/8/%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%B9%D8%AA|website=eshia|publisher=The Imam khomeini Educational Research institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Sunni scholars do believe in Raj’a, believing in the return of number of people such as [[Seven Sleepers]] synchronous with the appearance of the [[Mahdi]].&lt;ref name="Raj'a in view of Sunni Islam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Raj'a in view of Sunni Islam|url=http://lib.eshia.ir/71814/1/309#_ftnref5|website=eshia|publisher=encyclopaedia of  Mahdiism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imam al-Suyuti|Jalaluddin Al-Sayuti]] wrote about the raj`a but in a different way from the Shiites. According to his book ''The Possibility of Seeing the Prophet and the Angels'' ([[Arabic]]: تنوير الحلك في إمكان رؤية النبي والملك,) Suyuti claims to have seen the Prophet [[Muhammad]] over 70 times while he was awake. According to him, in contrast to Shiite belief, the return of the Prophet Muhammad is not limited to a specific time in the future. Al-Sayuti did not mention if any other religious figures will return after death before the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Marwan Khlifat, Warakibtu Assafeena 1st Ed P.644 مروان خليفات. وركبت السفينة: 644&lt;/ref&gt; According to Abu 'Abdullah [[Al-Qurtubi]], raj`a is understood as the lack of physical presence of a prophet, who marks his apparent death by absence in the physical world but will reappear, from time to time, to those who are pure in heart.&lt;ref&gt;Al Tathkira Fi Ahwal Al Mawta Vol 1.P212, ar. التذكرة في أحوال الموتى وأمور الآخرة. 1/212&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maliki]] scholar [[Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi|Ibn al-Arabi]], known for his exegesis of the [[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]], stated that seeing and hearing the prophets while awake is possible for the pure believer.&lt;ref&gt;Al hawi Lilfatawi Vol 2.P:257. الحاوي للفتاوي ج2 ص257، 258 جلال الدين السيوطي&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain Qur'anic verses that Sunni and Shia scholars suggest confirm Raj’a include the following:&lt;ref name="Raj'a in view of Sunni Islam"/&gt;
#And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator." Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful. And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on. [2;54-55]
#And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed over it, but Allah was to bring out that which you were concealing. So, We said, "Strike the slain man with part of it." Thus does Allah bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason. [2;72-73]
#Have you not considered those who left their homes in many thousands, fearing death? Allah said to them, "Die"; then He restored them to life. And Allah is full of bounty to the people, but most of the people do not show gratitude. [2;243]

===In the Bahá'í Faith===
The concept of return is central to Bahá'í prophetology, as Bahá'í's believe the Prophets of their religions to fulfill the expectations of return in Shi'a Islam, Christianity and other religions. Specifically, [[the Báb]] is seen as the Shi'a [[Mahdi]], while [[Bahá'u'lláh]] is seen simultaneously as the [[Second Coming|return of Christ]] and of the [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Husayn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moojan|first=Momen|date=1995|title=Baha'u'llah's prophetology: Archetypal patterns in the lives of the founders of the world religions|url=|journal=Bahá'í Studies Review|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís do not view the return of the prophets and saints of the past as a physical return, or resurrection, but rather a return of spiritual characteristics and archetypal roles. A well known Bahá'í story describes Rúhu'lláh Varqá, who would later be martyred for his allegiance to the Bahá'í Faith, describing the return of the prophets in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'One day Bahá’u’lláh asked Ruhu’llah, ‘What did you do today?’
He replied, ‘I was having lessons from — [a certain teacher].’ Bahá’u’lláh asked, ‘What subject were you learning?’ ‘Concerning the return [of the prophets]’, said Ruhu’llah. ‘Will you explain what this means?’ Bahá’u’lláh demanded. He replied: ‘By return is meant the return of realities and qualities.’

Bahá’u’lláh, questioning him further, said: ‘These are exactly the words of your teacher and you are repeating them like a parrot. Tell me in your own words your own understanding of the subject.’
‘It is like cutting a flower from a plant this year,’ answered Ruhu’llah. ‘Next year’s flower will look exactly like this one, but it is not the same.’

The Blessed Beauty praised the child for his intelligent answer and often called him Jinab-i-Muballigh (His honour, the Bahá’í teacher)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20313838|title=The Revelation of Baháʼuʼlláh|last=1921-2000.|first=Taherzadeh, Adib,|date=1974|publisher=G. Ronald|isbn=0853982694|edition=Rev.|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=20313838|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] are believed to both possess both a human soul, and to be Manifestations of the eternal [[Logos (Christianity)|logos]], each prophet is described by Bahá'u'lláh as in one sense the return of every previous prophet. The concept of return is further extended to the companions of the Manifestations, with members of the [[Letters of the Living]] being regarded as the return of figures such as the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]], [[Ali|Imam Ali]] and [[Fatimah|Fatima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Messiah of Shiraz: Studies in Early and Middel Babism|last=MacEoin|first=Dennis|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|year=2009|isbn=9789004170353|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|pages=339–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Amadas''' (before 1490 – 7 April 1532){{sfn|Percival|2003}} was a London [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths|Goldsmith]] whose clients included [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] and his courtiers. He was [[Master of the Jewel Office|Master of the King's Jewel House]], and one of the Deputy [[Master of the Mint|Masters of the Mint]].

==Family==
Robert Amadas was the son of William Amadas, a London [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths|Goldsmith]].{{sfn|Percival|2003}} His father's will, made in 1491, names his sons Robert, John, Thomas and William. Robert Amadas is also mentioned in the will, proved in 1490, of his uncle, John Amadas, also a London goldsmith.{{sfn|Hewerdine|2012|p=143}}

==Career==
Amadas was trained as a goldsmith by his father. He was a lowys&lt;ref&gt;Free from apprenticeship, having completed a term of service; ''Oxford English Dictionary'', online edition.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1492, and 'fully sworn to the Company in 1494'. In 1503 he was admitted to the livery. He was one of the Company's Wardens in 1511 and 1515, and Prime Warden in 1524 and again in 1530. The last mention of him in the Company's records was on 15 January 1532 when his apprentice, Brian Berwycke, was sworn to the Company.{{sfn|Percival|2003}}

Amadas is said to have been the 'chief supplier of gold and silver to the King and his courtiers';{{sfn|Percival|2003}} numerous entries in the State Papers record payment to him for gold and silver plate, including plate given by the King as New Year's gifts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=90976 'The King's Book of Payments, 1510', ''Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII'', Volume 2: 1515–1518 (1864), pp. 1444–1449] Retrieved 19 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=91410 'Henry VIII: November 1530, 21–30', ''Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII'', Volume 4: 1524–1530 (1875), pp. 3032–3052] Retrieved 19 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Percival|2003}} In January 1532 the King's New Year's gift to Amadas was 36.75 ounces of plate, while Amadas in turn gave the King 'six sovereigns in a white paper'.{{sfn|Percival|2003}} It has been conjectured that Amadas marked his work as a goldsmith with a heart, a play on his name.{{sfn|Percival|2003}}

Amadas served as acting [[Master of the Jewel Office|Master of the King's Jewel House]] as early as 1524,{{sfn|Percival|2003}} and on 20 April 1526 was formally appointed Master,{{sfn|Waters|1878|p=20}} an office which he retained until his death in April 1532, when he was succeeded by [[Thomas Cromwell]].{{sfn|Percival|2003}} After Amadas' death, commissioners appointed to take an inventory of the King's jewels which had been in Amadas' custody. Two of the three books of inventory were signed by the King, and all three by Amadas' widow, Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?Uri=C4248019 Inventory of the jewel house, late in the custody of Robert Amadas, deceased, and now in the custody of Thomas Cromwell, taken according to the King's commission, TNA E 36/85] Retrieved 19 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Palgrave|1922|p=89}}

At some time before 1526 Amadas was appointed one of the deputies to the [[Master of the Mint]], [[William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy]].{{sfn|Percival|2003}} In 1526 the coinage was altered, and a new contract was entered into between Mountjoy and his two deputies, Robert Amadas and [[Ralph Rowlett]], and Amadas' deputy, [[Martin Bowes]]. Shortly thereafter allegations were made of wrongdoing in the administration of the Mint, and in June 1527 a commission of inquiry was set up. The commission reported in February 1528, and was highly critical of Amadas and Rowlett. In 1530 Lord Mountjoy, disturbed by the declining revenues from the Mint, and suspecting corruption, instituted a lawsuit in the [[High Court of Chancery]] against his two deputies. Unfortunately the outcome of the lawsuit is unknown; however in December 1530 Mountjoy appointed a new deputy for the Mint, the London goldsmith Hugh Welshe or Walshe, who had been one of the members of the commission which had earlier been critical of the work of Amadas and Rowlett.{{sfn|Alsop|1981|pp=197–9}}

Amadas refused election as [[Sheriff of London]] in 1531.{{sfn|Waters|1878|p=20}} He made his will on 3 July 1531, requesting burial in his parish church of [[St Mary Woolnoth]], and appointing his wife, Elizabeth, as his sole executrix, and [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], and [[Richard Rich]] as overseers.{{sfn|Waters|1878|p=20}} He bequeathed the King a gold cup of £100 value.{{sfn|Waters|1878|p=20}} Among his other bequests was £5 to John Freeman, who had been apprenticed to him in 1507 and admitted to the livery in 1528.{{sfn|Percival|2003}} The will was proved 28 November 1533. His stock was inventoried after his death, and put up for sale.{{sfn|Percival|2003}}

In July 1533,{{sfn|Weir|2011|pp=176–8}} an [[Elizabeth Amadas]] claimed that she had earlier been solicited to become Henry VIII's mistress. She predicted that [[Anne Boleyn]] would be burned as a harlot, and said that men should not be able to set aside their wives, as the King was attempting to do with [[Catherine of Aragon]]. Elizabeth Amadas claimed that her own husband had left her. She was arrested for her treasonous comments, and it is said that Robert Amadas was ordered to pay several hundred pounds for 'missing plate' owned by the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hart |first=Kelly |date=1 June 2009 |title=The Mistresses of Henry VIII |edition=First |pages=104–109 |publisher=The History Press |isbn=0-7524-4835-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r6HGPAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Weir|2011|pp=176–8}}{{sfn|Thornton|2006|pp=30–1}}

However Virgoe and others consider this identification to be mistaken, and conclude that the Elizabeth Amadas who made these allegations was likely Elizabeth (née Buttockshide) Amadas, the daughter of Anthony Buttockshide of [[St Budeaux]], Devon, and wife of John Amadas (c.1489–1554/5), [[sergeant-at-arms]] to Henry VIII:{{sfn|Hewerdine|2012|pp=143–6}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cromwell seems to have treated [John Amadas] circumspectly, perhaps because the Mistress Amadas who prophesied against the King and [[Anne Boleyn]] and predicted a Parliament of Peace to be held in the [[Tower of London|Tower]] may have been his first wife...[[Geoffrey Elton|Elton's]] identification of the prophetess of 1533 with Elizabeth, widow of Robert Amadas, is unacceptable as she married [[Thomas Nevill|Sir Thomas Neville]] soon after the goldsmith's death in 1532.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/amadas-john-1489-155455 Amadas, John (by 1489-1554/55), of Court Gate, Tavistock, Devon; Eltham, Kent and Launceston, Cornwall] Retrieved 19 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
Amadas married Elizabeth Bryce, the daughter of James Bryce (d. before 1496) by his wife, Elizabeth Chester (d.1504), and the granddaughter of Sir Hugh Bryce (d. 22 November 1496), [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths|Goldsmith]], and [[List of Lord Mayors of London|Lord Mayor of London]] in 1485, and his wife, Elizabeth (née Ranfield),{{sfn|Waters|1878|p=19}} by whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth and Thomasine:{{sfn|Waters|1878|pp=9–22}}

*Elizabeth Amadas married Richard Scrope (d. December 1572) of [[Castle Combe]], Wiltshire, and is said to have left as her sole heir a daughter, Frances Scrope,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42723 'The ancient parish of Barking: Manors', ''A History of the County of Essex'': Volume 5 (1966), pp. 190–214] Retrieved 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; who married Martin Bowes (d.1573), son of [[Martin Bowes|Sir Martin Bowes]] (d.1566){{sfn|Nichols|1848|pp=122–3, 354–5}} who had been her grandfather's deputy at the Mint.{{sfn|Challis|2004}} According to the ''Diary'' of Henry Machyn, she was buried 29 December 1566.{{sfn|Nichols|1848|pp=122–3, 354–5}} Martin Bowes (d.1573) married secondly, Frances Clopton (d.1619), the daughter of Richard Clopton and Thomasine Knyvet.{{sfn|Jackson|1866|p=124}} After his death, Frances (née Clopton) married secondly, as his third wife, [[Matthew Hutton (Archbishop of York)|Matthew Hutton]], [[Archbishop of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Reliable sources agree that Archbishop Hutton's third wife was Frances, the widow of Martin Bowes (d.1573),{{sfn|Challis|2004}} but disagree as to her identity; Raine states that she was Martin Bowes' first wife, Frances (née Scrope), while the ''Visitation of Suffolk'' states that she was Martin Bowes' second wife, Frances (née Clopton).&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Raine|1861|p=55}}{{sfn|Jackson|1866|p=124}}
*Thomasine Amadas was the first wife of Sir Richard Stapleton (d. 11 January 1585) of [[Burton Joyce]], Nottinghamshire, by whom she had a son, Brian Stapleton (d. 13 December 1606), who married firstly Eleanor Neville, daughter of [[Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chetwynd-Stapleton|1884|p=415}}; {{Harvnb|Hoyle|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly Elizabeth Darcy, the daughter of [[George Darcy, 2nd Baron Darcy de Darcy]].{{sfn|Norcliffe|1881|pp=295–6}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=050-ddca&amp;cid=-1#-1 Papers of the Stapleton Family, National Archives] Retrieved 18 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Foster|1874}}

After Amadas' death, his widow, Elizabeth, married, on 28 August 1532, as his second wife, the lawyer and [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker of the House of Commons]], [[Thomas Nevill|Sir Thomas Neville]], (d. 29 May 1542), fifth son of [[George Nevill, 4th Baron Bergavenny|George Neville, 2nd Baron Bergavenny]] (1436–1492), by his first wife Margaret, daughter of [[Hugh Fenn (died 1476)|Hugh Fenn]].  Neville had earlier been married to Katherine (née Dacre), widow of [[George, 8th Baron FitzHugh]] (d. 28 January 1513), and daughter of [[Humphrey Dacre, 1st Baron Dacre]] of Gilsland, by whom he had an only child, [[Margaret Neville]], who on 1 May 1536 married [[Robert Southwell (sheriff)|Sir Robert Southwell]]. Elizabeth predeceased her second husband.{{sfn|Davies|2004}}{{sfn|Waters|1878|p=21}}

'''SS ''El Faro''''' was a [[United States]]-[[Flag state|flagged]], combination [[roll-on/roll-off]] and [[lift-on/lift-off]] [[cargo ship]] crewed by [[United States Merchant Marine|U.S. merchant mariners]]. Built in 1975 by [[Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co.]] as '''''Puerto Rico''''', the vessel was renamed '''''Northern Lights''''' in 1991, and finally, ''El Faro'' in 2006. She was lost at sea with all hands on October 1, 2015, after losing propulsion near the [[eyewall]] of [[Hurricane Joaquin]].

''El Faro'' departed [[Jacksonville, Florida]], bound for Puerto Rico at 8:10 pm EST on September 29, 2015, when then-Tropical Storm Joaquin was several hundred miles to the east. Two days later, after Joaquin had become a [[SSHS#Category 3|Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane]], the vessel likely encountered [[Swell (ocean)|swells]] of {{convert|20|to|40|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and winds over {{convert|80|kn|abbr=on}} as it sailed near the storm's [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]]. Around 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on October 1, the ship had taken on water and was [[Angle of list|listing]] 15&amp;nbsp;degrees. The last report from the [[Sea captain|captain]], however, indicated that the crew had contained the flooding. Shortly thereafter, ''El Faro'' ceased all communications with shore.&lt;ref name=":Vanity"&gt;{{cite news |quote=A recording salvaged from three miles deep tells the story of the doomed ''El Faro'', a cargo ship engulfed by a hurricane. |first1=William |last1=Langewiesche |date=April 2018|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/inside-el-faro-the-worst-us-maritime-disaster-in-decades |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |title="The Clock is Ticking" Inside El Faro: The Worst U.S. Maritime Disaster in Decades |accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2, the 40-year-old ship was declared missing, and an extensive search operation was launched by the [[United States Coast Guard]], with help from the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[Air National Guard]], and [[United States Navy|Navy]]. They recovered debris and a damaged [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]], and spotted (but could not recover) an unidentifiable body. ''El Faro'' was declared sunk on October 5. The search was called off at sunset on October 7, by which time more than {{convert|183,000|nmi2|abbr=on}} had been covered by aircraft and ships. The Navy sent the [[USNS Apache (T-ATF-172)|USNS ''Apache'']] to conduct an underwater search for ''El Faro'' on October 19, 2015.&lt;ref name="CBS Corporation"&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[CBS News]]|publisher=[[CBS Corporation]]|date=October 19, 2015|accessdate=October 19, 2015|title=U.S. Navy launches salvage operation for sunken cargo ship|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-navy-joins-search-for-cargo-ship-lost-near-bahamas-during-hurricane-joaquin/|location=Miami, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Apache'' identified a vessel on October 31 "consistent with  [the ''El Faro''] cargo ship...in an upright position and in one piece."&lt;ref name="Steve Almasy"&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Almasy|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|date=October 31, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2015|title=U.S. Navy finds wreckage believed to be missing cargo ship El Faro|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/31/us/el-faro-search/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, November 1, the Navy announced a submersible had returned images that identified the wreck as the ''El Faro''.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Halsey III, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/navy-finds-ship-that-sank-near-bahamas-in-hurricane-joaquin/2015/11/02/0e824e3c-8195-11e5-9afb-0c971f713d0c_story.html "Navy finds ship that sank near Bahamas in Hurricane Joaquin"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and earlier career==
''El Faro'' was built by the [[Sun Shipbuilding|Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], in 1975 as ''Puerto Rico''.&lt;ref name="abs"/&gt; As operated by the Navieras de Puerto Rico Steamship Company, the ''Puerto Rico'' hauled cargo to and from the U.S. East Coast for 15&amp;nbsp;years. In 1991, it was purchased by [[Saltchuk]] Resources, the parent company of [[TOTE Maritime]], and renamed ''Northern Lights''. Two years later, it was lengthened by {{convert|90|ft|m}} at Alabama Shipyard, Inc.&lt;ref name="abs"/&gt;  Under Saltchuk, it frequently sailed between [[Tacoma, Washington]], and [[Anchorage, Alaska]].&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes1011"&gt;{{cite news|author=Coral Garnick|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]|date=October 11, 2015|accessdate=October 13, 2015|title=El Faro cargo ship was expected to make Tacoma-Alaska run this winter|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article38779368.html|location=Seattle, Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, just before the United States-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], the vessel was chartered by the United States' [[Military Sealift Command]] as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom|Operation Iraqi Freedom]]; the vessel ferried [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and supplies from [[San Diego, California]], to [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes1011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDTA"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Defense Transportation Journal|publisher=National Defense Transportation Association|date=February 2006|accessdate=October 13, 2015|title=SS Northern Lights: A Lesson in Commitment|url=http://www.ndtahq.com/images/pdf/northernlights.pdf|format=PDF|pages=9–11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103185926/http://www.ndtahq.com/images/pdf/NorthernLights.pdf|archive-date=November 3, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, while in the [[Persian Gulf]], the vessel came under fire from missiles. The explosions rocked the ship, but caused no damage or injuries. Through October 2005, near the end of ''Northern Lights''{{'}} chartered service, the vessel made 25&amp;nbsp;voyages and 49&amp;nbsp;port calls. Collectively, 12,200&amp;nbsp;pieces of military equipment—weighing {{convert|81,000|ST|tonne}} in all—were transported by the ship. Robert Magee, then president of TOTE, and the crew of ''Northern Lights'' were praised by [[United States Air Force]] [[General (United States)|general]] [[Norton A. Schwartz]]: "You and your team of professionals showcased the US flag industry at its best."&lt;ref name="NDTA"/&gt; Following completion of its military services in 2006, the ship was transferred by TOTE to its subsidiary company Sea Star Lines and renamed ''El Faro''. The vessel returned to its original route and served as a "lifeline" between the United States and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes1011"/&gt;

When it sank on October 1, 2015, the Merchant Vessel ''El Faro'' was scheduled to return to Tacoma to relieve another vessel.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes1011"/&gt;

===Final voyage===
[[Image:El Faro life ring.JPG|thumb|left|Life ring recovered on October&amp;nbsp;3]]
On September 29, 2015, at 8:10&amp;nbsp;p.m., ''El Faro'' left [[Jacksonville, Florida]] for [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], carrying a cargo of 391 shipping containers, about 294 trailers and cars, and a crew of 33&amp;nbsp;people—28&amp;nbsp;Americans and 5&amp;nbsp;[[Poles]].&lt;ref name=NYT151005/&gt; The ship's master, Captain Michael Davidson, charted a course that, according to TOTE Maritime, took the vessel a reasonably safe distance away from the hurricane.&lt;ref name="CNNOct9"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Almasy  |author2=Yasmin Khorram |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|date=October 9, 2015|accessdate=October 10, 2015|title=El Faro had leaks, holes, other structural issues, former crew members say|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/08/us/el-faro-missing-ship/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of departure, Hurricane Joaquin was still a tropical storm, but meteorologists at the [[National Hurricane Center]] forecast that it would likely become a [[hurricane]] by the morning of October 1, on a southwest trajectory toward the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Daniel P. Brown|date=September 30, 2015|title=Tropical Storm Joaquin Discussion Number 9|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=October 7, 2015|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2015/al11/al112015.discus.008.shtml|location=Miami, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel's charted course took it within {{convert|175|nmi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of the storm, where seas in excess of {{convert|10|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} were likely.&lt;ref name="WUnderground"/&gt; TOTE could have vetoed the captain's sail plan into the area of a predicted hurricane, but chose not to and opted for the ship to continue. The company said there was no incentive for Davidson to maintain the ship's schedule, but that the schedule also appeared to be a safe one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= TOTE: Company could've vetoed El Faro's captain|url= http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/2015/10/05/tote-acknowledges-captain-could-have-been-overruled/73427310|author= Garrett Pelican|publisher= [[WTLV]]|date= October 6, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one of the deck officers, second mate Danielle Randolph, voiced concern prior to sailing and wrote in an email to friends and family, "there is a hurricane out here and we are heading straight into it."&lt;ref&gt;Michael E.

The vessel had "passed its annual Coast Guard inspection in March and another survey in June",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Doomed Cargo Ship El Faro Needed Work on Boilers: NTSB|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/doomed-cargo-ship-el-faro-was-due-have-boilers-serviced-n447856?cid=sm_twitter_feed_world|website = NBC News|accessdate = November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had also successfully completed the [[American Bureau of Shipping|American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)]] class and statutory surveys in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NTSB Issues Update on Investigation Into Sinking of Cargo Ship EL FARO|url = http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR20151020.aspx|website = www.ntsb.gov|accessdate = November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] confirmed on October 20, 2015, that El Faro had successfully completed the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) class and statutory surveys on February 13, 2015. They also found that safety drills were conducted on a weekly basis and that the ship met stability criteria when it left Jacksonville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = El Faro captain reported hull breach, NTSB says - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/20/us/el-faro-ntsb-investigation/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former crew members of ''El Faro'' expressed surprise and shock that the vessel set sail with a major storm in its course. They said the vessel was "a rust bucket" that "[was not] supposed to be on the water." They also said that ''El Faro'' suffered from drainage issues and that leaking was common in the Galley (Kitchen) Compartment. They said that the ship was covered in rust and its decks filled with holes as recently as August.&lt;ref name="CNNOct9"/&gt;

===Hurricane Joaquin===

Throughout September 30 into the morning of October 1, Joaquin continued to track southwest.&lt;ref name="WUnderground"/&gt; 10&amp;nbsp;hours after departing, ''El Faro'' was steaming at full speed and deviating from its charted course.

==== Voyage Data Recorder audio ====
{{Overly detailed|date=September 2018}}
On 13 December 2016, the NTSB released a 500-page transcript of the conversations that occurred on the bridge in the ship's final 26 hours, as recorded by the Vessel's Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) and its six microphones.

The transcript described a quickly deteriorating situation.

At 5:43 am, the captain takes a phone call indicating suspected flooding in the no. 3 cargo hold and sends the chief mate to investigate.  The crew then begin taking measures to try to assess and control the flooding.&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|415–416}}

At 6:13 am, the ship loses its steam propulsion plant.&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|439}}

At 6:54 am, the captain takes a phone call describing the situation onboard:

* "It’s miserable right now. We got all the uhh—all the wind on the starboard side here. Now a scuttle was left open or popped open or whatever so we got some flooding down in three hold—a significant amount. Umm, everybody’s safe right now, we’re not gonna abandon ship—we’re gonna stay with the ship. We are in dire straits right now. Okay, I’m gonna call the office and tell ’em [expletives]. Okay? Umm there’s no need to ring the general alarm yet—we’re not abandoning ship. The engineers are trying to get the plant back. So we’re working on it—okay?"&lt;ref name=vdr&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dms.ntsb.gov/public/58000-58499/58116/606566.pdf|title=Group Chairman's Factual Report of Investigation: Attachment 1 to Addendum — Voyage Data Recorder — Audio Transcript (Revised version, including changes from the Addendum and Errata), ''SS El Faro'' DCA16MM001|author=Sean Payne|date=August 8, 2017|website=National Transportation Safety Board|publisher=Office of Research and Engineering, Vehicle Recorder Division|access-date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|467}}

At 7:06 am, the captain makes a phone call. He says:

* "I have a marine emergency and I would like to speak with a QI.  We had a hull breach- a scuttle [hatch] blew open during the storm. We have water down in three hold. We have a heavy list. We've lost the main propulsion unit.  The engineers can not get it goin'.  Can I speak with a QI please?"&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|475}}
* "We have uhh secured the source of water coming in to the vessel.  uh, A scuttle was blown open... it's since been closed.  However, uh, three hold's got a considerable amount of water in it.  Uh, we have a very, very healthy port list.  The engineers cannot get lube oil pressure on the plant, therefore we've got no main engine, and let me give you um a latitude and longitude.  I just wanted to give you a heads up before I push that- push that button."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|476}}
* "The crew is safe.  Right now we're trying to save the ship now, but uh all available hands.  We are forty-eight miles east of San Salvador.  We are taking every measure to take the list off.  By that I mean pump out that- pump out that hold the best we can but we are not gaining ground at this time."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|477}}
* "Right now it's a little hard to tell because all the wind is... on that side too so we got a good wind heel goin'.  But it's not getting any better."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|478}}
* "[We're] gonna stay with the ship... no one's panicking, everybody's been made aware... Our safest bet is to stay with the ship during this particular time.  The weather is ferocious out here and we're gonna stay with the ship... swell is out the northeast, a solid ten to twelve feet (over) spray, high winds, very poor visibility..."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|478}}

At 7:10 am, the captain tells someone on the phone that they have a 10- to 15-degree list, "but a lot of that's with the wind heel."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|480}} He lets the person know he will be making a distress call to the USCG, and then directs the second mate to activate the [[Ship Security Alert System|SSAS]] button/[[GMDSS]] alarm, and directs her to wake everybody up.&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|481–482}}

At 7:15 am, the chief mate returns to the bridge:

* Chief mate: "I think that the water level's rising, Captain."
* Captain: "(okay).  Do you know where it's comin' from?"
* Chief Mate: "(at) first the Chief said something hit the fire main.  Got it ruptured.  Hard."
* Captain: "Um, there's no way to secure that?"
* Chief Mate: "We don't know if they still have any pressure on the fire main or not.  Don't know where's sea – between the sea suction and the hull or what uh but anything I say is a guess."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|483}}
 
At 7:17 am, the chief engineer informs the chief mate and the captain over the sound-powered phone that the bilge alarm is going off in "two alpha."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|485}} The captain asks the chief if he can pump out all of the cargo holds at the same time, and discusses the worsening list.&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|486}} The chief mate informs the captain that the cars are floating in #3 cargo hold, and that the fire main is below the surface of the water, so he couldn't see the damage or if water was still coming in.&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|487–488}}

At 7:19 am, after further discussion with the chief mate, the captain calls the chief engineer again, asking, "Can you... isolate the fire main from down in the uh engine room?... On the engine room side the isolation valve [on the] suction [for the] fire pump... secure it, isolate it on your side so there's no free communication from the sea."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|489–490}}

At 7:24 am, the captain, speaking with a crew member on the phone, says, "We still got reserve buoyancy and stability."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|493}}

At 7:27 am, the captain instructs the second mate to ring the general alarm and wake up the crew.&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|493}}

At 7:29 am, the captain gives the order to abandon ship, and about a minute later can be heard on the bridge calling out, "Bow is down, bow is down."&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|499–500}}

At 7:31 am, the captain yells over the UHF radio for the chief mate to "Get into your rafts!  Throw all your rafts into the water!  Everybody get off! Get off the ship! Stay together!"&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|501}}

From 7:32 am on, the captain is heard trying to help the panicked [[helmsman]], an [[Able seaman|able seaman]], get off the bridge, with alarms ringing throughout.&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|502}} The captain repeatedly tells the helmsman not to panic: "work your way up here,"&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|504}} "you're okay, come on,"&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|505}} and "I'm not leavin' you, let's go!"&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|507}} The helmsman exclaims, "I need a ladder!  A line!"&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|506}} and, "I need someone to help me!"&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|507}}

At 7:39 am, the VDR recording ends with the captain and AB still on the bridge.&lt;ref name=vdr/&gt;{{rp|509}}

===Search for the wreckage===
[[File:CURV photo of the stern of El Faro 160103-N-ZZ999-550.jpg|thumb|A Navy screen capture showing the stern of ''El Faro''.]]
On October 19, the [[USNS Apache (T-ATF-172)|USNS ''Apache'']] departed from [[Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek–Fort Story]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] to conduct the underwater search for ''El Faro''. The vessel was equipped with a [[towed pinger locator]], [[side-scan sonar]], and a remotely operated vehicle.&lt;ref name="CBS Corporation"/&gt; The search crew identified a vessel on October 31 at an approximate depth of {{convert|15,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The hydrostatic pressure at this depth is approximately {{convert|6688|psi|kPa}}. The NTSB reported that the object was, "consistent with a [{{convert|790|ft|m|abbr=on}}] cargo ship...in an upright position and in one piece."&lt;ref name="Steve Almasy"/&gt; On November&amp;nbsp;16, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] announced it had completed its search of the sunken ship but did not find the [[voyage data recorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR_20151116.aspx|title= NTSB Completes Documentation of Sunken Cargo Ship ''EL FARO''; Voyage Data Recorder Not Located|website=National Transportation Safety Board|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 3, 2016, the NTSB opened the public accident docket on the investigation into sinking of ''El Faro'', initially releasing underwater images and video of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR01032016.aspx|title= NTSB Opens Public Docket on Investigation Into Cargo Ship Sinking; Underwater Images and Video Released|website=National Transportation Safety Board|date=January 3, 2016|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second and third search effort for VDR====

On April 18, 2016, the NTSB, utilizing the [[RV Atlantis (AGOR-25)|RV ''Atlantis'']], a Navy-owned vessel operated by mariners of [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], launched a second search for the ship's voyage data recorder (VDR). On April 26, the NTSB stated the voyage data recorder was found about {{convert|41|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Acklins and Crooked Islands]], Bahamas. The NTSB was unable to retrieve the recorder at that time because of its proximity to the mast and other obstructions. On August 5, 2016, [[USNS Apache|USNS ''Apache'']] went back to the site. On August 9, 2016, the voyage data recorder was finally recovered from the wreckage by [[USNS Apache|USNS ''Apache'']], 10 months after the sinking. The VDR was then delivered to the NTSB in [[Mayport, FL]] to continue the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/u-recovers-data-recorder-sunken-cargo-ship-el-165252731.html?nhp=1 |title=U.S. recovers data recorder from sunken cargo ship ''El Faro''|work=Yahoo!

===Presentation of findings===
====US Coast Guard====
The Coast Guard ''El Faro'' Marine Board of Investigation completed its final report on September 24, 2017 and published it on October 1, 2017 in its document library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=US Coast Guard News-By-Region|url=http://www.news.uscg.mil/News-by-Region/Headquarters/El-Faro-Marine-Board-of-Investigation/ |author=U.S. Coast Guard ''El Faro'' Marine Board of Investigation|title= Document Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 199-page Marine Board's Report detailed facts, analysis, and conclusions and made safety, administrative, and enforcement recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.defense.gov/2017/Oct/01/2001820187/-1/-1/0/FINAL%20PDF%20ROI%2024%20SEP%2017.PDF |website=Department of Defense |author=U.S. Coast Guard ''El Faro'' Marine Board of Investigation|title= Final Report |date=September 24, 2017 |format=PDF |access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coast Guard investigators placed nearly all of the blame on Michael Davidson, ''El Faro''{{'}}s captain. Davidson underestimated the strength of the storm and the ship's ability to ride it out, and did not take enough measures to evade the storm, even though his crew raised concerns about its increasing strength and changing direction. Investigators stated that if Davidson had survived the storm, his actions would have been grounds for the Coast Guard to revoke his captain's license. "(Davidson) was ultimately responsible for the vessel, the crew and its safe navigation," said Capt. Jason Neubauer, who chaired the investigation.

Coast Guard investigators also lambasted [[TOTE Maritime]],'' El Faro''{{'}}s owner, stating the company made several violations regarding crew members' rest periods and work hours, had no dedicated safety officer to oversee the ''El Faro'', and used outdated, "open air" lifeboats (similar to the types used on older vessels, such as the RMS ''Titanic'') instead of the modern-day enclosed survival crafts, among other violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fox10tv.com/story/36494132/coast-guard-report-captain-errors-led-up-to-el-faro-sinking|title=Coast Guard report: Captain errors led up to ''El Faro'' sinking|work=Fox10 TV|access-date=October 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015201752/http://www.fox10tv.com/story/36494132/coast-guard-report-captain-errors-led-up-to-el-faro-sinking|archive-date=October 15, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* criticized the captain's decision to advance into the oncoming storm, despite numerous calls from the crew to alter course, and noted he had relied on outdated weather information from a commercial service
*criticized the Coast Guard's practices of grandfathering in vessels, exempting them from using closed lifeboats: the obsolescent lifeboats were not properly maintained, they were not launched, and in all probability they would not have offered useful shelter
*noted the owner's failure to maintain a superannuated and deteriorating vessel
In their final report,the NTSB determines{{quote|''that the probable cause of the sinking of El Faro and the subsequent loss of life was the captain’s insufficient action to avoid Hurricane Joaquin, his failure to use the most current weather information, and his late decision to muster the crew. Contributing to the sinking was ineffective bridge resource management on board El Faro, which included the captain’s failure to adequately consider officers’ suggestions. Also contributing to the sinking was the inadequacy of both TOTE’s oversight and its safety management system. Further contributing factors (...) were flooding in a cargo hold from an undetected open watertight scuttle and damaged seawater piping; loss of propulsion due to low lube oil pressure to the main engine resulting from a sustained list; and subsequent downflooding through unsecured ventilation closures to the cargo holds. Also contributing (...) was the lack of an approved damage control plan (...) Contributing to the loss of life was the lack of appropriate survival craft for the conditions''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/DCA16MM01_preliminary_report.pdf Marine Accident Report.

[[Captain]] '''Samarakoon Wasala Mudiyanselage Saliya Upul Aladeniya''', [[Parama Weera Vibhushanaya|PWV]], [[Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment|SLRS]] (In [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]: කපිතාන් සාලිය උපුල් අලදෙනිය; 1 March 1963 &amp;ndash; 11 June 1990) was [[Sri Lanka]]n soldier and the second recipient of the [[Parama Weera Vibhushanaya]], highest war time award for valor of Sri Lanka. He was commanding the small army detachment at [[Kokavil]], when it was surrounded he refused to abandon the injured and fought until they were overrun by [[LTTE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sundaytimes.lk/001001/plus4.html The Sunday Times article: "Don't worry sir, I will fight till I die"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankalibrary.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=2399&amp;/ LankaLibrary Forum;  Eelam War II - "Operation Balavegaya"]&lt;/ref&gt;   

Born in [[Kandy]], his father was a [[Captain]] in the [[Ceylon Army Volunteer Force]]. Educated at [[Trinity College (Kandy)|Trinity College Kandy]], he joined the [[Sri Lanka Army]] in 1989 as a volunteer officer. Following a short commissioning course at the [[Sri Lanka Military Academy]], he was commissioned as [[Second Lieutenant]] into the 2nd(v) Battalion, [[Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment]] and served with it in [[Nuwara Eliya]].

In May, [[Lieutenant]] Aladeniya and his platoon was deployed to an isolated army outpost at Kokuvla (Kokavil) that was established for guarding the television [[Broadcast relay station|relay station]]. The camp was surrounded for several days by LTTE cadres who outnumbered them five to one. The food and water were running out in the camp and so was the [[ammunition]]. In spite of many requests, [[reinforcements]] sent from Wanni headquarters never reached Kokavil, having been diverted elsewhere. On July 11, orders to withdraw from the camp came at the eleventh hour but then it was too late and Aladeniya had wounded men whom he did not want to leave behind. Pledging that he would rather die alongside them than leave them, Lt. Aladeniya fought on till an adjacent [[fuel dump]] exploded, killing the majority of the defenders in the camp. Since his body was not recovered he has been listed as missing in action. 

Aladeniya was posthumously promoted to rank of [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] and awarded the [[Parama Weera Vibhushanaya]] medal on June 21, 1994. In offensive operations in 2009, the Sri Lanka Army recaptured Kokavil. In 2011, the transmition tower was rebuilt and a monument to Aladeniya and his men was built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2011/06/12/fea02.asp Saved through blood, sweat and tears:]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Augustine Confessiones.jpg|170px|thumb|right|[[Confessions of St. Augustine]]]]
'''Spiritual reading''' is a practice of reading [[book]]s and [[Article (publishing)|article]]s about spirituality with the purpose of growing in [[Sacred|holiness]].

Spiritual reading is devoted to the reading of lives of saints, writings of Doctors and the Fathers of the Church, theological works written by holy people, and doctrinal writings of Church authorities. It is different from [[lectio divina]] which focuses on the bible.

The biblical basis is St. Paul's advice "Attend to reading" (1 Tim 4:13) which meant that Timothy his disciple should "apply to the reading of holy books, not in a passing way and for a short time, but regularly and for a considerable time," said St. [[Alphonsus Liguori]], Doctor of the Catholic Church on Moral theology. St. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] said that "spiritual reading and prayer are the arms by which hell is conquered and paradise won."

==Basis and advantages==

The biblical basis of this practice is [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]]'s advice to his disciple Timothy whom he appointed bishop. St. Paul told him to "Attend to reading." The word "attend" an allusion to the many other concerns that a bishop has to attend to. By this, according to St. [[Alphonsus Liguori]], Doctor of the Church on Moral theology, the Apostle Paul "wished him to apply to the reading of holy books, not in a passing way and for a short time, but regularly and for a considerable time."

The Fathers of the Church recommended this practice: St. [[Jerome]] says that when we pray we speak to God; but when we read, God speaks to us. St. [[Ambrose of Milan]] says the same: "We address him when we pray; we hear him when we read."

Spiritual reading is an instruction in prayer and virtue, according to St. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], and thus he said that "spiritual reading and prayer are the arms by which hell is conquered and paradise won." St. [[Josemaría Escrivá]] explained that spiritual reading "builds up a store of fuel. — It looks like a lifeless heap, but I often find that my memory, of its own accord, will draw from it material which fills my prayer with life and inflames my thanksgiving after Communion." (The Way 117)

Spiritual reading provides access to spiritual advice from masters of spirituality, says St. [[Alphonsus Liguori]]. Thus, St. [[Pius X]] further thoroughly explained:

:Everyone knows the great influence that is exerted by the voice of a friend who gives candid advice, assists by his counsel, corrects, encourages and leads one away from error. Blessed is the man who has found a true friend; he that has found him has found a treasure. We should, then, count pious books among our true friends. They solemnly remind us of our duties and of the prescriptions of legitimate discipline; they arouse the heavenly voices that were stifled in our souls; they rid our resolutions of listlessness; they disturb our deceitful complacency; they show the true nature of less worthy affections to which we have sought to close our eyes; they bring to light the many dangers which beset the path of the imprudent. They render all these services with such kindly discretion that they prove themselves to be not only our friends, but the very best of friends. They are always at hand, constantly beside us to assist us in the needs of our souls; their voice is never harsh, their advice is never self-seeking, their words are never timid or deceitful.

"When I read holy books," says St. Gregory the Theologian about the books of St. Basil the Great, "then the spirit and body are illumined and I become the temple of God and the harp of the Holy Spirit, played by divine powers through them I am corrected and through them I receive a kind of divine change and I am made into a different person."

Reading of holy books is also a way to fight [[temptation]]s: "Endeavor to have always in your hand a pious book," advised St. Jerome to his disciple Salvina, "that with this shield you may defend yourself against bad thoughts."

All the [[Entrepreneur|founder]]s of [[religious institute]]s have strongly recommended this holy exercise to their religious, said St. Alphonsus.

==Examples of sanctifying effect==

Throughout the history of Christian spirituality, spiritual reading has been seen to be of great benefit to many souls, and according to St. [[Pius X]], "There are many striking examples of the salutary effects of the reading of pious books."
[[Image:Ignatius Loyola.jpg|120px|thumb|right|St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] decided to be a man of God after reading the life of [[Jesus]] and some saints]]
Some examples are:

*St. [[Augustine of Hippo]], considered one of the greatest Fathers of the Church, converted to the Catholic Church upon hearing a boy tell him" "Take, read; take, read." He recounted that "I took (the epistles of Paul the Apostle), I opened, I read in silence; it was as though the darkness of all my doubting was driven away by the light of peace which had entered my soul."
*St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of what is considered as the largest religious order in Catholicism, decided to live a saintly life, after reading a volume of the lives of the saints which he accidentally took up while he was in a hospital bed.
*St. [[Edith Stein]], Patron of Europe, converted to Catholicism after reading the autobiography of St. [[Teresa of Ávila]] on a holiday in Göttingen in 1921, at the age of 29. One evening Edith picked up an autobiography of St. Teresa of Ávila and read this book all night. "When I had finished the book, I said to myself: This is the truth." She went out the next day to buy a missal and a copy of the Catholic catechism.
*[[Thomas Merton]], a known spiritual writer, read a book by [[Étienne Gilson]], on "The Elements of Christian Philosophy," and decided to study Catholicism. He later converted and became a Trappist monk.

==Practice==

St. Alphonsus recommends some principles and attitudes for spiritual reading.

*''Ask God for help beforehand'', because through reading it is God who speaks to us. Thus he recommended the prayer of Samuel: Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening. Speak, O my Lord, for I wish to obey you in all that you will make known to me to be your will.
*''The exclusive purpose of the reading is to advance in divine love'', and not to acquire learning and indulge in curiosity. To do spiritual reading with false intentions is "a study unprofitable to the soul," and "lost time."
*''Read slowly and with attention.'' "'Nourish your soul,' says St. Augustine, 'with divine lectures.'" To be nourished, he said, one must chew and well and ponder well, and apply the teachings to oneself. "And when what you have read has made a lively impression on you, St. Ephrem counsels you to read it a second time...Besides, when you receive any special light in reading, or any instruction that penetrates the heart, it will be very useful to stop, and to raise the mind to God by making a good resolution, or a good act, or a fervent prayer. St. Bernard says, that it is useful then to interrupt the reading, and to offer a prayer, and to continue to pray as long as the lively impression lasts."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="843">'''Telishment''' is a term coined by [[John Rawls]] to illustrate a problem of the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view of [[punishment]]. Telishment is an act by the authorities of punishing a suspect in order to deter future wrongdoers, even though they know that the suspect is innocent. If supporters of these theories believe in the effectiveness of telishment as a deterrent, opponents claim that they must [[bite the bullet]] and also hold that telishment is ethically justified.

'''Tobacco mosaic virus''' ('''TMV''') is a [[Sense (molecular biology)#RNA sense in viruses|positive-sense]] single stranded [[RNA virus]], genus [[tobamovirus]] that infects a wide range of plants, especially [[tobacco]] and other members of the family [[Solanaceae]].  The [[infection]] causes characteristic patterns, such as "[[mosaic]]"-like [[mottling]] and discoloration on the [[Leaf|leaves]] (hence the name). TMV was the first [[virus]] ever to be discovered. Although it was known from the late 19th century that an [[infectious disease]] was damaging tobacco crops, it was not until 1930 that the infectious agent was determined to be a virus. It is the first pathogen identified as a virus.

== History ==
In 1886, [[Adolf Mayer]] first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants, similar to [[bacteria]]l infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mayer | first = Adolf | title = Über die Mosaikkrankheit des Tabaks. | journal = Die Landwirtschaftliche Versuchs-stationen | volume = 32 | pages = 451–467 | year = 1886 | language = German}} Translated into English in Johnson, J., Ed.

(1942) ''Phytopathological classics'' (St. Paul, Minnesota: American Phytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1903, Ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells of the affected tobacco plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Iwanowski | first = D. | title = Über die Mosaikkrankheit der Tabakspflanze | journal = Zeitschrift für Pflanzenkrankheiten und Pflanzenschutz | volume = 13 | pages = 1–41 | year = 1903 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ivanovsky remained rather convinced, despite repeated failures to produce evidence, that the causal agent was an unculturable bacterium, too small to be retained on the employed [[Chamberland filter]]s and to be detected in the light microscope. In 1898, [[Martinus Beijerinck]] independently replicated Ivanovsky's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant.&lt;ref name="zaitlin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beijerinck | first = M.

Tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be [[crystallized]]. It was achieved by [[Wendell Meredith Stanley]] in 1935 who also showed that TMV remains active even after crystallization.&lt;ref name="zaitlin" /&gt; For his work, he was awarded 1/3 of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1946/stanley-bio.html|title=Wendell M.

The [[X-ray crystallography|crystallographer]] [[Rosalind Franklin]] worked for Stanley for about a month at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and later designed and built a model of TMV for the [[1958 World's Fair]] at [[Brussels]]. In 1958, she speculated that the virus was hollow, not solid, and hypothesized that the [[RNA]] of TMV is single-stranded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maddox|first=Brenda|title=Rosalind Franklin, the Dark Lady of DNA|year=2002|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0-06-018407-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conjecture was proven to be correct after her death and is now known to be the + strand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agls.uidaho.edu/ebi/vdie/descr803.htm#Properties&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations of tobacco mosaic disease and subsequent discovery of its viral nature were instrumental in the establishment of the general concepts of [[virology]].&lt;ref name="zaitlin" /&gt;

Tobacco mosaic virus has a rod-like appearance. Its [[capsid]] is made from 2130 [[molecules]] of coat protein (see image to the left) and one molecule of genomic single strand RNA, 6400 bases long. The coat protein self-assembles into the rod-like helical structure (16.3 proteins per helix turn) around the RNA, which forms a hairpin loop structure (see the [[Electron Microscope|electron micrograph]] above). The protein monomer consists of 158 [[amino acids]] which are assembled into four main alpha-helices, which are joined by a prominent loop proximal to the axis of the virion. Virions are ~300&amp;nbsp;nm in length and ~18&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-1843-X"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stryer, Lubert|title=Biochemistry|edition=|publisher=W.H.

== Genome ==
The TMV genome consists of a 6.3-6.5 kb single-stranded (ss) [[RNA]]. The 3’-terminus has a [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]]-like structure, and the 5’ terminus has a [[Methylation|methylated]] nucleotide cap. (m7G5’pppG).&lt;ref&gt;Expasy Viralzone [http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_species/51.html Tobamovirus]&lt;/ref&gt; The genome encodes 4 [[open reading frame]]s (ORFs), two of which produce a single protein due to [[Ribosome|ribosomal]] readthrough of a leaky UAG [[stop codon]]. The 4 genes encode a  '''[[replicase]]''' (with methyltransferase [MT] and [[RNA helicase]] [Hel] domains), an RNA-dependent '''[[RNA polymerase]]''', a so-called '''[[movement protein]]''' (MP) and a [[Capsid|'''capsid protein''']] (CP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gergerich |first1=R.

== Disease cycle ==
TMV does not have a distinct [[overwintering]] structure. Rather, it will over-winter in infected tobacco stalks and leaves in the soil, on the surface of contaminated seed (TMV can even survive in contaminated tobacco products for many years). With the direct contact with host plants through its vectors (normally insects such as [[Aphid|aphids]] and [[Leafhopper|leafhoppers]]), TMV will go through the infection process and then the replication process.

=== Infection and Transmission ===
After its multiplication, it enters the neighboring cells through [[plasmodesmata]]. The infection spreads by direct contact to the neighboring cells, For its smooth entry, TMV produces a 30 k[[Atomic mass unit|Da]] [[Movement proteins|movement protein]] called P30 which enlarges the plasmodesmata. TMV most likely moves from cell-to-cell as a complex of the RNA, P30, and replicate proteins.

It can also spread through [[phloem]] for longer distance movement within the plant. Moreover, TMV can be transmitted from one plant to another by direct contact. Although TMV does not have defined transmission vectors, the virus can be easily transmitted from the infected hosts to the healthy plants, by human handling.

=== Replication ===
Following entry into its host via mechanical inoculation, TMV uncoats itself to release its viral [+]RNA strand. As uncoating occurs, the MetHel:Pol gene is translated to make the capping enzyme MetHel and the RNA Polymerase. Then the viral genome will further replicate to produce multiple mRNAs via a [-]RNA intermediate primed by the tRNA&lt;sub&gt;HIS&lt;/sub&gt; at the [+]RNA 3' end. The resulting mRNAs encode several proteins, including the [[Capsid|coat protein]] and an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] (RdRp), as well as the movement protein. Thus TMV can replicate its own genome. 

After the coat protein and RNA genome of TMV have been synthesized, they spontaneously assemble into complete TMV virions in a highly organized process. The protomers come together to form disks or 'lockwashers' composed of two layers of protomers arranged in a helix. The helical capsid grows by the addition of protomers to the end of the rod. As the rod lengthens, the RNA passes through a channel in its center and forms a loop at the growing end. In this way the RNA can easily fit as a spiral into the interior of the helical capsid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Host and symptoms ==
[[File:Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms tobacco.jpg|thumb|Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms on tobacco]]
[[File:Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms orchid.jpg|thumb|Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms on orchid]]
Like other plant pathogenic viruses, TMV has a very wide host range and has different effects depending on the host being infected. The tobacco mosaic virus has been known to cause a production loss for flue cured tobacco of up to two percent in [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 |url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/pp/notes/oldnotes/tb1.htm

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to infect members of nine plant families, and at least 125 individual species, including tobacco, [[tomato]], [[Capsicum|pepper]] (all members of the useful [[Solanaceae]]), [[cucumber]]s, and a number of [[ornamental flowers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/horticulture/DG1168.html Tomato-Tobacco Mosaic Virus Disease&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614075040/http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/horticulture/dg1168.html |date=2012-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different strains. The first symptom of this virus disease is a light green coloration between the veins of young [[leaves]]. This is followed quickly by the development of a "mosaic" or mottled pattern of light and dark green areas in the leaves. [[Rugosity]] may also be seen where the infected plant leaves display small localized random wrinkles. These symptoms develop quickly and are more pronounced on younger leaves. Its infection does not result in plant death, but if infection occurs early in the season, plants are stunted. Lower leaves are subjected to "mosaic burn"  especially during periods of hot and dry weather. In these cases, large dead areas develop in the leaves. This constitutes one of the most destructive phases of tobacco mosaic virus infection. Infected leaves may be crinkled, puckered, or elongated. However, if TMV infects crops like [[grape]] and [[apple]], it is almost symptomless.

== Environment ==
TMV is known as one of the most stable viruses. It has a very wide survival range. As long as the surrounding temperature remains below approximately 40 degrees [[Celsius]], TMV can sustain its stable form. All it needs is a host to infect. If necessary, [[Greenhouse|greenhouses]] and [[Botanical garden|botanical gardens]] would provide the most favorable condition for TMV to spread out, due to the high population density of possible hosts and the constant temperature throughout the year.

== Treatment and management ==
One of the common control methods for TMV is [[sanitation]], which includes removing infected plants and washing hands in between each planting. [[Crop rotation]] should also be employed to avoid infected soil/[[Seedbed|seed beds]] for at least two years. As for any plant disease, looking for resistant strains against TMV may also be advised. Furthermore, the cross protection method can be administered, where the stronger strain of TMV infection is inhibited by infecting the host plant with mild strain of TMV, similar to the effect of a [[vaccine]].

In the past ten years, the application of [[genetic engineering]] on a host plant [[genome]] has been developed to allow the host plant to produce the TMV coat protein within their cells. It was hypothesized that the TMV genome will be re-coated rapidly upon entering the host cell, thus it prevents the initiation of TMV replication. Later it was found that the mechanism that protects the host from viral genome insertion is through [[gene silencing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Scientific and environmental impact ==
[[File:TMV virus super resolution microscopy Christoph Cremer Christina Wege.jpg|thumb|TMV virus: super resolution light microscopy]]The large amount of literature about TMV and its choice for many pioneering investigations in [[structural biology]] (including [[X-ray diffraction]]), virus assembly and disassembly, and so on, are fundamentally due to the large quantities that can be obtained, plus the fact that it does not infect animals.  After growing a few infected tobacco plants in a [[greenhouse]] and a few simple laboratory procedures, a scientist can easily produce several grams of the virus.

[[James D. Watson]], in his memoir ''[[The Double Helix]]'', cites his x-ray investigation of TMV's helical structure as an important step in deducing the nature of the [[DNA]] molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, James D.  ''The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix.'' chapters 16, 18.  {{ISBN|978-1-4767-1549-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigational uses ==
Due to its cylindrical shape, high aspect-ratio, self-assembling nature, and ability to incorporate metal coatings ([[nickel]] and [[cobalt]]) into its shell, TMV is an ideal candidate to be incorporated into battery [[Electrode|electrodes]].&lt;ref name=mems&gt;{{Cite conference
