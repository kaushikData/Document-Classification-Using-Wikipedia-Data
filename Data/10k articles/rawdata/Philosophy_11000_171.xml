'''An Hyang''' (1243–1306) also known as An Yu was a leading [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] scholar born in [[Yeongju]] in present-day [[South Korea]].  He was from the [[Clan Ahn of Sunheung]].  He is considered the founder of [[Neo-Confucianism]] in Korea, introducing Song Confucianism to the [[Goryeo]] kingdom. An Hyang visited [[China]], transcribing the ''[[Chu Tzu Shu]]'' and bringing his copy and portraits of [[Confucius]] and [[Zhu Xi]] to Korea to use in his revitalization of Confucianism. He strove to replace [[Buddhism]] with Confucianism.

There is a portrait of him at the [[Sosu Seowon]], which was built as a memorial to the scholar.  There is also a statue of him on Banya-san in [[Nonsan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="844">A '''closed concept''' is a concept where all the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] required to include something within the concept can be listed. For example, the concept of a [[triangle]] is closed because a three-sided polygon, and only a three-sided polygon, is a triangle. All the conditions required to call something a triangle can be, and are, listed.

'''Distinction''', the fundamental philosophical [[abstraction]], involves the recognition of difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|date=1998-01-01|title=The Method of Philosophy: Making Distinctions|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SOKTMO|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical philosophy, there were various ways in which things could be distinguished. The merely logical or virtual distinction, such as the difference between concavity and convexity, involves the mental apprehension of two definitions, but which cannot be realized outside the mind, as any concave line would be a convex line considered from another perspective. A real distinction involves a level of [[Ontology|ontological]] separation, as when squirrels are distinguished from llamas (for no squirrel is a llama, and no llama is a squirrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmhCGt9hKC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=copleston+history+of+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKq8HBtozTAhUIRCYKHecUDC8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=formal%20distinction&amp;f=false|title=History of Philosophy Volume 2: Medieval Philosophy|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|date=2003-06-12|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826468963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A real distinction is thus different than a merely conceptual one, in that in a real distinction, one of the terms can be realized in reality without the other being realized.

Later developments include [[Duns Scotus|Duns Scotus's]] [[formal distinction]], which developed in part out of the recognition in previous authors that there need to be an intermediary between logical and real distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wengert|first=R. G.|last2=Institute|first2=The Hegeler|date=1965-11-01|title=The Development of the Doctrine of the Formal Distinction in the Lectura Prima of John Duns Scotus|url=https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=monist&amp;id=monist_1965_0049_0004_0571_0587&amp;onlyautologin=true|journal=Monist|volume=49|issue=4|pages=571–587|doi=10.5840/monist196549435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some relevant distinctions to the history of Western philosophy include:
* [[Contingency (philosophy)|Necessity and Contingency]]
* [[Inductive reasoning|Inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|Deductive]]

== Distinctions in Contemporary Thought ==

=== [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]] ===
While the there are anticipation of this distinction prior to Kant in the British [[Empiricism|Empiricists]] (and even further in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thought), it was Kant who introduced the terminology. The distinction concerns the relation of a subject to its predicate: analytic claims are those in which the subject contains the predicate, as in "All bodies are extended." Synthetic claims bring two concepts together, as in "All events are caused." The distinction was recently called into question by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], in his paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]."

=== [[A priori and a posteriori|''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'']] ===
The origins of the distinction are less clear, and it concerns the origins of [[knowledge]]. ''A posteriori'' knowledge arises from, or is caused by, experience. ''A priori'' knowledge may come temporally after experience, but its certainty is not derivable from the experience itself. [[Saul Kripke]] was the first major think to propose that there are analytic ''a posteriori'' knowledge claims.

== Notable Distinctions in Historical Authors ==

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] makes the distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Cohen|first=S. Marc|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actuality is a realization of the way a thing could be, while potency refers simply to the way a thing could be. There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by [[Four causes|causes]], making it something which then has the ability to be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.

=== Aquinas ===
The major distinction [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] makes is that of [[essence]] and [[existence]]. It is a distinction already in [[Avicenna]], but Aquinas maps the distinction onto the actuality/potentiality distinction of Aristotle, such that the essence of a thing is in potency to the existence of a thing, which is that thing's actuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aq-meta/#H2|title=Aquinas: Metaphysics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the distinction between appearance and thing-in-itself is foundational to his entire philosophical project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colin|first=Marshall,|title=Kant’s One Self and the Appearance/Thing-in-itself Distinction|url=https://www.academia.edu/2573493/Kants_one_self_and_the_appearance_thing-in-itself_distinction|journal=Kant-Studien|language=en|volume=104|issn=0022-8877}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction separates the way a thing appears to us on the one hand, and the way a thing really is.

The '''Federation of Egalitarian Communities''' ('''FEC''') is a group of [[egalitarian communities]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Ellen. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6385943_ITM Some communes have survived -- and prospered -- beyond the '60s.] ''Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service.'' 23 Sept. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; which have joined together with the common purpose of creating a lifestyle based on equality, cooperation, and harmony with the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://wiki.ic.org/wiki/Federation_of_Egalitarian_Communities ic.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Diggers"&gt;[http://www.diggersanddreamers.org.uk/index.php?one=lin&amp;two=lin&amp;sel=3 Diggers and Dreamers]&lt;/ref&gt; A central principal of these communities is that in exchange for a members working quota (typically between 35 and 42 hours per week) the community pays for all aspects of their life style.  Members do not typically get salaries, instead they have small allowances (typically between $75 and $150 per month) with which they may buy luxury items.  They live, work and socialize within the community but are free to leave whenever they would like.

There are six full-member communities in the FEC, all of which share the primary values of [[egalitarianism]], [[non-violence]] and income-sharing. Approximately 200 people live in the various communities. The organization offers various programs to its member communities, including outreach, labor exchange and catastrophic health care coverage.&lt;ref name="reference"&gt;[http://www.ocfvillage.org/federation-egalitarian-communities/ OFC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fr20KegfE8gC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=%22federation+of+egalitarian+communities%22&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA130,M1 Utopias and Utopians By R. C. S. Trahair]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the full membership, the FEC has lower levels of membership, such as "Allied" or "Community in Dialog".  These are for communities that may share some, but not all of the FEC values, or who are not prepared for full membership.&lt;ref name="our"&gt;[http://thefec.org/taxonomy/term/4 FEC Communities]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
Each of the full-member FEC communities holds the following values:&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;[http://thefec.org/taxonomy/term/3 FEC Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
# Holds its land, labor, income and other resources in common
# Assumes responsibility for the needs of its members, receiving the products of their labor and distributing these and all other goods equally, or according to need
# Practices [[non-violence]]
# Uses a form of decision making in which members have an equal opportunity to participate, either through [[consensus]], [[direct vote]], or right of appeal or overrule
# Actively works to establish the equality of all people and does not permit discrimination on the basis of race, class, creed, ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity
# Acts to conserve natural resources for present and future generations while striving to continually improve ecological awareness and practice
# Creates processes for group communication and participation and provides an environment which supports people's development.

== Current communities ==
The following communities are full members of the Federation of Egalitarian Communities:

*[[Acorn Community]] in Virginia
*[[East Wind Community]] in Missouri

*[http://www.sandhillfarm.org/aboutus.php  Sandhill Community] in Missouri
*[[Twin Oaks Community]] in Virginia

'''Georg Simmel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɪ|m|əl}}; {{IPA-de|ˈzɪməl|lang}}; 1 March 1858 – 28 September 1918) was a German [[sociologist]], [[philosopher]], and [[critic]].

Simmel was one of the first generation of German sociologists: his [[neo-Kantian]] approach laid the foundations for sociological [[antipositivism]], asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?',&lt;ref name=l6&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) (1971)''Simmel: On individuality and social forms''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 6, {{ISBN|0226757765}}.&lt;/ref&gt; presenting pioneering analyses of social individuality and fragmentation. For Simmel, culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history".&lt;ref name=l6/&gt; Simmel discussed social and cultural phenomena in terms of "forms" and "contents" with a transient relationship; form becoming content, and vice versa, dependent on the context. In this sense he was a forerunner to [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] styles of reasoning in the [[social sciences]]. With his work on the [[metropolis]], Simmel was a precursor of [[urban sociology]], [[symbolic interactionism]] and [[social network]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry. (1988). "Structural Analysis: From Method and Metaphor to Theory and Substance." pp. 19&amp;ndash;61 in ''Social Structures: A Network Approach'', Barry Wellman and S. D. Berkowitz (eds.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521286875}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Linton (2004) ''The Development of Social Network Analysis.'' Vancouver: Empirical Press, {{ISBN|1594577145}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An acquaintance of [[Max Weber]], Simmel wrote on the topic of personal character in a manner reminiscent of the sociological '[[ideal type]]'. He broadly rejected academic standards, however, philosophically covering topics such as emotion and romantic love. Both Simmel and Weber's nonpositivist theory would inform the eclectic [[critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]].&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William. 1988. ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 2nd Edition (2009), p.5 ({{ISBN|9780745643281}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Simmel's most famous works today are ''The Problems of the Philosophy of History'' (1892), ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' (1900), ''[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]'' (1903), ''Soziologie'' (1908, inc. ''The Stranger'', ''The Social Boundary'', ''The Sociology of the Senses'', ''The Sociology of Space'', and ''On The Spatial Projections of Social Forms''), and ''Fundamental Questions of Sociology'' (1917). He also wrote extensively on the philosophy of [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]], as well on [[art]], most notably his book ''Rembrandt: An Essay in the Philosophy of Art'' (1916).

==Early life and education==
Simmel was born in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], as the youngest of seven children of an [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated Jewish]] family. His father, Eduard Simmel, a convert to [[Roman catholic|Roman Catholicism]], had founded a successful chocolate factory, Felix und [[Sarotti]], later Sarotti Confections, and was a prosperous businessman. His mother came from a Jewish family who had converted to the [[Lutheran Church]]. Georg himself, was [[baptized]] as a [[Protestant]] when he was a child.&lt;ref name="The Sociology of Georg Simmel"&gt;Simmel, Georg and Wolff, Kurt H. (1950) [https://archive.org/details/sociologyofgeorg030082mbp The Sociology of Georg Simmel]. Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
His father died in 1874, when Georg was 16, leaving a sizable inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Helle, Horst J. (2009). "Introduction to the translation." Sociology: inquiries into the construction of social forms, Volume 1. Leiden, The Netherlands: Koninklijke Brill NV. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Georg was then adopted by Julius Friedländer, the founder of an international music publishing house, Peters Verlag, who endowed him with the large fortune that enabled him to become a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socio.ch/sim/bio.htm Georg Simmel: Biographic Information]. ex: Coser, Lewis A. Masters of Sociological Thought: Ideas in Historical and Social Context. Second edition. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1876, Simmel studied [[philosophy]] and [[history]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="GS-society"&gt;"[http://www.simmel-gesellschaft.de/00_simmel/biostud.htm Biografie]" {{de icon}}. Section: "Studien und Ehe" (university studies and marriage). Georg Simmel Gesellschaft. simmel-gesellschaft.de. Retrieved 17&amp;nbsp;January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, he received his doctorate for his thesis on Kant's philosophy of matter, ''Das Wesen der Materie nach Kants Physischer Monadologie'' (The Nature of Matter According to Kant's Physical Monadology).&lt;ref name="GS-society"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1885, he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Berlin, officially lecturing in philosophy but also in [[ethics]], [[logic]], [[pessimism]], [[art]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. His lectures were not only popular inside the university, but attracted the intellectual elite of Berlin as well. Although his applications for vacant chairs at German universities were supported by [[Max Weber]], Simmel remained an academic outsider. However, with the support of an inheritance from his guardian, he was able to pursue his scholarly interests for many years without needing a salaried position.&lt;ref name="Palmisano"&gt;Palmisano, Joseph&amp;nbsp;M. (2001). "Georg Simmel". ''World of Sociology''. Detroit: Gale, 2001. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, 17&amp;nbsp;January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simmel had a hard time gaining acceptance in the academic community despite the support of well known associates, such as [[Max Weber]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Stefan George]] and [[Edmund Husserl]]. Partly he was seen as a Jew during an era of anti-Semitism, but also simply because his articles were written for a general audience rather than academic sociologists. This led to dismissive judgements from other professionals. Simmel nevertheless continued his intellectual and academic work, as well as taking part in artistic circles.

Only in 1901, was he elevated to the rank of extraordinary professor (full professor, but without a chair; see the German section at [[Professor#German (Central European)|Professor]]). At that time he was well known throughout Europe and America and was seen as a man of great eminence. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1909 Simmel, together with [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] and [[Max Weber]], and others, was a co-founder of the [[German Sociological Association|German Society for Sociology]],&lt;ref name="Palmisano"/&gt; serving as a member of its first executive body.&lt;ref&gt;Glatzer, Wolfgang. "[http://www.soziologie.de/index.php?id=14 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie: Die akademische soziologische Vereinigung seit 1909]" {{de icon}}. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie. soziologie.de. Retrieved 17&amp;nbsp;January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Simmel received an ordinary professorship with chair, at the then German [[University of Strasbourg|University of Strassburg]], but did not feel at home there. Because [[World War I]] broke out, all academic activities and lectures were halted and lecture halls were converted to military hospitals. In 1915 he applied &amp;ndash; without success &amp;ndash; for a chair at the [[University of Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name=Goodstein&gt;Goodstein, Elizabeth S. (2017) "Georg Simmel and the Disciplinary Imaginary". Stanford: Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|1503600742}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to World War I, Simmel had not been very interested in contemporary history, but rather in looking at the interactions, art and philosophy of his time. However, after its start, he was interested in its unfolding. Yet, he seems to give conflicting opinions of events, being a supporter in "Germany's inner transformation", more objective in "the idea of Europe" and a critic in "The crisis of culture". {{Dubious|date=July 2009}} Eventually, Simmel grew tired of the war, especially in the year of his death.

==Personal life==
In 1890, Georg married Gertrud Kinel, a philosopher who published under the [[pseudonym]] Marie-Luise Enckendorf, and under her own name. They lived a sheltered and bourgeois life, their home becoming a venue for cultivated gatherings in the tradition of the salon.&lt;ref name="socio.ch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coser|first1=Lewis A|title=Masters of Sociological Thought: Ideas in Historical and Social Context|date=1977|url=http://socio.ch/sim/bio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had one son, Hans Eugen Simmel, who became a medical doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biografie Georg Simmel|url=http://agso.uni-graz.at/lexikon/klassiker/simmel/42bio.htm|website=50 Klassiker der Soziologie|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georg and Gertrud's granddaughter was the psychologist [[:de:Marianne L. Simmel|Marianne Simmel]]. Simmel also had a secret affair with his assistant [[Gertrud Kantorowicz]], who bore him a daughter in 1907, though this fact was hidden until after Simmel's death.&lt;ref name="LaneRuehl2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Robert E.|authorlink=Robert E. Lerner|editor1=Melissa Lane|editor-link1=Melissa Lane|editor2=Martin Ruehl|title=A Poet's Reich: Politics and Culture in the George Circle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YiiHc6WLpMC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2011|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-462-2|pages=56–77|chapter=The Secret Germany of Gertrud Kantorowicz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1917, Simmel stopped reading the newspapers and withdrew to the [[Black Forest]] to finish his book.&lt;ref name="The Sociology of Georg Simmel"/&gt; Shortly before the end of the war in 1918, he died from [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] in Strassburg.&lt;ref name="socio.ch"/&gt;

==Theory==
===Levels of concern===
There are four basic levels of concern in Simmel’s work. First are his assumptions about the psychological workings of social life. Second is his interest in the sociological workings of interpersonal relationships. Third is his work on the structure of and changes in the ''Zeitgeist'', the social and cultural “spirit” of his times. He also adopted the principle of [[Emergentism|emergence]], which is the idea that higher levels emerge from the lower levels. Finally, he dealt with his views in the nature and inevitable fate of humanity. His most microscopic work dealt with forms and the interaction that takes place with different types of people. The forms include subordination, superordination, exchange, conflict and sociability.&lt;ref name=ritzer&gt;{{cite book|ref=Ritzer|author=[[George Ritzer]] |title= Modern Sociological Theory|edition=7th|place= New York|publisher= McGraw–Hill|year= 2007|isbn=0073404101}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158–88}}

===Dialectical thinking===

A [[dialectic]]al approach is multicausal, multidirectional, integrates facts and value, rejects the idea that there are hard and fast dividing lines between social phenomena, focuses on social relations,  looks not only at the present but also at the past and future, and is deeply concerned with both conflicts and contradictions.  Simmel’s sociology was concerned with relationships—especially interaction—and was known as a “methodological relationist”. This approach is based on the idea that interactions exist between everything.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Overall, he was mostly interested in dualisms, conflicts, and contradictions in whatever realm of the social world he happened to be working on.&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;

===Individual consciousness===

Simmel focused on forms of association and paid little attention to individual consciousness. Simmel believed in the creative consciousness and this belief can be found in diverse forms of interaction, the ability of actors to create social structures and the disastrous effects those structures had on the creativity of individuals. Simmel also believed that social and cultural structures come to have a life of their own.&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;

===Sociability===
Simmel refers to "all the forms of association by which a mere sum of separate individuals are made into a 'society,'" which he describes as a, "higher unity," composed of individuals.&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|157}} He was especially fascinated, it seems, by the, "impulse to sociability in man".&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|157}} He described it as "associations...[through which] the solitariness of the individuals is resolved into togetherness, a union with others," a process he describes by which, "the impulse to sociability distils, as it were, out of the realities of social life the pure essence of association," and "through which a unity is made," which he also refers to as, "the free-playing, interacting interdependence of individuals."&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|158}}

He defines sociability as, "the play-form of association,"&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|158}} driven by, "amicability, breeding, cordiality and attractiveness of all kinds."&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|158}} In order for this free association to occur, he says, "the personalities must not emphasize themselves too individually...with too much abandon and aggressiveness."&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|158}} He also describes, "this world of sociability...a democracy of equals...without friction," so long as people blend together in a spirit of fun and affection to, "bring about among themselves a pure interaction free of any disturbing material accent."&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|159}}

Simmel describes idealized interactions when he says that, "the vitality of real individuals, in their sensitivities and attractions, in the fullness of their impulses and convictions...is but a symbol of life, as it shows itself in the flow of a lightly amusing play,"&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|162}} or when he adds: "a symbolic play, in whose [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] charm all the finest and most highly sublimated dynamics of social existence and its riches are gathered."&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|163}}

==Social geometry==

===Dyad and triad===
A [[dyad (sociology)|dyad]] is a two-person group; a [[triad (sociology)|triad]] is a three-person group. In a dyad a person is able to retain their individuality. There is no other person to shift the balance of the group thereby allowing those within the dyad to maintain their individuality. In the triad group there is a possibility of a dyad forming within the triad thereby threatening the remaining individual's independence and causing them to become the subordinate of the group. This seems to be an essential part of society which becomes a structure. Unfortunately as the group (structure) becomes increasingly greater the individual becomes separated and grows more alone, isolated and segmented. Simmel's view was somewhat ambiguous with respect to group size. On one hand he believed that the bigger the group the better for the individual. In a larger group it would be harder to exert control on the individual, but on the other hand with a large group there is a possibility of the individual becoming distant and impersonal. Therefore, in an effort for the individual to cope with the larger group they must become a part of a smaller group such as the family.&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;

===Distance===
The value of something is determined by the distance from its actor. In [[The Stranger (sociology)|"The Stranger"]], Simmel discusses how if a person is too close to the actor they are not considered a stranger, but if they are too far they would no longer be a part of a group. The particular distance from a group allows a person to have objective relationships with different group members.&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;

==Views==

===On the metropolis===

One of Simmel's most notable essays is ''[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]'' ("Die Großstädte und das Geistesleben") from 1903, which was originally given as one of a series of lectures on all aspects of city life by experts in various fields, ranging from science and religion to art. The series was conducted alongside the [[Dresden]] cities exhibition of 1903. Simmel was originally asked to lecture on the role of intellectual (or scholarly) life in the big city, but he effectively reversed the topic in order to analyze the effects of the big city on the mind of the individual. As a result, when the lectures were published as essays in a book, to fill the gap, the series editor himself had to supply an essay on the original topic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The ''Metropolis and Mental Life'' was not particularly well received during Simmel's lifetime. The organizers of the exhibition over-emphasized its negative comments about city life, because Simmel also pointed out positive transformations. During the 1920s the essay was influential on the thinking of Robert E. Park and other American sociologists at the University of Chicago who collectively became known as the [[Chicago school (sociology)|"Chicago School"]]. It gained wider circulation in the 1950s when it was translated into English and published as part of Kurt Wolff's edited collection, ''The Sociology of Georg Simmel''. It now appears regularly on the reading lists of courses in urban studies and architecture history. However, it is important to note that the notion of the blasé is actually not the central or final point of the essay, but is part of a description of a sequence of states in an irreversible transformation of the mind. In other words, Simmel does not quite say that the big city has an overall negative effect on the mind or the self, even as he suggests that it undergoes permanent changes. It is perhaps this ambiguity that gave the essay a lasting place in the discourse on the metropolis.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

{{Quotation|The deepest problems of modern life flow from the attempt of the individual to maintain the independence and individuality of his existence against the sovereign powers of society, against the weight of the historical heritage and the external culture and technique of life. The antagonism represents the most modern form of the conflict which primitive man must carry on with nature for his own bodily existence. The eighteenth century may have called for liberation from all the ties which grew up historically in politics, in religion, in morality and in economics in order to permit the original natural virtue of man, which is equal in everyone, to develop without inhibition; the nineteenth century may have sought to promote, in addition to man's freedom, his individuality (which is connected with the division of labor) and his achievements which make him unique and indispensable but which at the same time make him so much the more dependent on the complementary activity of others; Nietzsche may have seen the relentless struggle of the individual as the prerequisite for his full development, while socialism found the same thing in the suppression of all competition – but in each of these the same fundamental motive was at work, namely the resistance of the individual to being levelled, swallowed up in the social-technological mechanism.|Georg Simmel ''The Metropolis and Mental Life'' 1903|&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg (1971) "The Metropolis and Mental Life", p. 324 in [[Donald N. Levine]] (ed) ''Simmel: On individuality and social forms'', Chicago University Press, {{ISBN|0226757765}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''The Philosophy of Money''===
{{main|The Philosophy of Money}}
In this major work, Simmel saw [[money]] as a component of life which helped us understand the totality of life.&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;

Simmel believed people created value by making objects, then separating themselves from that object and then trying to overcome that distance. He found that things which were too close were not considered valuable and things which were too far for people to get were also not considered valuable. Considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting the object.&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;

For Simmel, city life led to a division of labor and increased [[financialization]]. As financial transactions increase, some emphasis shifts to what the individual can do, instead of who the individual is. Financial matters in addition to emotions are in play.&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;

===''The Stranger''===
[[Image:Georg-Simmel-1914.jpg|thumb|150px|Simmel in 1914]]
Simmel’s concept of distance comes into play where he identifies a stranger as a person that is far away and close at the same time.

{{Quotation|The Stranger is close to us, insofar as we feel between him and ourselves common features of a national, social, occupational, or generally human, nature. He is far from us, insofar as these common features extend beyond him or us, and connect us only because they connect a great many people.|Georg Simmel ''The Stranger'' 1908|&lt;ref name="Simmel, Georg 1976"&gt;Simmel, Georg (1976) ''The Stranger'' The Sociology of Georg Simmel' New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A stranger is far enough away that he is unknown but close enough that it is possible to get to know him. In a society there must be a stranger. If everyone is known then there is no person that is able to bring something new to everybody.

The stranger bears a certain objectivity that makes him a valuable member to the individual and society. People let down their inhibitions around him and confess openly without any fear. This is because there is a belief that the Stranger is not connected to anyone significant and therefore does not pose a threat to the confessor's life.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

More generally, Simmel observes that because of their peculiar position in the group, strangers often carry out special tasks that the other members of the group are either incapable or unwilling to carry out. For example, especially in pre-modern societies, most strangers made a living from trade, which was often viewed as an unpleasant activity by "native" members of those societies. In some societies, they were also employed as [[arbitrator]]s and judges, because they were expected to treat rival factions in society with an [[Impartiality|impartial]] attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karakayali, Nedim|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2006.00293.x|title=The Uses of the Stranger: Circulation, Arbitration, Secrecy, and Dirt|year=2006|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=24|issue=4|pages=312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Objectivity may also be defined as freedom: the objective individual is bound by no commitments which could prejudice his perception, understanding, and evaluation of the given.|Georg Simmel ''The Stranger'' 1908|&lt;ref name="Simmel, Georg 1976"/&gt;}}

On one hand the stranger's opinion does not really matter because of his lack of connection to society, but on the other the stranger’s opinion does matter, because of his lack of connection to society. He holds a certain objectivity that allows him to be unbiased and decide freely without fear. He is simply able to see, think, and decide without being influenced by the opinion of others.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===On secrecy===
According to Simmel, in small groups, secrets are less needed because everyone seems to be more similar. In larger groups [[Sociological aspects of secrecy|secrets are needed]] as a result of their heterogeneity. In secret societies, groups are held together by the need to maintain the secret, a condition that also causes tension because the society relies on its sense of secrecy and exclusion.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
For Simmel, secrecy exists even in relationships as intimate as marriage.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}In revealing all, marriage becomes dull and boring and loses all excitement. Simmel saw a general thread in the importance of secrets and the strategic use of ignorance: To be social beings who are able to cope successfully with their social environment, people need clearly defined realms of unknowns for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Matthias Gross|Gross, Matthias]] |doi=10.1177/1749975512445431|title=‘Objective Culture’ and the Development of Nonknowledge: Georg Simmel and the Reverse Side of Knowing|year=2012|journal=Cultural Sociology|volume=6|issue=4|pages=422–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sharing a common secret produces a strong "we feeling." The modern world depends on honesty and therefore a lie can be considered more devastating than it ever has been before.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
Money allows a level of secrecy that has never been attainable before, because money allows for “invisible” transactions, due to the fact that money is now an integral part of human values and beliefs. It is possible to buy silence.&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;

===On flirtation===
In his multi-layered essay, published in 1923, Simmel discusses [[flirtation]] as a generalized type of social interaction. According to Simmel, "to define flirtation as simply a 'passion for pleasing' is to confuse the means to an end with the desire for this end." The distinctiveness of the flirt lies in the fact that she awakens delight and desire by means of a unique antithesis and synthesis: through the alternation of accommodation and denial. In the behavior of the flirt, the man feels the proximity and interpenetration of the ability and inability to acquire something. This is in essence the "price." A sidelong glance with the head half-turned is characteristic of flirtation in its most banal guise.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, G., 1984, ''Women, Sexuality &amp; Love''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On fashion===
In the eyes of Simmel, fashion is a form of social relationship that allows those who wish to conform to the demands of a group to do so. It also allows some to be individualistic by deviating from the norm. There are many social roles in fashion and both objective culture and individual culture can have an influence on people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socio.ch/sim/work.htm|title=Georg Simmel: Work|website=socio.ch|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the initial stage everyone adopts what is fashionable and those that deviate from the fashion inevitably adopt a whole new view of what they consider fashion.  Ritzer wrote, {{Quotation|Simmel argued that not only does following what is in fashion involve dualities so does the effort on the part of some people to be of fashion. Unfashionable people view those who follow a fashion as being imitators and themselves as mavericks, but Simmel argued that the latter are simply engaging in an inverse form of imitation.|[[George Ritzer]], ''Georg Simmel''  2008|&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;{{rp|163}}}}
This means that those who are trying to be different or "unique," are not, because in trying to be different they become a part of a new group that has labeled themselves different or "unique".&lt;ref name=ritzer/&gt;

[[Image:Koechler-kueresel_adalet_mi-book_cover.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''Global Justice or Global Revenge?'' Turkish edition 2005]]

'''''Global Justice or Global Revenge? International Criminal Justice at the Crossroads''''' (2003) is a book by Austrian philosopher [[Hans Köchler]], who was appointed by the [[United Nations]] as observer of the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial|Lockerbie bombing trial]] in the Netherlands (2000-2002). Turkish and Indian editions of the book were published in 2005, an Arabic edition was published in 2011.

==Topics==
The book deals with the evolving concept of [[universal jurisdiction]], the doctrine of [[humanitarian intervention]], legal questions of [[international terrorism]], and whether [[international criminal law|international criminal justice]] can at all be practiced in the absence of a global [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. The book analyzes the various international criminal courts since [[Nuremberg]] and provides a critical assessment of the prospects of the [[International Criminal Court]]. It challenges the assumption of established legal theory in which the normative framework of [[criminal justice]] can be abstracted from actual power relations and offers elements of a new doctrine on the "[[dialectical]] relationship" between [[Political power|power]] and [[law]].

==Quote from the author==

The gradual assertion of the International Criminal Court's authority will be the test case for the ''[[separation of powers]]'', which is the indispensable requirement of the rule of law, whether at the national or international level. Only a fully independent international court will guarantee that a system of ''[[global justice]]'', associated with [[universal jurisdiction]], will not turn into a system of ''global revenge'' where political interests, not the principles of [[impartiality]] and fairness, determine the practice of [[international criminal law]].

'''Götz Briefs''' (born 1 January 1889 in [[Eschweiler]]; died 16 May 1974 in [[Rome]]) was a [[Catholic]] social theorist, social ethicist, social philosopher and political economist, who together with Gustav Gundlach, SJ influenced the social teachings of [[Pope Pius XI]].

==Biography==
In 1908, Briefs began to study history and philosophy at the University of [[Munich]]. As it was customary in German academic circles at the time, he frequently switched universities, moving in 1909 to [[Bonn]], and later in 1911 to [[Freiburg]]. In Freiburg, he became a member of K.D.St. V. Wildenstein Freiburg im Breisgau, a Catholic student fraternity that belong to the [[Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen]]. In 1911, he completed his doctoral dissertation with an investigation of the influence of the alcoholic beverage industry on market price structures. He was awarded the highest honor [[Summa Cum Laude]] for his [[dissertation]] and continued on the topic of profits with his [[Habilitation]] on the effect of average profits on the economy in 1913.

In 1919, he was named Professor for economics at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität]] in Freiburg. Two years later 1921 he accepted a professorship at the Julius-Maximilian-Universität in [[Würzburg]]. In 1923 he returned to Freiburg and in 1926 to Berlin at the [[Technische Hochschule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32520346 |title=SOCIAL ECONOMY PLANNING. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |volume=XLVII, |issue=9,016 |location=Western Australia |date=19 May 1931 |accessdate=24 April 2017 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}, ''...At...conferences on 'The Workshop in a Changing Economic Environment,' to be presided over by Prof. Dr. Goetz Briefs. Leiter des Instituts fur Betriebssozioiogie und Soziaie Betriebsiehre an der Technischen Hochscule zu Berlin,..''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, he founded an Institute for [[Industrial Sociology]] in [[Berlin]].

After the [[National Socialist]]s won the elections in Germany and took over the government, he, like many other outspoken Catholics, lost his career and was forced to leave his native country. Göetz Briefs emigrated to the USA, where he found a teaching position as guest professor at the [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University]] and later full professor at the [[Jesuit]] [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C.

After being widowed during the war years, he married Elinor Castendyk in 1951, who later became known for her work on and translations of [[Romano Guardini]]. After his retirement, the couple lived in a mountain retreat near the [[Trappist]] monastery [[Holy Cross Abbey, Virginia|Holy Cross Abbey]] in [[Berryville, Virginia|Berryville]] in [[Clarke County, Virginia]], which he visited with his wife on a daily basis. Briefs influenced the social teachings of the Catholic Church and was considered a ghost writer of the encyclical ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' of [[Pope Pius XI]] with his friend, the Jesuit Gustav Gundlach, with whom he spent his annual Summer vacations together. On 16 May 1974 Briefs died in Rome after a short illness. He is buried in the Vatican's [[Campo Santo Teutonico]].

With Gustav Gundlach, Theodor Brauer, Paul Jostock, Franz H. Mueller, Heinrich Rommen and Oswald von Nell-Breuning, he was a member of the "Königswinter Circle" at the [[Königswinter]] ''"Institute for Society and Economy".'' Briefs received multiple scholarships and six honorary doctorates. In addition:

* 1959 – The Distinguished Service Cross of the Federal Republic of Germany [[Federal Cross of Merit|"Pour le merit"]]
* 1968 – The Star to the Order of Merit

Briefs published approximately 350 scientific articles. The road "Götz-Briefs-Weg" in his hometown was named after him in 1989.

Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson was an assistant editor of ''Eimreiðin'', a magazine published in 1972–75 by a group of young classical liberals or libertarians in the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]]. The group included [[Davíð Oddsson]], [[Þorsteinn Pálsson]], [[Geir H. Haarde]], [[Baldur Guðlaugsson]], [[Brynjólfur Bjarnason]], [[Kjartan Gunnarsson]] and [[Magnús Gunnarsson]]. The group became very influential within the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] in the late 1970s and onwards, [[Þorsteinn Pálsson]] being party leader in 1983–91, [[Davíð Oddsson]] in 1991–2005 and [[Geir H. Haarde]] since 2005. The group is widely seen as having made the Independence Party much more libertarian than it used to be. Hannes is a personal friend of [[Davíð Oddsson]] and served as his informal adviser during his 13&amp;nbsp;years as Prime Minister of Iceland, 1991–2004 (after which Oddsson was Foreign Minister for one year, and then Governor of the Central Bank 2005–2009).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1979, Hannes and his friends founded the Libertarian Association in Iceland, which operated for ten years. It organized visits by the three Nobel Laureates [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[James M. Buchanan]] and [[Milton Friedman]] in the early 1980s. Those visits had considerable impact on the exchange of ideas within Iceland. The Libertarian Association also published, in 1980–88, a magazine called ''Frelsið''. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 1984, from October 2 to 10, Hannes, with [[Kjartan Gunnarsson]], operated an illegal radio station, to protest against the government monopoly of broadcasting. Police eventually closed the station down. Hannes and Kjartan were indicted and fined for breaking the law on broadcasting. But the operation of the station and its closure turned many in the leadership of the Independence Party towards supporting the abolition of the government monopoly. The Icelandic parliament abolished the monopoly in 1985, and the law came into effect in 1986.

In early 1990, Hannes published a book on fisheries management, an important subject in Iceland whose main export is fish. It was entitled ''The Fish Stocks in the Icelandic Waters: The Property of the Nation or of the State?'' Hannes advocated a system of individual, transferable quotas, ITQs, in the Icelandic fisheries, where initially the quotas would be given free of charge to the owners of fishing vessels, in order to gain their support for what was tantamount to the enclosure of the Icelandic fishing grounds. The leadership of the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] also supported the ITQ system. The Independence Party held the Ministry of Fisheries 1991–2009.
[[Image:GissurarsonandOddsson1996.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson and Davíð Oddsson at the 1996 general meeting of the Independence Party]]
In 2002, Hannes published a book titled ''How Can Iceland Become the Richest Country in the World?''suggesting that Iceland could become an international financial centre offering low corporate taxes and a stable political environment. He named, as precedents, Luxembourg and Ireland – two other small European countries— and small islands, such as the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Caymans.

The corporate incomes tax in Iceland has already been lowered in the 1990s from 50% to 18%, and the net wealth tax had been abolished. The free-market reforms under the reign of the Independence Party 1991–2004 were comprehensive, not only consisting in tax reductions, but also in privatization, liberalization and stabilization. Enjoying access to the European financial market because of Iceland's membership of the EEA and also enjoying the high credit ratings for Icelandic companies earned in the 1991–2004 period, the Icelandic banks could expand rapidly, especially in the period after 2004. In the 2008 international financial crisis, the Icelandic Central Bank, since 2005 under the governorship of Davíð Oddsson, was refused credit lines from the US and Europe, with the result that the banks collapsed. It was argued that the Icelandic bank collapse was also a collapse of the neo-liberal model imposed on Iceland by Hannes and Davíð Oddsson. Hannes, however, points out that the Icelandic banks were subject to the same legal and regulatory framework as other banks in the EEA, and that their rapid credit expansion mostly took place after 2004.

==Controversy==
Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson has from the beginning of his public career managed to stir up controversy. It began when he first had a weekly radio talk show, at the Public Broadcasting Station, in 1976-7, introducing his audience to writers like [[George Orwell]], [[Arthur Koestler]], [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Karl Popper]]. The show was harshly criticized in the Socialist newspaper ''Þjóðviljinn''. In the early 1980s, Hannes and one of his former philosophy teachers at the University of Iceland, [[Þorsteinn Gylfason]], had a public feud in the newspapers where Þorsteinn called Hannes "a sheep in sheep's clothing", and Hannes responded by praising Þorsteinn as one of the "oldest and most promising philosophers in Iceland".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In early 1984, Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson had a heated exchange with [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], then acting editor of the Socialist newspaper ''Þjóðviljinn''. Ólafur Ragnar had quoted articles in ''The Guardian'' in England to the effect that [[Milton Friedman]], the "guru of the Icelandic libertarians", had, in his manipulation of his statistical data, acted dishonestly. The reference, by ''The Guardian'' and hence by Ólafur Ragnar, was to a recent critical study of Friedman's empirical research, by [[David Hendry]], a professor of statistics at the [[University of Oxford]]. Hannes wrote to Hendry who replied, saying that he had never accused [[Friedman]] of any dishonesty, and that their disagreement was one on methodology. The publication of Hendry's letter ended the dispute in Iceland.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

When, in the summer of 1988, the Minister of Education, Mr. [[Birgir Isleifur Gunnarsson]] (a leading member of the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]]), appointed Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson assistant professor of politics in the Faculty of Social Science at the University of Iceland, the Faculty and the University protested, since they had strongly recommended another applicant for the job. A special committee appointed by the Faculty had argued that Hannes was only partly qualified for the position, since his first University degrees were not in politics, but in philosophy and history. But the Minister of Education presented written reports by Hannes' teachers in England, Dr [[John Gray (LSE)|John Gray]], then of Jesus College, Oxford, later professor at the [[London School of Economics]], and Professor [[Norman P. Barry]] of the [[University of Buckingham]] that Hannes was fully qualified for a job as a teacher of politics. Later, the Faculty of Social Science confirmed Hannes' appointments, first as an associate professor, then as professor.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In the 1990s, Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson was a vocal critic of an Icelandic businessman, [[Jon Axel Olafsson|Jón Ólafsson]], chief owner of the private television channel, Stöð tvö. Jón Ólafsson was then seen by many as one of the bitterest enemies of Prime Minister [[Davíð Oddsson]], Hannes' friend and ally. In a paper (originally in English) to a conference of journalists in [[Reykholt, Western Iceland|Reykholt]] in the autumn of 1999, Hannes made disparaging remarks about Jón Ólafsson's past, which he subsequently put on his homepage (in English, as in the original). In 2004, on the basis of those remarks, Jón Ólafsson took Hannes to court in England, for libel, and obtained a judgement of £100,000. This was a judgement by default, as Hannes did not defend himself before the English court. Hannes appealed, arguing that a correct procedure had not been implemented against him, since he had not been served the claim form, or writ, according to Icelandic rules. The Royal High Court of Justice in London ruled in Hannes' favour and invalidated the decision against him on December 8, 2006. However, a ruling in March 2008 allowed the case to continue before English courts.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson informed the public, in the summer of 2003, that he was in the process of writing a three volumes' biography of [[Halldór Kiljan Laxness]], the Icelandic Nobel Laureate in literature, and the leading Socialist intellectual in Iceland in the 20th century, When the first volume of Hannes' biography of Laxness was published in late 2003, [[Helga Kress]] wrote a long and critical review of it, arguing that Hannes was guilty of [[plagiarism]] since he had in his book drawn heavily on the accounts of Laxness' childhood in his four volumes of memoirs without proper attribution. In late 2004, Laxness' widow sued Hannes for an alleged breach of [[copyright]]. On November 10, 2006, Hannes was acquitted by the Reykjavík District Court. The Supreme Court did however find Hannes guilty of the copyright breach on March 13, 2008, and ordered him to pay substantial damages.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 2013, Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson received a public apology from [[Robert Wade (development scholar)|Robert Wade]], Professor at the LSE, and [[Sigurbjörg Sigurgeirsdóttir]], a colleague of Hannes at the University of Iceland, for them having wrongly attributed to him as a direct quotation, from the Wall Street Journal in 2004, words that he had never written.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The '''Heptateuch''' (seven containers) is a name sometimes given to the first seven books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The seven books are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]]. The first four of these are sometimes called the Tetrateuch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWY8CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;vq=Tetrateuch&amp;dq=Old%20Testament%20Interpretation%20Mays%20Peterson%20Richards&amp;pg=PA36#v=snippet&amp;q=Tetrateuch&amp;f=false |title=Old Testament Interpretation: Past, Present And Future |chapter=The Formation of the Pentateuch |first=David L. |last=Petersen |editor1-first=James Luther |editor1-last=Mays |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Petersen |editor3-first=Kent H. |editor3-last=Richards |page=36 |year=1995 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first five are commonly known as the [[Torah]] or the [[Pentateuch]], the first six as the [[Hexateuch]]. With the addition of the [[Book of Ruth]], it becomes the [[Octateuch]]. The "Enneateuch" is the Heptateuch plus the [[Books of Samuel]] and the [[Books of Kings]] (each pair of books counted as one, and not including the Book of Ruth).

[[Augustine of Hippo]] produced a piece called ''Questions on the Heptateuch''. [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] produced an [[Old English language|Old English]] version of the Heptateuch.

'''Herbert Spiegelberg''' (May 18, 1904 &amp;ndash; September 6, 1990) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] who played a prominent role in the advancement of the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenogical movement]] in the United States.

==Life==

Spiegelberg was born in [[Strasbourg]], in the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] region of northeastern [[France]].  He studied at the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and [[University of Munich|Munich]], where he encountered [[Edmund Husserl]] and many others in the vanguard of the European phenomenological movement.  He received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1928 from the University of Munich. 
His doctoral dissertation was written under the direction of the phenomenologist [[Alexander Pfänder]] and was titled ''Gesetz und Sittengesetz'' (''Law and Morality'').

In 1937 Spiegelberg left the continent and studied for a year in England before emigrating to the United States.  In the U. S., he taught first at [[Swarthmore College]] and then at [[Lawrence University]], which later awarded him an honorary doctoral degree.

In 1953-54 and 1955-56 he received grants from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] for the preparation of the first edition of his landmark historical survey, ''The Phenomenological Movement: A Historical Introduction''.

In 1963, he relocated to [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] and remained there until his retirement as [[Emeritus Professor]] in 1971.  He also served as visiting professor at the universities of [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] and [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] and as [[Fulbright program|Fulbright]] Lecturer at the University of Munich.

Spiegelberg conducted five influential workshops in phenomenology, during the summers of 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969, and 1972.  The first workshop was supported by a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] and the second by a grant from the [[Monsanto Company]].

In 1981 Washington University established a [http://artsci.wustl.edu/~philos/history/lectures.htm series of lectures in phenomenology] in his honor.

Herbert Spiegelberg died of [[leukemia]], at the age of 86, at his home in St. Louis, Missouri.   His collected papers are available in the [http://archon.wulib.wustl.edu/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=367&amp;q=sturgis&amp;rootcontentid=479782 archives of the Washington University Libraries].

'''''History, Labour, and Freedom: Themes from Marx''''' is a 1988 book by the philosopher [[Gerald Cohen]].

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''History, Labour, and Freedom'' is a revision and expansion of Cohen's earlier ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'' (1978).{{sfn|McLellan|1995|page=440}} The work reprints several papers that argue against the idea that [[libertarianism]] advances freedom.{{sfn|Wolff|1991|page=154}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''History, Labour, and Freedom'' was reviewed by the political scientist [[David McLellan (political scientist)|David McLellan]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|McLellan|1989|page=809}}

===Academic journals===
''History, Labour, and Freedom'' received a positive review from McLellan in ''Political Studies''.{{sfn|McLellan|1990|page=756}} The book was also reviewed by William H. Shaw in ''[[Inquiry: Critical Thinking Across the Disciplines|Inquiry]]'',{{sfn|Shaw|1989|pages=437–453}} Daniel Little in ''[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]]'',{{sfn|Little|1990|pages=312–315}} and Andrew Levine in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]''.{{sfn|Levine|1991|pages=267–275}}

McLellan credited Cohen with "lucidity and sharpness of argument", and with offering important reformulations of the theory of historical revisionism put forward in ''Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence'' (1978). He considered Cohen's "discussion of the strength of nonmaterial
cultural elements such as religion and nationalism" particularly interesting, and found Cohen's discussion of the questions of how capitalism should be overcome, what form socialist society should take, and "the practical implications of the changing nature of the working class" to be "stimulating and relevant".{{sfn|McLellan|1990|page=756}}

{{Main article|University of Virginia}}

The [[University of Virginia]] has an honor code, formally known as the Honor System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Honor Committee | publisher = University of Virginia | url = http://www.virginia.edu/honor/ | date = 2006-12-11 | accessdate = 2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Honor code|Honor System]] is intended to be student administered.

It was founded by Virginia students in 1842 after John A. G. Davis, chairman of the faculty and professor of law, who was attempting to resolve a conflict between students, was shot to death.&lt;ref name="dabney-honor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dabney |first=Virginius |authorlink=Virginius Dabney |url=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=2006_01/uvaBook/tei/b000325415.xml&amp;chunk.id=d12&amp;toc.id=d12&amp;brand=default |title=Mr. Jefferson's University: A History |location=[[Charlottesville]] |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |year=1981 |isbn=0-8139-0904-X |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University had at that point a 17-year history of ongoing tensions between students and faculty over strictly enforced discipline, hours, and dress. Students, sons of the most prominent families of Virginia, found particularly galling the impugning of their honor by stringent supervision during tests: "[t]he students were allowed to bring only a pencil to the classroom, they were forbidden to speak, and the professors, operating in shifts, watched them with 'lynx-like' eyes during the course of the examinations."&lt;ref name="MyUser_Richmondthenandnow.com_February_19_2015c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richmondthenandnow.com/Newspaper-Articles/Honor-System.html |title=I Certify On My Honor--'The Real Story of How the Famed 'Honor System' at University of Virginia Functions and What Matriculating Students Should Know About It |newspaper=Richmond Times Dispatch |date=November 26, 1936 |author=C.

Originally the honor system only applied to allegations of cheating, although it was subsequently expanded to hold students to a general standard of gentlemanly conduct: the shared values of an all white, all male Southern aristocratic tradition.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Richmondthenandnow.com_February_19_2015c"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Noel C. Paul |coauthors=|title=Honoring the Code |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0604/p11s02-lehl.html |quote= |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=June 4, 2002 |accessdate=2014-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, however, the Honor System is composed of only three simple tenets: a student will not [[lie]], [[cheating|cheat]], or [[theft|steal]]. It extends to matters academic and personal, and the sole sanction for a confirmed Honor System violation is dismissal from the university. This is called the "single sanction system".

[[File:Honorsystematuva.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque regarding 150 years of the Honor System, placed on the Lawn in 1992]]
The system is not without its detractors—it has been criticized because the required severe penalty may prevent more moderate violations from being reported or acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Professors Tepid about the Honor System |work=[[Charlottesville Daily Progress]] |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/survey_uva_faculty_tepid_about_honor_system/13683/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723223505/http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/survey_uva_faculty_tepid_about_honor_system/13683/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-23 |last=Kessler |first=Aaron |date=2006-12-27 |accessdate=2007-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although students have voted on numerous proposals to weaken or eliminate the single sanction over the past few decades, none has ever succeeded. Support for the honor system has waned in recent years, and in the Spring of 2007 a non-binding referendum to replace the single sanction with a tiered, multiple sanction system received 49.5% of the votes cast, falling just 62 votes shy of a majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students decide on referenda |work=[[Cavalier Daily]] |last=Madrecki |first=Thomas |url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/news/2007/mar/01/students-decide-on-referenda/ |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2008-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114115956/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/news/2007/mar/01/students-decide-on-referenda/ |archivedate=2009-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While cheating convictions are relatively rare (24 students were dismissed during the 2003 academic year, and 21 more were dismissed in 2004), a large cheating scandal occurred in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Greta von Susteren |coauthors= |title=University of Virginia Tackles Cheating Head On|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0105/10/bp.00.html |quote= |work=[[CNN]] |date=May 10, 2001 |accessdate=2014-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physics professor and Hereford College Dean Louis Bloomfield, based on a student's complaint, suspected that some of his students copied portions of their term papers from [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] archives in his Introduction to Physics class. After devising a computer program to detect copied phrases of at least six sequential words, over 150 students were accused of plagiarizing or allowing others to plagiarize their work over the previous five semesters. Although over 100 of these students were eventually exonerated, 48 students either admitted guilt or were convicted, and were therefore dismissed from the university. Three of these students had already graduated, and their degrees were subsequently revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/4/other-academic-integrity-cases/ |title= Past Cases May Shed Light on 'Introduction to Congress" Investigation | date=September 4, 2012 | publisher = ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'' | accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawsuits have challenged the honor system, such as a 1983 case  brought by an expelled law student that reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. Courts so far have concluded the system affords due process sufficient to satisfy constitutional expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Meg Scheu|coauthors= |title=Judge Denies Call to Dismiss Lawsuit|url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/1999/07/judge-denies-call-to-dismiss-lawsuit |quote= |work=[[Cavalier Daily]] |date=June 22, 1999 |accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1983 the Fourth Circuit rejected a challenge brought by an expelled law student, the [http://openjurist.org/719/f2d/69/henson-v-honor-committee-of-u-va-u Henson case], concluding UVA's student-run honor system afforded sufficient due process to pass constitutional scrutiny.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there has been at least one case of UVA administration interference in an honor proceeding under the threat of a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Robert O' Harrow Jr.|coauthors= |title=Honor Case Causes Uproar at U-Va.; Some Angry Over Official Intervention, Student Panel's Unusual Reversal of Decision

The Honor Committee of that year insisted Leggett had received a fair trial but President [[John T.

'''''Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published quarterly by [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. As of March 2018, the journal is led by an interim editor, [[Ann Garry]], and two interim co-editors, [[Serene Khader]] and [[Alison Stone]].&lt;ref name=EditorialBoard/&gt; Book reviews are published by ''Hypatia Reviews Online (HRO)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hypatiareviews.org/ ''Hypatia Reviews Online''].&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is owned by a non-profit corporation, Hypatia, Inc.&lt;ref name=missionandvision&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypatia Inc|url=https://missionandvision.org/nonprofit/262868769/hypatia-inc/overview|publisher=Mission&amp;Vision|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310062603/https://missionandvision.org/nonprofit/262868769/hypatia-inc/overview|archivedate=10 March 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the journal arose out of meetings of the [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] (SWIP) in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy | url = http://pembroke-archives.squarespace.com/hypatia-a-journal-of-feminist-philosophy-1/ | publisher = [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] | access-date = 29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt; Philosopher and legal scholar [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] became the founding editor in 1982, when it was published as a "piggy back" issue of the ''[[Women's Studies International Forum]]''.&lt;ref name=Hibri22Oct2009/&gt; Named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a philosopher who was murdered by a mob in [[415]] CE, it became an independent journal in 1986.&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt;

''Hypatia'' became [[#2017 dispute|involved in a damaging dispute]] in April 2017 when its associate editors published an unauthorized apology for the journal's publication of an article on [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]], after the author and article were criticized on [[social media]]. The episode pointed to a significant breakdown of communications within ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial team.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schuessler19May2017/&gt; The journal responded by setting up a task force to restructure its governance.&lt;ref name=Weinberg13Nov2017/&gt;  ''Hypatia'' was the subject of further controversy in 2018, when it accepted a hoax article that had been deliberately designed to satirise feminist philosophy.  The hoax, which formed part of the [[Grievance Studies affair|Grievance studies scandal]], was revealed before the article could be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/arts/academic-journals-hoax.html?module=inline|title=Hoaxers Slip Breastaurants and Dog-Park Sex Into Journals|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
{{seealso|Feminist philosophy}}
''Hypatia'' has its roots in regional meetings of the [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] (SWIP), established in 1972.

SWIP decided in 1977 to set up an [[editorial board]] to plan the journal; the first board was put together by [[Ann Garry]] ([[California State University, Los Angeles|Cal State LA]]) and Jacqueline Thomason ([[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]]).&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt;{{efn|The 1977 SWIP editorial board included [[Ann Garry]], Jacqueline Thomason, [[Sandra Bartky]], Candace Groudine, [[Sandra Harding]], [[Sarah Hoagland]], [[Alison Jaggar]], [[Helen Longino]], [[Linda López McAlister]], [[Kathryn Morgan]], Janice Moulton, Connie Crank Price, and Joyce Trebilco.&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt;}} At a meeting in Denver in the spring of 1979, the board agreed that [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] ([[University of Richmond|UR]]) should be the founding editor.&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt; Al-Hibri began work on the journal in 1982, after she had completed her PhD in philosophy and just as she was starting her first year of [[law school]].&lt;ref name=Hibri22Oct2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Al-Hibri|first1=Azizah Y|author-link=Azizah Y. al-Hibri|title=A Journal of Her Own: Hypatia Founders and Editors|url=https://vimeo.com/12221774|publisher=25th Anniversary Conference: Feminist Legacies/Feminist Futures, University of Washington|date=22 October 2009|at=Courtesy of Vimeo, 00:05:50–00:08:15|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy and women's studies departments at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] offered support in the form of an office and research assistance.{{sfn|Al-Hibri|2009|loc=from 00:08:57}} ''[[Women's Studies International Forum]]'' agreed to publish the new journal as an annual "piggy back" issue of its own, which it did for three years,&lt;ref name=Hibri22Oct2009/&gt; and distributed 10,000 brochures to its mailing list advertising it.{{sfn|25th Anniversary Conference|2009|loc=from 00:08:45}}

The group led by Al-Hibri decided that submissions would be fully reviewed and that substantive comments would be offered, Alcoff wrote, rather than the usual brief rejection, to help authors improve their work and to contribute to the field's development.&lt;ref name=Alcoff4May2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alcoff|first1=Linda Martín|author-link=Linda Martín Alcoff|title=Here's my take.|url=https://www.facebook.com/lsalcoff/posts/10156108465053047|publisher=Facebook|archiveurl=https://archive.is/PYN7m|archivedate=15 May 2017|date=4 May 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donna Serniak ([[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]) was responsible for the first issue.{{sfn|Al-Hibri|2009|loc=from 00:11:30}} It was first published independently of ''Women's Studies International Forum'' in 1986.&lt;ref name=Gruen2010/&gt;

The journal is named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a mathematician and philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE. Al-Hibri said that the SWIP editorial board chose the name to reflect that women have "deep roots in philosophy".{{sfn|Al-Hibri|2009|loc=from 00:08:57}} According to [[Linda López McAlister]] ([[University of South Florida|USF]]), the idea for the name came from Sue Larson ([[Barnard College|Barnard]]) during a meeting of Eastern SWIP in 1973. [[Sandra Harding]] ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]), who was at the meeting, objected, thinking it awful to name a feminist-philosophy journal after a woman who had been "stoned to death for telling the truth".{{sfn|25th Anniversary Conference|2009|loc=00:02:50}} The first suggestion was ''Hypatia: A Journal of Philosophy and Feminism'', rather than ''A Journal of Feminist Philosophy'', because at the time it was unclear what feminist philosophy might be.{{sfn|25th Anniversary Conference|2009|loc=from 00:05:45}}

The journal had published Tuvel's article, "In Defense of Transracialism", in its spring 2017 edition after the standard double-anonymous [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]].

In July 2017 Scholz resigned as editor-in-chief, along with Shelley Wilcox, editor of ''Hypatia Reviews Online''.

Eight of the associate editors resigned. In their resignation statement, they wrote that the current controversy was "grounded in long-standing differences and tensions within the field."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17679">'''Ionel Gherea''', also known as '''Ioan Dobrogeanu-Gherea''' or '''Ion D. Gherea''' ([[Francization|Francized]] ''J. D. Ghéréa''; 1895 – November 5, 1978), was a [[Romania]]n philosopher, essayist, and concert pianist. The son of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoretician and critic, and the brother of communist militant [[Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea|Alexandru "Sașa" Gherea]], he discarded their political and literary influence, being more interested in the [[aestheticism]] of his brother-in-law, [[Paul Zarifopol]]. As a youth, Zarifopol took him to meet playwright [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and his family. Gherea's debut as a writer was a 1920 novel written jointly with [[Luca Caragiale]], which was also his only contribution to the genre.

Enjoying national success as an accompanist for [[George Enescu]], Gherea was also a respected literary essayist, and a noted Romanian [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]], [[Ontology|ontologist]], and [[Aesthetics|philosopher of art]]; his lasting friendship with philosopher [[Constantin Noica]] transcended ethnic and ideological barriers. An [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], Gherea was repressed by during the first decade of [[Communist Romania|Romanian communism]], but reemerged in the 1960s as a memoirist and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] translator.

==Biography==

===Origins and early life===
Born into a [[Romanian Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Ploiești]], he was the third child of Marxist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and his wife Sofia (''née'' Parcevska, or ''Parcevskaia'').&lt;ref name="simion"&gt;[[Eugen Simion]] (ed.), ''Dicționarul general al literaturii Române'', vol. 6, pp. 325–326. Bucharest: [[Univers Enciclopedic]], 2007.  {{ISBN|973-637-070-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family originated in [[Dnipropetrovsk|Yekaterinoslav]], a Ukrainian part of the [[Russian Empire]]: patriarch Gherea fled to Romania to escape persecution for his political activism, and worked menial jobs before getting his break in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Atanasiu, pp. 373–377&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Iași]], he married Sofia; she was the daughter of a Polish [[gourmet chef]], who was also Gherea's business associate.&lt;ref&gt;Păcurariu, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of Ionel's birth, his father, mother, and his grown-up siblings were managing the Ploiești Train Station Restaurant, a venue for commercial and literary transactions, but also a hangout for Romanian and exile Russian Marxists, including [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Pavel Axelrod]].&lt;ref&gt;Atanasiu, pp. 57–58, 178–180; Păcurariu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandru soon made an impact as a revolutionary socialist, and later communist, militant.&lt;ref&gt;Beke, pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vtstilist"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], [http://www.lapunkt.ro/2014/07/21/un-stilist-al-ideilor-paul-zarifopol-si-snobismul-mesianic/ "Un stilist al ideilor: Paul Zarifopol și snobismul mesianic"], in ''LaPunkt'', July 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Gherea's early education took place at home and was followed by the local [[Ion Luca Caragiale National College (Ploiești)|Saints Peter and Paul High School]], where he graduated from the sciences section.&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt; Together with his elder sister Ștefania and her husband, literary critic [[Paul Zarifopol]], he lived in Germany for a time, especially in [[Leipzig]], and in Italy, but returned home upon the outbreak of World War I.&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt; In his father's houses in Ploiești and [[Sinaia]], as well as in Germany, he became acquainted with Caragiale; Gherea became friends with the playwright's younger son Luca (Luki). Other cultural figures whom he met in the family homes include [[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]], [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], [[George Coșbuc]], [[Panait Cerna]] and [[Sextil Pușcariu]]. His memoirs include sharply drawn portraits as well as revealing anecdotes about Caragiale and his elder son, [[Mateiu Caragiale|Mateiu]].&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt;

Around 1915, young Gherea was a student at the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Letters, where he became close friends with poet [[Artur Enășescu]] and met [[Tudor Vianu]], his fellow critic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tudor Vianu]], ''Scriitori români'', Vol. III, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1971, p. 321. {{OCLC|7431692}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also close to [[Lucia Demetrius]], and, together with Zarifopol, helped her launch her career as a novelist.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Lucia Demetrius]], [http://www.romlit.ro/memorii "Memorii"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 4/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Luki, Gherea himself wrote the novel ''Nevinovățiile viclene'' ("The Cunning Naïvetés"). A study in adolescent psychology, which has earned posthumous appreciation,&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ipnumele"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/n_numele_fiului "În numele fiului"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 10/2001&lt;/ref&gt; it appeared in ''[[Viața Românească]]'' in 1920. The work shocked conservative sensibilities with its supposed libertinage, and was only taken up by the literary magazine following Zarifopol's intercession.&lt;ref name="ipnumele"/&gt;

With Luki dying the next year, Gherea never returned to fiction writing.&lt;ref name="ipnumele"/&gt; He dedicated himself to philosophy and criticism, with essays which appeared in ''[[Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger|Revue Philosophique]]'', ''Viața Românească'' and its satellite, ''[[Adevărul Literar și Artistic]]'', ''[[Kalende]]'', later in Zarifopol's ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'' and ''Revista de Filosofie''. Such works reveal his intellectual debt to [[Blaise Pascal]]; a generous use of irony; complex readings from [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], but also of [[Marcel Proust]], [[Paul Valéry]], [[Francis Jammes]], and [[Knut Hamsun]].&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt; His abstract, philosophically grounded speculations somewhat resemble Zarifopol's, but unlike his onetime mentor, he often wrote down [[Impressionist literature|impressionist]] thoughts in the manner of [[Anatole France]], one of his favorite authors, glossing over the discrepancies and limitations of the texts he discussed.&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt; He is especially known for his pioneering study on Proust's [[snobbery]], which appeared in the 1929 edition of ''Adevărul Literar și Artistic'', and in which he opposed Zarifopol's own Proustianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dana Pîrvan-Jenaru, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Receptarea-lui-Proust-in-Romania*articleID_20269-articles_details.html "Receptarea lui Proust în România"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 436, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pianist-philosopher===
Gherea was also friends with violinist-composer [[George Enescu]]: in 1927 or 1928, he accompanied Enescu as a pianist on a domestic concert tour, also leaving anecdotes from that encounter.&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ștc224"&gt;Ștefan Cervatiuc, ''Istoria teatrului la Botoşani: 1838-1944. Vol 3: 1925–1944, Index'', p. 224. Botoșani: Quadrant.  {{ISBN|978-606-8238-88-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two reunited in 1936, when Enescu returned to the country and included Gherea on his team of touring pianists, which also included [[Dinu Lipatti]], [[Alfred Alessandrescu]], and Muza Ghermani Ciomac.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil Gheorghiu, "Anul muzical 1936—1937", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 10/1937, pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; Gherea claimed that, overall, he had been Enescu's piano accompanist in as many as 300 separate performances.&lt;ref name="ștc224"/&gt;

During those years, Gherea was writing a lengthy treatise on the [[philosophy of self]]; titled ''Le Moi el le monde. Essai d'une cosmogonie anthropomorphique'' ("The Self and the World. An Essay in Anthropomorphic [[Cosmogony]]"), it initially appeared in 1933 in the Paris-based ''[[Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale]]''. It was published in book form in Paris and in [[Bucharest]] in 1938.&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt; The book was noted by reviewer Constantin Floru for its disregard toward academic terminology, basing itself on "common sense", "years-long meditation", and "the erudition of a subtle spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Floru, p. 685&lt;/ref&gt; It earned Gherea the friendship and admiration of academic philosophers [[Constantin Noica]] and [[Petru Comarnescu]], who prepared the book for [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]]. Noica referred to Gherea as an "innovative" asset in [[Romanian philosophy]], comparing him to [[Stéphane Lupasco]] and [[Piu-Șerban Coculescu|Pius Servien]].&lt;ref&gt;Chișu &amp; Noica, pp. 72, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Moi el le monde'' mapped out an independent [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[ontology]], imagining situations in which the "coexistence" of individual minds creates an implicit need for [[time perception]], which inevitably leads them to the [[noumenon]]—hence, "cosmogony is anthropomorphic".&lt;ref&gt;Floru, pp. 686–689; Pătrășcanu, pp. 92–98&lt;/ref&gt; As read by Floru, Gherea understood these selves as [[Monad (philosophy)|monadic units]], with direct reference to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibnitz]]'s ontological essences.&lt;ref&gt;Floru, pp. 688–689&lt;/ref&gt; Gherea's "anthropomorphism" was nevertheless a critique of "naive" [[materialism]], seeking to rehabilitate [[idealism]] with input from [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;Pătrășcanu, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]], himself a [[historical materialist]], found the work to be "original", but remained critical of Gherea's implicit [[agnosticism]] and explicit [[consequentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pătrășcanu, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1930s, Gherea and Noica were involved with the ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion]]'' cultural forum. He was supposed to lecture there about the phenomenology of [[Edmund Husserl]], but, being a timid man, lost his composure; he was filled in by [[Mircea Vulcănescu]], who reused his notes.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Mihai, "Dinamica conferințelor Criterionului", in ''Anuarul Institutului de Cercetări Socio-umane C. S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor'', Vol. 13, 2012, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; He and Noica became friends, despite the latter being a right-leaning [[National conservatism|national conservative]]. Noica wrote in 1936: "One of the several things about [Gherea] that left a mark on me is that, although he lives in a leftist milieu and carries a surname dear to the Jewish and socialist circles, he has never once profited from this and has been living in want, at least not these past few years."&lt;ref&gt;Chișu &amp; Noica, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repression and recovery===
The rise of [[Iron Guard]] fascism and antisemitism was a disappointment for Gherea, a fact documented by [[Mihail Sebastian]], a Zarifopol disciple and fellow Jewish writer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mihail Sebastian]], ''Journal, 1935-1944''. London: [[Random House]], 2003, p. 135.  {{ISBN|0-7126-8388-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with Vulcănescu and Noica, he remained one of the "young philosophers and disciples" who stood by [[metaphysician]] and Guard affiliate [[Nae Ionescu]], when the latter was released from a concentration camp for political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], ''Autobiography, Vol. 2. 1937–1960, Exile's Odyssey'', p. 83.  Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1988.  {{ISBN|0-226-20411-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1940, the Iron Guard's [[National Legionary State|National Legionary government]] ordered his father's remains to be exhumed and reburied in a Jewish-only cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matatias Carp]], ''Cartea neagră. Suferințele evreilor din România, 1940—1944. I. Legionarii și rebeliunea'', p. 197. Bucharest: [[Editura Socec]], 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II and the [[King Michael's Coup|fall of fascism]], Gherea, whose brother had taken refuge to the Soviet Union and killed as a dissident during the [[Great Purge]],&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; was troubled by the prospects of communization. In a 1946 interview with [[Ion Biberi]], he expressed his support for a "tolerant and libertarian democracy", but believed that the future belonged to "the sort of socialism that prevents people from speaking their mind."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel Dimisianu]], "La început, la mijloc, la sfârșit de secol", in ''[[Lettre Internationale]]'' (Romanian edition), Nr. 62, Summer 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Gherea's final decades were lived under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. Branded a "decadent" philosopher in the Marxist works of [[Constantin Ionescu Gulian]], he was marginalized together with other thinkers of his generation.&lt;ref name="vtgulian"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/c._i._gulian_exterminatorul_filosofiei_romneti "C. I. Gulian, exterminatorul filosofiei românești"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 2/2012&lt;/ref&gt; By 1955, his father, Constantin, was being officially recovered as a precursor of [[Socialist realism in Romania|socialist realism]], the standard literary dogma,&lt;ref&gt;Florin Mihăilescu, ''De la proletcultism la postmodernism''. Constanța: [[Editura Pontica]], 2002, pp. 94–95.  {{ISBN|973-9224-63-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his works appeared only in [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censored form]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Monica Lovinescu]], ''Unde scurte'', p. 410. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 1990.  {{ISBN|973-28-0172-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gherea was mainly focused on translation work, putting out versions of Jammes, [[Thomas de Quincey]] and [[Heinrich Mann]] into Romanian, while rendering [[Ion Marin Sadoveanu]]'s ''Sfârșit de veac în București'' into French.&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt;

In the late 1950s, Gherea's continued visits with Noica became a subject of interest for [[Securitate]] agents, who were monitoring Noica for his former Iron Guard affiliation. Noica and many of his friends were arrested and tried in 1960, with Gherea himself interrogated.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} George Ardeleanu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/CONSTANTIN-NOICA-IN-VIZORUL-SECURITATII*articleID_13570-articles_details.html "Constantin Noica în vizorul Securității. Meditații la limba engleză (la Cîmpulung, în 1957–1958)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 277, July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Later that decade, the regime introduced controlled liberalization, and Gulian was sidelined.&lt;ref name="vtgulian"/&gt; ''Nevinovățiile viclene'' came out in a paperback edition at [[Editura Tineretului]], 1969.&lt;ref name="ipnumele"/&gt; Gherea's work became more available. His essays reprinted in ''[[Manuscriptum]]'', then as the 1971 ''Eseuri'' ("Essays"), Gherea's 1938 study was only fully published in Romanian in 1984, as ''Eul și lumea''.&lt;ref name="simion"/&gt;

Living his final years in Bucharest, Gherea was sought after by his father's [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian Romanian]] biographer and translator, [[Gyula Csehi]], their interviews published in ''Igaz Szó'' on Gherea's 70th birthday. Csehi left this portrait of Gherea Jr: "His face is surprisingly like his fathers'. He is a quiet, gentle, thoughtful man, mindful of all exaggeration."&lt;ref&gt;Beke, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to philosophical work, in 1978 Gherea and Ion Herdan also published a translation from [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Birth of Tragedy]]'', also signaling a recovery for the German thinker.&lt;ref&gt;Simion Dănilă, "Die Rezeption Friedrich Nietzsches in Rumänien", in ''Nietzsche-Studien. Internationales Jahrbuch Fur Die Nietzsche-Forschung'', Vol. 34, Issue 1, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23298">[[Image:David Hume.jpg|right|thumb|[[David Hume]] raised the is–ought problem in his ''[[Treatise of Human Nature]]''.]]

The '''is–ought problem''', as articulated by the Scottish [[philosopher]] and [[historian]] [[David Hume]] (1711–76), states that many writers make claims about what ''ought'' to be, based on statements about what ''is''. Hume found that there seems to be a significant difference between [[Positive statement|positive]] statements (about what is) and prescriptive or [[normative]] statements (about what ought to be), and that it is not obvious how one can coherently move from descriptive statements to prescriptive ones. The is–ought problem is also known as '''Hume's law''', '''Hume's guillotine''' or '''fact–value gap'''.

A similar view is defended by [[G. E. Moore]]'s [[open-question argument]], intended to refute any identification of [[moral]] properties with natural [[properties]]. This so-called [[naturalistic fallacy]] stands in contrast to the views of [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]].

==Overview==
Hume discusses the problem in book III, part I, section I of his book, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739):

{{quote|In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, ''is'', and ''is not'', I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ''ought'', or an ''ought not''. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ''ought'', or ''ought not'', expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|chapter=Section 1|wslink=Treatise of Human Nature/Book 3: Of morals/Part 1|plaintitle=Treatise of Human Nature|last= Hume |first= David |authorlink = David Hume |year=|publisher=|page=469-470|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hume |first = David |authorlink = David Hume |title = A Treatise of Human Nature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Sp8B0ZdyAYC&amp;pg=PA335#v=snippet&amp;q=%22every%20system%20of%20morality%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-12-06 |year = 1739 |publisher = John Noon |location= London |page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!-- Please note before you "fix" it, that the preceding is a direct quote and that the words used in the text are so abbreviated --&gt;

[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Hume asks, given knowledge of the way the universe ''is'', in what sense can we say it ''ought to be'' different? (photograph, ''[[Earthrise]]'')]]Hume calls for caution against such inferences in the absence of any explanation of how the ought-statements follow from the is-statements. But how exactly ''can'' an "ought" be derived from an "is"? The question, prompted by Hume's small paragraph, has become one of the central questions of ethical theory, and Hume is usually assigned the position that such a derivation is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Priest |title=The British Empiricists |pages=177–78 |publisher=Routledge |location= |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-415-35723-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complete severing of "is" from "ought" has been given the graphic designation of ''Hume's Guillotine''.&lt;ref name="Black1964"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Max|title=The Gap Between "Is" and "Should"|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=73|issue=2|year=1964|page=165|issn=0031-8108|doi=10.2307/2183334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The apparent gap between "is" statements and "ought" statements, when combined with [[Hume's fork]], renders "ought" statements of dubious validity. Hume's fork is the idea that all items of knowledge are based either on logic and definitions, or else on observation. If the is–ought problem holds, then "ought" statements do not seem to be known in either of these two ways, and it would seem that there can be no moral knowledge. [[Moral skepticism]] and [[non-cognitivism]] work with such conclusions.

==Responses==

===Oughts and goals===
[[File:Alonzo Babers finish.JPEG|thumb|left|150px|Few debate that one ''ought'' to run quickly ''if'' one's goal is to win a race. A tougher question may be whether one "morally ought" to want to win a race in the first place.]]
[[Ethical naturalists]] contend that moral truths exist, and that their truth value relates to facts about physical reality. Many modern naturalistic philosophers see no impenetrable barrier in deriving "ought" from "is", believing it can be done whenever we analyze goal-directed behavior. They suggest that a statement of the form ''"In order for agent ''A'' to achieve goal ''B'', ''A'' reasonably ought to do ''C''"'' exhibits no [[category error]] and may be factually verified or refuted. "Oughts" exist, then, in light of the existence of goals. A counterargument to this response is that it merely pushes back the 'ought' to the subjectively valued 'goal' and thus provides no fundamentally objective basis to one's goals which, consequentially, provides no basis of distinguishing moral value of fundamentally different goals. A possible basis for an objective, moral realist, morality might be an appeal to [[teleonomy]].

This is similar to work done by moral philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], who attempts to show that because ethical language developed in the West in the context of a belief in a human [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]—an end or goal—our inherited moral language, including terms such as good and bad, have functioned, and function, to evaluate the way in which certain behaviors facilitate the achievement of that telos. In an evaluative capacity, therefore, good and bad carry moral weight without committing a category error. For instance, a pair of scissors that cannot easily cut through paper can legitimately be called bad since it cannot fulfill its purpose effectively. Likewise, if a person is understood as having a particular purpose, then behaviour can be evaluated as good or bad in reference to that purpose. In plainer words, a person is acting good when that person fulfills that person's purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacIntyre |first=Alasdair |title=After Virtue: A Study in Moral Philosophy |location=Notre Dame, IN |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |year=1981 |pages=148–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the concept of an "ought" is meaningful, this need not involve morality. This is because some goals may be morally neutral, or (if they exist) against what is moral. A poisoner might realize his victim has not died and say, for example, "I ought to have used more poison," since his goal is to murder. The next challenge of a moral realist is thus to explain what is meant by a "''moral'' ought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=H. L. A. Hart |last=Hart |first=H. L. A. |title=The Concept of Law |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discourse ethics===
{{Main article|Discourse ethics}}
Proponents of discourse ethics argue that the very act of discourse implies certain "oughts", that is, certain [[presupposition]]s that are necessarily accepted by the participants in discourse, and can be used to further derive prescriptive statements. They therefore argue that it is incoherent to argumentatively advance an ethical position on the basis of the is–ought problem, which contradicts these implied assumptions.

====Moral oughts====
As MacIntyre explained, someone may be called a good person if people have an inherent purpose. Many ethical systems appeal to such a purpose. This is true of some forms of [[moral realism]], which states that something can be wrong, even if every thinking person ''believes'' otherwise (the idea of [[brute fact]] about morality). The ethical realist might suggest that humans were created for a purpose (e.g. to serve God), especially if they are an [[ethical non-naturalist]]. If the ethical realist is instead an [[ethical naturalist]], they may start with the fact that humans have [[evolved]] and pursue some sort of [[evolutionary ethics]] (which risks “committing” the [[moralistic fallacy]]).
Not all moral systems appeal to a human telos or purpose. This is because it is not obvious that people even ''have'' any sort of natural purpose, or what [[Teleology|that purpose]] would be. Although many scientists do recognize [[teleonomy]] (a tendency in nature), few philosophers appeal to it (this time, to avoid the naturalistic fallacy).

[[File:The Posts - geograph.org.uk - 116024.jpg|thumb|Even if oughts can be understood in relation to goals or needs, the greater challenge of ethical systems remains that of defining the nature and origins of the good, and in what sense one ought to pursue it.]]
Goal-dependent oughts run into problems even without an appeal to an innate human purpose. Consider cases where one has no desire to be good—whatever it is. If, for instance, a person wants to be good, and good means washing one's hands, then it seems one morally ought to wash their hands. The bigger problem in moral philosophy is what happens if someone does ''not'' want to be good, whatever its origins? Put simply, in what sense ''ought'' we to hold the goal of being good? It seems one can ask "how am I rationally required to hold 'good' as a value, or to pursue it?"&lt;ref&gt;These ideas are discussed extensively in {{cite book |first=Richard |last=Joyce |title=The Myth of Morality |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue above mentioned is a result of an important [[ethical relativist]] critique. Even if "oughts" depend on goals, the ought seems to vary with the person's goal. This is the conclusion of the [[ethical subjectivist]], who says a person can only be called good according to whether they fulfill their own, ''self-assigned'' goal. Alasdair MacIntyre himself suggests that a person's purpose comes from their culture, making him a sort of ethical relativist.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in {{cite book |authorlink=J. L. Mackie |first=J. L. |last=Mackie |title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong |year=1997 |location= |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical relativists acknowledge local, institutional facts about what is right, but these are facts that can still vary by society. Thus, without an objective "moral goal", a moral ought is difficult to establish. [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] was particularly critical of the word "ought" for this reason; understood as "We need such and such, and the only way to get it is this way"—a person may need something immoral, or else find that their noble need requires immoral action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Anscombe |year=1958 |title=Modern Moral Philosophy |journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] |volume=33 |issue=124 |pages=1–19 |jstor=3749051 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100037943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If moral goals depend on private assumptions or public agreement, so may morality as a whole. For example, Canada might call it good to maximize global welfare, where a citizen, Alice, calls it good to focus on herself, and then her family, and finally her friends (with little empathy for strangers). It does not seem that Alice can be objectively or rationally bound—without regard to her personal values ''nor'' those of groups of other people—to act a certain way. In other words, we may not be able to say "You just ''should'' do this". Moreover, persuading her to help strangers would necessarily mean appealing to values she already possesses (or else we would never even have a hope of persuading her).&lt;ref&gt;http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is another interest of [[normative ethics]]—questions of [[Normative ethics#Binding force|binding forces]].

There may be responses to the above relativistic critiques. As mentioned above, ethical realists that are non-natural can appeal to God's purpose for humankind. On the other hand, naturalistic thinkers may posit that valuing people's well-being is somehow 'obviously' the purpose of ethics, or else the only relevant purpose worth talking about. This is the move made by [[natural law]], [[scientific moralist]]s and some [[utilitarians]].

===Institutional facts===
[[John Searle]] also attempts to derive "ought" from "is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Searle |first=John R. |title=How to Derive 'Ought' From 'Is' |journal=Philosophical Review |volume=73 |year=1964 |issue=1 |pages=43–58 |jstor=2183201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He tries to show that the act of making a promise places one under an obligation by definition, and that such an obligation amounts to an "ought". This view is still widely debated, and to answer criticisms, Searle has further developed the concept of [[institutional fact]]s, for example, that a certain building ''is'' in fact a bank and that certain paper ''is'' in fact money, which would seem to depend upon general recognition of those institutions and their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Searle |first=John R. |year=1995 |title=The construction of social reality |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0-02-928045-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indefinables===

Indefinables are concepts so global that they cannot be defined; rather, in a sense, they themselves, and the objects to which they refer, define our reality and our ideas.  Their meanings cannot be stated in a true definition, but their meanings can be referred to instead by being placed with their incomplete definitions in [[self-evident]] statements, the truth of which can be tested by whether or not it is impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction.  Thus, the truth of indefinable concepts and propositions using them is entirely a matter of logic.

An example of the above is that of the concepts "finite parts" and "wholes"; they cannot be defined without reference to each other and thus with some amount of circularity, but we can make the self-evident statement that "the whole is greater than any of its parts", and thus establish a meaning particular to the two concepts.

These two notions being granted, it can be said that statements of "ought" are measured by their ''prescriptive'' truth, just as statements of "is" are measured by their ''descriptive'' truth; and the descriptive truth of an "is" judgment is defined by its correspondence to reality (actual or in the mind), while the prescriptive truth of an "ought" judgment is defined according to a more limited scope—its correspondence to right desire (conceivable in the mind and able to be found in the rational appetite, but not in the more "actual" reality of things independent of the mind or rational appetite).&lt;ref name="prescriptive truths"&gt;see Aristotle's ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

To some, this may immediately suggest the question: "How can we know what is a right desire if it is already admitted that it is not based on the more actual reality of things independent of the mind?" The beginning of the answer is found when we consider that the concepts "good", "bad", "right" and "wrong" are indefinables. Thus, right desire cannot be defined properly, but a way to refer to its meaning ''may'' be found through a self-evident prescriptive truth.&lt;ref name="definables"&gt;As an example of philosophical argumentation that identifies particular indefinables, we take "being" and then "good".  Aristotle stated that although being is not a genus (''Posterior Analytics'' 2.7), yet of everything that is, being is predicated (''Topics'' 4.1), and that the [[Genus-differentia definition]]s, of which he was the first recorded proponent, requires that its subject be defined through its genus and a differentia.  But since nothing lies outside of what is predicated of being, there is nothing which can serve as a differentia.  So being is postulated to be indefinable.  Later, Aquinas made an [[argument]] that stated, "Good and being are the really the same, and differ only according to reason....  [G]ood presents the aspect of desirableness, which being does not present." (''Summa Theologica'', Part I, Q. 5, Art. 1) So good is postulated to be indefinable.&lt;/ref&gt;

That self-evident truth which the moral cognitivist claims to exist upon which all other prescriptive truths are ultimately based is: ''One ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else.'' The terms "real good" and "right desire" cannot be defined apart from each other, and thus their definitions would contain some degree of circularity, but the stated self-evident truth indicates a meaning particular to the ideas sought to be understood, and it is (the moral cognitivist might claim) impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction.  Thus combined with other descriptive truths of what is good (goods in particular considered in terms of whether they suit a particular end and the limits to the possession of such particular goods being compatible with the general end of the possession of the total of all real goods throughout a whole life), a valid body of knowledge of right desire is generated.&lt;ref name="self-evident"&gt;See for example Ruggiero, ''Thinking Critically about Ethical Issues'', 5th ed., Ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functionalist counterexamples ===
Several counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an "ought" logically follows from an "is." First of all, [[Hilary Putnam]], by tracing back the quarrel to Hume's dictum, claims fact/value entanglement as an objection, since the distinction between them entails a value. [[Arthur Prior|A. N. Prior]] points out, from the statement "He is a sea captain," it logically follows, "He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair MacIntyre]], ''After Virtue'' (2007), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] points out, from the statement "This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably," the evaluative conclusion validly follows, "This is a bad watch."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; John Searle points out, from the statement "Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars," it logically follows that "Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars." The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Don MacNiven, ''Creative Morality'', pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral realism ===
[[Philippa Foot]] adopts a [[Moral realism|moral realist]] position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a "committal in a new dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Foot, “Moral Beliefs,” ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', vol. 59 (1958), pp. 83–104.&lt;/ref&gt;  She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word "injury." Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?
{{quote|It may seem that the only way to make a necessary connection between 'injury' and the things that are to be avoided, is to say that it is only used in an 'action-guiding sense' when applied to something the speaker intends to avoid. But we should look carefully at the crucial move in that argument, and query the suggestion that someone might happen not to want anything for which he would need the use of hands or eyes. Hands and eyes, like ears and legs, play a part in so many operations that a man could only be said not to need them if he had no wants at all.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
{{quote|Philosophers who have supposed that actual action was required if 'good' were to be used in a sincere evaluation have got into difficulties over weakness of will, and they should surely agree that enough has been done if we can show that any man has reason to aim at virtue and avoid vice. But is this impossibly difficult if we consider the kinds of things that count as virtue and vice? Consider, for instance, the cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, courage and justice. Obviously any man needs prudence, but does he not also need to resist the temptation of pleasure when there is harm involved? And how could it be argued that he would never need to face what was fearful for the sake of some good? It is not obvious what someone would mean if he said that temperance or courage were not good qualities, and this not because of the 'praising' sense of these words, but because of the things that courage and temperance are.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Misunderstanding ===
[[Hilary Putnam]] argues philosophers that accept Hume's "is–ought" distinction reject his reasons in making this, and thus undermine the entire claim.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary (2003). ''The Collapse of the Fact-Value Dichotomy and Other Essays'', Harvard University Press, pp.21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars have also indicated that, in the very work where Hume argues for the is–ought problem, Hume himself derives an "ought" from an "is".&lt;ref&gt;Baier, Annette. "Hume's Own 'Ought' Conclusions," in Hume on Is and Ought&lt;/ref&gt;  Such seeming inconsistencies in Hume have led to an ongoing debate over whether Hume actually held to the is–ought problem in the first place, or whether he meant that ought inferences can be made but only with good argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;Pidgen, Charles. "Hume on Is and Ought"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeffrey I. Gordon''' (born {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1947) is a biologist and the Dr. Robert J. Glaser Distinguished University Professor and Director of the Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology at [[Washington University in St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gordonlab.wustl.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is internationally known for his research on gastrointestinal development and how gut microbial communities affect normal intestinal function, shape various aspects of human physiology including our nutritional status, and affect predisposition to  diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mednews.wustl.edu/sb/page/normal/182.html Washington University News]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies.

==Education and early career==
Gordon received his bachelor's degree in Biology at 1969 at [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio. Over the next four years, Gordon received his medical training at the [[University of Chicago]] and graduated with honors in 1973.   After two years as intern and junior assistant resident in Medicine at Barnes Hospital, St Louis, Gordon joined the Laboratory of Biochemistry at the [[National Cancer Institute]] as a Research Associate in 1975.  He returned to Barnes Hospital in 1978 to become Senior Assistant Resident and then Chief Medical Resident at Washington University Medical Service. In 1981 he completed a fellowship in medicine (Gastroenterology) at Washington University School of Medicine.  In the following years, Gordon rose quickly through the academic ranks at Washington University: Asst. Prof. (1981–1984); Assoc. Prof. (1985–1987); Prof. (1987–1991) of Medicine and Biological Chemistry. In 1991, he became head of the Dept. Molecular Biology &amp; Pharmacology (1991–2004).  Gordon is currently the Director of the Center for Genome Sciences (2004–present) at Washington University.

Gordon’s early career focused on the development of cell lineages within the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  His laboratory initially combined the use of transgenic mouse models and biochemical approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of gut epithelial development along the duodenal-colonic and crypt-villus axes.  Early studies also provided important insight into biochemical properties of lipid handling and transport in the digestive system. Dr. Gordon and colleagues later combined [[laser capture microdissection]], and [[functional genomics]] to characterize specified cell populations within the gastrointestinal tract, including [[multipotent stem cells]].

Gordon played a pivotal role in the study of protein N-[[myristoylation]], a co-translational modification by which a [[Myristic acid|myristoyl group]] is covalently attached to an N-terminal glycine residue of a nascent polypeptide. Gordon and his colleagues were instrumental in characterizing the mechanism by which N-myristoyltransferase (the enzyme that catalyzes the myristoylation reaction) selects its substrates and its catalytic mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Kresge et al., N-Myristoyltransferase Substrate Selection and Catalysis: the Work of Jeffrey I. Gordon. J. Biol. Chem. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon’s group published a series of elegant studies that describe the ability of components of the commensal microbiota to induce specific responses in the host intestinal epithelium.   One of these responses, the induction of intestinal cell surface [[fucose]] residues, is elicited by a prominent human intestinal symbiont,'' [[Bacteroides]] thetaiotaomicron'', which can harvest and use the host fucose as a carbon and energy source.&lt;ref&gt;Bry et al., A model of host-microbial interactions in an open mammalian ecosystem. Science. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon’s group published a seminal study in which functional genomics were used to document the genome-wide intestinal epithelial response to microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper et al., Molecular analysis of commensal host-microbial relationships in the intestine. Science. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Gordon’s laboratory has investigated epithelial cell interaction with human-associated pathogens, including uropathogenic ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', and ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]''.

==Present research==
Dr. Gordon and his laboratory are currently focused on understanding the mutualistic interactions that occur between humans and the 10-100 trillion commensal microbes that colonize each person’s gastrointestinal tract.   To tease apart the complex relationships that exist within this gut micobiota, Dr. Gordon’s research program employs [[germ-free animal|germ-free]] and [[gnotobiotic]] mice as model hosts, which may be colonized with defined, simplified microbial communities. These model intestinal microbiotas are more amenable to well-controlled experimentation.

Jeffrey Gordon has become an international pioneer in the study of gut microbial ecology and evolution, using innovative methods to interpret [[metagenomic]] and gut microbial genomic sequencing data.  In recent studies, Dr. Gordon’s lab has established that the [[gut flora|gut microbiota]] plays a role in host fat storage and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Backhed et al., Mechanisms underlying the resistance to diet-induced obesity in germ-free mice. PNAS, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordon and co-workers have used DNA [[pyrosequencing]] technology to perform metagenomics on the intestinal contents of obese mice, demonstrating that the gut microbiota of fat mice possess an enhanced capacity for aiding the host in harvesting energy from the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbaugh et al., An obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest. Nature, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of the microbial ecology of obese human subjects on two different weight loss diets indicate that the same principles may be operating in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Ley et al., Microbial ecology: human gut microbes associated with obesity. Nature, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;   His group has applied the sequencing of bacterial and archaeal genomes to describe the microbial functional genomic and metabolomic underpinnings of microbial adaptation to the gastrointestinal habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Sonnenburg et al., Glycan foraging [[in vivo]] by an intestine-adapted bacterial symbiont. Science, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel et al., Genomic and metabolic adaptations of ''Methanobrevibacter smithii'' to the human gut. PNAS, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been extended to describe the role of the adaptive immune system in maintaining the host-microbial relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson et al., IgA response to symbiotic bacteria as a mediator of gut homeostasis. Cell Host Microbe, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Gordon is the lead author of an influential 2005 National Human Genome Research Institute white-paper entitled “Extending Our View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)”.   In 2007 the [[Human microbiome project|Human Microbiome Project]] was listed on the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research as one of the New Pathways to Discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/ NIH Roadmap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210013519/http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/ |date=2010-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6947">'''John of Jandun''' ([[French language|French]] ''' Jean de Jandun,''' ''' Johannes von Jandun,''' or '''Johannes de Janduno,''' circa 1285&amp;ndash;1328) was a [[French people|French]] philosopher, theologian, and political writer.  Jandun is best known for his outspoken defense of [[Aristotelianism]] and his influence in the early Latin [[Averroist]] movement.

==Life==
Jandun was born in [[Reims]], in the Champagne region of France, between 1280 and 1289, though the exact date is unknown.  It is likely that he grew up in the small town of [[Jandun]] (modern day [[Signy-l'Abbaye]]).

Jandun is known to have become a member of the arts faculty in [[Paris]] by 1310, likely by as early as 1307.  While a professor in Paris, Jandun was well informed and involved with theological debates. In 1315 Jandun became an original member of the faculty at the [[College of Navarre]] and was in charge of 29 students.  In 1316 [[Pope John XXII]] awarded Jandun a canonry of [[Senlis]], and it is likely that he spent time there, though he continued to teach in [[Paris]] for the next ten years.

Jandun identified closely with [[Marsilius of Padua]], another Latin [[Averroist]] who was rector at the university in Paris from 1312-1313. Marsilius presented Jandun with a copy of [[Pietro d'Abano]]'s commentary on the problems of [[Aristotle]].

On 19 June 1324 Jandun was involved in a business transaction to rent a house for life.  Four days later Marsilius finished the ''[[Defensor Pacis]]''.  When it became known in 1326 that Marsilius had authored the ''Defensor Pacis'', he and Jandun fled together to the court of [[Louis IV of Bavaria]]. Pope John XXII began issuing condemnations against Jandun from 6 September 1326 and finally excommunicated Jandun on 23 October 1327 as a heretic.

Jandun accompanied Louis IV to [[Italy]], and was present in [[Rome]] on 1 May 1328 when Louis IV was crowned Holy Roman Emperor.  Louis appointed Jandun as [[Bishop of Ferrara]].  Ten weeks later Jandun was formally accepted as a member of Louis IV's court, and was given indefinite rations for three servants and three horses.  Later that summer, around 31 August 1328, Jandun died in [[Todi]], most likely en route to his new bishopric.

==Works==
Jandun is best known for his work on the ''[[agens sensus]]'', the principle of individuation, and the priority of universal knowledge to particular knowledge.  He also wrote on the theory of the vacuum, plurality of forms, form and matter, the soul, the intellect, as well as  other topics relating to [[Aristotle]]. Because of his closeness to Marsilius of Padua, Jandun is often incorrectly credited with authoring or coauthoring the ''Defensor pacis''.  It is now generally accepted that he did not write it, but it is possible that Jandun advised Marsilius on the work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}(&lt;ref&gt;there is a reference to this collaboration in R. Rubenstein "Aristotle's Children" p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;).

Jandun's works first appeared in manuscript beginning with a short ''quaestio''in 1314, though he may have begun writing as early as 1310 or 1307. He is also the author of an encomnium to Paris (''Tractatus de laudibus parisius''), written in 1323, which gives a description of that city in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;An edition of the text, along with introductory notes and a translation, appears in ''Paris et ses historiens aux 14&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; et 15&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècles; documents et écrits originaux recueillis et commentés par Le Roux de Lincy et L.M. Tisserand'' (Paris: Imprimerie impériale, 1867): 1-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Printed editions of his works include:

==Legacy==
Jandun's work carried the Latin Averroist tradition from Paris to [[Bologna]], [[Padua]], and [[Erfurt]] in the fourteenth century, and [[Krakow]] in the fifteenth century. Jandun tended toward the views of [[Aristotle]], but was not afraid to follow an idea to its logical conclusion.  Many of his views were uncommon and controversial, and were not received well by the Catholic Church. Manuscripts and printed editions influenced the Latin Averroist movement until the time of [[Galileo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2862">'''Jvarasura''' also called '''Jwarasura''' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]: ज्वारासुर) in [[Hindu]] mythology is the fever-deity and consort of pox-deity goddess, [[Shitala]].

==In Hindu mythology==

According to one legend, Jvarasura was born out of sweat of the fore-head of meditating [[Shiva]] and was threat to Gods. Once [[Vishnu]] was inflicted with fever of Javarasura, when in form of [[Hayagriva|Haya-griva]]. He killed the fever-demon, Jvarasura.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Hindu and Buddhist art|author= P. K. Mishra|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqSAQpCOifoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA107&amp;lpg=RA1-PA107&amp;dq=Jvarasura&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hgyH0Zqd-N&amp;sig=5aAPlcgBO7WdmNNjzzTztPE2n5U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v7gDT4uVEojTrQe9h-nzDw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Jvarasura&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; by cutting him into three pieces using his, cosmic-disk weapon, the [[Sudarshana Chakra]]. However, Jvarasura was later revived by [[Brahma]], who joined the three parts. But by that time each three parts had grown head and limbs. Thus Jvarasura is depicted as having three faces, three feet and remarkable ability to move in all directions at once. He was later selected as consort of pox-goddess, [[Shitala]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|title=The Divine consort: Rādhā and the goddesses of India  By John Stratton Hawley, Harvard University. Center for the Study of World Religions|year=1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3R1z0sE340C&amp;pg=PA351}}&lt;/ref&gt; 



The cult of Shitala-Jvarasura is widely popular in [[Bengali people|Bengali]] culture. Incidentally, in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]] and [[Hindi]] languages, fever is referred to as ''Jvara''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Hindu ritual and the goddess |author= [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] |year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmWLsI7gbI0C&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Asura]] means demon. The name Jvarasura is combination of these two words - ''Jvara'' (meaning fever) and ''Asura'' (meaning demon) - Jvarasura. Thus, Jvarasura means the demon of fever. Jvarasura is disguised as a young servant. [[Shitala]], the consort of Jvarasura is widely worshiped by village folk in whole of North India, as a protector of pox and fever diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fruits of worship: practical religion in Bengal  By Ralph W. Nicholas|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLI7nyI2UVYC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Buddhism==

In [[Buddhist]] culture, Jvarasura is depicted sometimes as consort of [[Paranasabari]], the Buddhist Goddess of diseases. In some images these deities are shown as flying away to escape from wrath of [[Vajrayogini]], the Buddhist Goddess and destroyer of diseases.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

'''Kim Sterelny''' (born 1950) is an Australian philosopher and professor of philosophy in the [[Research School of Social Sciences]] at [[Australian National University]] and [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. He is the winner of several international prizes in the [[philosophy of science]], and was previously editor of ''[[Biology and Philosophy]]''. He is also a member of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]].

==Work==
Sterelny's principal area of research is in the [[philosophy of biology]]. He states "the development of [[evolutionary biology]] since 1858 is one of the great intellectual achievements of science."&lt;ref name="evolutionthe1st4billionyears"&gt;{{cite book|title= Evolution: The First Four Billion Years| author=Sterelny, K| chapter=Philosophy of Evolutionary Thought | editors=[[Michael Ruse]] &amp; [[Joseph Travis]] | year=2009 | publisher= [[The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-03175-3 | page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterelny has also written extensively about the [[philosophy of psychology]]. He is the author of many important papers in these areas,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.victoria.ac.nz/hppi/staff/kim-sterelny.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; including widely anthologised papers on group selection, [[meme]] theory and cultural evolution such as "Return of the Gene" (with [[Philip Kitcher]]), "Memes Revisited" and "The Evolution and Evolvability of Culture."

Together with his former student [[Paul E. Griffiths|Paul Griffiths]], in 1999, Sterelny published ''[[Sex and Death]]'', a comprehensive treatment of problems and alternative positions in the philosophy of biology. This book incorporated a number of the positions developed in previous articles on the range of topics in the philosophy of biology. At certain points Sterelny and his coauthor differed (for example, on the Darwinian treatment of emotions and on the prospects for [[developmental systems theory]]).

In 2004 Sterelny's book ''Thought in a Hostile World: The Evolution of Human Cognition'' received the [[Lakatos Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/newsAndEvents/archives/2004/LakatosAward_PR.htm|title=Winner of the Lakatos Award 2004 announced|accessdate=3 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804201510/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/newsAndEvents/archives/2004/LakatosAward_PR.htm|archivedate=4 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a distinguished contribution to the philosophy of science. This book provides a Darwinian account of the nature and evolution of human cognitive capacities, and is an important alternative to nativist accounts familiar from [[evolutionary psychology]]. By combining an account of neural plasticity, group selection, and niche construction, Sterelny shows how much of the data on which nativist accounts rely can be accounted for without attributing a large number of genetically hardwired modules to the mind/brain. In 2008 Sterelny was awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize|Jean-Nicod Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutnicod.org/conf_2008.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714222835/http://www.institutnicod.org/conf_2008.htm |archivedate=14 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His lectures are published under the title, ''[[The Evolved Apprentice]]''. These lectures build on the non-nativist Darwinian approach of ''Thought in a Hostile World,'' while providing a discussion of a great deal of recent work by other philosophers, biological anthropologists and ecologists, gene-culture co-evolution theorists, and evolutionary game theorists.

[[File:Laplace, Pierre-Simon, marquis de.jpg|thumb| French scholar [[Pierre-Simon de Laplace]] (1749-1827)]]

In the [[history of science]], ''Laplace's demon'' was the first published articulation of [[causal determinism|causal or scientific determinism]], by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1814.&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html |last=Hawking |first=Stephen |title=Does God Play Dice? |work=Public Lectures}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to determinism, if someone (the demon) knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, their past and future values for any given time are entailed; they can be calculated from the laws of [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Simon Laplace, "[https://archive.org/details/philosophicaless00lapliala A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities]" (full text).&lt;/ref&gt;

A desire to confirm or refute Laplace's demon played a vital motivating role{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} in the subsequent development of statistical [[thermodynamics]], the first of several repudiations developed by later generations of [[physics|physicists]] to the assumption of causal determinacy upon which Laplace's demon is erected.

==English translation==

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''&lt;ref name="Truscott"&gt;Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'', translated into English from the original French 6th ed. by Truscott, F.W. and Emory, F.L., Dover Publications (New York, 1951) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This intellect is often referred to as ''Laplace's demon'' (and sometimes ''Laplace's Superman'', after [[Hans Reichenbach]]). Laplace himself did not use the word "demon", which was a later embellishment. As translated into English above, he simply referred to: ''"Une intelligence... Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l'avenir, comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux."'' Apparently, Laplace was not the first to evoke one such demon and strikingly similar passages can be found decades before Laplace's ''Essai philosophique'' in the work of scholars such as [[Nicolas de Condorcet]] and [[Baron D'Holbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marij  | year = 2014 | title = On the origins and foundations of Laplacian determinism | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368113001325 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 24–31 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2013.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems that the first who offered the image of a super-powerful calculating intelligence was [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], whose formulation of the principle of determinism in his 1758 ''Theoria philosophiae naturalis'' turns out not only to be temporally prior to Laplace's but also—being founded on fewer metaphysical principles and more rooted in and elaborated by physical assumptions—to be more precise, complete and comprehensive than Laplace's somewhat parenthetical statement of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kožnjak Boris | year = 2015 | title = Who let the demon out?

==Arguments against Laplace's demon==

===Thermodynamic irreversibility===
According to chemical engineer [[Robert Ulanowicz]], in his 1986 book ''Growth and Development'', Laplace's demon met its end with early 19th century developments of the concepts of [[irreversibility]], [[entropy]], and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. In other words, Laplace's demon was based on the premise of [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversibility]] and classical mechanics; however, Ulanowicz points out that many thermodynamic processes are irreversible, so that if thermodynamic quantities are taken to be purely physical then no such demon is possible as one could not reconstruct past positions and momenta from the current state. [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics]] takes a very different view, considering thermodynamic variables to have a statistical basis which can be kept separate from the microscopic physics.&lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, this theory has met criticism regarding its ability to make predictions about physics; a number of physicists and mathematicians, including Yvan Velenik of the Department of Mathematics for the [[University of Geneva]], have pointed out that maximum entropy thermodynamics essentially describes our knowledge about a system and not the system itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unige.ch/math/folks/velenik/publications.html|title=Section de Mathématiques Université de Genève|last=|first=|date=July 23, 2017|website=www.unige.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum mechanical irreversibility===
Due to its canonical assumption of [[determinism]], Laplace's demon is incompatible with the Copenhagen [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation]], which stipulates [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminacy]]. The interpretation of quantum mechanics is still very much open for debate and there are many who take opposing views (such as the [[Many Worlds Interpretation]] and the [[de Broglie–Bohm theory|de Broglie–Bohm interpretation]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.2719v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaos theory===
[[Chaos theory]] is sometimes pointed out as a contradiction to Laplace's demon: it describes how a deterministic system can nonetheless exhibit behavior that is impossible to predict: as in the [[butterfly effect]], minor variations between the starting conditions of two systems can result in major differences.&lt;ref name=SEPDeterminism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Causal Determinism"]&lt;/ref&gt; While this explains unpredictability in practical cases, applying it to Laplace's case is questionable: under the strict demon hypothesis all details are known—to infinite precision—and therefore variations in starting conditions are non-existent. Put another way: Chaos theory is applicable when knowledge of the system is imperfect whereas Laplace's demon assumes perfect knowledge of the system, therefore chaos theory and Laplace's demon are actually compatible with each other.

===Cantor diagonalization ===
In 2008, [[David Wolpert]] used [[Cantor diagonalization]] to disprove Laplace's demon. He did this by assuming that the demon is a computational device and showed that no two such devices can completely predict each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=David H. Wolpert| title=Physical limits of inference| journal=Physica D| volume=237| issue=9| year=2008| pages=1257–1281| doi=10.1016/j.physd.2008.03.040| arxiv=0708.1362| bibcode=2008PhyD..237.1257W}} [http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1476h/1476%20%28Wolpert%29.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=P.-M. Binder |url=http://www.astro.uhh.hawaii.edu/documents/Binder_nv-toae.pdf |title=Theories of almost everything |journal=Nature |volume=455 |year=2008 |pages=884–885 |doi=10.1038/455884a |issue=7215|bibcode=2008Natur.455..884B }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Wolpert's paper was cited in 2014 in a paper of Josef Rukavicka, where a significantly simpler argument is presented that disproves Laplace's demon using Turing machines. &lt;ref&gt;Rukavicka Josef (2014), ''Rejection of Laplace's Demon, The American Mathematical Monthly [https://dx.doi.org/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.121.06.498]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent views==
There has recently been proposed a limit on the computational power of the universe, i.e. the ability of Laplace's demon to process an infinite amount of information. The limit is based on the maximum entropy of the universe, the speed of light, and the minimum amount of time taken to move information across the [[Planck length]], and the figure was shown to be about 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=If the Universe Were a Computer |author=Physical Review Focus |publisher=[[American Physical Society|APS]] |date=24 May 2002 |url=http://focus.aps.org/story/v9/st27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, anything that requires more than this amount of data cannot be computed in the amount of time that has elapsed so far in the universe.

Another theory suggests that if Laplace's demon were to occupy a parallel universe or alternate dimension from which it could determine the implied data and do the necessary calculations on an alternate and greater time line, the aforementioned time limitation would not apply. This position is for instance explained in ''[[The Fabric of Reality]]'' by [[David Deutsch]], who says that realizing a 300-[[qubit]] [[quantum computer]] would prove the existence of parallel universes carrying the computation.

Counter arguments to this can be made using [[string theory]]. Albeit, the gradients of finite theories are useful, speculative scenarios, such as space-time decompactification &lt;ref&gt;Yau, S.-T., &amp; Nadis, S. J. (2010, p. 264). The shape of inner space: String theory and the geometry of the universe's hidden dimensions. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; occurring on a faster frame, require infinities whose interpretation remains open.

===Depictions in popular culture===

In the anime series ''[[Rampo Kitan: Game of Laplace]]'', Laplace's Demon is the basis of a high school student's computer program called Dark Star. Dark Star is a program which allows for a masked vigilante, Twenty Faces, to cause the deaths of people who have escaped justice.

In ''[[Blast of Tempest]]'', [[chaos theory]] and the [[butterfly effect]] are incorporated into the main theme, where time travel and breaking out of parallel universes become the main plot.

In the film ''[[Waking Life]]'' a discussion of Laplace's Demon takes place, as well as a handling of the retort from Quantum Mechanics.

In the webcomic ''[[Dresden Codak]]'', this concept is used in a page melding philosophical notions and a ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]]'' séance titled "Advanced dungeons and discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dresden Codak » Archive » Advanced Dungeons &amp; Discourse|url = http://dresdencodak.com/2009/01/27/advanced-dungeons-and-discourse/|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this page, Kimiko Ross has to burn the second law of thermodynamics in order to summon the demon.

The UK sitcom ''[[Spaced]]'' featured an episode called Chaos, in which the artist Brian makes an implicit reference to Laplace's Demon in a conversation about [[chaos theory]]. He states that reality is a mathematically predictable preordained system, even though it would "utterly defy any possibility of comprehension by even the most brilliant human mind."

In the light novel and anime series ''[[Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai|Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai]]'', it is mentioned in order to try define the situation in which the main protagonist is repeating a specific day.

''Rapurasu no Majo'' (''Laplace's Witch''), a 2015 novel by Japanese author [[Keigo Higashino]]. It was adapted into a [[Laplace's Witch (film)|2018 film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and starring [[Shō Sakurai]].

{{mergeto|Neural correlates of consciousness|discuss=Talk:Neural correlate#Merger proposal|date=July 2017}}

A '''neural correlate''' of a content of [[experience]] is any bodily component, such as an electro-neuro-biological state or the state assumed by some [[biophysics|biophysical]] subsystem of the brain, whose presence necessarily and regularly correlates with such a specific content of [[experience]].

When the full [[ontology|ontological]] consistence or build-up of the reality variably called [[mind]], [[soul]], [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], or existentiality is called "[[consciousness]]" and [[Philosophy of mind|deemed to]] exclusively consist in mental contents associated with and at least partly generated by the [[Human brain|brain]] organ, the notion of [[neural correlates of consciousness|neural correlate of consciousness]]  is commonly employed. When it is only the sensations that are held to be produced by brain states, whether exclusively or not (''e.g.'', when sensations are also deemed capable of being generated by the mind reacting against itself), then the notion of '''neural correlate of a content of experience''' is commonly utilized. A mid-way concept, not always clarified, is that of a neural correlate encompassing the production of every mental content but not of consciousness itself.

== Conceptual frameworks using the notion == 
The notion of a '''neural correlate''' of a mental state is an important concept for [[materialists]], those [[List of philosophers of mind|philosophers of mind]] and researchers who believe that all mental states are equivalent to brain states. According to strict [[materialists]], all properties credited to the [[mind]], including [[consciousness]], [[emotion]], [[beliefs]], and [[motivation|desires]] have direct neural correlates.  This is also a pragmatic view adopted by a number of scholars. This view frequently depends on considering [[mind]]s exclusively as sentient knots {{citation needed|reason=This concept needs more developement|date=April 2015}} in [[nature]]'s causal net.

Instead, other [[neuroscientist]]s find minds inaugurating [[Causality|causal actions]] in nature, rather than solely being able of merely continuing previously initiated causal sequences. These neuroscientists thus describe minds as percipient agencies, the mind's very agency or causal aptitude being deemed extraneous to any neural correlate.

Still, some neurobiologists consider reasons to further assume that rememberings are not engraved in brain tissue but retained by the very mind, which thereby transforms itself in a way different from the time changes underwent by non-minds. These later neuroscientists consider that there is no neural correlate for [[episodic memory|episodal]] and some other memories, but that the mind moves the brain state (like as it may also inaugurate a finger movement) in such a way as to produce a brain state which the mind then reacts to by fleshing its selected memory again ([[Husserl]]'s ''Einfüllung''), re-imagining it. This view develops a notion by [[Aristotle]] and, again, makes no use of the notion of neural correlate for certain experiences, namely in regard to complex mental contents. It only admits neural correlates for the mind's elementary sensational reactions, which are called "intonations" (following neurobiologist Christfried Jakob, 1866-1956).

The concept of a neural correlate only encompassing the production of intonations occurs in a variety of researchers on different neurobiological traditions, including [[Scholasticism]] (see ''References''). Rather, the concept of a neural correlate encompassing the production of every mental content occurs only in a specific conceptual line of theoretical [[neuroscience]], characterized by the following features:

* Minds are sometimes viewed as incapable of positing causal acts upon self-initiated, internal modifications. This posits [[observation|observer]]s in nature as [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomenal]], unable to introduce perturbations, even less to absolutely inaugurate causal series.
* Mental contents are considered stand-alone realities, similar to any other physical reality as apples, rocks, or molecules. Such a line of opinion does not admit a difference in level between non-mental things and mental contents, namely that while things as apples and rocks do not belong with any other natural reality and thus are capable of standing alone, mental contents rather belong with a particular mind or, as sometimes called, a particular existentiality: e.g., this red is in Jane's experience whereas that red (which might be sensationally identical to Jane's) is John's experience and not Jane's at all. This distinctive feature of the contents of experience is dismissed (see Szirko's article cited in ''References''), so that the physical condition of mental contents is deemed identical to the stand-alone condition of apples and rocks.
* The relationship of a mind with the body in which it finds itself is [[plato]]nistically portrayed, so that any a mind might have found itself in any a brain-body system, like as a steerman may find himself in any ship that he chances to steer. Therefore this line of theoretical [[neuroscience]] does not admit that every mind and its particular body could intrinsically make a unity besides and apart from their causal interactions, which interactions, inasmuch as the mind is also deemed [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomenal]], reduce to bodily influences upon the mind's experiences or states.
* As a consequence, the connections of a mind and the body in which it finds itself are deemed to exclusively be of [[Causality|causal-efficient]] nature, similar to the energy supplied for a domestic appliance to function. This view entails that minds are no more than the mental contents which may be causally generated in them by their respective brains. Sentience (minds' intonability), [[semovience]] (minds' capability of inaugurating [[Causality|efficient causal actions]] on internal forces) and circumstantiation (every mind's finding itself in not another body) are thus viewed as highly problematic and their research is usually relegated.

In the conceptual line characterized by these four features, and in recent years, papers have been published on the neural correlates of [[awareness]], [[emotions]], and [[decision making]]. [[Francis Crick]] wrote a popular book "The Astonishing Hypothesis" whose thesis is that the neural correlate for consciousness lies in our nerve cells and their associated molecules.  Crick and his collaborator [[Christof Koch]] have sought to avoid philosophical debates that are associated with the study of consciousness, by emphasizing the search for "correlation" and not "causation".

There is much room for disagreement about the nature of this correlation (''e.g.'', does it require synchronous spikes of neurons in different regions of the brain? Is the co-activation of frontal or parietal areas necessary?). The philosopher [[David Chalmers]] maintains that a neural correlate of consciousness, unlike other correlates such as for memory, will fail to offer a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon.

== Laboratory studies ==

Neurophysiological studies in animals provided some insights on the neural correlates of conscious behavior. [[Vernon Mountcastle]], in the early 1960s, set up to study this set of problems, which he termed "the Mind/Brain problem", by studying the neural basis of perception in the [[somatic sensory system]]. His labs at Johns Hopkins were among the first, along with Edward V.Evarts at NIH, to record neural activity from behaving monkeys. Struck with the elegance of SS Stevens approach of magnitude estimation, Mountcastle's group discovered three different modalities of somatic sensation shared one cognitive attribute: in all cases the firing rate of peripheral neurons was linearly related to the strength of the percept elicited. More recently, Ken H. Britten, William T. Newsome, and C. Daniel Salzman have shown that in [[Visual cortex#V5.2FMT|area MT]] of monkeys, neurons respond with variability that suggests they are the basis of decision making about direction of motion. They first showed that neuronal rates are predictive of decisions using signal detection theory, and then that stimulation of these neurons could predictably bias the decision. Such studies were followed by Ranulfo Romo in the somatic sensory system, to confirm, using a different percept and brain area, that a small number of neurons in one brain area underlie perceptual decisions.

Other lab groups have followed Mountcastle's seminal work relating cognitive variables to neuronal activity with more complex cognitive tasks. Although monkeys cannot talk about their perceptions, behavioral tasks have been created in which animals made nonverbal reports, for example by producing hand movements. Many of these studies employ perceptual illusions as a way to dissociate sensations (''i.e.'', the sensory information that the brain receives) from perceptions (''i.e.'', how the consciousness interprets them). Neuronal patterns that represent perceptions rather than merely sensory input are interpreted as reflecting the neuronal correlate of consciousness.

Using such design, [[Nikos Logothetis]] and colleagues discovered perception-reflecting neurons in the temporal lobe. They created an experimental situation in which conflicting images were presented to different eyes (''i.e.'', [[binocular rivalry]]). Under such conditions, human subjects report bistable percepts: they perceive alternatively one or the other image. Logothetis and colleagues trained the monkeys to report with their arm movements which image they perceived. Temporal lobe neurons in Logothetis experiments often reflected what the monkeys' perceived. Neurons with such properties were less frequently observed in the primary visual cortex that corresponds to relatively early stages of visual processing. Another set of experiments using binocular rivalry in humans showed that certain layers of the cortex can be excluded as candidates of the neural correlate of consciousness. Logothetis and colleagues switched the images between eyes during the percept of one of the images. Surprisingly the percept stayed stable. This means that the conscious percept stayed stable and at the same time the primary input to layer 4, which is the input layer, in the visual cortex changed. Therefore layer 4 can not be a part of the neural correlate of consciousness. [[Attention versus memory in prefrontal cortex|Mikhail Lebedev]] and their colleagues observed a similar phenomenon in monkey prefrontal cortex. In their experiments monkeys reported the perceived direction of visual stimulus movement (which could be an illusion) by making eye movements. Some prefrontal cortex neurons represented actual and some represented perceived displacements of the stimulus. Observation of perception related neurons in prefrontal cortex is consistent with the theory of [[Christof Koch]] and [[Francis Crick]] who postulated that neural correlate of consciousness resides in prefrontal cortex. Proponents of distributed neuronal processing may likely dispute the view that consciousness has a precise localization in the brain.

== Of cognitive variables ==

In addition to neural correlate of consciousness in general, much progress has been made in elucidating neural correlates of specific cognitive variables.  Thus, Earl Miller and colleagues discovered prefrontal cortex neurons that represent perceptual categories (cats versus dogs in their experiments). The work of Richard Andersen, Steven Wise, Carl Olson, Jun Tanji, Apostolos Georgopoulos and other neuroscientists has illuminated neuronal correlates of [[motor planning]], selective visual attention, motor sequences and spatial reference frames in which these entities are represented by brain cells. The progress in understanding neuronal correlates of motor planning has led to the creation of [[brain-machine interface]] so, the devices that translate neuronal activity into purposeful commands to artificial actuators.

A large number of studies have addressed the problem of neural correlates of mental representations in human subjects. For example,  functional neuroimaging have shown that parts of the cortex are still active in vegetative patients that are presumed to be unconscious (Laureys, Trends Cogn Sci, 2005, 9:556-559). However, these areas appear to be functionally disconnected from associative cortical areas whose activity is needed for awareness.

In [[Indian philosophy]], action or [[Karma]] has been divided into three categories, according to their intrinsic qualities or [[guna]]s. Here Nishkam Karma belongs to the first category, the ''[[Sattva]]'' (pure) or actions which add to calmness; the Sakam Karma (Self-centred action) comes in the second ''[[rajas|rājasika]]'' (aggression) and Vikarma (bad-action) comes under the third,  ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tāmasika]]'' which correlates to darkness or inertia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Speaking_Tree/All_Work_And_No_Play_Makes_You_Dull/articleshow/2983723.cms Relaxation, a must for better mind power] ''[[Times of India]], July 28, 2008.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of ''Sakam Karma'' (Attached Involvement) or actions done with results in mind,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindubooks.org/samskars/krishna_bhatta/sakamkarma/index.htm Sakam Karma]&lt;/ref&gt; Nishkam Karma has been variously explained as 'Duty for duty's sake' &lt;ref&gt;''Psychology in Human and Social Development: Lessons from Diverse Cultures : a Festschrift for Durganand Sinha'', by Durganand Sinha, John W. Berry, R. C. Mishra, Rama Charan Tripathi. Published by SAGE, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7619-9535-8}}. ''Page 61''.&lt;/ref&gt; and  as 'Detached Involvement', which is neither negative attitude or indifference; and has today found many advocates in the modern business area where the emphasis has shifted to [[ethical business|ethical business practices]] adhering to intrinsic [[human values]] and reducing stress at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6FpCMSAt52sC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=%22Nishkam+Karma%22&amp;as_brr=0 Human Values and Indian Ethos] ''Human Action in Business: Praxiological and Ethical Dimensions'', by Wojciech Gasparski, Leo V.

Published by Walter de Gruyter, 1998. {{ISBN|3-11-015448-X}}. ''Page 296''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect that differentiates it from Sakam or selfish action, is that while the former is guided by inspiration, the latter is all about motivation, and that makes the central difference in its results, for example Sakam Karma might lead to excessive work pressure and workaholism as it aims at success, and hence creates more chances of physical and psychological burn outs. On the other hand Nishkam Karma, means more balanced approach to work, and as work has been turned into a pursuit of personal excellence, which results in greater personal satisfaction, which one would have otherwise sought in job satisfaction coming from external rewards. One important fallout of the entire shift is that where one is essentially an ethical practice inside-out leading to the adage, ‘Work is worship’ show itself literally at workplace, leading to greater work commitment, the other since it is so much result oriented can lead to unethical business and [[professional ethics]], as seen so often at modern work place &lt;ref&gt;''Globalisation Managing Org. Adaptation'', by Murthi. Published by Anmol Publications PVT. LTD..{{ISBN|8126104961}}. ''Mantra of Karma Yoga -Page 333-334''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the central tenet of practicing Nishkam Karma is [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|Mindfulness]] in the present moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/OPINION/Editorial/Mindfulness_with_Present_Is_Nishkama_Karma/articleshow/1564920.cms Mindfulness with Present Is Nishkama Karma] ''[[Times of India]], February 6, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this practice leads to not only [[equanimity]] of mind as it allows the practitioner to stay detached from results, and hence from ups and downs of business that are inevitable in any business arena, while maintaining constant work commitment since work as now been turned into a personal act of worship.&lt;ref name=eco&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2091131.cms How are CEOs beating the crunch factor?] Lalbhai Shah ([[Arvind Mills]]), ''[[The Economic Times]], June 1, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/19968512/the_guru_of_google/5 The Guru of Google] ''[[Rolling Stone]], April 17, 2008''.&lt;/ref&gt; Further in the long run it leads to cleansing of the heart but also spiritual growth and holistic development.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Values and Ethics: Achieving Holistic Excellence'', by SK Chakraborty, D Chakraborty.

== Nishkam Karma in Bhagavad Gita ==
Nishkam Karma, gets an important place in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', the central text of [[Mahabharata]],&lt;ref&gt;''Critical Perspectives on the Mahābhārata
By Arjunsinh K. Parmar. Published by Sarup &amp; Sons, 2002. {{ISBN|81-7625-273-5}}. ''Page 111''.&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Krishna]] advocates 'Nishkam Karma Yoga' (the Yoga of Selfless Action) as the ideal path to realize the Truth. Allocated work done without expectations, motives, or thinking about its outcomes tends to purify one's mind and gradually makes an individual fit to see the value of reason and the benefits of renouncing the work itself. These concepts are vividly described in the following verses:

* ''To action alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive; neither let there be in thee any attachment to inaction''.  &lt;br /&gt;- &lt;small&gt;Verse 47, Chapter 2-Samkhya theory and Yoga practise, The Bhagavadgita&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''verse 47, Chapter 2-Samkhya theory and Yoga practise, The Bhagavadgita - [[Radhakrishnan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Essence of Maharishi Patanjali's Ashtang Yoga'', by J.M. Mehta, Published by Pustak Mahal, 2006. {{ISBN|81-223-0921-6}}. ''Page 23''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''"Fixed in yoga, do thy work, O Winner of wealth (Arjuna), abandoning attachment, with an even mind in success and failure, for evenness of mind is called yoga"''&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;small&gt;Verse 2.48&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''verse 48, Chapter 2-Samkhya theory and Yoga practise, The Bhagavadgita - [[Radhakrishnan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''"With the body, with the mind, with the intellect, even merely with the senses, the Yogis perform action toward self-purification, having abandoned attachment. He who is disciplined in Yoga, having abandoned the fruit of action, attains steady peace..."&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;small&gt;Verse 5.11&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Peter Scott Adamson''' (born August 10, 1972) is an American academic who is professor of [[Ancient philosophy|late ancient]] and [[Arabic philosophy]] at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. He has written articles, monographs and edited books, mostly on philosophy in the Islamic world and ancient philosophy. He is the host of the weekly podcast "History of Philosophy without any gaps", which by 2014 had more than four million downloads and led to the publication of a book series. He received the [[Philip Leverhulme Prize]] in 2003, for "outstanding research achievements of young scholars of distinction and promise based in UK institutions" and received a grant from the same institution in 2010.

==Biography ==
Adamson received his bachelor's degree from [[Williams College]] with ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1994 and his Ph.D. from the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=wiu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiu.edu/news/newsrelease.php?release_id=11868|title=Adamson to Deliver Mary Olive Woods Lecture Sept. 18 at WIU|work=Western Illinois University News|publisher=Western Illinois University|date=2014-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked at [[King's College London]] from 2000, becoming professor of ancient and medieval philosophy there in 2009.&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt; In 2012 he became a professor of late ancient and Arabic philosophy at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt;

== Works ==
=== ''History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps'' ===
Adamson is the host of ''History of Philosophy without any gaps'' [[podcast]]s, which started in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historyofphilosophy.net/Thales|title=1 – Everything is Full of Gods: Thales|last=Adamson|first=Peter|work=History of Philosophy without any gaps|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is ongoing as of 2017 and examines philosophers and philosophical traditions throughout history. By 2014, the podcasts had more than four million downloads and thousands of followers.&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt; The podcasts led to the publication of a series of book adaptations.&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt;  The first installment was titled ''Classical Philosophy: A history of philosophy without any gaps'' and published in 2014.&lt;ref name=classical/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/classical-philosophy-9780199674534|title=Classical Philosophy – Overview|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume, ''Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds: A History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps'', was published in 2015 and covered the period after [[Aristotle]] up to the death of [[St. Augustine]].&lt;ref name=hellenistic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freebeacon.com/culture/mind-the-gap/|title=Mind the Gap|work=[[The Washington Free Beacon]]|last=Fleming|first=Bruce|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/philosophy-in-the-hellenistic-and-roman-worlds-9780198728023|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds – Overview|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third installment ''Philosophy in the Islamic World: History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps'' covered the philosophical traditions in the [[Islamic world]], including Muslim, Jewish and Christian philosophers.&lt;ref name=islamic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/philosophy-in-the-islamic-world-9780199577491|title=Philosophy in the Islamic World – Overview|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adamson said that the goal of the series was to tell the history of philosophy in "an entertaining but not overly-simplified way".&lt;ref name=classical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/philosophy/does-the-history-of-philosophy-matter|title=Does the history of philosophy matter?|work=[[Prospect Magazine]]|first=Malcolm Thorndike|last=Nicholson|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times of Israel]]'' contributor [[Daniel J. Levy]] described the podcasts as "popular", "fun" and "easy to listen to".&lt;ref name=islamic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/book-review-philosophy-in-the-islamic-world-a-history-of-philosophy-without-any-gaps-volume-3/|title=Book review: Philosophy in the Islamic World: A history of philosophy without any gaps, Volume 3|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|first=Daniel J.|last=Levy|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy also reviewed the third book ''Philosophy in the Islamic World'', and praised it for its presentation and wide coverage.&lt;ref name=islamic/&gt; [[Bruce Fleming (author)|Bruce Fleming]], reviewing ''Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds'' for ''[[The Washington Free Beacon]]'', praised the book for being "full of clear summaries" of the subjects as well as for using "groan-inducing puns" and "cute allusions to our day".&lt;ref name=hellenistic/&gt; Malcolm Thorndike Nicholson of ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'', reviewing the first book ''Classical Philosophy'' criticised the puns as "a problem", and in general criticised the book for its "painful prose" and for having chapters that are "less comprehensive and less interesting" than the corresponding [[Wikipedia]] article.&lt;ref name=classical/&gt;

=== Others ===
Other than the ''History of Philosophy'' series, Adamson wrote ''The Arabic Plotinus: a Philosophical Study of the 'Theology of Aristotle''', focusing on the so-called ''[[Theology of Aristotle]]'' in 2002 and ''Great Medieval Thinkers: al-Kindi'' on the Islamic philosopher [[Al-Kindi]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt; As of 2014, he has published at least 40 articles and edited or co-edited at least nine books, mostly on philosophy in the [[Islamic world]] and on [[ancient philosophy]].&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt; He and [[Richard C. Taylor]] co-edited the ''Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy''.&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt;

He has also appeared on [[BBC Radio]], including several [[List of In Our Time programmes|''In Our Time'' programmes]], and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], to discuss his areas of work in history of philosophy.&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt;

== Awards ==
Adamson received the [[Philip Leverhulme Prize]] in 2003, for "outstanding research achievements of young scholars of distinction and promise based in UK institutions".&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt;&lt;ref name=leverhulme03&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/sites/default/files/imported_pdfs/2003.pdf|title=Awards Made in 2003|publisher=Leverhulme Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he received a nearly [[Pound sterling|£]]250,000 grant from the same institution.&lt;ref name=wiu/&gt;&lt;ref name=leverhulme10&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Awards_made/2010.pdf|title=Awards Made in 2010|publisher=Leverhulme Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">'''Philonides''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Φιλωνίδης}}, c. 200 &amp;ndash; c. 130 BCE) of [[Laodicea in Syria]], was an [[Epicurean]] philosopher and [[mathematician]] who lived in the [[Seleucid]] court during the reigns of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and [[Demetrius I Soter]].

He is known principally from a ''Life of Philonides'' which was discovered among the charred [[Papyri from Herculaneum|papyrus]] scrolls at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Philonidi'', PHerc. 1044&lt;/ref&gt; Philonides was born into a family with good connections with the Seleucid court.&lt;ref name="gera"&gt;Dov Gera, (1998), ''Judaea and Mediterranean Politics, 219 to 161 B.C.E.'', page 274. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have been taught by Eudemus and [[Dionysodorus]] the mathematician.&lt;ref name="mueller"&gt;Ian Mueller, ''Geometry and scepticism'', in Jonathan Barnes, (2005), ''Science and Speculation: Studies in Hellenistic Theory and Practice'', page 94. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Philonides attempted to convert Antiochus IV Epiphanes to [[Epicureanism]], and later instructed his nephew, Demetrius I Soter, in philosophy.&lt;ref name="gera"/&gt; Philonides was highly honoured in the court, and he is also known from various stone inscriptions.&lt;ref name="dewitt"&gt;Dewitt, (1999), ''Epicurus and His Philosophy'', pages 119&amp;ndash;120. U of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt;

He was renowned as a mathematician, and is mentioned by [[Apollonius of Perga]] in the preface to the second book of his ''Conics''.&lt;ref name="mueller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius, I 192.7&amp;ndash;11&lt;/ref&gt;

Philonides was a zealous collector of the works of [[Epicurus]] and his colleagues, and is said to have published over 100 treatises, probably compilations of the works he collected.&lt;ref name="snyder"&gt;H.

'''Political egalitarianism''' is where members of a society are of equal standing in terms of political power or influence.&lt;ref&gt; https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/ &lt;/ref&gt; It is a founding principle of various forms of [[democracy]]. It was an idea which was supported by Thomas Jefferson.

It is a concept similar to [[moral reciprocity]] and [[legal equality]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5297">'''Radical empiricism''' is a philosophical doctrine put forth by [[William James]]. It asserts that experience includes both particulars and relations between those particulars, and that therefore both deserve a place in our explanations. In concrete terms: any philosophical worldview is flawed if it stops at the physical level and fails to explain how meaning, values and intentionality can arise from that.&lt;ref&gt;William James, ''[[Essays in Radical Empiricism]]'', 1912, Essay II § 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radical empiricism ==
Radical empiricism is a postulate, a statement of fact and a conclusion, says James in ''The Meaning of Truth''. The postulate is that "the only things that shall be debatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from experience". The fact is that our experience contains disconnected entities as well as various types of connections, it is full of meaning and values. The conclusion is that our worldview does not need "extraneous [[Transcendence (philosophy)|trans-empirical]] connective support, but possesses in its own right a concatenated or continuous structure."

=== Postulate ===
The postulate is a basic statement of the [[empiricism|empiricist]] method: our theories shouldn't incorporate supernatural or transempirical entities. Empiricism is a theory of knowledge that emphasizes the role of experience, especially sensory perception, in the formation of ideas, while discounting ''a priori'' reasoning, intuition, or revelation. James allows that transempirical entities may exist, but that it's not fruitful to talk about them.

=== Fact ===
James' factual statement is that our experience isn't just a stream of data, but a [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|complex process]] that's full of meaning. We see objects in terms of what they mean to us and we see causal connections between phenomena. Experience is "double-barreled": it has both a content ("[[sense data]]") and a reference, and empiricists unjustly try to reduce experience to bare sensations, according to James. Such a "thick" description of conscious experience was already part of William James' monumental work ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' in 1890, more than a decade before he first wrote about radical empiricism.

It differs notably from the traditional empiricist view of [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]], who see experience in terms of atoms like patches of color and soundwaves, which are in themselves meaningless and need to be interpreted by [[ratiocination]] before we can act upon them.

=== Conclusion ===
James concludes that experience is full of connections and that these connections are part of what is actually experienced:
{{quotation|Just so, I maintain, does a given undivided portion of experience, taken in one context of associates, play the part of a knower, of a state of mind, of 'consciousness'; while in a different context the same undivided bit of experience plays the part of a thing known, of an objective 'content.' In a word, in one group it figures as a thought, in another group as a thing. And, since it can figure in both groups simultaneously we have every right to speak of it as subjective and objective, both at once. (James 1912, Essay I)}}

== Context and importance ==
James put forth the doctrine because he thought ordinary [[empiricism]], inspired by the advances in physical science, has or had the tendency to emphasize 'whirling particles' at the expense of the bigger picture: connections, causality, meaning. Both elements, James claims, are equally present in experience and both need to be accounted for.

The observation that our adherence to science seems to put us in a quandary is not exclusive to James. For example, [[Bertrand Russell]] notes the paradox in his ''Analysis of Matter'' (1927): we appeal to ordinary perception to arrive at our physical theories, yet those same theories seem to undermine that everyday perception, which is rich in meaning.

Radical empiricism relates to discussions about [[direct realism|direct]] versus [[realism (philosophy)|indirect realism]] as well as to early twentieth-century discussions against the [[idealism]] of influential philosophers like [[Josiah Royce]]. This is how neo-realists like [[William Pepperell Montague]] and [[Ralph Barton Perry]] interpreted James.

The conclusion that our worldview does not need transempirical support is also important in discussions about the adequacy of [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] descriptions of meaning and intentionality, which James attempts to provide, in contrast to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approaches or some forms of [[reductionism]] that claim that meaning is an illusion.

* [[John Dewey]], who in his ''Experience and Nature'', attacks the same dichotomies that bothered James: objectivity/subjectivity, mind/body and so on. His position is more or less the same as that of James, although he does not himself use the term 'radical empiricism' but rather 'immediate empiricism'

'''''Rethinking Islam: Common Questions, Uncommon Answers''''' is a book on [[Islamic philosophy]] by Dr. [[Mohammed Arkoun]], published in 1994. Arkoun's book has been cited in a number of scholarly sources for providing a contemporary understanding of the development of Islamic philosophy and its effects in the Muslim world.

''Rethinking Islam'' discusses a range of topics including the various ways in which Islamic ideas have been interpreted over time and the perspective of developments in Islamic countries from their own point of view. A ''[[New York Times]]'' review called the book "an illustration of the contemporary fecundity of Islam" and called Arkoun "the leading French-language spokesman calling for a rethinking of Islam in a modern mode."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resetdoc.org/story/00000000232 "Mohammed Arkoun and the modernization of Islam."] ''Dialogues on Civilization.'' Thursday, 23 November, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
===Thought and meaning===
In his work, Arkoun writes on the subject of thought and meaning. He declared there are three categories of thought. He labels these categories as 'thinkable', 'unthinkable' and 'unthought'.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Riaz. "Globalisation's challenge to the Islamic Ummah." ''Asian Journal of Social Science'' 34, no. 2 (2006): 311-323.&lt;/ref&gt; Arkoun taught that meaning is generated by semantic creativity, the inventiveness of a subject especially while under the pressure of new and unfamiliar existential demands that necessitate destroying, transforming, or surpassing previous meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Victoria S. "Hermeneutics, religious language and the Qur'an." ''Islam and Christian–Muslim Relations'' 21, no. 3 (2010): 207-220.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights in Islamic society===
Arkoun was of the view that Islamic thought had always included a discourse on the rights of God (either public or collective rights) and the rights of man (essentially individual rights), with the former having priority over the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Suhaila, Nik Salida, Nik Saleh, Wan Abdul Fattah, and Wan Ismail. "Feminist Critiques on the Theory of Rights in the Jurisdiction: Towards Gender Equality."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic philosophical and political development===
In ''Rethinking Islam'', Arkoun argues for a concise understanding Islamic development in modern times and attempts to deconstruct the popular western misrepresentations. He argues: "Islamic culture, in fact, is not reducible to the stereotypes articulated by the Christian religion and European cultures ever since the thirteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, Chouki El. "Muslim diaspora in Western Europe: The Islamic headscarf (hijab), the media and Muslims' integration in France." ''Citizenship Studies'' 6, no. 3 (2002): 293-308.&lt;/ref&gt; Arkoun argues that "Mediterranean thinking" is always multiple and open, always engaged in exchange, negotiation, and dialogue between "influences and residues".&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Miriam. "MEDITERRANEAN THINKING: FROM NETIZEN TO MEDIZEN*." Geographical Review 89, no. 2 (1999): 290-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arkoun, public discussion of secular aspects embedded within a religious understanding of the universal concept of human rights was not the prime factor bringing Islamic countries in recent years to a "compromise position".&lt;ref&gt;Mohammadi, Ali. "The culture and politics of human rights in the context of Islam." ''Islam Encountering Globalisation'' (2012): 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Arkoun suggested that scholars studying the intellectual development of Islam today need to see beyond the imposed restrictions in many Middle Eastern countries on various kinds of knowledge in journalism, political studies and deviant Islamist ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Spoelders, Benedicte. "Rethinking development and the feminist versus Islamist dichotomy." ''Islam and Christian‐Muslim Relations'' 9, no. 3 (1998): 295-305.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation of Islamic texts===
Arkoun admits that many fundamental changes occur in the constant interpretation of Islamic texts. He states that it is especially true of the Qur'an, which "has been ripped from its historical, linguistic, literary, and psychological contexts and then been continually recontextualized in various cultures and according to the ideological needs of various actors."&lt;ref&gt;Munir, Lily Zakiyah. "Islam and gender: reading equality and patriarchy." ''Islam in Southeast Asia: Political, Social and Strategic Challenges for the 21st Century'' 11 (2005): 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamentalist and politically inspired Islamic movements tend to reaffirm in their own theological discourse by casting their ideology in an orientalist imaging of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Gülalp, Haldun. "Using Islam as Political Ideology Turkey in Historical Perspective." ''Cultural Dynamics'' 14, no. 1 (2002): 21-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert von Zimmermann''' or '''Robert Zimmermann''' (November 2, 1824, [[Prague]] – September 1, 1898, [[Prague]]) was a [[Czech people|Czech]]-born [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]].

The mathematician and philosopher, [[Bernard Bolzano]], entrusted his unfinished work, ''Grössenlehre'' ("Theory of Quantity", a philosophical foundation for mathematics), which had not been completed at the time of his death in 1848, to von Zimmermann who was 24 years old. Zimmermann had been a student of Bolzano's. Since Zimmermann's interests were more in the area of philosophy as he had been appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] in 1852, he didn't do much with Bolzano's papers. Most of the remaining manuscripts stayed in Zimmermann's possession until 1882 when he gave them to the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] (Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien).&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J.J.; Robertson E.F., [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Bolzano_manuscripts.html "Bernard Bolzano's manuscripts"], University of St. Andrews, The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert von Zimmermann taught at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1861.&lt;ref&gt;von Schlosser, Julius, [http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_139136_en.pdf "The Vienna school of the history of art"]. Cf. pp.27, 29. (translated into English and edited by Karl Johns from ‘Die Wiener Schule der Kunstgeschichte‘, Mitteilungen des österreichischen Institut für Geschichtsforschung Ergänzungs-Band 13, Heft 2, Innsbruck: Wagner 1934)&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his doctoral students was [[Kazimierz Twardowski]].

[[File:Repin Nichilista.JPG|thumb|150px|A nihilist student, by [[Ilya Repin]]]]
The '''Nihilist movement''' was a [[Russia]]n movement in the 1860s which rejected all authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=anarchism&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary] s.v. "nihilism"&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:nihil|nihil]]'', meaning "nothing".  After the assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1881, the Nihilists were known throughout Europe as proponents of the use of violence in order to bring about [[political change]].

== History ==
=== The two nihilist revolutions === 
Russian [[nihilism]] (rus. "нигилизм") can be divided into two periods. The foundational period (1860-1869) where the '[[counterculture|counter-cultural]]' aspects of nihilism scandalized Russia, and even the smallest of indiscretions resulted in nihilists being sent to [[Siberia]] or imprisoned for lengthy periods of time, and where the philosophy of nihilism was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=J.M.|title="Nihilism." In The midnight sun, the tsar and the nihilist adventures and observations in Norway, Sweden and Russia|date=2008|publisher=Kessinger|location=Whitefish, MT|asin=B008I9E4MA|pages=335–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There followed the revolutionary period of Nihilism (1870-1881) when [[Sergei Nechayev]]'s pamphlet [[Revolutionary Catechism|''The Catechism of a Revolutionist'']] transformed the movement, which was waiting and only striking mild propaganda, into a movement-with-teeth and a will to wage war against the tsarist regime, with dozens of actions against the Russian state. The revolutionary period ends with the assassination of the [[Tsar Alexander II]] (March 13, 1881), and the consequential crushing of the nihilist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hingley|first=Ronald|title=Nihilists; Russian radicals and revolutionaries in the reign of Alexander II, 1855-81|date=1969|publisher=Delacorte Press|location=New York, NY|pages=87–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mikhail Bakunin's influence === 
[[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s (1814-1876) "Reaction in Germany" (1842) included a famous dictum, "Let us therefore trust the eternal Spirit which destroys and annihilates only because it is the unfathomable and eternal source of all life. The passion for destruction is a creative passion, too!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|title=Reaction in Germany|date=1842}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This piece of literature anticipated and instigated the ideas of the nihilists. In Russia, Bakunin was considered a Westernizer because of his influences that spread the ideology of [[anarchism]] outside of his nation to the rest of Europe and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLaughlin|first=Paul|title=Mikhail Bakunin: The Philosophical Basis of His Theory of Anarchism|date=2002|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-892941-41-4|pages=55–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While he is inexorably linked to both the foundational and revolutionary periods of nihilism, Bakunin was a product of the earlier generation whose vision, ultimately, was not the same as the nihilist view. He stated this best as "I am a free man only so far as I recognize the humanity and liberty of all men around me. In respecting their humanity, I respect my own." This general [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] instinct is in contrast to the nihilist proclamations of having a "hate with a great and holy hatred" or calling for the "annihilation of aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|title=God and the State|date=1876|publisher=Cosimo Classics|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-60520-361-0|pages=13–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
=== Chernyshevsky and nihilist socialism === 
[[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]] was the first to incorporate nihilism in the socialist agenda.  The nihilist contribution to socialism in general was the concept that the peasant was an agent of social change (Chernyshevsky, A Criticism of Philosophical Prejudices Against the Obshchina (1858)),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buel|first=James|title="Chapter IV." In Russian Nihilism and Exile Life in Siberia: A Graphic and Chronological History of Russia's Bloody Nemesis, and a Description of Exile Life in All Its True but Horrifying Phases, being the Results of a Tour through Russia and Siberia Made by the Author|date=1883|publisher=Ulan Press|location=New York, NY|pages=77–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and not just the bourgeois reformers of the revolutions of 1848, or the proletariat of Marx (a concept that wouldn't reach Russia until later). Agitation for this position landed Chernyshevsky in prison and exile in Siberia for the next 25 years (although the specific accusations with which he was convicted were a concoction) in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buel|first=James|title="Chapter IV." In Russian Nihilism and Exile Life in Siberia: A Graphic and Chronological History of Russia's Bloody Nemesis, and a Description of Exile Life in All Its True but Horrifying Phases, being the Results of a Tour through Russia and Siberia Made by the Author|date=1883|publisher=Ulan Press|location=New York, NY|pages=77–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first group inspired by nihilist ideas to form and work towards social change did so as a secret society, and were called [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]]. This group's name was also taken by another, entirely separate group, during the Revolutionary Nihilist period, with the first Land and Freedom conspiring to support the Polish independence movement and to agitate the peasants who were burdened with debt as a result of the crippling redemption payments required by the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. Polish independence was not of particular interest to the nihilists, and after a plot to incite Kazan peasants to revolt failed, Land and Liberty folded (1863).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edie|first=James M.|title=Russian Philosophy| volume= II: the Nihilists, The Populists, Critics of Religion and Culture|date=1994|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=TN|pages=36–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hidden nihilist groups ===
[[File:Russian Nihilists are being tied to chairs on horse-drawn pl Wellcome V0041837.jpg|thumb|Russian Nihilists are being tied to chairs on horse-drawn platforms and paraded past groups of soldiers on their way to their execution in St. Petersburg ([[wood engraving]])]]

After the failure, the Russian government began to actively hunt nihilist revolutionaries, so the first secret nihilist societies were created. One of the first to act in secrecy was called The Organization, and they created a boys' school in a Moscow slum in order to train revolutionaries. In addition they had a secret sub-group called Hell whose purpose was political terrorism, with the assassination of the Tsar as their ultimate goal. This resulted in the failed attempt by [[Dmitry Karakozov]] on the 4th of April 1866. Dmitry was tried and hanged at Smolensk Field in [[St Petersburg]]. The leader of The Organization, Nicholas Ishutin, was also tried and was to be executed before being exiled to Siberia for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edie|first=James M.|title=Russian Philosophy|volume= II: the Nihilists, The Populists, Critics of Religion and Culture|date=1994|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=TN|pages=36–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus ended The Organization.

=== The White Terror === 
The White Terror began by the Tsar putting Count [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov|Mikhail Muravyov]] (1845-1900) (otherwise known as 'Hanger Muravyov' due to his treatment of Polish rebels in prior years) in charge of the suppression of the nihilists. The two leading radical journals (''The Contemporary'' and ''Russian Word'') were banned, liberal reforms were minimized in fear of reaction from the public, and the educational system was reformed to stifle the existing revolutionary spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter H.|title="Anarchism in Practice: Russia and the Ukraine." In Demanding the impossible a history of anarchism: be realistic! Demand the impossible!|date=2010|publisher=PM Press|location=Oakland, CA|isbn=1-60486-064-2|pages=469–479}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This action by the Russian state marks the end of the foundational period of nihilism.

=== Nechayev's nihilist revolution === 
The entrance on the scene of [[Sergey Nechayev]] symbolizes the transformation from the foundational period to the revolutionary period. Nechayev, the son of a serf, which was unusual as most nihilists came from a slightly higher social class, what we would call lower middle class, desired an escalation of the discourse on social transformation. Nechayev argued that just as the European monarchies used the ideas of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], and the Catholic Jesuits practiced absolute immorality to achieve their ends, there was no action that could not be also used for the sake of the people's revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nechayev|first=Sergey|title=The Revolutionary Catechism|date=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A scholar noted that "His apparent immorality [more an amorality] derived from the cold realization that both Church and State are ruthlessly immoral in their pursuit of total control. The struggle against such powers must therefore be carried out by any means necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=John|title=The Anti-Communist Manifestos: Four Books That Shaped the Cold War|date=2010|publisher=Norton and Company|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-393-07476-5|pages=321–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nechayev's social cache was greatly increased by his association with Bakunin in 1869 and extraction of funds from the Bakhmetiev Fund for Russian revolutionary propaganda.

The image of Nechayev is as much a result of his ''Catechism of a Revolutionist'' (1869) as any actions he actually took. The Catechism is an important document as it establishes the clear break between the formation of nihilism as a political philosophy and what it becomes as a practice of revolutionary action. It documents the revolutionary as a much transformed figure from the nihilist of the past decade. Whereas the nihilist may have practiced asceticism, they argued for an uninhibited hedonism. Nechayev assessed that the Revolutionary, by definition, must live devoted to one aim and not allow themselves to be distracted by emotions or attachments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nechayev|first=Sergei|title=The Revolutionary Catechism|date=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Friendship was contingent on revolutionary fervor, relationships with strangers were quantified in terms of what resources they offered revolution, and everyone had a role during the revolutionary moment that boiled down to how soon they would be lined up against the wall or when they would accept that they had to do the shooting. The uncompromising tone and content of the Catechism was influential far beyond the mere character Nechayev personified in the minds of the revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sijak|first=Ana|title=Angel of Vengeance: The Girl Who Shot the Governor of St. Petersburg and Sparked the Age of Assassination|date=2009|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=United Kingdom|asin=B005E8AJVI|pages=21–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the reason for this is the way in which it extended nihilist principles into a revolutionary program. The rest of the reason was that the catechism gave the revolutionary project a form of constitution and weight that the "men of the sixties" did not.

=== End of Nechayev and the first nihilist revolution === 
Bakunin, an admirer of Nechayev's zeal and stories of his organization's success, provided contacts and resources to send Nechayev back to Russia as his representative of the Russian Section of the World Revolutionary Alliance, which was also an imaginary organization.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Upon his return to Russia, Nechayev formed the secret, cell based organization, People's Vengeance.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} One student member of the organization Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} questioned the very existence of the Secret Revolutionary Committee that Nechayev claimed to be the representative of.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} This suspicion of Nechayev's modus operandi required action. Author [[Ronald Hingley]], wrote "On the evening of 21 November 1869 the victim [Ivanov] was accordingly lured to the premises of the Moscow School of Agriculture, a hotbed of revolutionary sentiment, where Nechayev killed him by shooting and strangulation, assisted without great enthusiasm by three dupes… Nechayev's accomplices were arrested and tried."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hingley|first=Ronald|title=Nihilists; Russian radicals and revolutionaries in the reign of Alexander II, 1855-81|date=1969|publisher=Delacorte Press|location=New York, NY|pages=87–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon his return from Russia to Switzerland, Nechayev was rejected by Bakunin, for his taking of militant actions, and was eventually extradited back to Russia where he spent the remainder of his life at the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|title=Bakunin on Violence: Letter to S. Nechayev|date=1870|publisher=New York: Anarchist Papers|location=New York, NY|pages=2–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He did, due to his charisma and force of will, continue to influence events, maintaining a relationship to People's Will and weaving even his jailers into his plots.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} He was found dead in his cell in 1882.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Main ideas and conceptions==
Researches of Prof. Salahaddin Khalilov elucidate the stages of the process of application of new scientific knowledge to production with logical-gnoseological way; they also determine the special place and specificities of scientific-technical knowledge in the classification of sciences, and draw comparative analysis of the notions of  “applied sciences”, “technical sciences”, “scientific-technical knowledge”, “technological knowledge”. The comparative researches of science and economy, science and technology, science and language, science and religion, science and education, science and literature etc., are useful to appraise the role of science in the modern social life from different aspects. Some of his investigations are dealing with determination of the peculiarities of Eastern and Islamic way of thought.
Prof. Khalilov discusses ideas which are presented in the West as intuition, irrational comprehension and mysticism in the context of Tasavvuf philosophy. His researches compare several Islamic philosophers with Western philosophers,  such as comparison between Avicenna and Descartes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Halilov | first1 = Selahaddin | title = Doğu ́dan Batı ́ya Felsefe Körpüsü publisher | publisher = “Ötüken” | year = 2008 | location = İstanbul | pages = 152–159 | isbn = 978-975-437-693-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suhravardi and Kant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Xəlilov | first1 = Səlahəddin | title = Felsefe: tarix ve muasirlik (felsefi komparativistika) | publisher =  "Azərbaycan Universiteti" nəşriyyatı | year = 2006 | location = Bakı | pages = 227–237 | isbn = 978-9952-8050-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun and Karl Marx and also give an  explanation of similarities between Sufizm and Phenomenology.
In his opinion the problem of determining the boundary between conscious and unconscious is in some sense equivalent to the problem of isolating the rational soul in the structure of internal life. From what does consciousness originate? The core condition for consciousness is the obviousness of an object. This is achieved by the concretion of a certain idea in the confines of the body. (For every object, reality is the synthesis of an infinite number of ideas.) Intentionality, phenomenological reduction, is the isolation of a single idea in pure form. Alongside Brentano’s and Husserl’s notably efficient idea about the intentionality of consciousness, other ideas and constructions of Husserl directed at the creation of an all-embracing theory seem to be argumentative and are sometimes also artificially constructed. For instance, there is the problem of the corporeal activity of man, the idea of kinetic consciousness, etc. where the functions of the body are seen as if detached from the functioning of the sensory organs.
In his papers he discusses some peculiarities – simililarities and differences – of memory and remembrance (personal life memory). The mechanisms of storing knowledge and recollection have been analysed. It was shown that earlier used spirit-body or soul-body methods could not adequately explain the correlation between memory and remembrance . For consideration specific details of the correlation of memory and remembrance more realistic model of “spirit-soul-body” or “mind-soul-body” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = | first1 = | title = Analecta Husserliana. vol. CI. // Memory in the Ontopoiesis of Life ; Edited by Prof. '''[[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]]''' | publisher = “Springer” | year = 2009 | location = Dordrecht | pages = 243–250 | isbn = 978-90-481-2317-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed.
Some of Western ideologists have considered that Eastern Islamic countries, including Azerbaijan, stay behind Western countries in the economical competition based on modern technology,  for the reasons of Islam and traditional thought. However, sciences which are bases of economical development do not depend on the religions of scientists. S. Khalilov explains that it could be a problem of relations of religion and science but not of religions of scientists. When we define the main attributes of the East and West, it becomes clear that all religions, including the Christianity are Eastern phenomena, regardless of their geographical location. So, it would be wrong if we relate Western civilization to the Christianity.
According to the view of Prof. Khalilov, the modern civilization had been formulated by joint efforts of both the East and the West, in different stages of history.

'''Sandra G. Harding''' (born 1935) is an [[United States|American]] philosopher of [[Feminist philosophy|feminist]] and [[post-colonialism|postcolonial theory]], [[epistemology]], research methodology, and [[philosophy of science]]. She taught for two decades at the [[University of Delaware]] before moving to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1996.  She directed the [[UCLA Center for the Study of Women]] from 1996 to 2000, and co-edited ''[[Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]]'' from 2000 to 2005.  She is currently a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Education&lt;ref name="Sandra Harding's GSEIS Profile" /&gt; and Gender Studies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genderstudies.ucla.edu/people/faculty&lt;/ref&gt; at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and a Distinguished Affiliate Professor of Philosophy at [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophy.msu.edu/people/faculty/sandraharding/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 she was awarded the [[John Desmond Bernal Prize]] by the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science|Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S)]]. (Earlier recipients of this prize include [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]], [[Thomas Kuhn|Thomas S. Kuhn]], [[Mary Douglas]], and [[Joseph Needham]].)

She has developed the research standard of “[[strong objectivity]],” and contributed to the articulation of [[standpoint theory|standpoint methodology]]. This kind of research process starts off from questions that arise in the daily lives of people in oppressed groups.  To answer such questions, it “studies up”, examining the principles, practices and cultures of dominant institutions, from the design and management of which oppressed groups have been excluded. She has also contributed to the development of feminist, anti-racist, multicultural, and postcolonial studies of the natural and social sciences, asking the extent to which paradigms like [[feminist empiricism]] are useful for promoting to goals of feminist inquiry.  She is the author or editor of many books and essays on these topics, and was one of the founders of the fields of [[feminist epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]]. This work has been influential in the [[social science]]s and in [[women's studies|women]]/[[gender studies]] across the disciplines. It has helped to create new kinds of discussions about how best to relink scientific research to pro-democratic goals.

She has been a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[University of Costa Rica]], the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain/federal-institutes-technology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217033708/http://www.ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain/federal-institutes-technology |archivedate=2013-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Asian Institute of Technology]].  She has been a consult to several [[United Nations]] organizations including the [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[UNESCO]], the U.N. Commission on Science and Technology for Development,&lt;ref&gt;http://unctad.org/en/Pages/cstd.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women|U.N. Development Fund for Women]]. [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] selected her as a national lecturer in 2007.  She has lectured at over 300 colleges, universities, and conferences, on five continents.&lt;ref name="Sandra Harding's GSEIS Profile" /&gt;

During what is known now as the "[[Science Wars]]", she was part of a debate regarding the value-neutrality of the sciences. This aspect of her work has been criticized by the mathematicians Michael Sullivan,&lt;ref name="sullivan_1996"&gt;Sullivan, M.C. (1996) A Mathematician Reads ''Social Text'', [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society|AMS Notices]] '''43'''(10), 1127-1131.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary W. Gray|Mary Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Gray, "Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lenore Blum]],&lt;ref&gt;Lenore Blum, "AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives," in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M. Leggett, eds., ''Complexities: Women in Mathematics'', Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the historian of science [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "A historian looks at gender and science," ''International Journal of Science Education'', vol. 9 (1987), p. 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding referred to [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia Mathematica'']] as a "rape manual" in her 1986 book "The Science Question in Feminism", a characterization that she later said she regretted.&lt;ref name="nemecek_1997"&gt;Nemecek, S. (1997) The Furor Over Feminist Science, [[Scientific American]] '''276'''(1), 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stjepan "Stijepo" Gradić''' or '''Stefano Gradi''' (Latin: Stephanus Gradius; March 6, 1613 – May 2, 1683) was a [[philosopher]], [[scientist]] and a [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] of the [[Republic of Ragusa]].

Stijepo's parents were Miho Gradi (Gradić) and Marija Benessa (Beneša). He was born in [[Dubrovnik]], Republic of Ragusa, where he was first schooled. He moved to [[Rome]] by the order of his uncle, a vicar general of Dubrovnik, Petar Benessa. In [[Rome]] and in [[Bologna]] he studied [[philosophy]], [[theology]], [[law]] and [[mathematics]]. His mathematics professor in Rome was [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]] and in [[Bologna]] his mathematics professor was [[Benedetto Castelli]]. He became a priest in 1643, the year he returned home and soon became abbot of the Benedictine abbey of St. Cosmas and Damian on the island of [[Pašman]], canon of cathedral choir in Dubrovnik and Dubrovnik deputy Archbishop. After a private trip to [[Rome]] he remained there until his death as the official diplomatic representative of the Dubrovnik Republic to the Holy See. Since 1682 he was the head of the [[Vatican Library]].&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;
[[Image:stefano gradi.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Stjepan Gradić]]
Gradić was a [[polymath]]. He cooperated with the historian [[Joannes Lucius]] in defending the honor and reputation of their native country of unjust attacks of some Italian and French writers, translated classical authors, wrote a biography of the Dubrovnik writer [[Junije Palmotić]] and a poem about the [[earthquake]] in Dubrovnik. In the literary and scientific circle of [[pope Alexander VII]] and Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] Gradić discussed scientific and philosophical issues.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

His philosophical works are written in the spirit of [[Aristotle|Aristotelianism]] and [[scholasticism]]. Gradić was a member of the Royal Academy in [[Padua]], having correspondence with many notable Europeans. He described the disastrous earthquake in Dubrovnik in 1667 in [[Latin language|Latin]] verses and organized help from all over [[Europe]] for the devastated city.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

Along with [[philosophy]], he engaged in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[literature]] and [[diplomacy]]. In [[mathematics]], he dealt with [[Galileo's paradox]]. This work went unnoticed and was even unknown to [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]] who was a professor of mathematics at the Collegium Romanum where a century before Gradić had been an alumnus. In his only printed mathematical treatise ''De loco Galilaei quo punctum lineae aequale pronuntiat'' published in the collection ''Dissertationes physico-mathematicae quatuor'' he disputed the concept of indivisible and developed a series of ideas en route to infinitesimal method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | author=Stephanus Gradius | title=De loco Galilaei quo punctum lineae aequale pronuntiat, Dissertationes physico-mathematicae quatuor (written in 1661) | journal=Amstelodami: Apud Danielem Elsevirium | year=1680 | pages=39-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | author=I.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Structural anthropology''' is a school of [[anthropology]] based on [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' idea that immutable deep structures exist in all [[culture]]s, and consequently, that all cultural practices have [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] counterparts in other cultures, essentially that all cultures are equitable.

Lévi-Strauss' approach arose in large part from [[dialectics]] expounded on by [[Marx]] and [[Hegel]], though dialectics (as a concept) dates back to [[Ancient Greek philosophy]]. Hegel explains that every situation presents two opposing things and their resolution; [[Fichte]] had termed these "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]." Lévi-Strauss argued that cultures also have this structure. He showed, for example, how opposing ideas would fight and were resolved to establish the rules of [[marriage]], [[mythology]] and [[ritual]]. This approach, he felt, made for fresh new ideas. He stated:

{{quote|[[people]] think about the world in terms of binary opposites—such as high and low, inside and outside, [[person]] and [[animal]], [[life]] and [[death]]—and that every [[culture]] can be understood in terms of these opposites. "From the very start," he wrote, "the process of visual perception makes use of binary oppositions.{{sfn|Lévi-Strauss|1972}}}}

Only those who practice structural analysis are aware of what they are actually trying to do: that is, to reunite perspectives that the "narrow" scientific outlook of recent centuries believed to be mutually exclusive: sensibility and intellect, quality and quantity, the concrete and the geometrical, or as we say today, the [[emic and etic|"etic" and the "emic."]]{{sfn|Lévi-Strauss|1972}}

In [[South America]] he showed that there are "dual organizations" throughout [[Amazon rainforest]] cultures, and that these "dual organizations" represent opposites and their synthesis. As an illustration, [[Gê peoples|Gê tribes]] of the Amazon were found to divide their villages into two rival halves; however, members from each half married each other, resolving the opposition

Culture, he claimed, has to take into account both life and death and needs to have a way of mediating between the two. Mythology (see his several-volume ''Mythologies'') unites opposites in diverse ways.

Three of the most prominent structural anthropologists are Lévi-Strauss himself and the British neo-structuralists [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]]. The latter was the author of such essays as "Time and False Noses" (in ''Rethinking Anthropology'').{{sfn|Leach|1966}}

== Influences ==
{{Further | Alliance theory}}

Lévi-Strauss took many ideas from [[structural linguistics]], including those of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]]. Saussure argued that linguists needed to move beyond the recording of ''parole'' (individual [[speech act]]s) and come to an understanding of [[langue and parole|''langue'']], the [[grammar]] of each language.

Lévi-Strauss applied this distinction in his search for mental structures that underlie all acts of human behavior: Just as speakers can talk without awareness of grammar, he argued, humans are unaware of the workings of [[social structure]]s in daily life. The structures that form the "deep grammar" of society originate in the [[mind]] and operate [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]ly (albeit not in a [[Freud]]ian sense).

Another concept was borrowed from the [[Prague school]] of [[linguistics]], which employed so-called binary oppositions in their research. [[Roman Jakobson]] and others analysed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features, such as "voiceless" vs. "voiced". Lévi-Strauss included this in his conceptualization of the mind's universal structures. For him, opposites formed the basis of social structure and culture.

== Kinship ==

In his early work Lévi-Strauss argued that tribal [[kinship]] [[Group (sociology)|groups]] were usually found in pairs, or in paired groups that oppose each other yet need one another. For example, in the Amazon basin, two extended families would build their houses in two facing semicircles that together form a big circle. He showed too that the ways people initially categorized animals, [[tree]]s, and other natural features, were based on a series of oppositions.

In his most popular work, ''[[The Raw and the Cooked]]'', he described [[Folklore|folk tale]]s of tribal South America as related to one another through a series of transformations&amp;mdash;as one opposite in tales ''here'' changed into its opposite in tales ''there.'' For example, as the title implies, [[wikt:raw|raw]] becomes its opposite [[cooking|cook]]ed. These particular opposites (raw/cooked) are symbolic of human culture itself, in which by means of [[thought]] and [[labour (economics)]], raw materials become [[clothes]], [[food]], [[weapon]]s, [[art]] and [[idea]]s.

While Durkheim thought that [[Biological classification|taxonomies]] of the natural world are collective in origin (the "[[collective conscious]]"), meaning that social structures influence individual cognitive structures, Lévi-Strauss proposed the opposite, arguing that it is the latter that gives rise to the former. Social structures mirror [[cognitive]] structures, meaning that patterns in social interaction can be treated as their manifestations. While structural-functionalists looked for structures within social organisation, structuralism seeks to identify links between structures of thought and social structures. Possibly the most significant influence on structuralism came from Mauss' ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]''. Mauss argued that gifts are not free, but rather oblige the recipient to reciprocate. Through the gift, the givers give part of themselves, imbuing the gift  a certain [[Power (social and political)|power]] that compels a response. Gift exchanges, therefore play a crucial role in creating and maintaining social relationships by establishing bonds of obligations. Gifts are not merely physical, incidental objects; they possess cultural and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] properties. It is a "total prestation" as Mauss called it, as it carries the power to create a system of reciprocity in which the [[honour]] of both giver and recipient are engaged. Social [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s are therefore based on exchange; Durkheimian solidarity, according to Mauss, is best achieved through structures of reciprocity and related systems of exchange.

Lévi-Strauss took this idea and postulated three fundamental properties of the human mind: a) people follow rules; b) reciprocity is the simplest way to create social relationships; c) a gift binds both giver and recipient in a continuing social relationship{{sfn|Layton|1997|p=76}}

Structures are universal; their realization is culturally specific. Lévi-Strauss argued that exchange is the universal basis of [[kinship]] systems, the structures of which depend on the type of marriage rules that apply. Because of its strong focus on vertical social relations, Lévi-Strauss' model of kinship systems came to be called [[alliance theory]].

== Marriage ==

Lévi-Strauss' model attempted to offer a single explanation for cross-[[cousin marriage]], sister-exchange, dual organization and rules of [[exogamy]]. Over time, marriage rules create social structures because marriages are primarily forged between groups and not just between spouses. When groups exchange women on a regular basis, they marry together; consequently, each marriage creates a debtor/creditor relationship that must be balanced through the "repayment" of wives, either immediately or in the next generation.

Lévi-Strauss proposed that the initial motivation for the exchange of women was the [[incest taboo]]. He deemed this the beginning and essence of culture, as it was the first [[prohibition]] to check natural impulses; secondarily, it divides labor by gender. Prescribing exogamy creates a distinction between marriageable and tabooed women that necessitates a search for women outside one's own kin group ("marry out or die out") and fosters exchange relationships with other groups. Exogamy promotes inter-group alliances and forms structures of social networks.

Lévi-Strauss also discovered that a wide range of historically unrelated cultures had the rule that individuals should marry their cross-cousin, meaning children of siblings of the opposite sex - from a male perspective that is either the FZD (father's sister's daughter) or the MBD (mother's brother's daughter). Accordingly, he grouped all possible kinship systems into a scheme containing three basic kinship structures constructed out of two types of exchange. He called the three kinship structures elementary, semi-complex and complex.

Elementary structures are based on positive marriage rules that specify whom a person must marry, while complex systems specify negative marriage rules (whom one must not marry), thus leaving room for choice based on preference. Elementary structures can operate based on two forms of exchange: restricted (or direct) exchange, a symmetric form of exchange between two groups (also called moieties) of wife-givers and wife-takers; in an initial restricted exchange FZ marries MB, with all children then being bilateral cross-cousins (the daughter is both MBD and FZD). Continued restricted exchange means that the two lineages marry together. Restricted exchange structures are generally quite uncommon.

The second form of exchange within elementary structures is called generalised exchange, meaning that a man can only marry either his MBD ([[matrilateral]] cross-cousin marriage) or his FZD (patrilateral cross-cousin marriage). This involves an asymmetric exchange between at least three groups. Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage arrangements where the marriage of the parents is repeated by successive generations are very common in parts of Asia (e.g. amongst the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]]). Lévi-Strauss considered generalised exchange to be superior to restricted exchange because it allows the integration of indefinite numbers of groups.{{sfn|Barnard|Good|1984|p=96}} Examples of restricted exchange are found, for instance, in the [[Amazon basin]]. These tribal societies are made up of multiple moieties that often split up, rendering them comparatively unstable. Generalised exchange is more integrative but contains an implicit hierarchy, as e.g. amongst the Kachin where wife-givers are superior to wife-takers. Consequently, the last wife-taking group in the chain is significantly inferior to the first wife-giving group to which it is supposed to give its wives. These status inequalities can destabilise the entire system or can at least lead to an accumulation of wives (and in the case of the Kachin, also of [[bridewealth]]) at one end of the chain.

From a structural perspective matrilateral cross-cousin marriage is superior to its patrilateral counterpart; the latter has less potential to produce social cohesion since its exchange cycles are shorter (the direction of wife exchange is reversed in each successive generation). Lévi-Strauss' theory is supported by fact that patrilateral cross-cousin marriage is in fact the rarest of three types. However, matrilateral generalised exchange poses a risk as group A depends on receiving a woman from a group that it has not itself given a woman to, producing a less immediate obligation to reciprocate compared to a restricted exchange system. The risk created by such a delayed return is obviously lowest in restricted exchange systems.

Lévi-Strauss proposed a third structure between elementary and complex structures, called semi-complex structure or Crow-Omaha system. Semi-complex structures contain so many negative marriage rules that they effectively prescribe marriage to specific parties, thus somewhat resembling elementary structures. These structures are found, for example, among  the [[Crow Nation]] and [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] [[Native Americans in the United States]].

In Lévi-Strauss' view, the basic building block of kinship is not just the nuclear family, as in structural-functionalism, but the so-called kinship atom: the nuclear family together with the wife's brother. This "mother's brother" (from the perspective of the wife-seeking son) plays a crucial role in alliance theory, as he is the one who ultimately decides whom his daughter will marry. Moreover, it is not just the nuclear family as such, but alliances between families that matter in regard to the creation of social structures, reflecting the typical structuralist argument that the position of an element in the structure is more significant than the element itself. Descent theory and alliance theory therefore look at two sides of one coin: the former emphasising bonds of [[consanguinity]] (kinship by blood), the latter stressing bonds of affinity (kinship by law or choice).

== The Leiden school ==
{{main|The Leiden school}}
Much earlier, and some 450 miles north of Paris, a specific type of applied anthropology emerged at [[Leiden University]], [[Netherlands]] that focused frequently on the relationship between apparent cultural phenomena found in the Indonesian [[archipelago]]: [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Moluccas]], etc., though it was primarily aimed at training governors for colonial [[Indonesia]]. This type of anthropology, developed by late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century scholars, was eventually called "de Leidse Richting," or "de Leidse School,".

Multiple researchers were educated in this school. This theory attracted students and researchers interested in a holistic approach, that was broad and deep, that related economic circumstances with mythological and spatial classifications and that explored the relationship between the natural world and religious, [[symbol]]ic systems. This was long before structuralism. The "Leiden" perspective drove research for many decades, influencing successive generations of anthropologists.

The most recent chairs were held by [[J. P. B. de Josselin de Jong]] (chair: 1922–1956, 1964), who coined the concept of the Field of Ethnological Study in 1935, and later his nephew [[P. E. de Josselin de Jong]] (chair: 1956–1987, 1999).

== British neo-structuralism ==

The British brand of structuralism was mainly espoused by Rodney Needham and [[Edmund Leach]], who were both critical towards the structural-functionalist perspective and who drew on Lévi-Strauss as well as [[Arthur Maurice Hocart]]. They also found grounds for critiquing Lévi-Strauss. Leach was more concerned with researching people's actual lives than with the discovery of universal mental structures.

He found that the latter's analysis of the Kachin contained serious flaws. According to Leach, Lévi-Strauss' project had been overly ambitious, meaning that his analyses were too superficial and the available data treated with too little care. While part of his analysis of the Kachin was simply based on incorrect ethnographic information, the rest reflected Kachin ideology but not actual practice.

In theory, Kachin groups were supposed to marry in a circle ideally consisting of five groups. In reality, the system was strongly unbalanced with built-in status differences between wife-givers and wife-takers. Lévi-Strauss had incorrectly assumed that wife-takers would be of higher rank than wife-givers; in reality, it was the other way round, and the former usually had to make substantial bridewealth payments to obtain wives. Overall, some lineages would accumulate more wives and material wealth than others, meaning that the system was not driven primarily by reciprocity. The marriage system was quite messy and the chance of it breaking down increased with the number of groups involved.

In generalised exchange systems, more groups imply greater complexity to ensure that all wife-givers will eventually be on the receiving end, an issue that Lévi-Strauss had already foreseen. He thought that in practice there would be competition for women, leading to accumulation and therefore asymmetries in the system. According to Leach, in Kachin reality instabilities arose primarily from competition for bridewealth. Men sought to get the maximum profit in forms of either bridewealth or political advantage from their daughters' marriage. Lévi-Strauss had only accorded a symbolic role to marriage prestations, effectively overlooking their significance within the system. Leach argued that they are also (or even primarily) economic and political transactions and are frequently connected to transfers of rights over land, too.

Marriage exchanges need to be analysed within their wider economic and political context rather than in isolation, as Lévi-Strauss attempted. Leach charged the latter with neglecting the effects of material conditions on social relations. He also challenged the claims to universality made by Lévi-Strauss about the model, doubting whether structures generated by marriage rules would be the same in different social contexts.

== Critiques ==

=== Postmodernistic ===

By the late 1970s/early 1980s, alliance theory had lost influence. With the advent of [[postmodern]], interpretive-[[hermeneutic]] thought, structuralist and [[structural functionalism|functionalist]] theories went receded. Internal incoherence and a range of intrinsic limitations further reduced its appeal.

=== Excessive emphasis of affinal ties ===

By overstressing the structural significance of affinal ties, alliance theory effectively neglected the importance of descent and genealogical ties. Some societies (e.g. [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] tribal societies) employ descent as their primary organizational principle. In others, alliances are of primary significance, as in e.g. many [[Southeast-Asia]]n societies and amongst Amazon tribes; and still others emphasise both. The [[Yanomami]] fit very well into the alliance theory mold, while the [[Tallensi]] or [[Azande]] do not. [[Ladislav Holý|Holý]] (1996) pointed out that some [[Middle-East]]ern societies cannot be conclusively explained by either descent or alliance theory.

Critics also saw weaknesses in Lévi-Strauss' methods, in the fact that he looked for ideal structures, thereby neglecting the reality and complexity of actual practices. His model explained practices that were not observed. Kuper{{sfn|Kuper|1988|p=223}} pointed out that if the structures of the mind really are universal and Lévi-Strauss' model is correct, then why do not all human societies act accordingly and structure their kinship systems around alliances and exchanges? Kuper allowed that exchange was the universal form of marriage, but there could be other significant factors. And even if reciprocity was the primary principle that underlies marriages, the return would not have to be in kind but could take other forms (such as money, livestock, services or favours of various kinds). Also, social cohesion through reciprocity does not have to rest primarily on the bride exchange. Mauss showed that different cultures use all kinds of gifts to create and maintain alliances.

[[Feminist]]s critique Lévi-Strauss' claim that the underlying principle according to which all societies work is the exchange of women by men, who dispose of them as if they were objects. Others, for example Godelier, critiqued structuralism's synchronic approach that led it to be essentially ahistorical.

=== Materialistic perspectives ===

[[Marxist]]s shifted the attention within anthropology from an almost exclusive preoccupation with kinship to an emphasis on economic issues. For them, social structures were primarily shaped by material conditions, property relations and class struggles.

=== Falsification ===

Structuralism's main propositions were not formulated in a way so that they could be subject to verification or [[Falsifiability|falsification]].{{sfn|D'Andrade|1995|p=249}}{{sfn|Barnes|1971|p=165-171}} Lévi-Strauss did not develop a framework that could prove the existence of his concept of the fundamental structures of human thought, but simply assumed their existence. Boyer pointed out that experimental research on concepts in psychology have not supported a structuralistic view of concepts, but rather a theory-oriented or prototype-based view.{{sfn|Boyer|2013}}

[[File:Qigong taiji meditation.jpg|thumb|The Daoyintu; a painting on silk depicting the practice of Tao yin; unearthed in 1973 in [[Hunan]] Province, China, from the 168 BC [[Western Han]] burial site of [[Mawangdui]], Tomb Number 3.]]
'''Tao yin''' (sometimes referred to as [[Taoist]] [[yoga]]) is a series of exercises (mainly in lying and sitting positions, but also in standing positions) practiced by [[Taoists]] to cultivate [[ch'i]], the internal energy of the body according to [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo chapter 11 Tao Yin - Taoist Respiration Therapy page 113(Aquarian Press/Thorsons - [[HarperCollins]] 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice of Tao Yin was a precursor of [[qigong]],&lt;ref name="Huang 1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Huang|first=Jane|title=The Primordial Breath, Vol. 1|publisher=Original Books, Inc|year=1987|isbn=0-944558-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was practised in Chinese Taoist [[monasteries]] for [[health]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] cultivation.&lt;ref name="Huang 1987"/&gt; Tao Yin,  is also said to be&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eberhard|first=Wolfram|title=A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols: Hidden Symbols in Chinese Life and Thought|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London|year=1986|isbn=0-415-00228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a primary formative ingredient in the well-known "[[soft style]]" [[Chinese martial art]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai Chi Ch'uan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lao|first=Cen|title=The Evolution of T'ai Chi Ch'uan – T’AI CHI The International Magazine of T’ai Chi Ch’uan Vol. 21 No. 2|publisher=Wayfarer Publications|date=April 1997|issn=0730-1049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main goal of Tao yin is to create balance between internal and external energies and to revitalize the body, mind and spirit, developing strength and flexibility in muscles and tendons.

==The Daoyintu==
[[File:Daoyin tu - chart for leading and guiding people in exercise Wellcome L0040263.jpg|thumb|Original ''[[Tao yin#The Daoyintu|Daoyin tu]]'' Drawings of Guiding and Pulling in the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]]]]
[[File:Daoyin tu - chart for leading and guiding people in exercise Wellcome L0036007.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed ''[[Tao yin#The Daoyintu|Daoyin tu]]'' Drawings of Guiding and Pulling in the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]]]]
A painted scroll on display at the [[Hunan Provincial Museum]] and known as the Daoyintu found in tomb three at [[Mawangdui]] in 1973 and dated to 168 BC shows coloured drawings of 44 figures in standing and sitting postures doing Tao yin exercises. It is the earliest physical exercise chart in the world so far and illustrates a medical system which does not rely on external factors such as medication, surgery or treatments but internal factors to prevent disease.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The images include men and women, young and old. Their postures and movements differ from one another. Some are sitting, some are standing, and still others are practising Daoyintu or exercising using apparatuses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translation of the texts covering the document show that the early Chinese were aware of the need for both preventative and treatment based breathing exercises.
The exercises can be divided into three categories:
# Postures of bodily exercises such as stretching arms and legs, leaning over, hopping, dancing, breathing exercises and using various equipment such as a stick and a ball.
# Imitating animal behaviour such as dragon, monkey, bear and crane.
# Exercises targeted at specific diseases.

==Effects==
A typical Tao Yin exercise will involve movement of the arms and body in time with controlled inhalation and exhalation. Each exercise is designed with a different goal in mind, for example calmative effects or expanded lung capacity.

{{quote|Some of the exercises act as a means of sedating, some as a stimulant and a tonic, whilst others help in the activation, harnessing and cultivation of internal Ch'i energy and the external Li life force. Through the excellent health that is gained thereby, they all assist in the opening up of the whole body, enhance the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, increase the mental capacity of the brain, give greater mind control, increase perception and intuition, uplift moral standards, and give tranquillity to the mind, which in turn confers inner harmony and greater happiness. As time goes by, these exercises slowly open up the functional and control channels that feed and activate the energy, nervous and psychic centres, enabling the individual to have a deeper understanding, consciousness and awareness of the spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo chapter 11 Tao Yin - Taoist Respiration Therapy page 114(Aquarian Press/Thorsons - [[HarperCollins]] 1986&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Mantak Chia]] (Taoist Master and creator of the Universal Healing Tao System) the practice of Tao Yin has the following effects: harmonization of the [[Qi|chi]], relaxation of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm, training of the "second brain" in the lower abdomen, improvement of health and structural alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chia|first=Mantak|title=Energy Balance through the Tao: Exercises for Cultivating Yin Energy.|publisher=Destiny Books.|date=September 2005|isbn=159477059X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable''''' is a 2007 book by author and former [[options trader]] [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]]. The book focuses on the extreme impact of rare and unpredictable [[outlier]] events &amp;mdash; and the human tendency to find simplistic explanations for these events, retrospectively. Taleb calls this the [[Black Swan theory]].

The book covers subjects relating to knowledge, [[aesthetics]], as well as [[way of life|ways of life]], and uses elements of fiction and anecdotes from the author's life to elaborate his theories. The book spent 36 weeks on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best-seller list]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aHfkhe8.C._8 | work=Bloomberg | title=Taleb Outsells Greenspan as Black Swan Gives Worst Turbulence | date=March 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is  part of Taleb's five volume series, titled the ''Incerto'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Fooled-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/0399590455/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1478542991&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=incerto|title=Incerto: Fooled by Randomness The Black Swan The Bed of Procrustes Antifragile|first=Nassim Nicholas|last=Taleb|date=15 November 2016|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|accessdate=5 November 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Fooled by Randomness]]'' (2001), ''The Black Swan'' (2007–2010)'',  ''[[The Bed of Procrustes]]'' (2010–2016), ''[[Antifragile]]'' (2012), and  [[Skin in the Game (book)|''Skin in the Game'']] (2018).

==Coping with Black Swan events==
A central idea in Taleb's book is not to attempt to predict Black Swan events, but to build [[Robust statistics|robustness]] to negative events and an ability to exploit positive events. Taleb contends that banks and trading firms are vulnerable to hazardous Black Swan events and are exposed to losses beyond those predicted by their defective financial models.

The book asserts that a "Black Swan" event depends on the observer, e.g., what may be a Black Swan surprise for a turkey is not a Black Swan surprise for its butcher.  Hence the objective should be to "avoid being the turkey", by identifying areas of vulnerability in order to "turn the Black Swans white".

==Summary==
Taleb refers to the book variously as an essay or a narrative with one single idea: ''"our blindness with respect to randomness, particularly large deviations."''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} p.xix.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book's layout follows "a simple logic"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} PROLOGUE p.xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;, moving from literary subjects in the beginning to scientific and mathematical subjects in the later portions. Part One and the beginning of Part Two delve into [[psychology]]. Taleb addresses science and business in the latter half of Part Two and Part Three. Part Four contains advice on how to approach the world in the face of uncertainty and still enjoy life.

Taleb acknowledges a contradiction in the book. He uses an exact metaphor, the [[Black swan theory|Black Swan idea]] to argue against the "unknown, the abstract, and imprecise uncertain—white ravens, pink elephants, or evaporating denizens of a remote planet orbiting Tau Ceti."

{{quote|There is a contradiction; this book is a story, and I prefer to use stories and vignettes to illustrate our gullibility about stories and our preference for the dangerous compression of narratives.... You need a story to displace a story. Metaphors and stories are far more potent (alas) than ideas; they are also easier to remember and more fun to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} PROLOGUE p.xxvii, Taleb call this human tendency ''the narrative fallacy'': we seem to enjoy stories, and we seem to want to remember stories for their own sake.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Part one: Umberto Eco's anti-library, or how we seek validation===
In the first chapter, the Black Swan theory is first discussed in relation to Taleb's coming of age in the [[Levant]]. The author then elucidates his approach to historical analysis. He describes history as opaque, essentially a [[black box]] of cause and effect. One sees events go in and events go out, but one has no way of determining which produced what effect. Taleb argues this is due to ''The Triplet of Opacity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} PROLOGUE p8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter  discusses a neuroscientist named Yevgenia Nikolayevna Krasnova and her book ''A Story of Recursion''. She published her book on the web and was discovered by a small publishing company; they published her unedited work and the book became an international bestseller. The small publishing firm became a big corporation, and Yevgenia became famous. This incident is described as a Black Swan event.

The book goes on to admit that the so-called author is a work of fiction. Yevgenia rejects the distinction between fiction and nonfiction. She also hates the very idea of forcing things into well defined "categories", holding that the world generally is complex and not easy to define. Though female, the character is based, in part, autobiographically on the author (according to Taleb), who has many of the same traits.

The third chapter introduces the concepts of ''Extremistan'' and ''Mediocristan''. He uses them as guides to define how predictable the environment one's studying is. ''Mediocristan'' environments safely can use [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]]. In ''Extremistan'' environments, a Gaussian distribution should be used at one's own peril.

Chapter four brings together the topics discussed earlier, into a narrative about a turkey. Taleb uses it to illustrate the philosophical problem of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] and how past performance is no indicator of future performance. He then takes the reader into the history of [[skepticism]].

In chapter nine, Taleb outlines the multiple topics he previously has described and connects them as a single basic idea.

In chapter thirteen, the book discusses what can be done regarding epistemic arrogance. He recommends avoiding unnecessary dependence on large-scale harmful predictions, while being less cautious with smaller matters, such as going to a picnic. He makes a distinction between the American cultural perception of failure versus European and Asian stigma and embarrassment regarding failure: the latter is more tolerable for people taking small risks. He also describes the "[[barbell strategy]]" for investment he used as a trader, which consists in avoiding medium risk investments and putting 85–90% of money in the safest instruments available and the remaining 10–15% on extremely [[Speculation|speculative]] bets.

==Argument==
The term ''black swan'' was a Latin expression: its oldest reference is in the poet [[Juvenal]]'s expression that "a good person is as rare as a black swan" ("rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno", 6.165).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/294875| jstor = 294875| title = The Origin of Etruscan tusna ("Swan")| journal = The American Journal of Philology| volume = 105| issue = 2| pages = 209| year = 1984| last1 = Puhvel | first1 = J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a common expression in 16th century London, as a statement that describes impossibility, deriving from the old world presumption that 'all [[swan]]s must be white', because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taleb|first=Nassim Nicholas|url=http://fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm |title=Opacity: What We Do Not See |publisher=Fooledbyrandomness.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the black swan is an oft cited reference in philosophical discussions of the improbable. Aristotle's "Prior Analytics" is the most likely original reference that makes use of example syllogisms involving the predicates "white", "black", and "swan." More specifically, Aristotle uses the white swan as an example of necessary relations and the black swan as improbable. This example may be used to demonstrate either deductive or inductive reasoning; however, neither form of reasoning is infallible, since in inductive reasoning, the premises of an argument may support a conclusion, but do not ensure it, and similarly, in deductive reasoning, an argument is dependent on the truth of its premises. That is, a [[false premise]] may lead to a false result and inconclusive premises also will yield an inconclusive conclusion. The limits of the argument behind "all swans are white" is exposed—it merely is based on the limits of experience (e.g., that every swan one has seen, heard, or read about is white). The point of this metaphor is that all known swans were white until the discovery of [[Black swan|black swans]] in Australia. [[David Hume|Hume]]'s attack against induction and causation is based primarily on the limits of everyday experience and so too, the limitations of scientific knowledge.

==Reception==
 
Mathematics professor David Aldous argued that "Taleb is sensible (going on prescient) in his discussion of financial markets and in some of his general philosophical thought, but tends toward irrelevance or ridiculous exaggeration otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Aldous]], [http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Books/taleb.html A critical review of Taleb, Nassim Nicholas.

'''''The Case for God''''' is a 2009 book by [[Karen Armstrong]]. It is an answer to the recent claims that God does not exist from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] and focuses on the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] from the paleolithic age to the present day. Also included are [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]].

Among the themes of the book are [[apophatic theology]] and intellectualism versus practice. Armstrong claims that the fundamental reality, later called [[God]], [[Brahman]], [[nirvana]] or [[Tao]], transcends human concepts and thoughts, and can only be known through devoted religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/case-for-god-karen-armstrong|title=All quiet on the God front|date=4 July 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2009/07/religion-armstrong-god-case|title=The Case for God: What Religion Means  By Karen Armstrong |last=Byrnes|first=Sholto|date=16 July 2009|work=[[New Statesman]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/books/review/Douthat-t.html|title=Perpetual Revelations|date=1 October 2009|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article6619456.ece|title=The Case for God: What Religion Really Means by Karen Armstrong|date=5 July 2009|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/09/10/out-out-damned-atheists.html|title=Out, Out, Damned Atheists: Karen Armstrong weighs in on God.|last=Miller|first=Lisa|date=11 September 2009|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

In the introduction, Armstrong presents two forms of knowledge, ''[[Logos#Jung.27s analytical psychology|mythos]]'' and ''[[logos]]''.{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xi}} Since the 16th and 17th century, she says ''logos'' governed civilization, resulting in two phenomena: [[fundamentalism]] and [[atheism]].{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xv}} Armstrong says that the [[new atheism|"new" atheists]] have made some valid criticisms of religion, stating "I can sympathize with the irritation of the new atheists". But she maintains that they have focused primarily on fundamentalism. She says they "aren't radical enough" and finds their work "disappointingly shallow".{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xvi}} According to Armstrong, "My aim in this book is simply to bring something fresh to the table."{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xvii}}

{{Christian mysticism}}

'''''The Cloud of Unknowing''''' ([[Middle English]]: ''The Cloude of Unknowyng'') is an anonymous work of [[Christian mysticism]] written in [[Middle English]] in the latter half of the 14th century. The text is a spiritual guide on [[contemplative prayer]] in the late [[Middle Ages]]. The underlying message of this work suggests that the way to know [[God]] is to abandon consideration of God's particular activities and attributes, and be courageous enough to surrender one's mind and ego to the realm of "unknowing", at which point one may begin to glimpse the nature of God.

==History==
''The Cloud of Unknowing'' draws on the mystical tradition of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and Christian [[Neoplatonism]],&lt;ref name=eve/&gt; which focuses on the [[via negativa]] road to discovering God as a pure entity, beyond any capacity of mental conception and so without any definitive image or form. This tradition has reputedly inspired generations of mystical searchers from [[John Scotus Eriugena]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], and [[John of the Cross]], to [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (the latter two of whom may have been influenced by ''The Cloud'' itself). Prior to this, the theme of ''The Cloud'' had appeared in the ''[[Confessions of St. Augustine]]'' (IX, 10) written in AD 398.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/clunintr.htm "Introduction", ''The Cloud of Unknowing'', (Patrick Gallacher, ed.)  (TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The author is unknown. The English Augustinian mystic [[Walter Hilton]] has at times been suggested, but this is generally doubted.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cloud of Unknowing'', (James Walsh, ed.) (New York: Paulist Press, 1981), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible he was a Carthusian priest, though this is not certain.{{sfn|Walsh pp. 3-9}}

A second major work by the same author, ''The Book of Privy Counseling'' (originally titled ''Prive Counselling''), continues the themes discussed in the ''Cloud''. It is less than half the size of the ''Cloud'', appears to be the author's final work, and clarifies and deepens some of its teachings.&lt;ref name="Bernard McGinn 2012 p396"&gt;McGinn, Bernard. ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 2012), p396.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, the author characterizes the practice of contemplative unknowing as worshiping God with one's "substance," coming to rest in a "naked blind feeling of being", and ultimately finding thereby that God is one's being.

==Contents==
The book counsels a young student to seek God, not through knowledge and [[intellection]] (faculty of the human mind), but through intense contemplation, motivated by love, and stripped of all thought.{{refn|group=note|This can be seen as an antithesis to the school of [[scholasticism]] common in Roman Catholic teaching from the 11th century onwards, and more in line with [[Orthodox Christian]] philosophy.}} This is brought about by putting all thoughts and desires under a "cloud of forgetting," and thereby piercing God's cloud of unknowing with a "dart of longing love" from the heart. This form of contemplation is not directed by the intellect, but involves spiritual union with God through the heart:
{{Quote|For He can well be loved, but he cannot be thought. By love he can be grasped and held, but by thought, neither grasped nor held. And therefore, though it may be good at times to think specifically of the kindness and excellence of God, and though this may be a light and a part of contemplation, all the same, in the work of contemplation itself, it must be cast down and covered with a cloud of forgetting. And you must step above it stoutly but deftly, with a devout and delightful stirring of love, and struggle to pierce that darkness above you; and beat on that thick cloud of unknowing with a sharp dart of longing love, and do not give up, whatever happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cloud of Unknowing and other works |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Penguin Classics |location= |isbn=978-0-14-044762-0 |page= |doi= |url=}} Translated by A. C. Spearing&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chapters 39 and 40 recommend the focus on a single word as the means to invoke the fullness of God:
{{quote|When we intend to pray for goodness, let all our thought and desire be contained in the one small word "God." Nothing else and no other words are needed, for God is the epitome of all goodness. Immerse yourself in the spiritual reality it speaks of yet without precise ideas of God's works whether small or great, spiritual or material. Do not consider any particular virtue which God may teach you through grace, whether it is humility, charity, patience, abstinence, hope, faith, moderation, chastity, or evangelical poverty. For to a contemplative they are, in a sense, all the same. Let this little word represent to you God in all his fullness and nothing less than the fullness of God.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston (1996), pp. 98-101.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Ch. 39-40, other translations:&lt;br&gt;* [[Evelyn Underhill]] (1922/2003)''': "And if we will intentively pray for getting of good, let us cry, either with word or with thought or with desire, nought else nor no more words, but this word “God.” For why, in God be all good..
Fill thy spirit with the ghostly bemeaning of it without any special beholding to any of His works—whether they be good, better, or best of all—bodily or ghostly, or to any virtue that may be wrought in man’s soul by any grace; not looking after whether it be meekness or charity, patience or abstinence, hope, faith, or soberness, chastity or wilful poverty. What recks this in contemplatives?.. they covet nothing with special beholding, but only good God. Do thou.. mean God all, and all God, so that nought work in thy wit and in thy will, but only God.&lt;ref&gt;''Cloud'' (version), Underhill (2003), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/anonymous2/cloud.xlv.html pp. 69-72], Accessed 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;* [[Middle English]] original: "And yif we wil ententifly preie for getyng of goodes, lat us crie, outher with worde or with thought or with desire, nought elles, ne no mo wordes, bot this worde God. For whi in God ben alle goodes..

What thar reche in contemplatyves?.. thei coveyte nothing with specyal beholdyng, bot only good God. Do thou.. mene God al, and al God, so that nought worche in thi witte and in thi wile, bot only God.&lt;ref&gt;''Cloud'' (original), Gallacher (1997), [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/cloud.htm lines 1426 - 1471] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219120306/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/cloud.htm |date=19 February 2009 }}, Accessed 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

Chapter 23 of ''The Book of Privy Counseling'' glorifies experience over knowledge:
{{Quote|"And so I urge you, go after experience rather than knowledge. On account of pride, knowledge may often deceive you, but this gentle, loving affection will not deceive you. Knowledge tends to breed conceit, but love builds. Knowledge is full of labor, but love, full of rest."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston (1996), p. 188 (paperback).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other works by the same author==
In addition to ''The Cloud of Unknowing'' and ''The Book of Privy Counseling'', the ''Cloud'' author is believed to be responsible for a few other spiritual treatises and translations, including:

* ''Deonise Hid Divinity'', a free translation of the ''Mystical Theology'' by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]. A vernacular translation of the ''Mystical Theology'' was unprecedented; however, it was clearly not widely read, since only two manuscripts survive.&lt;ref name="Bernard McGinn 2012 p398"&gt;Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 2012), p398.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A Letter of Prayer'' (''A Pistle of Prayer''), which survives in seven manuscripts. ([http://www.ccel.org/g/gardner/cell/cell18.htm Online]);
* ''A Letter of Discretion of Stirrings'' (''A Pistle of Discrecioun of Stirings''). ([http://www.ccel.org/g/gardner/cell/cell19.htm Online, part VI of "The Cell of Self Knowledge"])
* It is possible, but doubtful,&lt;ref name="Bernard McGinn 2012 p398"/&gt; that he wrote ''A Treatise of Discernment of Spirits'' (originally titled ''A Tretis of Discrecyon of Spirites''), a free translation of ''Sermones di Diversis'' nos 23-24, by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], ([http://www.ccel.org/g/gardner/cell/cell20.htm Online]).
* It is possible, but doubtful,&lt;ref name="Bernard McGinn 2012 p398"/&gt; that he wrote ''A Treatise of the Study of Wisdom that Men Call Benjamin'' (also called ''Pursuit of Wisdom'', and, in its original, ''A Tretyse of the Stodye of Wysdome that Men Clepen Beniamyn''), an abbreviated and free translation of the ''Benjamin Minor'' by [[Richard of Saint Victor]] ([http://www.ccel.org/g/gardner/cell/cell03.htm Online]).

==Manuscripts==

''The Cloud of Unknowing'' has 17 known manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Bernard McGinn 2012 p396"/&gt; The two best known are [[British Library]] MS Harleian 674 and [[Cambridge University Library]] Kk.vi.26. These contain all seven of the works attributed to the ''Cloud'' author, the former extensively glossed in Latin.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; Another important manuscript is British Library Harleian 2373, which contains all but ''Deonise Hid Divinity''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cloud of Unknowing and Other Works'', trans. by A. C. Spearing (London: Penguin, 2001), p. xl.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later influence==
Given its survival in only seventeen manuscripts, ''The Cloud of Unknowing'' was not as popular in late medieval England as the works of [[Richard Rolle]] or [[Walter Hilton]], perhaps because the ''Cloud'' is addressed to solitaries and concentrates on the advanced levels of the mystical path. Two Latin translations of the ''Cloud'' were made in the late fifteenth century. One was made by [[Richard Methley]], a Carthusian of the Charterhouse of [[Mount Grace]] in [[Yorkshire]], and finished in 1491.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cloud of Unknowing'', ed James Walsh, (New York: Paulist Press, 1981), p16.&lt;/ref&gt; The other is anonymous. Neither, however, enjoyed wide dissemination.&lt;ref name="Bernard McGinn 2012 p396"/&gt;

This work became known to English Catholics in the mid 17th century, when the Benedictine monk, [[Augustine Baker]] (1575–1641), wrote an exposition on its doctrine based on a manuscript copy in the library of the monastery of [[Stanbrook Abbey|Cambrai]] in [[Flanders]]. The original work itself, however, was not published until 1877. English mystic [[Evelyn Underhill]] edited an important version of the work in 1922.&lt;ref name=eve&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/cou/cou01.htm "Introduction", ''The Cloud of Unknowing'', (Evelyn Underhill, ed.) 1922].&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has become increasingly popular over the course of the twentieth century, with nine English translations or modernisations produced in this period. In particular, ''The Cloud'' has influenced recent contemplative prayer practices. The practical prayer advice contained in ''The Cloud of Unknowing'' forms a primary basis for the contemporary practice of [[Centering Prayer]], a form of [[Christian meditation]] developed by [[Trappist]] monks [[William Meninger]], [[Basil Pennington]] and [[Thomas Keating]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=keating86&gt;''Open Mind, Open Heart: The Contemplative Dimension of the Gospel'' (2006/1986). by Thomas Keating. Continuum International Publishing Group. paperback: {{ISBN|0-8264-0696-3}}, hardback: {{ISBN|0-8264-1420-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also informed the meditation techniques of the English Benedictine [[John Main]].&lt;ref name="Bernard McGinn 2012 p396"/&gt;

The contemplation method urged in ''The Cloud'' is similar to [[Buddhist meditation]] and modern [[transcendental meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cloud of Unknowing and Other Works'', trans. by A. C. Spearing (London: Penguin, 2001), p. xviii; Ninian Smart, 'What Would Buddhaghosa Have Made of ''The Cloud of Unknowing''?', in ''Mysticism and Language'', ed. by Steven A, Katz (New York, 1992), pp. 103-22.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the last paragraph of chapter 7 says: &lt;blockquote&gt;If you want to gather all your desire into one simple word that the mind can easily retain, choose a short word rather than a long one. A one-syllable word such as "God" or "love" is best. But choose one that is meaningful to you. Then fix it in your mind so that it will remain there come what may. This word will be your defence in conflict and in peace. Use it to beat upon the cloud of darkness above you and to subdue all distractions, consigning them to the ''cloud of forgetting'' beneath you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Story ==
The myth concerns a Foolish Old Man of 90 years who lived near a pair of mountains (given in some tellings as the [[Taihang Mountains|Taihang]] and the [[Mount Wangwu|Wangwu]] mountains, in [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu Province]]). He was annoyed by the obstruction caused by the mountains and sought to dig through them with hoes and baskets. When questioned as to the seemingly impossible nature of his task, the Foolish Old Man replied that while he may not finish this task in his lifetime, through the hard work of himself, his children, and their children, and so on through the many generations, some day the mountains would be removed if he persevered. The [[Chinese gods|gods]] in Heaven, impressed with his hard work and perseverance, ordered the mountains separated.&lt;ref name="Giddens"/&gt;

== Mao's speech ==
[[File:Wuhan-Flood-Memorial-0226.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Wuhan memorial to the [[1954 Yangtze River Floods]], including a quotation from Mao's speech]]
In a speech at [[Yan'an]] on 11 June 1945, Mao Zedong recounted the story, re-interpreting it as a call for collective action:&lt;ref name="Lawrance"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Today, two big mountains lie like a dead weight on the Chinese people. One is imperialism, the other is feudalism. The Chinese Communist Party has long made up its mind to dig them up. We must persevere and work unceasingly, and we, too, will touch God's heart. Our God is none other than the masses of the Chinese people. If they stand up and dig together with us, why can't these two mountains be cleared away?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Together with ''[[Serve the People]]'' and ''Memory of Norman Bethune'' (紀念白求恩), it was one of the three most-frequently read stories in the ''[[Little Red Book]]'' of Mao's sayings and was memorized by schoolchildren during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3763">'''William Christian''' (born 1945 in [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], [[British Columbia]]) was a political scientist at the [[University of Guelph]]. He retired in 2008. Educated at the [[University of Toronto]]  (BA, MA) and  the [[London School of Economics]] (PhD), he is best known academically for his research and teaching in Canadian Political Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polisci.uoguelph.ca/facultystaff/william_christian.shtml |title=Department of Political Science |publisher=www.polisci.uoguelph.ca |accessdate=2008-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629012755/http://www.polisci.uoguelph.ca/facultystaff/william_christian.shtml |archivedate=June 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1970, he taught at [[Mount Allison University]]. He joined the faculty at Guelph in 1978. His publications include biographies of [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]] and Sir George Parkin, George Grant's grandfather, as well as topics ranging from the political and economic history of Canada (i.e. ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis''), to a concern for the philosophical roots of the Western tradition (i.e. "Waiting for Grace: Philosophy and Politics in [[Plato's Republic]]"). In 1974, along with [[Colin Campbell (political scientist)|Colin Campbell]], he published the first edition of ''Political Parties and Ideologies in Canada''. The scholarship was an original and valuable contribution, since it emphasized the [[ideological]] roots shaping Canada and its political parties, as opposed to a social science analysis of power relationships. The textbook distinguished the philosophical foundations of each political party by tracing its comparative tradition, policies, and leaders. In 2006, he and Campbell 'Canadianized' a leading American textbook on ideologies. Besides his academic concerns, he has contributed frequently to the Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star, the Guelph Mercury and the Waterloo Region Record.

'''Yirmiyahu Yovel''' (20 October 1935, [[Haifa]] – 9 June 2018) was an Israeli philosopher and public intellectual. He was Professor Emeritus of philosophy at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York. Yovel had also been a political columnist in Israel, cultural and political critic and a frequent presence in the media. Yovel was a laureate of the [[Israel Prize]] in philosophy and ''officier'' of the French order of the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques|Palme académique]]. His books were translated into [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Rumanian]], [[Hebrew]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Yovel was married to Shoshana Yovel, novelist and community organizer, and they had a son, Jonathan Yovel, poet and law professor, and a daughter, Ronny, classical musician, TV host and family therapist.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2587521326/yovel-yirmiyahu.html|publisher=encyclopedia.com|title=Yovel, Yirmiyahu - Dictionary definition of Yovel, Yirmiyahu &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Education and early philosophical development ===
Born in [[Haifa]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then under a [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British mandate]], Yirmiyahu Yovel graduated in 1953 from the [[Hebrew Reali School]] in Haifa. Following his mandatory military service he studied philosophy and economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, completing his B.A. in 1961 and M.A. in 1964. He supported his studies as radio news editor and presenter. However, he declined a permanent career in broadcasting and went to the [[Sorbonne]] and [[Princeton University]] to complete his philosophical studies. In 1968 he earned his PhD from the Hebrew University. His adviser was [[Nathan Rothenstreich]].

Yovel came to the university driven by existential philosophical concerns and suspicious of rationalism. Upholding individual subjectivity, young Yovel was estranged from the collectivist ideals and political ideologies of the time (including the socialist-[[Zionist]] ethos), because of their demand to monopolize and politicize all intellectual concerns. Religion, too, was not the answer, but rather an escape. Yovel has shared from the start [[Nietzsche]]'s radical drive to existential lucidity, which can be emotionally taxing but also liberating.

It was, in particular, [[Kant]]'s program of critical reason (though not its actual execution), and the concept of finite rationality that provided Yovel with the terms for a constructive critique of rationalism, one that recognizes rationality as indispensable for human life and culture, even while taking its finitude more radically than Kant's, by admitting its fallibility, open-endedness, and non-absolute nature.

Yovel holds that the history of philosophy is embedded in most philosophical discourse, and that often it contains issues and insights that can be fruitfully contemporized by a method of immanent reconstruction. His own philosophical position can be described as "a philosophy of immanence," which, following [[Spinoza]], views the immanent world as all there is and as the sole possible source of social and political normativity. The latter theme was extensively probed in his two-volume Spinoza and Other Heretics ([[Princeton University Press|Princeton]], 1989), which traces the idea of immanence back to Spinoza and follows its adventures in later thinkers of modernity from Kant and [[Hegel]] to Nietzsche and beyond.

Yovel was to return as visiting professor both to Princeton University (1970–71) and the Sorbonne (1978–80), among other foreign appointments. His years on both sides of the Atlantic helped shape Yovel's attitude towards [[analytic philosophy|Anglo-American analytic philosophy]]. He shares its demand for clarity and precision – this was recognized as a hallmark of his writing – but criticized its often scholastic tendencies and a-historical approach.

Following his academic and public activity Yirmiyahu Yovel became a prominent voice in Israeli intellectual life. His numerous columns in major papers, mostly [[Ha'aretz]] and [[Yediot Aharonot]], probed public attitudes and government policies. He was an early advocate of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, and strongly opposed the settlement activity in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] as politically wrong and motivated by false Messianism.

=== Journalism and public activity ===

Yovel's involvement in journalism started in his student days. In 1960–64 he worked for [[radio Israel]] and co-founded its weekly news magazine. In 1967 he participated in the project of creating an independent Israeli broadcasting authority, serving two terms on its council. Later he edited the first political documentaries of [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|Israel TV]], and during 1975–1978 he edited and hosted 30 major TV programs on social and political issues (drugs, gay liberation, divorce, adoption, violence in sports, Arab land rights; the right to die, etc.). His viewers also remembered him as a military reporter in the [[Sinai]] frontline in both the [[1967 War|1967]] and [[1973 War between Egypt and Israel|1973]] war. In 1973 he was among the few journalists who insisted on reporting the truth about Israel's military setbacks in the early stage of the war.

After Labor's historic defeat in 1977, he joined "Circle 77," a group of intellectuals that tried to reform the Labor party, but found himself unfit for party politics. Henceforth he focused on the written press, publishing scores of political columns until the 1990s.

=== Academic career ===

Most of Yovel's career took place at the Hebrew University, where he served in various academic posts and held the Shulman Chair of Philosophy. During that time, he also visited and lectured in numerous universities and institutes worldwide including Columbia, Hamburg, Milan, Oxford, Paris IV ("Sorbonne - Pantheon"), and others. In 1994 he accepted an appointment to teach annually one-term at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research which became his "second academic home." He was then nominated to the inaugural Hans Jonas Chair in Philosophy, from which he retired in 2010.&lt;ref name="huji"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huji.ac.il/dataj/controller/ihoker/MOP-STAFF_LINK?sno=460449&amp;Save_t=|publisher=huji.ac.il|title=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem - Faculty Research Interests|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Yovel founded the [[Jerusalem Spinoza Institute]] with a dual intention – to foster Spinoza scholarship, and to promote public education around ideas associated with Spinoza (such as democracy, secularism, and tolerance) both as all- European thinker and as an emblematic figure of Jewish modernity).

In 2000 Yovel won the Israel Prize for his achievements in philosophy. His thank-you address on behalf of his fellow laureates was entitled "A Report on the State of Reason." Reason is alive and breathing, Yovel reported, but is besieged by inner and outer enemies. Reason's "inner enemy" is its over-ambitious tendency to exceed its limits and control, and three "external enemies": mysticism, global commercial culture, and post-modern radical critique. Yovel argued that these challenges can be tackled by a sober attitude, committed to reason all while accepting its fallibility, finitude, and lack of absolute character. This is rationality "on a human scale," rather than a secular replica of religion.&lt;ref name="vanleer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanleer.org.il/en/publication/philosopher-public-sphere-essays-yirmiyahu-yovel|publisher=vanleer.org.il|title=The Philosopher in the Public Sphere: Essays for Yirmiyahu Yovel &amp;#124; מכון ון ליר בירושלים|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Yirmiyahu Yovel's published numerous scholarly articles and several books, among them ''Kant and  the Problem of History'' (Princeton 1980,86) ''Spinoza and Other Heretics'' (Princeton 1989), ''Dark Riddle: Hegel,  Nietzsche and the Jews'' ([[Polity Press|Polity]] 1996) and ''The Other Within: The Marranos'' (Princeton 2013). He translated into Hebrew two major philosophical classics (Spinoza's ''[[Spinoza's Ethics|Ethics]]'' and Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'') with systematic introductions, and  edited several collective books, including a 5-volume encyclopedia of Jewish modern secular culture. Yovel's credits as journalist include dozens of press columns and 30 major TV programs.

===''Kant and the Renewal of Metaphysics''===
Yovel's first book, based on his PhD dissertation, was ''Kant and the Renewal of Metaphysics'' (1974, in Hebrew.) While Kant had been often held to have destroyed [[metaphysics]], Yovel's book argues that Kant's actual program was to renew it, by replacing the old dogmatic metaphysics with a new critical one. Metaphysical questions are deeply significant even when they exceed the range of legitimate answers. To either repress the questions or to pretend answering them is equally irrational. Reason in Kant has a metaphysical interest and a critical interest that are equally indispensable, yet contradict each other in the absence of a critique. The critical turn resolves this [[antinomy]] in two stages. First, it establishes a system of [[Synthetic a priori|synthetic a-priori]] categories and principles that functions as a valid metaphysics of the immanent (empirical) domain; and, secondly, in the [[Dialectic]], it re-orients the metaphysical drive from its search of empty, illusory objects back into the empirical world, and makes us realize our fundamental finitude, as well as the endlessly open horizons within this world which we can explore.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Bartuchat, "Yirmiahu Yovel, Kant and the Philosophy of History", Archiv Fuer Geschichte der Philosophie , 66 Band Heft 3, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

By metaphysics Kant understood a system of supersensible elements that (1) determines the entities in the sensible world, and (2) concerns the meaning of their being. The Kantian synthetic a-priori categories and principles fulfill the first role, but do so critically, since they are not supersensible objects existing in themselves but are only ingredients in the synthesis of empirical objects. As such they also determine what it means for empirical objects to be (namely, to be a synthesis of sense perceptions linked by the categories.) The ''a priori'' system is thus not only an [[epistemology]], but equally an [[ontology]] of finite, natural beings.

The book also highlights the dynamic, self-driving nature of Kantian reason (which Yovel sometimes calls "erotic" in the [[Plato]]nic sense). Human rationality is not a mere calculus in Kant but a goal-oriented activity, which projects its own inherent ends and strives to realize them. Finally, the book describes Kant's method as the self-explication of reason, which depends upon its own history, including a series of collapses, and culminates in a critical revolution.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===''Kant and the Philosophy of History''===
Yovel's major work on Kant was to become his ''Kant and the Philosophy of History'' (Princeton 1980, 1986; French 1989).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kant and the Philosophy of History|author=Yovel, Y.|date=1989|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691020563|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=3XOCHAAACAAJ|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's historical thought had for a long time been ignored, or dismissed as marginal and inconsistent. Yovel's work was instrumental in reversing this outlook. The book goes beyond Kant's customary moral teaching, which revolves on the formal and personal characteristics of morality, to uncover a second, material tier in Kant's [[practical philosophy]], in which the moral will becomes a world-shaping will: the will is not satisfied with its personal morality alone, but works to reshape the entire social-historical world as "a moral totality". The will does not only strive to make itself good, but to reshape its world in its own image—to see its moral goals embodied in the actual world's ways and institutions. This makes possible a critical philosophy of history, and of particular areas within it—politics, law, social ethics, moral education, and a religion of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Kierans, "Kant and the Philosophy of History. By Yirmiyahu Yovel", Dalhousie Review Vol.69 No.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The lever leading to the second stage is Kant's concept of "The Highest Good" and the imperative to promote it. A close analysis of this concept leads Yovel to interpret it as the Kantian regulative idea of history, an ideal that combines maximal morality (personal and institutional, ethical and political) with universal well-being and prosperity. Kant even calls the historical task "the ultimate end of creation itself"&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Critique of Judgment  §84&lt;/ref&gt;), thus suggesting that moral history, in which humans change themselves and reform the world, is the only possible justification of there being a world and a human race, which otherwise would be utterly contingent and meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Darrel E. Christensen, "Yirmiahu Yovel. Kant and the Philosophy of History [et.al.]",  40, December 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In method, the book is not a narrative commentary but a systematic reconstruction. While relying on careful textual analyses, it organizes the material in relation to the inner logic and latent implications of Kant's positions, which allow Yovel to draw new conclusions that shed light on unknown aspects in his philosophy.

The book had strong echoes which reversed the traditional outlook. Today there is even talk of Kant's "historical turn", a concept unheard of in the past).
A noted German philosopher, director of the Institut für Sozialforschung ([[Institute for Social Research]], the institutional home of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]]) recently described the book's impact:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I first read Yirmiyahu Yovel's marvelous book on Kant and the Philosophy of History almost twenty years ago, I learned how one should approach the task of interpreting classical texts: Starting from the identification of a central problem in a philosopher`s writings, one must try rearrange the elements of the proposed solution until a new idea emerges that goes beyond the original author's explicit intentions. Because I was extremely impressed by this method the way it was applied to Kant's systematic thought, I not only became a regular and eager reader of Yirmiyahu Yovel's publications, but I also tried to emulate this mode of thinking in my own work" (—[[Axel Honneth]], 2010).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Spinoza and other Heretics''===
Yovel's best-known book is ''Spinoza and other Heretics'', (Princeton 1989), a diptych in two volumes that offers a new interpretation of the existential origins of Spinoza's intellectual revolution (Vol. I) and its developments in later thinkers of [[modernity]] (Vol. II). Spinoza appealed to Yovel primarily by his radical principle of immanence, which Yovel sees as paradigmatic of much of modern thought, and by his striking personal case. No modern thinker before Nietzsche has gone as far as Spinoza in shedding all historical religion and all horizons of transcendence. In wondering what had enabled Spinoza to tear himself so drastically from the Western theistic tradition, Yovel did not turn directly to  the rational arguments that drove Spinoza, but  looked first for the historico-existential situation that cleared the mental space for those arguments to emerge and take hold in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Feldman, "A Durable Heresy", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The answer, Yovel suggested, is  linked to the  dualities and confused religious identity of the peculiar Jewish group from which Spinoza came, the so-called [[Marranos]], who before arriving in [[Holland]] had lived for generations in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] as forced converts from [[Judaism]], absorbing [[Christianity|Christian]] symbols, mental patterns and ways of thinking. Former Jews  who tried to remain Jewish in secret had only scant knowledge of Judaism, and what they knew  they  conceptualized  in Christian terms;  while others, having mixed the two religions, ended up  neither Jews nor Christians, and looked to the affairs of this life and this world as a substitute to religious salvation in either [[Jesus]] or [[Moses]]. However, describing the events of Marranos responding to the miracle in the Convent of São Domingos in Lisbon on April 19, 1506 with statements such as "How can a piece of wood do miracles?", or "Put some water to it and it'll go out", Yovel states that these words "expressed the same rough Jewish common sense resisting the Catholic sense of mysterium and insisting on calling super-rational phenomena by their earthly names." &lt;ref&gt;The Other Within: The Marranos: Split Identity and Emerging Modernity By Yirmiyahu Yovel, Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 198-199&lt;/ref&gt; The Marrano experience, Yovel suggests, made it possible for several ex-Marranos to adopt the immanent and "secular" standpoint  which Spinoza radicalized and gave it a powerful systematization.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Feldman, "A Durable Heresy", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume One (The Marrano of Reason)&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Spinoza and Other Heretics: The Marrano of Reason|author=Yovel, Y.|date=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691020785|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=DOFwnubVDncC|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses historical and literary materials to elicit a set of typical and recurring Marrano patterns (for example: life on two levels, overt and concealed; the use of equivocation and dual language; the search for an alternative way to salvation, replacing Jesus and Moses with philosophical reason, etc.) which in Spinoza are transposed from the context of religion to that of reason. From the other direction, key philosophical issues in Spinoza (language, politics and the multitude, the third kind of knowledge) are also, at the same time, shown to be responding to Marrano-like elements that further illuminate and contextualize  them. Yovel insists that this contextualization is not reductive: Spinoza's ideas have an independent rational import that cannot be reduced to the historical circumstances that allowed them to arise.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Feldman, "A Durable Heresy", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

A heretic to all religions, Spinoza was banned by the rabbis but refused to convert to Christianity. By calling him "the first modern Jew", Yovel highlights his relevance to the Modern Jewish situation. His case - even more than his thought - anticipated most of the rival and contradicting solutions that were offered in later centuries to non-orthodox Jewish existence. Yet Spinoza himself neither advocated nor personally realized any of those options. He thus became, involuntarily, a founding father of almost all the forms of modern life in which he himself did not participate.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Feldman, "A Durable Heresy", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume Two (The Adventures of Immanence)&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Spinoza and Other Heretics: The Adventures of Immanence|author=Yovel, Y.|date=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691020792|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=ghVOo8aLgzoC|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; uncovers the presence of  Spinoza's revolution in some major turns of modern thought. Yovel distinguishes between [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and the broader concept of a "philosophy of immanence". The latter maintains that (a) immanent reality is all there is, the overall horizon of being; (b) it is also (through humans) the only valid source of moral and  political norms; and (c) interiorizing this recognition is a precondition to whatever liberation or redemption humans can hope for. Yovel takes the reader into the latent and overt conversation with Spinoza in the work of  Kant, Hegel, the left-Hegelians ([[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], [[Feuerbach]], [[Moses Hess|Hess]]), [[Marx]], Nietzsche and [[Freud]] - all of whom shared a core philosophy of immanence but worked it out in rival ways, which also diverge from  Spinoza's. This approach makes vividly present  Spinoza's influence on modernity, including Jewish modernity. In the Epilogue, speaking for himself, Yovel argues for a critical philosophy of immanence to modify Spinoza's "dogmatic" one.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Feldman, "A Durable Heresy", the New York Times Book Review, March 18, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was widely discussed and translated into French, German, Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/18/books/a-durable-heresy.html|publisher=nytimes.com|title=A DURABLE HERESY - NYTimes.com|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dark Riddle: Hegel, Nietzsche and the Jews''===
This book&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dark Riddle: Hegel, Nietzsche, and the Jews|author=Yovel, Y.|date=1998|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=9780271017945|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=i2X9huJtGXQC|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; treats the so-called "Jewish question"' as primarily a question for Europe with itself. Hegel was a philosopher of reason and Nietzsche its outright opponent; Hegel was a (heterodox) Christian and Nietzsche a self-proclaimed 'Antichrist'; Hegel sought to bring rational modernity to its climax and Nietzsche wanted to replace it with a "[[Dionysian]]"culture based upon the "will to power". Yet each in terms of his project had to grapple with the issue of Judaism and the Jews. The result was ambivalence of two different kinds.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Raynaud, "La Philosophie allemande, la raison et les juifs, Commentaire, summer 2001, 472-474.&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Hegel manifested a harsh anti-Jewish attitude which his mature philosophy mitigated. Reversing his early claim that the Jews had contributed nothing worthwhile to humanity, the older Hegel went as far as to attribute to Judaism one of the most consequential turning points in human history: the recognition that absolute being is Spirit, not a thing or a natural entity, and that Spirit is higher than nature. Yet Judaism falsified its own revolution in the very act of performing it, because it shaped itself as "a religion of sublimity", by which Hegel means a religion of self-alienation and slavish submission to an infinitely remote Master, before whom the individual stands in dread as a complete nullity. In this dialectical fashion, the mature Hegel tacitly condemned the Jews in the very act of praising them. Furthermore, unlike Nietzsche, Hegel denied post-Christian Jews any historical significance and value. It followed from Hegel's logic of history that the Jews had lost their raison d'être already in antiquity and become the empty shell of their former self. Yet while he was puzzled and disturbed by their long survival as a theoretical paradox (a "dark riddle"), this did not prevent Hegel from supporting political [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] and social acceptance for the contemporary Jews, an unpopular position in [[Germany]] at the time. Hegel looked down on German xenophobic nationalism, and as a philosopher of freedom he chose, without enthusiasm, to admit the Jews into the modern world as a necessary recognition of their humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Raynaud, "La Philosophie allemande, la raison et les juifs, Commentaire, summer 2001, 472-474.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche not only overcame the anti-Jewish prejudice of his early years but, unlike Hegel, did so with passion. Following his break with [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] the mature Nietzsche came into his own as an ardent anti-anti-Semite. To him, the modern anti-Semite was a creature of ressentiment, and as such was the genealogical cousin of the ancient Jewish priest, whom Nietzsche despised with the same ardor, and for the same psycho-philosophical reasons. Nietzsche refused to attribute to Judaism a single unchanging essence. His attitude, as reconstructed in this book, varies according to three phases in Jewish history. (1)The Old Testament Hebrews were the object of Nietzsche's admiration on account of their grand figures, great deeds, and authentic self-affirmation. (2) Nietzsche loathed and reviled the ‘priestly' Judaism of the Second Temple (and Testament), primarily because it had engendered [[Christianity]] and the "slave morality" that corrupted Europe alongside [[Socrates|Socratic]] rationalism. (3) He admired the Jews of the Diaspora because of their historical depth and the existential power they accumulated in centuries of resistance and perseverance. This power Nietzsche now wanted to pour into the new Europe he envisioned. He therefore expects urged the Jews to become secularized, to mix with other Europeans, to excel in all European affairs and eventually set new standards and values to them. The Jew's existential vigor and anti-Christian disposition would then pour into Europe, promoting a Dionysian revolution of values. Unlike Hegel, then, Nietzsche treats the Jews as an ethnic, historical human group and not primarily a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Raynaud, "La Philosophie allemande, la raison et les juifs, Commentaire, summer 2001, 472-474.&lt;/ref&gt;

This book, published in Hebrew in 1996 and translated into English, French, Japanese, and Rumanian, also shows that universal reason does not necessarily exclude a strong anti-Jewish bias, and a philosophy of power must not necessarily be anti-Semitic.

===''The Other Within: Split Identity and Emerging Modernity''===
Following his interest in Spinoza, Yovel was intrigued by the broader phenomenon of the Marranos and studied it for its own sake. The result was another opus: ''The Other Within: The Marranos: Split Identity and Emerging Modernity'' (Princeton 2009).&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Other Within: The Marranos : Split Identity and Emerging Modernity|author=Yovel, Y.|date=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691135717|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=JdN0Px3M9UMC|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yovel describes the Marranos as "the other within"—people who both did and did not belong. Rejected by most Jews as renegades and by most veteran Christians as Jews with impure blood, Marranos had no definite, integral identity, Yovel argues. The "Judaizers"-Marranos who wished to remain secretly Jewish - were not actually Jews, and those Marranos who wished to assimilate were not truly integrated as Hispano-Catholics. Rather, mixing Jewish and Christian symbols and life patterns, Marranos were typically distinguished by a split identity. They also discovered the subjective mind, engaged in social and religious dissent, and demonstrated early signs of secularity and this-worldliness. In these ways, Yovel says, the Marranos anticipated many central features of Western modernity, and also of the modern Jewish experience.

Historians who see their work as constructive of the national identity tend to appropriate the Marranos (or, Conversos) exclusively to their own nation and culture. Yovel's book argues it is impossible to attribute any integral and univocal identity to the Marranos, neither Jewish nor Hispano-Catholic, since  it was, precisely, the disintegration of the  compact characteristic of [[medieval]] society which is the most distinctive and interesting feature of these people, and one of the main contributions they made to [[Early modern Europe|early-modern]] Europe.

One of this book's philosophical conclusions is that the split identity which the [[Inquisition]] persecuted and modern nationalism condemns as illicit, is a genuine and inevitable shape of human existence, which deserves recognition as a basic human freedom.

'''''Zhengfa Yanzang''''' ([[Hànyǔ Pīnyīn]]: Zhèngfǎ Yǎnzàng; [[Rōmaji]]: Shōbōgenzō), known in English as the '''''Treasury of the Correct Dharma Eye''''' or by the Japanese reading of its title, '''''Shōbōgenzō''''', is a collection of ''[[kōan]]''s compiled by [[Dahui Zonggao]]. Dahui was a famous popularizer of ''kōan''s during the [[Song Dynasty]] in China. Dahui's collection is composed of three scrolls prefaced by three short introductory pieces. Dahui's work uses the same Chinese characters for its title as the now well known [[Shōbōgenzō]] written by the Japanese monk [[Eihei Dōgen]] in the thirteenth century. Upon arriving in China, Dōgen first studied under [[Wuji Lepai]], a disciple of Dahui, which is where he probably came into contact with Dahui's ''Zhengfa Yanzang''. In his book ''Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation'', the modern scholar [[Carl Bielefeldt]] acknowledges that Dōgen likely took the title from Dahui for his own ''kōan'' collection, the [[Shinji Shōbōgenzō]], and kept it for his later and now most well-known work, the [[Shōbōgenzō|Kana Shōbōgenzō]] (usually referred to simply as "the Shōbōgenzō"): &lt;blockquote&gt; Indeed the fact that Dōgen styled his effort "Shōbō genzō" suggests that he had as his model a similar compilation of the same title by the most famous of Sung masters, Ta-Hui Tsung-kao [Dahui Zonggao]. Unlike the latter, Dōgen was content here simply to record the stories without interjecting his own remarks. A few years later, however, he embarked on a major project to develop extended commentaries on many of these and other passages from the Ch'an literature. The fruit of this project was his masterpiece—the remarkable collection of essays known as the kana, or "vernacular", Shōbō genzō.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation|last=Bielefeldt|first=Carl|page=46|publisher=University of California Press|place=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|ISBN=0-520-06835-1|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
