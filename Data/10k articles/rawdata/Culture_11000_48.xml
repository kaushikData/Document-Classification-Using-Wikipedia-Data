'''''A Decent Ride''''' is a 2015 novel by [[Irvine Welsh]]. Welsh returns to his character Terry Lawson, first introduced in ''[[Glue (novel)|Glue]]'', this book taking place a further 10 years after the events of ''[[Porno (novel)|Porno]]'' during the 2011 Scottish [[Hurricane Bawbag]]. The book's title is a double-entendre on Lawson's sexual prowess, and his job in this novel as a taxi driver.

==Synopsis==
Terry Lawson, having met writers through giving them lifts during the [[Edinburgh Festival]], decides that a literary education will aid him in his relentless sexual escapades and help him overcome his own loss of virility. He also meets Wee Jonty—a well-endowed, nice-but-dim character, similar to ''Porno'''s Curtis—whose girlfriend Jinty Magdalen has gone missing. Lawson agrees to help track her down, his "investigations" making him question the motivations of a prominent American businessman and TV star Ronald Checker (a pastiche of [[Donald Trump]]) and his role in Jinty's disappearance. The book's narration alternates between Lawson, Jonty and Checker.

==Ronald Checker/Donald Trump==
''The Financial Times'' identified the Checker character as "a Donald Trump-esque tycoon, with a grand, possibly devious, business plan.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/eda02bd4-df65-11e4-a6c4-00144feab7de|title=‘A Decent Ride’, by Irvine Welsh|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh himself told the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that Checker was “ a youthful, punkish version of Donald Trump”, though the paper reflected that "as obnoxious as this character [Checker] is, he doesn’t come close to his real-world model [Trump]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/irvine-welsh-is-back-with-another-brazen-novel-a-decent-ride/2016/02/02/8346ac94-c50c-11e5-9693-933a4d31bcc8_story.html|title=Irvine Welsh is back with another brazen novel: ‘A Decent Ride’|first1=Patrick|last1=Anderson|first2=Patrick|last2=Anderson|date=2 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump was prominent in Scotland at the time the novel was set, developing an [[Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd v The Scottish Ministers|environmentally controversial golf course]] and publicly supporting [[Scottish Government]] policies (a theme within the book) while it suited his business needs, before falling out with [[Alex Salmond]] over his support for [[wind turbines]]—the novel plays on this and imagines and infers his sexual proclivities. Trump's subsequent rise to the presidency make the novel more relevant in its satire and its conceit of being 'taken for a ride' than it seemed at time of release. When challenged later on his opinions of Trump, Welsh stated that Checker was "a generic kind of demagogue" but that subsequent to the novel's release that "Trump...since he lost Iowa, has become more interesting. He's like some kind of game show participant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/adventure/outdoor/irvine-welsh-on-sex-politics-and-of-course-scotland-20160209|title=Irvine Welsh on Sex, Politics, and, of Course, Scotland|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The novel was reviewed in many newspapers. It received mixed reviews.

Welsh's own website chose to cite Claire Inman of [[Curious Animal]] Magazine, who felt that “Whether your interest is piqued by the ridiculously expensive bottles of whiskey and the extraordinary lengths an American will go to own them or your heart strings are pulled by Wee Jonty’s anguished love story, there’s a multitude of ideas and human emotions that Welsh brings out among the laughter.”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irvinewelsh.net/books/info/?t=A-Decent-Ride#morereviews|title=A Decent Ride :: Books :: Irvine Welsh Official Website|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a review for ''[[The Spectator]]'', in which James Walton suggested that “Irvine Welsh is not a writer who’s mellowing with age... Welsh’s [language is an] astonishingly supple invention: one that can combine scabrousness and lyricism, comedy and ruefulness in the same paragraph... [if] you fancy an authentic and often thrilling blast of full-strength Irvine Welsh, then you’re in for a treat.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/04/taxi-ride-to-the-dark-side-a-thrilling-blast-of-full-strength-irvine-welsh/|title=Taxi ride to the dark side: a thrilling blast of full-strength Irvine Welsh|date=11 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a review titled "Poor Writing and Penis Jokes" Stuart Kelly felt that he "could have spent this entire review analysing Welsh’s sexual politics – but what would be the point? The tired old rebuttal is 'it’s a satire and you don’t have a sense of humour'. But listen. What’s that? It’s the sound of no one laughing. There is a faint and distant sniggering, though. If anyone parts with £12.99 for this, they’re being taken for a ride."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/24/a-decent-ride-irvine-welsh-review-novel|title=A Decent Ride by Irvine Welsh review – poor writing and penis jokes|first=Stuart|last=Kelly|date=24 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Incomplete History of the Art of the Funerary Violin''''' is a 2006 book by [[Rohan Kriwaczek]], purportedly tracing the lost history of [[funerary]] [[violin]].  Contrary to its title, the book is a work of fiction and not an actual account of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/04/books/04viol.html|title= British Author Espies a Funerary Violin Vacuum and So Fills It|author=JULIE BOSMAN|date=October 4, 2006|work=New York Yimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/anincompletehistoryoftheartoffuneraryviolin|title=An Incomplete History of the Art of Funerary Violin |accessdate=April 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113170129/http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/anincompletehistoryoftheartoffuneraryviolin |archivedate=January 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/book-reviews/an-incomplete-history-of-the-art-of-funerary-violin/2007/04/18/1176696877054.html |title=An Incomplete History of the Art of Funerary Violin - Book Reviews - Books |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writing.com/main/view_item/item_id/1212347 |title=History of the Art of Funerary Violin |publisher=Writing.Com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Mayer]], the publisher of [[Overlook Press]], doubted the veracity of the book and the history that it was said to contain; nevertheless, he agreed to publish it. Violin dealers and stringed instrument publications quickly refuted the existence of a musical [[genre]] called "funerary violin," as reported by ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Defending his decision to publish the book, Mayer said:
:I decided it didn't really matter to me how much of this was actually accurate. It was a life's work. [Kriwaczek] was dedicated to this guild not being forgotten, dedicated to the music. I decided this is just an amazing piece of work, and I wanted to publish it,... Who knows if it's true, but it's unbelievable reading.

Book stores that have agreed to stock the book are unsure how to categorize it.{{fact|date=February 2018}}  The book does not really belong in fiction because it is not a typical narrative, but the art history section would also be incorrect because much "historical" fact has been invented.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Kriwaczek argues that his book is neither a [[hoax]] nor an attempt to mislead. He issued a statement on October 5, 2006 saying that he wanted to "expand the notion of musical composition to encompass the creation of an entire artistic genre, with its necessary accompanying history, mythology, philosophy, social function, etc."{{fact|date=February 2018}}

'''Boombal''' (pl. Boombals) is a relatively recent phenomenon of [[folk dance]] parties in [[Belgium]], originating in the French bal folk. The partygoers indulge in pair, ring, line, and string dances such as the [[waltz]], [[polka]], [[An Dro]], etc. adapted from the French [[bal folk]] scene. The events are seen as a more social and enjoyable alternative to the individualistic dancing that is often seen in modern clubs. There is a very low barrier of entrance due to the emphasis on having fun rather than meticulously performed and complicated dances.

==History==
Boombal originated in [[Ghent]], Belgium when accordion instructor Wim Claeys wanted his students to play to a real dance audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kkunst.com/kk/20030911933.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713155616/http://www.kkunst.com/kk/20030911933.php |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The first Boombal was organised in September 2000 in an old furniture shop, with about 5 couples participating. This shop was located in the Boomstraat (lit. tree-street), which is how the event got its name. A year later, the Boombal concept had grown immensely and with over 100 participants the event was relocated to the Volkshuis van de Dampoort in Ghent. Soon, another move was necessary to the even bigger intercultural centre 'De Centrale'.

In 2006, Boombal is an established and popular concept in Belgium, organised mostly in and around various student cities. In the Netherlands, similar events are popping up, under the name Folkbal. The idea is slowly gaining popularity in other neighbouring countries as well.

==Event==
A Boombal typically consists of two parts:

1. Initiation

In about an hour, an instructor will demonstrate and teach various dances. Popular ones include [[Schottische]], [[Gigue]]s and [[Bourrée]]s. The emphasis is on dances that can be performed with two or more people at the time.

2. Party

Professional folk musicians play live music to which the various learned dances are performed en masse. There is a lot of interplay between the audience and the musicians. A typical session lasts about two hours.

'''Catholic Slavs''' and '''Slavic Catholic''' are terms used for the historically and/or predominantly Catholic Slavic ethnic groups and nations and for the [[history of Catholicism]] among the [[Slavic peoples]]; especially amongst the [[West Slavs]]. The Catholic Slavic nations include all [[West Slavs]] ([[Poles]], [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] and all their sub-ethnicities ex. [[Kashubs]], [[Silesians]]) as well as the westernmost [[South Slavs]] ([[Slovenes]] and [[Croats]]).&lt;ref name="Jakelic2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Slavica Jakelic|title=Collectivistic Religions: Religion, Choice, and Identity in Late Modernity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olY3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-16420-3|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Middle Ages===
Grand Duke [[Kazimierz IV]] of Lithuania and Poland (r. 1440–92) initiated the Catholicization of [[Kiev Voivodeship|Kiev]] (which was Orthodox) early in his reign.{{sfn|Cooper|2003|p=227}}

===Early modern period===
{{see also|Counter-Reformation}}
The [[Union of Brest]] (1596) saw the official establishment of the [[Uniate]] Church (Eastern it custom and ritual but subscribing to Catholic dogma and submission to the [[Pope]] as head of the Church) in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].{{sfn|Cooper|2003|p=227}}

The [[Habsburg Monarchy]] launched a programme of re-Catholicization in [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] in the 1620s.&lt;ref name="Polišenský1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef V.

'''Children's literature''' or '''juvenile literature''' includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children. Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader.

Children's literature can be traced to stories and songs, part of a wider [[oral tradition]], that adults shared with children before publishing existed. The development of early children's literature, before printing was invented, is difficult to trace. Even after printing became widespread, many classic "children's" tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience. Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children, often with a moral or religious message. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is known as the "Golden Age of Children's Literature", because many classic children's books were published then.

There is no single or widely used definition of children's literature.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|15–17}} It can be broadly defined as anything that children read&lt;ref name=nodel&gt;{{cite book|last=Nodelman|first=Perry|title=The Hidden Adult: Defining Children's Literature|year= 2008|publisher= [[JHU]]|page=4| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wKosfJZhUwQC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-8018-8980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more specifically defined as [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], [[poetry]], or [[drama]] intended for and used by children and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress|title=Children's Literature|url=https://www.loc.gov/acq/devpol/chi.pdf|work=LIbrary of Congress Collections Policy Statement|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20thc&gt;{{cite book|last= Chevalier|first= Tracy|title=Twentieth-Century Children's Writers|year=1989|publisher=[[St. James Press]]|location= [[Chicago]]|isbn= 0-912289-95-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvii}} One writer on children's literature defines it as "all books written for children, excluding works such as [[comic book]]s, joke books, [[cartoon book]]s, and non-fiction works that are not intended to be read from front to back, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference materials".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2006, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others would argue that comics should also be included: "Children's Literature studies has traditionally treated comics fitfully and superficially despite the importance of comics as a global phenomenon associated with children".&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, C. "Abstract":, "Comic Art, Children's Literature, and the New Comic Studies." ''The Lion and the Unicorn'', vol. 30 no. 3, 2006, pp. 360-382. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/uni.2006.0031 [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202582/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'' notes that "the boundaries of [[genre]]&amp;nbsp;... are not fixed but blurred".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first= Peter (editor)|title= International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature|year=1996|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P74RiK3CRGkC&amp;pg=PP4|isbn= 978-0-203-16812-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Sometimes, no agreement can be reached about whether a given work is best categorized as literature for adults or children. Some works defy easy categorization. [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series was written and marketed for young adults, but it is also popular among adults. The series' extreme popularity led ''[[The New York Times]]'' to create a separate best-seller list for children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|title=The ''Times'' Plans a Children's Best-Seller List|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 24, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/books/the-times-plans-a-children-s-best-seller-list.html|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread association of children's literature with picture books, spoken narratives existed before [[printing]], and the root of many children's tales go back to ancient storytellers.&lt;ref name=Arbuth&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbuthnot|first=May Hill|title=Children and Books|year=1964|publisher=[[Scott, Foresman Publishers|Scott, Foresman]]|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} [[Seth Lerer]], in the opening of ''Children's Literature: A Reader's History from Aesop to Harry Potter'', says, "This book presents a history of what children have heard and read&amp;nbsp;... The history I write of is a history of ''reception''."&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|2}}

Early children's literature consisted of spoken stories, songs, and poems that were used to educate, instruct, and entertain children.&lt;ref name=random&gt;{{cite web|title=To Instruct and Delight A History of Children's Literature| url=http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/024children.html|publisher=Randon History|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was only in the eighteenth century, with the development of the concept of childhood, that a separate genre of children's literature began to emerge, with its own divisions, expectations, and [[Western canon|canon]].&lt;ref name=nikola&gt;{{cite book|last= Nikolajeva|first= María (editor) |author-link=Maria Nikolajeva |title= Aspects and Issues in the History of Children's Literature|year= 1995|publisher= Greenwood| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ubZL9V1L9fEC&amp;pg=PR9|isbn= 978-0-313-29614-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|x-xi}} The earliest of these books were educational books, books on conduct, and simple ABCs--often decorated with animals, plants, and anthropomorphic letters. &lt;ref&gt;•Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, French historian [[Philippe Ariès]] argues in his book ''[[Centuries of Childhood]]'' that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times. He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment.&lt;ref name=shav&gt;{{cite book|last= Shavit|first= Zohar|title= Poetics of Children's Literature|year= 2009|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8203-3481-3| url=https://books.google.com/?id=NerYSgnlnaIC&amp;pg=PP10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} As evidence for this position, he notes that, apart from instructional and didactic texts for children written by [[cleric]]s like [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] and [[Ælfric of Eynsham]], there was a lack of any genuine literature aimed specifically at children before the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMunn|first=Meradith Tilbury|author2=William Robert McMunn|title=Children's Literature in the Middle Ages|journal=[[Children's Literature (journal)|Children's Literature]]|year=1972|volume= 1|pages=21| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/chl/summary/v001/1.mcmunn.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|doi=10.1353/chl.0.0064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brad&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Johanna|title=From Chapbooks to Plumb Cake: The History of Children's Literature|year=2007|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|isbn=978-0-549-34070-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=65KJo_XpLoYC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

Other scholars have qualified this viewpoint by noting that there was a literature designed to convey the values, attitudes, and information necessary for children within their cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Wyile|first= Andrea Schwenke (editor)|title=Considering Children's Literature: A Reader|year=2008|publisher=Broadview|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MWTY0BK5jbIC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the ''[[Play of Daniel]]'' from the 12th century.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;ref name=kline&gt;{{cite book|last= Kline|first= Daniel T.|title= Medieval Literature for Children|year= 2003|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8153-3312-8| url=https://books.google.com/?id=TcxBsWXg9mYC&amp;pg=PR4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Pre-modern children's literature, therefore, tended to be of a [[didactic]] and [[Morality|moralistic]] nature, with the purpose of conveying [[Conduct book|conduct]]-related, educational and [[Religious book|religious]] lessons.&lt;ref name=kline /&gt;{{rp|6–8}}

=== Early-modern Europe ===
[[File:Hornbook Mexican.png|left|thumb|An early Mexican [[hornbook]] pictured in Tuer's ''History of the Horn-Book'', 1896.]]
During the 17th century, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them.&lt;ref name=shav /&gt;{{rp|6–7}}&lt;ref name=reynolds&gt;{{cite book|last= Reynolds|first= Kimberley|title= Children's Literature: A Very Short Introduction|year=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The English philosopher [[John Locke]] developed his theory of the [[tabula rasa]] in his 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.  In Locke's philosophy, ''tabula rasa'' was the theory that the (human) mind is at birth a "blank slate" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's [[sense|sensory]] experiences. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. Locke himself emphasized the importance of providing children with "easy pleasant books" to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them; "children may be cozen'd into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipp'd for." He also suggested that picture books be created for children.

In the nineteenth century, a few children's titles became famous as classroom reading texts. Among these were the fables of Aesop and Jean de la Fontaine and Charles Perraults's 1697 ''Tales of Mother Goose''&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;. The popularity of these texts led to the creation of a number of nineteenth century fantasy and fairy tales for children which featured magic objects and talking animals. &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence on this shift in attitudes came from [[Puritanism]], which stressed the importance of individual salvation. Puritans were concerned with the spiritual welfare of their children, and there was a large growth in the publication of "good godly books" aimed squarely at children.&lt;ref name=random /&gt; Some of the most popular works were by [[James Janeway]], but the most enduring book from this movement, still read today, especially In modernised versions, is ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678) by [[John Bunyan]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''The New Amplified Pilgrim's Progress'' (both book and dramatized audio) – as retold by James Pappas. Published by Orion's Gate (1999) and ''The Evergreen Wood: An Adaptation of the "Pilgrim's Progress" for Children'' written by Linda Perry, illustrated by Alan Perry. Published by Hunt &amp; Thorpe, 1997. [[The Pilgrim's Progress#Retellings]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chapbook]]s, pocket-sized pamphlets that were often folded instead of being stitched,&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|32}} were published in Britain; illustrated by [[Woodcut|woodblock printing]], these inexpensive booklets reprinted popular [[ballads]], historical re-tellings, and folk tales. Though not specifically published for children at this time, young people enjoyed the booklets as well.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;{{rp|8}} Johanna Bradley says, in ''From Chapbooks to Plum Cake'', that chapbooks kept imaginative stories from being lost to readers under the strict [[Puritan]] influence of the time.&lt;ref name=brad /&gt;{{rp|17}}
[[File:Aforadam.png|thumb|The New England Primer]]
[[Hornbook]]s also appeared in England during this time, teaching children basic information such as the alphabet and the [[Lord's Prayer]].&lt;ref name=questia&gt;{{cite book|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia: Children's Literature|year=2009|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422190423/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|archive-date=2012-04-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were brought from England to the [[British America|American colonies]] in the mid-17th century. The first such book was a [[catechism]] for children written in verse by the Puritan [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]]. Known as ''[[Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes]]'', it was published in 1646, appearing both in England and [[Boston]]. Another early book, ''[[The New England Primer]]'', was in print by 1691 and used in schools for 100 years. The [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] begins, "In Adam's fall We sinned all&amp;nbsp;...", and continues through the alphabet. It also contained religious maxims, [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]], spelling help and other educational items, all decorated by [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|35}}

In 1634, the ''[[Pentamerone]]'' from Italy became the first major published collection of European folk tales. [[Charles Perrault]] began recording [[fairy tale]]s in France, publishing his first collection in 1697. They were not well received among the French literary society, who saw them as only fit for old people and children. In 1658, Jan Ámos [[Comenius]] in [[Bohemia]] published the informative illustrated ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'', for children under six learning to read. It is considered to be the first picture book produced specifically for children.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The first [[Denmark|Danish]] children's book was ''The Child's Mirror'' by [[Niels Bredal]] in 1568, an adaptation of a [[Courtesy book]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] priest [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]. ''A Pretty and Splendid Maiden's Mirror'', an adaptation of a [[Germany|German]] book for young women, became the first [[Sweden|Swedish]] children's book upon its 1591 publication.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|700, 706}} Sweden published fables and a children's magazine by 1766.

In [[Italy]], [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] released ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' in the 1550s. Called the first European storybook to contain fairy-tales, it eventually had 75 separate stories and written for an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Opie |first=Iona |author2=[[Peter Opie]]  |authorlink=Iona Opie |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |page=20|location=Oxford and New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1974 |isbn=0-19-211559-6|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Russia]]'s earliest children's books, [[Primer (textbook)|primers]], appeared in the late 16th century. An early example is ''ABC-Book'', an [[alphabet book]] published by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1571.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} The first [[picture book]] published in Russia, [[Karion Istomin]]'s ''The Illustrated Primer'', appeared in 1694.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} [[Peter the Great]]'s interest in [[Modernization|modernizing]] his country through [[Westernization]] helped Western children's literature dominate the field through the 18th century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} [[Catherine the Great]] wrote [[Allegory|allegories]] for children, and during her reign, [[Nikolai Novikov]] started the first juvenile magazine in Russia.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}}

=== Origins of the modern genre ===
[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|[[Brothers Grimm]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]] (left) and [[Jakob Grimm]] (right) from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]

The modern children's book emerged in mid-18th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-the-newbery-award-got-its-name/|title=How the Newbery Award Got Its Name}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing [[politeness|polite]] middle-class and the influence of [[John Locke|Lockean]] theories of childhood innocence combined to create the beginnings of childhood as a concept. ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'', written and published by [[John Newbery]], is widely considered the first modern children's book, published in 1744. It was a landmark as the first children's publication aimed at giving enjoyment to children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kodomo.go.jp/ingram/e/section1/index.html|title=Early Children's Literature: From moralistic stories to narratives of everyday life}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a mixture of rhymes, picture stories and games for pleasure.&lt;ref name=marks&gt;{{cite book|last= Marks|first= Diana F.|title=Children's Book Award Handbook|year= 2006|publisher= [[Libraries Unlimited]]|location= Westport, Conn|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery believed that play was a better enticement to children's good behavior than physical discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, John Rowe. ''Written for Children''. (1990). New York: HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-06-446125-4}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the child was to record his or her behavior daily.

The book was child–sized with a brightly colored cover that appealed to children—something new in the publishing industry. Known as gift books, these early books became the precursors to the [[toy book]]s popular in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Lundin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lundin, Anne H. |year=1994 |title=Victorian Horizons: The Reception of Children's Books in England and America, 1880–1900 |journal=The Library Quarterly |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |volume=64 |issue= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery was also adept at marketing this new genre. According to the journal ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn (journal)|The Lion and the Unicorn]]'', "Newbery's genius was in developing the fairly new product category, children's books, through his frequent advertisements&amp;nbsp;... and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children's books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Susina|first= Jan|title= Editor's Note: Kiddie Lit(e): The Dumbing Down of Children's Literature |journal= The Lion and the Unicorn |date=June 1993|volume= 17|issue= 1|pages= v–vi| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v017/17.1.susina.html| accessdate=30 July 2012 |doi=10.1353/uni.0.0256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;



The improvement in the quality of books for children, as well as the diversity of topics he published, helped make Newbery the leading producer of children's books in his time. He published his own books as well as those by authors such as [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Oliver Goldsmith]];&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;ref name="Rose, 219"&gt;Rose, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter may have written ''[[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes]]'', Newbery's most popular book.

Another philosopher who influenced the development of children's literature was [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argued that children should be allowed to develop naturally and joyously. His idea of appealing to a children's natural interests took hold among writers for children.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|41}} Popular examples included [[Thomas Day]]'s ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'', four volumes that embody Rousseau's theories. Furthermore, [[Maria Edgeworth|Maria]] and [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]]'s ''[[Practical Education]]: The History of Harry and Lucy'' (1780) urged children to teach themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Leader, Zachary, ''Reading Blake's Songs'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7Q9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau's ideas also had great influence in Germany, especially on [[Philanthropinum|German Philanthropism]], a movement concerned with reforming both education and literature for children. Its founder, [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]], authored ''Elementarwerk'' as a popular textbook for children that included many illustrations by [[Daniel Chodowiecki]]. Another follower, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], created an adaptation of ''Robinson Crusoe'' that went into over 100 printings. He became Germany's "outstanding and most modern"&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|736}} writer for children. According to Hans-Heino Ewers in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "It can be argued that from this time, the history of European children's literature was largely written in Germany."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|737}}

The [[Brothers Grimm]] preserved and published [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|the traditional tales]] told in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Silvey&gt;{{cite book|last=Silvey|first=Anita (editor)|title=The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators|year= 2002|publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]]|location= New York|isbn=0-618-19082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}} They were so popular in their home country that modern, realistic children's literature began to be looked down on there. This dislike of non-traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|739–740}} The Grimms's contribution to children's literature goes beyond their collection of stories, as great as that is. As professors, they had a scholarly interest in the stories, striving to preserve them and their variations accurately, recording their sources.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|259}} 

A similar project was carried out by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] scholars [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], who collected Norwegian fairy tales and published them as ''[[Norwegian Folktales]]'', often referred to as ''Asbjørnsen and Moe''. By compiling these stories, they preserved Norway's literary heritage and helped create the Norwegian written language.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|260}}

Danish author and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]] traveled through Europe and gathered many well-known fairy tales and created new stories in the fairy tale genre.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Elias Bredsdorff, ''Hans Christian Andersen: the story of his life and work 1805–75'', Phaidon (1975) {{ISBN|0-7148-1636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Switzerland]], [[Johann David Wyss]] published ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1812, with the aim of teaching children about family values, good husbandry, the uses of the natural world and self-reliance. The book became popular across Europe after it was translated into French by [[Isabelle de Montolieu]].

[[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s tale "[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]" was published in 1816 in a German collection of stories for children, ''Kinder-Märchen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nutcracker|last=Hoffmann|first=E.

=== Golden age ===
The shift to a modern genre of children's literature occurred in the mid-19th century; [[didacticism]] of a previous age began to make way for more humorous, child-oriented books, more attuned to the child's imagination. The availability of children's literature greatly increased as well, as paper and [[printing]] became widely available and affordable, the population grew and literacy rates improved.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|654–655}}

''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' by [[Thomas Hughes]] appeared in 1857, and is considered to be the founding book in the [[school story]] tradition.&lt;ref name=knowles&gt;{{cite book|last= Knowles|first= Murray|title= Language and Control in Children's Literature|year= 1996|publisher= [[Psychology Press]]| url=https://books.google.com/?id=2mh6pCDCZ5EC&amp;pg=PP7|isbn= 978-0-203-41975-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}} However, it was [[Lewis Carroll]]'s fantasy, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', published in 1865 in England, that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first "English masterpiece written for children"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|44}} and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the "First Golden Age" of children's literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=knowles /&gt;{{rp|18}} Another important book of that decade was ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby]]'', by Reverend [[Charles Kingsley]] (1862), which became extremely popular in England, and remains a classic of British children's literature.

In 1883, [[Carlo Collodi]] wrote the first Italian fantasy novel, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', which was translated many times. In that same year, [[Emilio Salgari]], the man who would become "the adventure writer par excellence for the young in Italy"&lt;ref&gt;Lawson Lucas, A. (1995) "The Archetypal Adventures of Emilio Salgari: A Panorama of his Universe and Cultural Connections New Comparison", ''A Journal of Comparative and General Literary Studies'', Number 20 Autumn&lt;/ref&gt; first published his legendary character ''[[Sandokan]]''. In Britain, ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Princess and Curdie]]'', by [[George MacDonald]], appeared in 1872 and 1883, and the adventure stories ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'', both by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], were extremely popular in the 1880s. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' was first published in 1894, and [[J. M. Barrie]] told the story of [[Peter Pan]] in the novel  ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' in 1911. [[Johanna Spyri]]'s two-part novel ''[[Heidi]]'' was published in Switzerland in 1880 and 1881.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|749}} In the US, children's publishing entered a period of growth after the [[American Civil War]] in 1865. Boys' book writer [[William Taylor Adams|Oliver Optic]] published over 100 books. In 1868, the "epoch-making book"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|45}} ''[[Little Women]]'', the fictionalized autobiography of [[Louisa May Alcott]], was published. This "[[coming of age]]" story established the genre of realistic family books in the United States. [[Mark Twain]] released ''[[Tom Sawyer]]'' in 1876, and in 1880 another bestseller, ''[[Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings]]'', a collection of [[African American]] folk tales adapted and compiled by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|478}}

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a plethora of children's novels began featuring realistic, non-magical plotlines. Certain titles received international success such as Robert Louis Stevenson's ''Treasure Island'' (1883), L.M. Montgomery's ''Anne of Green Gables'' (1908), and Louisa May Alcott's ''Little Women'' (1869) &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
The Chinese [[Revolution of 1911]] and [[World War II]] brought political and social change that revolutionized children's literature in China. Western science, technology, and literature became fashionable. China's first modern publishing firm, [[Commercial Press]], established several children's magazines, which included ''Youth Magazine'', and ''Educational Pictures for Children''.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|832–833}} The first Chinese children's writer was [[Sun Yuxiu]], an editor of Commercial Press, whose story ''The Kingdom Without a Cat'' was written in the language of the time instead of the classical style used previously. Yuxiu encouraged novelist [[Mao Dun|Shen Dehong]] to write for children as well. Dehong went on to rewrite 28 stories based on classical Chinese literature specifically for children. In 1932, [[Zhang Tianyi]] published ''Big Lin and Little Lin'', the first full-length Chinese novel for children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|833–834}}

The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution of 1949]] changed children's literature again. Many children's writers were denounced, but Tianyi and [[Ye Shengtao]] continued to write for children and created works that aligned with [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideology. The 1976 death of [[Mao Zedong]] provoked more changes that swept China. Many writers from the early part of the century were brought back, and their work became available again. In 1990, ''General Anthology of Modern Children's Literature of China'', a fifteen-volume anthology of children's literature since the 1920s, was released.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|834–835}}

Literature for children developed as a separate category of literature especially in the [[Victorian era]]. Some works became internationally known, such as those of [[Lewis Carroll]], ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. At the end of the Victorian era and leading into the Edwardian era, [[Beatrix Potter]] was an author and illustrator, best known for her children's books, which featured animal characters. In her thirties, Potter published ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' in 1902. Potter eventually went on to publish 23 children's books and become a wealthy woman. Michael O. Tunnell and James S. Jacobs, professors of children’s literature at Brigham Young University, write, "Potter was the first to use pictures as well as words to tell the story, incorporating coloured illustration with text, page for page."&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tunnell|first=Michael O.|last2=Jacobs|first2=James S.|date=2013-10-01|title=The Origins and History of American Children's Literature|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/TRTR.1201/abstract|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=80–86|doi=10.1002/TRTR.1201|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another classic of the period is [[Anna Sewell]]'s animal novel ''[[Black Beauty]]'' (1877).

In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by English illustrators [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], and [[Kate Greenaway]]. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children's books; among them were [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Cicely Mary Barker]], [[W. Heath Robinson]], [[Henry Justice Ford|Henry J. Ford]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], and [[George Cruikshank]].

The [[Kailyard school]] of Scottish writers, notably [[J. M. Barrie]], creator of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, [[Kenneth Grahame]] wrote the children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' and the [[Scouts]] founder [[Robert Baden-Powell]]'s first book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' was published. Inspiration for [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s novel ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' (1910) was the [[Great Maytham Hall]] Garden in Kent. In 1920 [[Hugh Lofting]] created the character [[Doctor Dolittle]] who appears in a series of [[Doctor Dolittle#The books|twelve books]].

The Golden Age of Children's Literature ended with [[World War I]] in Great Britain and Europe, and the period before [[World War II]] was much slower in children's publishing. The main exceptions in England were the publications of ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' by [[A. A. Milne]] in 1926, the first ''[[Mary Poppins]]'' book by [[P. L. Travers]] in 1934, ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in 1937, and the Arthurian novel ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' by [[T. H. White]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|978-0-203-16812-7}}, pp. 682-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's [[paperback]] books were first released in England in 1940 under the [[Puffin Books]] imprint, and their lower prices helped make book buying possible for children during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'', pp. 475-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enid Blyton]]'s books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into almost 90 languages. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]], [[The Famous Five (novel series)|The Famous Five]], [[The Secret Seven]], and [[The Adventure Series]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Sheila G. (1982), ''The Blyton Phenomenon''. Andre Deutsch, {{ISBN|978-0-233-97441-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these children's stories, ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'', was published in 1942.

In the 1950s, the book market in Europe began recovering from the effects of two world wars. An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "Inklings". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. C. S. Lewis published the first installment of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series in 1950 while Tolkien is best known in addition to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as the author of  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. (1954) Another significant writer of fantasy stories is [[Alan Garner]] author of ''[[Elidor]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Owl Service]]'' (1967). The latter work is an adaptation of the myth of [[Blodeuwedd]] from the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', set in modern [[Wales]], and for it Garner won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a British author.&lt;ref name=medal1967&gt;[http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 (Carnegie Winner 1967)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106194213/http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 |date=2013-01-06 }}.

[[Mary Norton (author)|Mary Norton]] wrote ''[[The Borrowers]]'' (1952), featuring tiny people who borrow from humans. [[Dodie Smith]]'s ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' was published in 1956. [[Philippa Pearce]]'s ''[[Tom's Midnight Garden]]'' (1958) has him opening the garden door at night and entering into a different age. The heroine of ''[[Charlotte Sometimes (novel)|Charlotte Sometimes]]'' by Penelope Farmer (1969) is already shaken by her arrival in a girls' boarding school when she finds herself waking as another girl in the same bed, but decades earlier. Closer to reality, Jenny in ''[[No One Must Know]]'' (1962) by [[Barbara Sleigh]] is a newcomer in the street who faces a landlord's pet ban. She needs urgent help from nearby children to hide her cat and kittens.

[[Roald Dahl]] rose to prominence with his children's [[fantasy novels]], often inspired from experiences from his childhood, with often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-man-who-liked-to-make-up-stories-2158052.html Once upon a time, there was a man who liked to make up stories ...] ''[[The Independent]]'' (Sunday, 12 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl was inspired to write ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964), featuring the eccentric candymaker [[Willy Wonka]], having grown up near two chocolate makers in England who often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies into the other's factory. His other works include ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1961), ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (1971), ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'' (1983), and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'' (1988). Starting in 1958, [[Michael Bond]] published humorous stories about [[Paddington Bear]].

==== Adventure fiction for children ====
Adventure stories written specifically for children began in the 19th century. Early examples include [[Johann David Wyss]]' ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1812), [[Frederick Marryat]]'s ''[[The Children of the New Forest]]'' (1847) and [[Harriet Martineau]]'s ''The Peasant and the Prince'' (1856).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Hunt, Peter]]. (Editor). ''Children's literature: an illustrated history''. Oxford University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-212320-3}}  (pp.&amp;nbsp;98–100)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victorian era saw the development of the genre, with [[William Henry Giles Kingston|W.H.G. Kingston]], [[Robert Michael Ballantyne|R. M. Ballantyne]] and [[G. A. Henty]] specializing in the production of adventure fiction for boys.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Butts, Dennis,"Adventure Books" in [[Jack Zipes|Zipes, Jack]], ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature''. Volume One. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-514656-1}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–16).&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired writers who normally catered to adult audiences to write for children, and an example is [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s (1850–94) classic [[Piracy|pirate]] story ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883).&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In the years after the First World War, writers such as [[Arthur Ransome]]  (1884–1967) developed the adventure genre by setting the adventure in Britain rather than distant countries. Ransome began publishing in 1930 his [[Swallows and Amazons]] series of children's books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the English [[Lake District]] and the [[Norfolk Broads]]. Many of the books involve sailing; fishing and camping are other common subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Brogan, ''The Life of Arthur Ransome''. Jonathan Cape, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biggles]] was a popular series of [[adventure book]]s for young boys, about James Bigglesworth, a fictional pilot and [[adventurer]], by [[W. E. Johns]]. Biggles made his first appearance in the story ''The White Fokker'', published in the first issue of ''[[Light Aircraft Association|Popular Flying]]'' magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, ''The Camels Are Coming'' (both 1932). Johns continued to write Biggles books until his death in 1968, the series eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time. These included novels about a woman pilot in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF), Flight Officer Joan Worralson, better known as "[[Worrals]]".

[[Geoffrey Trease]] and [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 1995, (p.&amp;nbsp;208–9)&lt;/ref&gt; brought a new sophistication to the historical adventure novel.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; [[Philip Pullman]] in the [[Sally Lockhart]] novels and [[Julia Golding]] in the [[Cat Royal]] series have continued the tradition of the historical adventure.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

==== Magazines and comics ====
An important aspect of British children's literature has been [[comic books]] and [[List of early-20th-century British children's magazines and annuals|magazines]]. Amongst the most popular comics have been ''[[The Dandy]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-19284222 BBC News, 16 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Beano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/pixar/11766202/Was-Pixars-Inside-Out-inspired-by-The-Beano.html ''The Telegraph'', 27 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Important early magazines or [[story papers]] for older children were the ''[[Boys Own Paper]]'', which was published from 1879 to 1967&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data071.html#BOYSOWNMAGAZINEUK Galatic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Girl's Own Paper]]'' published from 1880 until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data207.html Galatic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; Other story papers for older boys were ''[[The Hotspur]]'' (1933 to 1959) and ''[[The Rover (story paper)|The Rover]]''–which started in 1922 and was absorbed into ''Adventure'' in 1961 and ''[[The Wizard (DC Comics)|The Wizard]]'' in 1963, and eventually folded in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishcomics.20m.com/home.htm British Comics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prominent authors contributed to the ''Boys Own Paper'': [[cricket]]er [[W.G. Grace]] wrote for several issues, along with authors [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Jules Verne]] and [[R.M. Ballantyne]], as well as [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the inspiration for the [[Scout Movement]], Between 1941–61 there was 60 issues with stories about [[Biggles]] by [[W. E. Johns]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boysown.info/|title=Boys Own Paper featuring the work of Captain W E Johns|last=rogerharris@biggles.info|website=www.boysown.info|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1960s occasional contributors included [[Isaac Asimov]] and the respected astronomer [[Patrick Moore]].

Many contributors to ''The Girls Own Paper'' were not known outside the paper's pages but they also included [[Noel Streatfeild]], [[Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd]], [[Rosa Nouchette Carey]], [[Sarah Doudney]] (1841–1926), [[Angela Brazil]], [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]], [[Richmal Crompton]], [[Fanny Fern]], and [[Baroness Orczy]]. Between 1940–47 [[Captain W. E. Johns]] contributed sixty stories featuring the female pilot [[Worrals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.girlsown.info|title=Girls Own Paper featuring the work of Captain W E Johns|last=rogerharris@biggles.info|website=www.girlsown.info|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Eagle (British comics)|Eagle]]'' was a popular British comic for boys, launched in 1950 by [[Marcus Morris (publisher)|Marcus Morris]], an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sabin, ''Adult comics: an introduction'' (illustrated ed.), London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1993, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science museum"&gt;{{Citation | title = Dan Dare and the Birth of Hi-Tech Britain | url = http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/dan_dare.aspx | publisher = sciencemuseum.org.uk | accessdate = 19 June 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100721103622/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/dan_dare.aspx | archivedate = 21 July 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, "[[Dan Dare]], Pilot of the Future", created with meticulous attention to detail.&lt;ref name="ODNB Hampson"&gt;{{Citation | last = Varah | first = Chad | authorlink = Chad Varah | title = Hampson, Frank (1918–1985) | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31192 | accessdate = 16 June 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/31192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribute"&gt;{{Citation | title = A Tribute to Frank Hampson 1918–1985 | url = http://www.tameside.gov.uk/blueplaque/frankhampson | publisher = tameside.gov.uk | date = 12 September 2007 | accessdate = 24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times Hampson"&gt;{{Citation | last = Crompton | first = Alastair | title = Where Eagle dared | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/598/936/79880174w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS201560409&amp;dyn=5!xrn_10_0_CS201560409&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | publisher = ''The Times'', hosted at infotrac.galegroup.com | date = 25 October 1985 | page = 12 | issue = 62278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular stories included "Riders of the Range" and "P.C. 49".

Children's literature has been a part of American culture since Europeans first settled in America. The earliest books were used as tools to instill self-control in children and preach a life of morality in Puritan society. 18th-century American youth began to shift away from the social upbringing of its European counterpart, bringing about a change in children's literature. It was in this time that ''A Little Book for Little Children'' was written by T.W. in 1712. It includes what is thought to be the earliest nursery rhyme and one of the earliest examples of a text book approaching education from the child's point of view, rather than the adult's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bingham|author2=Scholt|title=Fifteen Centuries of Children's Literature|date=1980|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-22164-2|pages=99,107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous books of American children's literature is [[L. Frank Baum]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', published in 1900. "By combining the English fondness for word play with the American appetite for outdoor adventure", Connie Epstein in ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'' says Baum "developed an original style and form that stands alone".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479}} Baum wrote fourteen more Oz novels, and other writers continued the [[List of Oz books|Oz series]] into the twenty-first century.

Demand continued to grow in [[North America]] between World War I and World War II, helped by the growth of libraries in both Canada and the United States. Children's reading rooms in libraries, staffed by specially trained librarians, helped create demand for classic juvenile books. Reviews of children's releases began appearing regularly in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and in ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' magazine began to regularly publish reviews of children's releases, and the first Children's Book Week was launched in 1919. In that same year, [[Louise Seaman Bechtel]] became the first person to head a juvenile book publishing department in the country. She was followed by [[May Massee]] in 1922, and [[Alice Dalgliesh]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479–480}}

The [[American Library Association]] began awarding the [[Newbery Medal]], the first children's book award, in 1922.&lt;ref name=newbery&gt;{{cite web|title=Newbery Awards|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caldecott Medal]] for illustration followed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caldecott Medal Awards |url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/caldecottmedal#30s |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] about her life on the [[American frontier]], ''[[Little House in the Big Woods]]'' appeared in 1932.&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|471}} In 1937 [[Theodor Seuss Geisel|Dr. Seuss]] published his first book, entitled, ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]''. The [[young adult book]] market developed during this period, thanks to sports books by popular writer [[John R. Tunis]]', the novel ''[[Seventeenth Summer]]'' by [[Maureen Daly]], and the ''[[Sue Barton (juvenile series)|Sue Barton]]'' nurse book series by [[Helen Dore Boylston]].&lt;ref name=cart&gt;{{cite book|last=Cart|first=Michael|title=Young Adult Literature: From Romance to Realism|year=2010|publisher=[[ALA Editions]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4RJ8rOTTgC|isbn=978-0-8389-1045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

The already vigorous growth in children's books became a boom in the 1950s, and children's publishing became big business.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} In 1952, American journalist [[E. B. White]] published ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', which was described as "one of the very few books for young children that face, squarely, the subject of death".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|467}} [[Maurice Sendak]] illustrated more than two dozen books during the decade, which established him as an innovator in book illustration.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] that began in 1957, provided increased interest and government money for schools and libraries to buy science and math books and the non-fiction book market "seemed to materialize overnight".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|482}}

The 1960s saw an age of new realism in children's books emerge. Given the atmosphere of social revolution in 1960s America, authors and illustrators began to break previously established taboos in children's literature. Controversial subjects dealing with alcoholism, death, divorce, and child abuse were now being published in stories for children. Maurice Sendak's ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' in 1963 and [[Louise Fitzhugh]]'s ''[[Harriet the Spy]]'' in 1964 are often considered the first stories published in this new age of realism.&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86" /&gt;

[[Esther Forbes]] in ''[[Johnny Tremain]]'' (1943) and [[Mildred D. Taylor]] in ''[[Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry]]'' (1976) continued the tradition of the historical adventure in an American setting.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; The modern children's adventure novel sometimes deals with controversial issues like terrorism, as in [[Robert Cormier]]'s ''[[After the First Death]]'' in 1979, and warfare in the [[Third World]], as in [[Peter Dickinson]]'s ''AK'' in 1990.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In books for a younger age group, Bill Martin and John Archambault's ''[[Chicka Chicka Boom Boom]]'' (1979) presented a new spin on the [[alphabet book]]. [[Laura Numeroff]] published ''[[If You Give a Mouse a Cookie]]'' in 1985 and went on to create a series of similarly named books that is still popular for children and adults to read together.

[[Lloyd Alexander]]'s [[The Chronicles of Prydain]] (1964-1968) was set in a fictionalized version of medieval Britain.

=== Continental Europe ===
The period from 1890 until [[World War I]] is considered the Golden Age of Children's Literature in [[Scandinavia]]. [[Erik Werenskiold]], [[Theodor Kittelsen]], and [[Dikken Zwilgmeyer]] were especially popular, writing folk and fairy tales as well as realistic fiction. The 1859 translation into English by [[George Webbe Dasent]] helped increase the stories' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 705,&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential and internationally most successful Scandinavian children's books from this period is [[Selma Lagerlöf]]s ''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]''. [[Astrid Lindgren]] (''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'') and [[Jostein Gaarder]] (''[[Sophie's World]]'') are two of the best-known Scandinavian writers internationally.

The interwar period saw a slow-down in output similar to Britain, although "one of the first mysteries written specifically for children," ''[[Emil and the Detectives]]'' by [[Erich Kästner]], was published in Germany in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Silvey, (editor) (2002). ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators''. New York: Houghton Mifflin, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;  German writers [[Michael Ende]] (''[[The Neverending Story]]'') and [[Cornelia Funke]] (''[[Inkheart]]'') achieved international success with their fantasy books.

The period during and following World War II became the Classical Age of the picture book in Switzerland, with works by [[Alois Carigiet]], [[Felix Hoffmann (illustrator)|Felix Hoffmann]], and [[Hans Fischer (painter)|Hans Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. pp. 683–685, 399, 692, 697, 750.&lt;/ref&gt; 1963 was the first year of the [[Bologna Children's Book Fair]] in Italy, which was described as "the most important international event dedicated to the children's publishing".&lt;ref name=bologna&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy {{!}} Bologna Children's Book Fair|url=http://culture360.org/event/italy-bologna-childrens-book-fair/|publisher=Culture360|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For four days it brings together writers, illustrators, publishers, and book buyers from around the world.&lt;ref name=bologna /&gt;

Swiss author Marcus Pfister's ''[[Rainbow Fish]]'' series has received international acclaim since 1992.

[[File:Stamp-russia2010-children-books-block.png|thumb|Postal stamp of Russia celebrating children's books.]]

[[Russian folktale]]s were collected by [[Aleksandr Afanasyev]] in his three volume ''Narodnye russkie skazki'', and a selection of these were published in ''Русские детские сказки'' (Russian Children's Fairy Tales) in 1871. By the 1860s, [[literary realism]] and non-fiction dominated children's literature. More schools were started, using books by writers like [[Konstantin Ushinsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose ''Russian Reader'' included an assortment of stories, fairy tales, and fables. Books written specifically for girls developed in the 1870s and 1880s. Publisher and journalist [[Evgenia Tur]] wrote about the daughters of well-to-do landowners, while [[Alexandra Nikitichna Annenskaya]]'s stories told of middle-class girls working to support themselves. [[Vera Zhelikhovsky]], [[Elizaveta Kondrashova]], and [[Nadezhda Lukhmanova]] also wrote for girls during this period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|767}}

Children's non-fiction gained great importance in Russia at the beginning of the century. A ten-volume children's encyclopedia was published between 1913 and 1914. [[Vasily Avenarius]] wrote fictionalized biographies of important people like [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Alexander Pushkin]] around the same time, and scientists wrote for books and magazines for children. Children's magazines flourished, and by the end of the century there were 61. [[Lidia Charskaya]] and {{ill|Klavdiya Lukashevich|ru|Лукашевич, Клавдия Владимировна}} continued the popularity of girls' fiction. [[Realism (literature)|Realism]] took a gloomy turn by frequently showing the maltreatment of children from lower classes. The most popular boys' material was [[Sherlock Holmes]], and similar stories from detective magazines.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|768}}

The state took control of children's literature during the [[October Revolution]]. [[Maksim Gorky]] edited the first children's, ''Northern Lights'', under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. People often label the 1920s as the Golden Age of Children's Literature in Russia.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|769}} [[Samuil Marshak]] led that literary decade as the "founder of (Soviet) children's literature".&lt;ref name=shray&gt;{{cite book|last=Shrayer|first=Maxim (editor)|title=An Anthology of Jewish-Russian Literature: 1801–1953|year=2007|publisher=[[M.

In 1932, professional writers in the Soviet Union formed the [[USSR Union of Writers]], which served as the writer's organization of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. With a children's branch, the official oversight of the professional organization brought children's writers under the control of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|state]] and the police. [[Communism|Communist principles]] like [[Common ownership|collectivism]] and [[solidarity]] became important themes in children's literature. Authors wrote biographies about revolutionaries like [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Pavlik Morozov]]. [[Alexander Belyayev]], who wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, became Russia's first [[science fiction]] writer.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|770}} According to Ben Hellman in the ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "war was to occupy a prominent place in juvenile reading, partly compensating for the lack of adventure stories", during the Soviet Period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|771}} More political changes in Russia after [[World War II]] brought further change in children's literature. Today, the field is in a state of flux because some older authors are being rediscovered and others are being abandoned.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|772}}

In Brazil, [[Monteiro Lobato]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lobato.globo.com/ MONTEIRO LOBATO]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a series of 23 books for children known as [[Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series)|Sítio do Picapau Amarelo]] (The Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), between 1920 and 1940. The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as [[C. S. Lewis]], [[The Chronicles of Narnia]] and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]] series.{{according to whom|date=January 2017}} The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 short story "A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado", and was later republished as the first chapter of "Reinações de Narizinho", which is the first novel of the series.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The main setting is the "Sítio do Picapau Amarelo", where a boy (Pedrinho), a girl (Narizinho) and their living and thinking anthropomorphic toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning. On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as [[Neverland]], the mythological [[Ancient Greece]], an underwater world known as "Reino das Águas Claras" (Clear Waters Kingdom), and even the outer space. The "Sítio" is often symbolized by the character of [[Emilia (Sítio do Picapau Amarelo)|Emília]], Lobato's most famous creation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Christian missionaries]] first established the [[Calcutta School-Book Society]] in the 19th century, creating a separate genre for children's literature in that country. Magazines and books for children in native languages soon appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|808}} In the latter half of the century, [[Raja Shivprasad]] wrote several well-known books in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|810}} A number of respected [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writers began producing [[Bengali literature]] for children including [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], who translated some stories and wrote others himself. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote plays, stories, and poems for children, including one work illustrated by painter [[Nandalal Bose]]. They worked from the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th century. Tagore's work was later translated into English, with Bose's pictures.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811}} [[Behari Lal Puri]] was the earliest writer for children in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. His stories were [[Didacticism|didactic]] in nature.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|815}}

The first full-length children's book was ''Khar Khar Mahadev'' by [[Narain Dixit]], which was serialized in one of the popular children's magazines in 1957. Other writers include [[Premchand]], and poet [[Sohan Lal Dwivedi]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811}} In 1919, [[Sukumar Ray]] wrote and illustrated [[Nonsense verse|nonsense rhymes]] in the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language, and children's writer and artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]] finished ''Barngtarbratn''. Bengali children's literature flourished in the later part of the twentieth century. Educator [[Gijubhai Badheka]] published over 200 books in the [[Children's literature in Gujarati language]], and many of them are still popular.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|812}} Other popular Gujarati children's authors were [[Ramanlal Soni]] and [[Jivram Joshi]]. In 1957, political cartoonist [[K. Shankar Pillai]] founded the [[Children's Book Trust]] publishing company. The firm became known for high quality children's books, and many of them were released in several languages. One of the most distinguished writers is Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] in [[Oriya literature]], who wrote many good books for children, including ''Pari Raija'', ''Kuhuka Raija'', ''Panchatantra'', and ''Adi Jugara Galpa Mala''. He wrote biographies of many historical personalities, such as ''Kapila Deva''. In 1978, the firm organized a writers' competition to encourage quality children's writing. The following year, the Children's Book Trust began a writing workshop and organized the First International Children's Book Fair in [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|809}} Children's magazines, available in many languages, were widespread throughout India during this century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811–820}}

{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
Originally, for centuries, stories were told by Africans in their native languages, many being told during social gatherings. Stories varied between mythic narratives dealing with creation and basic proverbs showcasing human wisdom. These narratives were passed down from generation to generation orally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shafii|first1=Zainab|title=Aesthetics of Children’s Literature in Nigeria: a Study of Selected Books|url=http://kubanni.abu.edu.ng:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/7940/1/AESTHETICS%20OF%20CHILDREN%E2%80%99S%20LITERATURE%20IN%20NIGERIA%20A%20STUDY%20OF%20SELECTED%20BOOKS.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805183328/http://kubanni.abu.edu.ng:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/7940/1/AESTHETICS%20OF%20CHILDREN%E2%80%99S%20LITERATURE%20IN%20NIGERIA%20A%20STUDY%20OF%20SELECTED%20BOOKS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2017|publisher=Zainab Shafii|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its Independence in 1960, Nigeria has witnessed a rise in the production of children's literature by its people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Umer|first1=Marie Linton|title=Children’s Literature in Nigeria Revolutionary Omissions|date=1997|pages=191–206|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18757421-90000224|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the past three decades contributing the most to the genre. Most children's books depict the African culture and lifestyle, and trace their roots to traditional folktales, riddles, and proverbs. Authors who have produced such works include [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Cyprian Ekwensi]], [[Amos Tutuola]], [[Flora Nwapa]], and [[Buchi Emecheta]]. Publishing companies also aided in the development of children's literature.

== Classification ==
Children's literature can be divided into categories, either according to [[Literary genre|genre]] or the intended age of the reader.
[[File:The return of Rama.jpg|thumb|A [[Abanindranath Tagore|Tagore]] illustration of a Hindu myth]]

=== By genre ===
A literary genre is a category of literary compositions. Genres may be determined by technique, tone, content, or length.  According to Anderson,&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson 2006&lt;/ref&gt; there are six categories of children's literature (with some significant subgenres):
* [[Picture books]], including concept books that teach the [[alphabet]] or [[counting]] for example, pattern books, and wordless books.
* [[Literature|Traditional literature]], including folktales, which convey the legends, customs, superstitions, and beliefs of people in previous civilizations. This genre can be further broken into subgenres: [[myth]]s, [[fable]]s, [[legend]]s, and [[fairy tale]]s
* [[Fiction]], including [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]], [[Literary realism|realistic fiction]], and [[historical fiction]]
* [[Non-fiction]]
* [[Biography]] and [[autobiography]]
* [[Poetry]] and verse.

=== By age category ===
The criteria for these divisions are vague, and books near a borderline may be classified either way. Books for younger children tend to be written in simple language, use large print, and have many illustrations. Books for older children use increasingly complex language, normal print, and fewer (if any) illustrations. The categories with an age range are listed below:
* [[Picture book]]s, appropriate for pre-readers or children ages 0–5.
* [[Early reader]] books, [[appropriate for children]] ages 5–7.  These books are often designed to help a child build his or her reading skills.
* [[Chapter book]]s, appropriate for children ages 7–12.
** Short chapter books, appropriate for children ages 7–9.
** Longer chapter books, appropriate for children ages 9–12.
* [[Young adult fiction]], appropriate for children ages 12–18.

== Illustration ==
[[File:orbispictus.JPG|thumb|A late 18th-century reprint of ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' by [[Comenius]], the first children's picture book.]]

Pictures have always accompanied children's stories.&lt;ref name=lerer&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerer|first=Seth|title=Children's Literature: A Reader's History, from Aesop to Harry Potter|year=2008|publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320}} A [[papyrus]] from [[Diocese of Egypt (Late Antiquity)|Byzantine Egypt]], shows illustrations accompanied by the story of [[Hercules]]' labors.&lt;ref&gt;Cribiore, Raffaella, ''Gymnastics of the Mind'', pg. 139 [[Princeton University]], 2001, cited in Lerer, Seth, ''Children's Literature'', pg. 22, [[University of Chicago]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern children's books are [[illustration|illustrated]] in a way that is rarely seen in adult literature, except in [[graphic novel]]s. Generally, artwork plays a greater role in books intended for younger readers (especially pre-literate children). Children's picture books often serve as an accessible source of high quality art for young children. Even after children learn to read well enough to enjoy a story without illustrations, they continue to appreciate the occasional drawings found in chapter books.

According to Joyce Whalley in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "an illustrated book differs from a book with [[illustration]]s in that a good illustrated book is one where the pictures enhance or add depth to the text."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|221}} Using this definition, the first illustrated children's book is considered to be ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' which was published in 1658 by the [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravian]] author [[Comenius]]. Acting as a kind of encyclopedia,''Orbis Pictus'' had a picture on every page, followed by the name of the object in [[Latin]] and German. It was translated into English in 1659 and was used in homes and schools around Europe and Great Britain for years.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|220}}

Early children's books, such as ''Orbis Pictus'', were illustrated by [[woodcut]], and many times the same image was repeated in a number of books regardless of how appropriate the illustration was for the story.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|322}} Newer processes, including copper and steel [[engraving]] were first used in the 1830s. One of the first uses of [[Chromolithography]] (a way of making multi-colored prints) in a children's book was demonstrated in ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', published in Germany in 1845. English illustrator [[Walter Crane]] refined its use in children's books in the late 19th century. [[File:Crane frog4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Crane]]'s [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]] illustration for ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]'', 1874.]]

Another method of creating illustrations for children's books was [[etching]], used by [[George Cruikshank]] in the 1850s. By the 1860s, top artists were illustrating for children, including Crane, [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Kate Greenaway]], and [[John Tenniel]]. Most pictures were still black-and-white, and many color pictures were hand colored, often by children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–226}} ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators'' credits Caldecott with "The concept of extending the meaning of text beyond literal visualization".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|350}}

Twentieth-century artists such as [[Kay Nielson]], [[Edmund Dulac]], and [[Arthur Rackham]] produced illustrations that are still reprinted today.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–227}} Developments in printing capabilities were reflected in children's books. After World War II, [[Offset printing|offset lithography]] became more refined, and painter-style illustrations, such as [[Brian Wildsmith]]'s were common by the 1950s.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|233}}

== Scholarship ==
Professional organizations, dedicated publications, individual researchers and university courses conduct scholarship on children's literature. Scholarship in children's literature is primarily conducted in three different disciplinary fields: literary studies/cultural studies (literature and language departments and humanities), library and information science, and education. (Wolf, et al., 2011).

Typically, children's literature scholars from literature departments in universities (English, German, Spanish, etc. departments), cultural studies, or in the humanities conduct literary analysis of books. This [[literary criticism]] may focus on an author, a thematic or topical concern, genre, period, or literary device and may address issues from a variety of critical stances (poststructural, postcolonial, New Criticism, psychoanalytic, new historicism, etc.). Results of this type of research are typically published as books or as articles in scholarly journals.

The field of Library and Information Science has a long history of conducting research related to children's literature.

Most educational researchers studying children's literature explore issues related to the use of children's literature in classroom settings.  They may also study topics such as home use, children's out-of-school reading, or parents' use of children's books. Teachers typically use children's literature to augment classroom instruction.

The academic journal ''Children’s Literature Review'' provides critical analysis of many well known children’s books. In its 114th volume, the journal discuses the cultural stereotypes in Belgian cartoonist [[Herge]]’s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' series in reference to its depiction of people from the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Tintin|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=114|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the scramble for Africa which occurred between the years of 1881 and 1914 there was a large production of children's literature which attempted to create an illusion of what life was like for those who lived on the African continent. This was a simple technique in deceiving those who only relied on stories and secondary resources. Resulting in a new age of books which put a “gloss” on imperialism and its teachings at the time. Thus encouraging the idea that the colonies who were part of the African continent were perceived as animals, savages and un human like. Therefor needing cultured higher class Europeans to share their knowledge and resources with the locals. Also promoting the idea that the people within these places were as exotic as the locations themselves.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Examples of these books include:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Lou lou chez les negres (1929) - lou lou among the blacks
* Baba Diène et Morceau de sucre (1939)

The picture book ''[[The Snowy Day]]'', written and illustrated by [[Ezra Jack Keats]] was published in 1962 and is known as the first picture book to portray an African-American child as a protagonist.

Writer Mary Renck Jalongo In ''Young Children and Picture Books'' discusses damaging stereotypes of [[Native Americans in children's literature]], stating repeated depictions of indigenous people as living in the 1800s with feathers and face paint cause children to mistake them as fictional and not as people that still exist today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jalongo|first1=Mary Renck|title=Young Children and Picture Books|date=2004|publisher=National Association for the Education of Young Children|location=Washington, DC|page=39|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depictions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people in [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]’s ''[[Little House on the Prairie]]'' and [[J.M. Barrie]]’s ''[[Peter Pan]]'' are widely discussed among critics. Wilder’s novel, based on her childhood in America’s midwest in the late 1800s, portrays Native Americans as racialized stereotypes and has been banned in some classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Laura Ingalls Wilder 1867–1957|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=111|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay, ''Somewhere Outside the Forest: Ecological Ambivalence in Neverland from The Little White Bird to Hook'', writer M.

=== The Empire, imperialism and colonialism ===

The presence of [[empire]] as well as pro-colonialist and [[imperialist]] themes in children’s literature have been identified in some of the most well known children’s classics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siecle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Deborah Cogan|last2=Webb|first2=Jean|title=Introducing Children's Literature: From Romanticism to Postmodernism.

In the French illustrator [[Jean de Brunhoff]]’s 1931 picture book ''Histoire de Babar, le petit elephant (The Story of [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]], The Little Elephant)'', prominent themes of [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] have been noted and identified as propaganda. An allegory for French colonialism, Babar easily assimilates himself into the bourgeois lifestyle. It is a world where the elephants who have adapted themselves dominate the animals who have not yet been assimilated into the new and powerful civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Babar|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=116|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WIELAND|first1=RAOUL|title=Babar The Elephant – Racism, Sexism, and Privilege in Children’s Storie|url=http://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/babar-the-elephant-racism-sexism-and-privilege-hesaid/|website=The Good Men Project|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|title=Freeing the Elephants: What Babar brought.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/09/22/freeing-the-elephants|website=The New Yorker|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. A. Rey]] and [[Margret Rey]]’s ''[[Curious George]]'' first published in 1941 has been criticized for its blatant slave and colonialist narratives. Critics claim the man with the yellow hat represents a colonialist poacher of European descent who kidnaps George, a monkey from Africa, and sends him on a ship to America. Details such as the man in colonialist uniform and Curious George's lack of tail are points in this argument. In an article, ''The Wall Street Journal'' interprets it as a "barely disguised slave narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=John J.|title=Curious George's Journey to the Big Scree|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113883544357862588|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munson|first1=Kyle|title=Does monkey tale speak of slavery?|url=http://archive.desmoinesregister.com/article/20060210/LIFE01/602100343/Munson-Does-monkey-tale-speak-slavery-|website=The Des Moines Register|publisher=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=8 December 2015|df=}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peacock|first1=Scot|last2=Marion|first2=Allison|title=Margret and H.

=== Gender roles and representation of women ===
Some of the earliest children’s stories that contain feminist themes are [[Louisa May Alcott]]’s ''[[Little Women]]'' and [[Frank L. Baum]]’s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. With many women of this period being represented in children’s books as doing housework, these two books deviated from this pattern. Drawing attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of the earliest forms of the feminist movement. ''Little Women'', a story about four sisters, is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature. The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement. It has been suggested that the feminist themes in ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' result from influence of Baum's mother-in law, [[Matilda Gage]], an important figure in the [[suffragist]] movement. Baum's significant political commentary on capitalism, and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage's influence. Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist, [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] who is punished by being made to do housework. Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author [[Tove Jansson]]'s [[Moomin]] series which features strong and individualized female characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=18–20, 25–45 &amp; 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a surge in the production and availability of [[feminist children's literature]] as well as a rise in [[gender neutrality]] in children's literature.

In addition to perpetuating stereotypes about appropriate behavior and occupations for women and girls, children's books frequently lack female characters entirely, or include them only as minor or unimportant characters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the book ''Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics'', scholar [[Alison Lurie]] says most adventure novels of the 20th century, with few exceptions, contain boy protagonists while female characters in books such as those by [[Dr. Seuss]], would typically be assigned the gender-specific roles of receptionists and nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=43 &amp; 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' characters written by [[A. A. Milne]], are primarily male, with the exception of the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]], who is a mother to [[Roo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even animals and inanimate objects are usually identified as being male in children's books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The near-absence of significant female characters is paradoxical because of the role of women in creating children's literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the one hand ''Growing up with Dick and Jane'' highlights the heterosexual, [[nuclear family]] and also points out the gender-specific duties of the mother, father, brother and sister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kismaric|first1=Carole|last2=Heiferman|first2=Marvin|title=Growing up with Dick and Jane: Learning and Living the American Dream|date=1996|publisher=Collins San Francisco,|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Young Children and Picture Books'', on the other hand, encourages readers to avoid books with women who are portrayed as inactive and unsuccessful as well as intellectually inferior and subservient to their fellow male characters to avoid children’s books that have repressive and [[sexist]] stereotypes for women.&lt;ref name="Young Children and Picture Books" /&gt;

In her book ''Children’s Literature: From the fin de siècle to the new millennium'', professor Kimberley Reynolds claims gender division stayed in children's books prominently until the 1990s. She also says that [[capitalism]] encourages gender-specific marketing of books and toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, adventure stories have been identified as being for boys and domestic fiction intended for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Deborah Cogan|last2=Webb|first2=Jean|title=Introducing Children's Literature: From Romanticism to Postmodernism. London: Routledge|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publishers often believe that boys will not read stories about girls, but that girls will read stories about both boys and girls; therefore, a story that features male characters is expected to sell better.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Why are there so few girls in children’s books?|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2016-01-08|access-date = 2016-01-09|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Jennie|last = Yabroff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in appealing to boys is also seen in the Caldecott awards, which tend to be presented to books that are believed to appeal to boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reynolds also says that both boys and girls have been presented by limited representations of appropriate behaviour, identities and careers through the illustrations and text of children’s literature. She argues girls have traditionally been marketed books that prepare them for domestic jobs and motherhood. Conversely, boys are prepared for leadership roles and war.&lt;ref name="Northcote House"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 20th century, more than 5,000 children's picture books were published in the U.S; during that time, male characters outnumbered female characters by more than 3 to 2, and male animals outnumbered female animals by 3 to 1.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|last2=Fairchild|first2=Emily|last3=Grauerholz|first3=Liz|last4=Pescosolido|first4=Bernice A.|last5=Tope|first5=Daniel|date=31 March 2011|title=Gender in Twentieth-Century Children’s Books:  Patterns of Disparity in Titles and Central Characters|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243211398358|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|issn=0891-2432|lay-url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books|lay-source=Why are there so few girls in children's books?|lay-date=8 January 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No children's picture book that featured a protagonist with an identifiable gender contained only female characters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''I’m Glad I’m a Boy! I’m Glad I’m a Girl!'' (1970) by [[Whitney Darrow Jr.]] was criticized for its narrow depictions of careers for both boys and girls. The book informs the reader that boys are doctors, policemen, pilots, and Presidents while girls are nurses, meter maids, stewardesses and First Ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Popova|first1=Maria|title=I’m Glad I’m a Boy!

=== Debate over controversial content ===

A widely discussed and debated topic by critics and publishers in the children’s book industry is whether outdated and offensive content, specifically racial stereotypes, should be changed upon the printing of new editions. Some question if certain books should be banned&lt;ref name="Adios Barbie" /&gt; while others believe original content should remain but publishers should make additions that guide parents in conversations with their children about the problematic elements of the particular story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Kavitha|title=Are some children's classics unsuitable for kids?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/22/childrens-classics-unsuitable-kids|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marche|first1=Stephen|title=How to Read a Racist Book to Your Kids|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/magazine/how-to-read-a-racist-book-to-your-kids.html?_r=3|website=The New York Times Magazine|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see racist stereotypes as cultural artifacts that should be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Children’s Culture Reader'', scholar [[Henry Jenkins]] references [[Herbert Kohl]]’s essay ''Should We Burn Babar?'' which raises the debate whether children should be educated on how to think critically towards oppressive ideologies rather than ignore historical mistakes.

=== Effect on early childhood development ===

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'', uses [[psychoanalysis]] to examine the impact that [[fairy tales]] have on the developing child. Bettelheim states the unconscious mind of a child is affected by the ideas behind a story, which shape their perception and guides their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bettelheim|first1=Bruno|title=The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=United States|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, author and illustrator [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]] contends the early viewing of an image in a [[picture book]] leaves an important and lasting impression on a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, a child’s most crucial individual characteristics are developed in their first five years.

[[Image:Modern Credenza.JPG|thumb|right|Modern built-in or fitted credenza]]

A '''credenza''' is [[US English]] term for a [[dining room]] [[sideboard]] cupboard, particularly one where a central cupboard is flanked by [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]] glass [[display cabinet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/credenza?show=0&amp;t=1390947700  Merriam-Webster Online: ''Credenza'': "a sideboard, buffet, or bookcase patterned after a Renaissance CREDENCE; especially:  one without legs"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Credenza'' is in the March 2014 online update of the ''[[OED]]'' as "A sideboard, free-standing cupboard, or storage chest, orig. Italian or of Italian style", expanding the 1989 print edition's "A sideboard". It also appears in ''OED'' as ''Credence'', as well as in John Gloag, ''A Short Dictionary of Furniture'' (London, 1977), where ''Credence'' is described as "a small [[Side table|side-table]] for vessels, used as a serving table", noting 16th-century usage and quoting [[John Britton (antiquary)|John Britton]], ''A Dictionary of the Art and Archaeology of the Middle Ages'' 1838: "a shelf-like projection placed across a piscina, or within a [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] as a place for sacred vessels used at [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]; also a [[buffet]] or [[sideboard]] for plate".&lt;/ref&gt; and usually made of [[wikt:burnish|burnish]]ed and polished wood and decorated with [[marquetry]]. The top would often be made of marble, or another decorative liquid- and heat-resistant stone.

The credenza started as a rough table with a cloth draped over it. In early 14th century of Italy, it took on an architectural form with column and pilaster decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Payne |editor1-first=Christopher |title=Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Furniture |date=1989 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=9780060161415 |page=24 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, a credenza is more often a type of [[sideboard]] used in the home or [[restaurant]]. In dining rooms, it is typically made from [[wood]] and used as a platform to serve [[buffet]] meals. In restaurant kitchens, made from [[stainless steel]], it provides a side surface and storage cupboards.

==Etymology==
Originally in Italian the name meant ''belief'' or ''trust'' (etymologically connected to the English word "credence"). In the 16th century the act of ''credenza'' was the tasting of food and drinks by a [[Food taster|servant]] for a lord or other important person (such as the [[pope]] or a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]) in order to test for [[poison]]. The name may have passed then to the room where the act took place, then to the furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etimo.it/?term=credenza |title=Etimologia : credenza |work=Dizionario Etimologico Online |accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CriticalEssaysOrwell.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Secker &amp; Warburg]])]]
'''''Critical Essays''''' (1946) is a collection of wartime pieces by [[George Orwell]].  It covers a variety of topics in English literature, and also includes some pioneering studies of [[popular culture]].  It was acclaimed by critics, and Orwell himself thought it one of his most important books.

== Publication ==

In late 1944 Orwell, worrying about the ephemerality of magazine publication, began to collect a volume of his best essays.{{sfn|Rodden|Rossi|2012|p=70}}  The resulting collection appeared under the imprint of [[Harvill Secker|Secker &amp; Warburg]] on 14 February 1946, with a print-run of 3028 copies.  The following May a second impression of 5632 copies was issued, with some small corrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Davison |editor1-link=Peter Davison (professor) |title=Smothered Under Journalism: 1946 |accessdate=4 October 2013 |series=The Complete Works of George Orwell.

== Themes ==

The [[blurb]] to the first edition described some of the essays as being "among the very few attempts that have been made in England to study popular art seriously".  Orwell thought seemingly frivolous popular culture, such as crime fiction, [[Postcard#British seaside postcards|comic postcards]], and the [[Billy Bunter]] stories, to be worth studying for the light it throws on contemporary attitudes.{{sfn|Crick|1994}}  Applying this approach to the subjects considered in ''Critical Essays'' he tended to find that they showed the innovations of his own time to be harsh and unfeeling compared to the old-fashioned humanity of traditional popular forms.{{sfn|Meyers|1997|p=22}}
Another theme is that of literary style, which Orwell thought to be the inevitable result of its writer's world-view and the message he wanted to get across.  He considered the English language of the 1940s to be in a degenerate state, and held that political discourse was inevitably corrupted as a result.{{sfn|Crick|1994}}{{sfn|Rodden|Rossi|2012|p=70}}

== Critical reception ==

Orwell himself, writing before he had completed ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', said that he thought ''Critical Essays'' one of his three most important books, along with ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.{{sfn|Rodden|Rossi|2012|p=70}}  His contemporaries in the world of criticism also largely saw the book's merits.  The journalist [[T. R. Fyvel|Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'', acclaimed Orwell as "a national figure as a critic, satirist and political journalist", while disagreeing with Orwell's view that the [[Attlee ministry|Attlee government]] was uncommitted to the introduction a fully socialist society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rodden |first1=John |title=George Orwell: The Politics of Literary Reputation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-7ihMZgiRgC&amp;pg=PA307 |accessdate=6 October 2012 |year=2009 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Transaction |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |isbn=076580896X |page=307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Catholic paper ''[[The Tablet]]'' [[Evelyn Waugh]] predictably deplored Orwell's lack of religious feeling, but also wrote that the essays "represent at its best the new humanism of the common man", and that Orwell was "outstandingly the wisest" of the new critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giraldi |first1=William |date=11 August 2013 |title=Orwell: Sage of the Century |journal=New Republic |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/114254/george-orwell-life-letters-reviewed-william-giraldi |accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greene |first1=Donald |author1-link=Donald Greene |chapter=Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh – "Catholic novelists" |editor1-last=Meyers |editor1-first=Jeffrey |title=Graham Greene: A Revaluation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MbdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22orwell+is+outstandingly+the+wisest%22&amp;dq=%22orwell+is+outstandingly+the+wisest%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hWJ2UpHwHo2AhQe6kICwBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |publication-date=1990 |page=23 |isbn=0333458958 |accessdate=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Middleton Murry|Middleton Murry]], who likewise criticised Orwell's secularism, nevertheless called Orwell and [[Cyril Connolly]] the two most gifted critics of their generation.  [[V. S. Pritchett]] considered the essays "brilliant examples of political anthropology applied to literature by a non-conforming mind".  [[Eric Bentley]] saw the book as "a dirge for nineteenth-century liberalism", and, like [[Irving Howe]], thought it represented Orwell at his best.{{sfn|Meyers|1997|pp=23, 220}}  [[Edmund Wilson]], a critic to whom most others compared Orwell, called him "the only contemporary master" of sociological criticism, praising him for his courage in rejecting the reigning orthodoxies, and for "a prose style that is both downright and disciplined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Jeffrey |title=Edmund Wilson: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bhdAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA272 |location=London |publisher=Constable |publication-date=1995 |pages=272–273 |isbn=0395689937 |accessdate=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent survey of Orwell's work endorses his own high opinion of its importance, calling it "Orwell at his best", a book which "showed Orwell's talent for finding deep meaning in otherwise trivial matters",{{sfn|Rodden|Rossi|2012|p=70}} while [[Bernard Crick]] said that Orwell's essays "may well constitute his lasting claim to greatness as a writer".{{sfn|Crick|1994}}

==Plot==
{{main article|List of Digimon Fusion characters|List of Digimon Fusion episodes}}

===Season 1===
{{main article|Digimon Fusion (season 1)}}
Michael "Mikey" Kudo is a 7th grade boy with a need to help others. Mikey hears a mysterious voice and finds a dying Digimon named Shoutmon in a nearby alley. Mikey's desire to save Shoutmon causes a mysterious legendary Digivice called the Fusion Loader to appear in front of him and drags him and his friends Angie Hinomoto and Jeremy Tsurgi into the Digital World. Mikey, Angie, and Jeremy find there is a growing evil empire ruled by Bagramon. Bagramon is systematically taking over the 108 Zones of the Digital World by collecting the Code Crown fragments, which are parts of a special artifact that, when completely collected, allow the holder to rule the Digital World. Mikey decides to save the Digital World. Mikey forms his own team known as the Fusion Fighters. The Fusion Fighters befriend various Digimon. Mikey uses his Fusion Loader to DigiFuse the Digimon from the Fusion Fighter team to battle Bagramon's Bagra Army legions and collect all the Code Crown fragments. On his journey, the Fusion Fighter team encounters two other generals. The two other generals are Christopher Aonuma and his Blue Flare team and Nene Amano with her Midnight team. Nene is later revealed as a figurehead for Midnight's true leader: SkullKnightmon who blackmailed her in aiding him in creating the Darkness Loader. After SkullKnightmon attempts to dispose of her once she outlived her usefulness, Nene joins the Fusion Fighters.

The Fusion Fighters continued to collect the Code Crown fragments, slowly restoring peace and order to the Digital World. But when a final confrontation for a fully formed Code Crown begins, Bagramon takes it while sending Mikey, Angie, and Jeremy back to the human world along with Shoutmon and Bagra Army general Tactimon. With the Fusion Fighters' core members out of the way, Bagramon begins his reign alongside SkullKnightmon, who is revealed as his younger brother. Ending up in their hometown of Koto, the Fusion Fighters meet Omnimon who is an ancient warrior sealed in a DigiCard. Omnimon is the one who gave Mikey his Fusion Loader. An enlarged Tactimon fully bioemerges and causes havoc until the feelings of Angie and Jeremy enable Shoutmon to Digivolve into OmniShoutmon to destroy Tactimon for good. Omnimon used his remaining energy to send Mikey and Shoutmon back to the Digital World, while Angie and Jeremy remain in the human world.

===Season 2===
{{main article| Digimon Fusion (season 2)}}
Upon returning to the Digital World, Mikey and Shoutmon find that Bagramon has reconstructed the Digital World into an empire divided into seven kingdoms. Each kingdom is ruled by a denominated Dark General with their own Darkness Loaders that have the ability to forcibly DigiFuse Digimon gained from the Bagra Army's new second in command SkullKnightmon. Reunited with their allies, Mikey and Nene convince Christopher to join forces with them. Mikey, Christopher, and Nene travel together through the seven kingdoms to defeat the seven Dark Generals, learning that Nene's kid brother Ewan Amano is helping the Bagra Army after SkullKnightmon had tricked the boy into thinking the Digital World is a game for his pleasure. In time, the Fusion Fighters learn that Bagramon uses the seven Dark Generals to gather negative energy from the suffering they caused to transform the Code Crown into the "Dark Stone" for his upcoming day for ultimate destruction, which he calls "D5." During the journey, Christopher, Nene and Ewan's pasts and motivations are revealed. Some Digimon are killed in battle, allies are made, and stronger DigiFusions are created to better combat the seven Dark Generals. After defeating the seven Dark Generals while opening Ewan's eyes to the truth, the Fusion Fighters finally confront Bagramon. Bagramon reveals his intentions to combine the human and digital worlds with himself as the supreme ruler.

Bagramon's plans are temporarily disrupted when AxeKnightmon (SkullKnightmon's fusion with the Digimon named Axemon) forcibly absorbs him to gain more power in the form of Darkest AxeKnightmon. But Bagramon overpowers his brother while converting the DigiFusion into DarknessBagramon. In the process, Shoutmon dies while DarknessBagramon sends Mikey, Christopher, and Nene to a void. But Mikey, Christopher, and Nene are saved by Angie and Jeremy using the last two DigiMemory Cards. In the final battle, Ewan's Darkness Loader turned into a yellow Fusion Loader for his use. Mikey, Angie, and Cutemon decide to go inside the Dark Stone to find Shoutmon. Mikey, Angie, and Cutemon are attacked by the metaphysical incarnation of Bagramon. When the completed Code Crown chose Mikey as its true owner, Shoutmon is revived alongside all the dead Digimon: Including fallen allies (Beelzemon &amp; Deckerdramon) and former enemies (Grademon, Apollomon and Olegmon). The Digimon trapped in the DigiMemory Cards also regain their original forms. The Digimon are all DigiFused into Shoutmon X7 Superior Mode, who destroys MegaDarknessBagramon (a gigantic version of DarknessBagramon after he absorbed parts of his surroundings to increase his size). The Fusion Fighters and Shoutmon X7 Superior Mode save both the human and digital worlds, the human members remaining in the human world as they say farewell to all their Digimon friends as they return to their world to rebuild it under their new Digimon King Shoutmon.

===Season 3===
:''Known as '''Digimon Fusion 2''' outside Japan.''
{{main article|Digimon Fusion (season 3)}}
A year has passed since the battle against MegaDarknessBagramon. Mikey established the Xros Heart basketball team consisting of himself, Ewan, and his classmate named Tagiru Akashi. One day, Tagiru discovers a strange and unstable realm in-between the human and digital worlds called the DigiQuartz. The DigiQuartz is where Fusion Loader wielding children known as Digimon Hunters hunt down and capture Digimon that escape from the Digital World to feed off the negative emotions of humans. Given a Fusion Loader by a strange old man and accompanied by a Digimon named Gumdramon, Tagiru, along with Mikey, Ewan and their Digimon, join the Digimon Hunt to investigate and protect their world from rampant Digimon while clashing against rival hunters. In the end, the Clock Store Owner reveals to everyone the truth that the Digimon Hunt was to select one among the Digimon Hunters to battle Quartzmon. Quartzmon is a deadly Digimon born from the residual power that lingered after MegaDarknessBagramon's defeat with the combined Digital Power in the human world that intends to change the entire human world into the DigiQuartz while absorbing all converted data.

To fight the threat, the Clock Store Owner traveled through time and space to summon the [[Digimon Adventure|eight original Digidestined]], the [[Digimon Adventure 02|four new Digidestined]], the [[Digimon Tamers]], the [[Digimon Frontier|Legendary Digimon Warriors]], and the [[Digimon Data Squad|operatives of DATS]] from their different universes to fend off Quartzmon alongside the reunited Fusion Fighter Army. Taigiru and the other Digimon Hunters battle each other to unlock the "Brave Snatcher," which is a weapon created from Bagramon's right arm that can defeat Quartzmon. Though a Hunter named Ryouma wins the Brave Snatcher, he is revealed as a tool by Quartzmon in the form of his partner Astamon. With the blessing of Mikey and the other group leaders, Tagiru is chosen as Ryouma's replacement. In a decisive battle, Tagiru uses the power of the Brave Snatcher to defeat Quartzmon and capture his DigiEgg. With Quartzmon defeated, the balance between the Human and Digital Worlds is restored, with the Digimon returning to the Digital World while the heroes are sent back to their universes. A month after Quartzmon's defeat, Tagiru and Gumdramon are reunited. The Clock Store Owner reappears, who reveals that there are still some Digimon running astray in the Human World. In the occasion, Mikey confirms his suspicion that the Clock Store Owner is actually the reincarnation of Bagramon, who has now dedicated himself to  protect the human and Digital Worlds.

==Production==
''Digimon Xros Wars'' was first publicly revealed in the June 2010 issue of [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[V Jump]]'' magazine, including the name of the series and brief descriptions of the series and several main characters.&lt;ref name="V Jump"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-17/digimon-new-series-titled/digimon-cross-wars|title=Digimon's New Anime Titled &amp; Dated: Digimon Xros Wars in July|date=April 17, 2010|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=April 19, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421064917/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-17/digimon-new-series-titled/digimon-cross-wars|archivedate=April 21, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Tetsuya Endo]] and written by [[Riku Sanjo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/digimon/staff/index.html|title=Staff|publisher=TV Asahi|language=Japanese|accessdate=May 22, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130111174442/http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/digimon/staff/index.html#|archivedate=2013-01-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Digimon Fusion'' received positive ratings in Japan. However, the third season was rushed, with Yukio Kaizawa as the main writer. In order to retain the series' popularity, Mikey Kudo remained as a returning character, while Christopher and Nene were removed from the main cast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The '''Driglam Namzha''' ({{bo|t=སྒྲིག་ལམ་རྣམ་གཞག་|w=sgrig lam rnam gzhag}}) is the official behaviour and [[dress code]] of [[Bhutan]]. It governs how citizens should dress in public and how they should behave in formal settings. It also regulates a number of cultural assets such as art and [[Architecture of Bhutan|architecture]]. In English, ''driglam'' means "order, discipline, custom, rules, regimen"&lt;ref name=DWDict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/diction/diction.htm |title=Dharma Dictionary |year=1996 |publisher=Diamond Way Buddhism |accessdate=2010-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328014624/http://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/diction/diction.htm |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''namzha'' means "system",&lt;ref name=DWDict/&gt; though the term may be styled "The Rules for Disciplined Behaviour".

==History==

The Driglam Namzha traces its roots directly back to the 17th-century pronouncements of [[Ngawang Namgyal]], the first [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]], a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[lama]] and military leader who sought to unify Bhutan not only politically but also culturally. He established guidelines for [[dzong architecture]], the characteristic monastery-fortresses of Bhutan. He also established many of the traditions of the [[tshechu]] "district festival" such as the [[Cham dance]]. The guidelines were intentionally codified to encourage the emergence of a distinctively-Bhutanese identity.

In 1989, the government elevated the status of the dress code from recommended to mandatory. All citizens were then required to observe the dress code in public during business hours. The decree was resented by [[Lhotshampa]]s in the southern lowlands, who complained about being forced to wear the clothing of the [[Ngalop people]].&lt;ref name=bbc98&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/country_profile/54627.stm |title=Country profile – Bhutan: a land frozen in time |date=1998-02-09 |publisher=BBC News online |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/country_profiles/1166513.stm |title=Bhutan country profile |date=2010-05-05 |publisher=BBC News online |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clothing ==
[[File:Bhutanese people.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Bhutanese people in national dress.]]
Under the Driglam Namzha, men wear a heavy knee-length robe tied with a belt, called a [[gho]], which is folded in such a way to form a pocket in front of the stomach. Women wear colourful blouses called [[wonju (Bhutan)|wonju]] over which they fold and clasp a large rectangular cloth called a [[Kira (Bhutan)|kira]], thereby creating an ankle-length dress. A short silk jacket or [[toego]] may be worn over the kira. Everyday gho and kira are cotton or wool according to the season, patterned in simple checks and stripes in earth tones. For special occasions and festivals, colourfully-patterned silk kira and, more rarely, gho, may be worn.

Additional rules apply when visiting a dzong or a temple, and when appearing before a high-level official. A white, raw silk sash with fringes called a [[kabney]] is worn by commoner men from left shoulder to opposite hip, with other colours reserved for officials and monks. Women wear a ''rachu'', a narrow embroidered cloth draped over the left shoulder.

==Architecture==

The Driglam Namzha codifies the traditional rules for the construction of the [[sacred]] fortresses known as dzongs. No plans are drawn up nor are nails allowed in their construction. Under the direction of an inspired [[lama]], citizens build dzongs as part of their [[corvée|tax obligation to the state]]. As recently as 1998, by [[decree]], all buildings must be constructed with multi-coloured wood frontages, small arched windows and sloping roofs.&lt;ref name=bbc98/&gt;

'''''Far Cry 4''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[first-person shooter]] video game developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]] for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is the successor to the 2012 video game ''[[Far Cry 3]]'', and the fourth main installment in the ''[[Far Cry]]'' series. The game was released on November 18, 2014.

The game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] country. The main story follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American, as he is caught in a civil war involving Kyrat's Royal Army, controlled by tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel movement called the Golden Path. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in [[role-playing game]]s, such as a branching storyline, and side quests. The game also features a map editor, a co-operative multiplayer mode, and an asymmetrical competitive multiplayer mode.

Announced in May 2014, development on ''Far Cry 4'' began immediately after the shipment of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to ''Far Cry 3'' that continues ''3''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided to develop a new setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of ''Far Cry 4'' were inspired by the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]'' and ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]''. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by [[Red Storm Entertainment]] while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by [[Ubisoft Toronto]].

''Far Cry 4'' was met with a mostly positive critical reception upon release. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters, particularly antagonist Pagan Min, as well as new gameplay additions and the wealth of content. However, some critics disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A successor, ''[[Far Cry 5]]'', was released on March 27, 2018.

The game features an [[open world]] environment that is free for players to explore. It features several environments, including forests, rivers, and mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/15/gamescom-2014-far-cry-4-glimpse-into-kyrat-trailer-rewind-theater|title=Gamescom 2014: Far Cry 4 Glimpse Into Kyrat Trailer Rewind Theatre|first=Tate|last=Fiebing|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 15, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To allow players to travel between places faster, the game features various vehicles, including buggies, trucks, and water vehicles like [[speedboats]]. Players can drive and shoot at the same time, and can enable auto-drive, in which the game's [[artificial intelligence]] takes over the role of controlling the vehicle and guides players to their objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-12-02-moving-targets-the-scattergun-politics-of-far-cry-4|title=Moving targets: the scattergun politics of Far Cry 4|first=Edwin|last=Evans-Thirlwell|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can also hijack other vehicles while driving.

While in Shangri-La, players are accompanied by an injured tiger which serves as their companion.

The game world is divided into two halves: North and South Kyrat. Players start in South Kyrat and are free to explore it almost immediately, but can only unlock North Kyrat over the course of the story. The map is progressively opened by liberating bell towers, freeing them from Pagan Min's influence and allowing the Golden Path to expand. These towers help players reveal new areas and mark new locations of interest on the map.&lt;ref name="Tips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/tips-for-playing-far-cry-4-1661679705|title=Tips for playing Far Cry 4|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|first=Yannick |last=LeJacq|work=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world is scattered with outposts controlled by Pagan Min, which can be infiltrated by players. Four larger outposts, or fortresses, can also be found, and feature stronger defenses and more difficult combinations of enemies. If players successfully liberate these outposts, they will serve as fast-travel points, allowing quick navigation through the game's world. Additional missions and quests also become available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/10-ways-stay-alive-far-cry-4-deadly-world/|work=[[GamesRadar]]|title=10 ways to stay alive in Far Cry 4's deadly world|first=David|last=Roberts|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many side-missions that can be completed, including hostage rescues, bomb disposal quests, and hunting missions.

Like its predecessors, the game features some [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements. Players can earn experience points by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points can then be spent on performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies. Doing so will give players discounts when purchasing new items at trading posts, and will allow players to call in support and back-up from members of the Golden Path.&lt;ref name="PCTrailer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-14-why-ajay-ghale-isnt-the-real-star-of-far-cry-4|title=Why Ajay Ghale isn't the real star of Far Cry 4|first=Aoife|last=Wilson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=October 14, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can also gain experience by collecting items like masks, propaganda posters, and [[prayer wheel]]s.&lt;ref name="Tips"/&gt; There is also an Arena mode, in which players battle human enemies and animals for additional experience points and rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4s-arena-mode-is-a-gladiator-style-humans-/1100-6422371/|title=Far Cry 4's Arena Mode Is a Gladiator-Style, Humans vs. Animals Affair|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplayer===
''Far Cry 4'' features a [[co-operative gameplay|co-operative multiplayer]] mode known as "Guns for Hire", which supports up to two players. The mode is separated from the game's campaign, and players are free to explore the game's world, defeat enemies, and infiltrate outposts with their companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/06/09/far-cry-4-co-op-modes-detailed/|title=Far Cry 4 Co-op Modes Detailed|first=Kim|last=Belair|date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=[[PlayStation Blog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the co-operative mode, players can gain access to several competitive multiplayer modes which have an asymmetrical structure. Players play as either a Rakshasa or a Golden Path member. The Rakshasa are equipped with bows and arrows, and have the ability to teleport and to summon wildlife to assist them, while Golden Path members are equipped with guns and explosives, and have access to armored vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-12-heres-how-far-cry-4-co-op-works-if-you-dont-have-the-game|title=Here's how Far Cry 4 co-op works if you don't have the game|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as "Battles of Kyrat", players fight against each other in three modes, called Outpost, Propaganda, and Demon Mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4s-pvp-multiplayer-mode-mixes-magic-with-elephants-guns-with-stealth/|title=Far Cry 4's PvP multiplayer mode mixes magic with elephants, guns with stealth|first=Tom|last=Sykes|date=October 31, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Far Cry 4'' also contains a Map Editor that allows users to create and share custom content.

==Synopsis==

===Premise===
The story was inspired by the ten-year-long [[Nepalese Civil War|Maoist insurgency in Nepal]]. The game follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American who returns to his native country of Kyrat (a fictional [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] country derived from the [[Kirati people|Kirat]] ethnicities of Nepal and northern India) to spread his deceased mother's ashes. Kyrat was once an autonomous state in the Himalayas ruled by a royal family before being engulfed in a series of civil wars. Ajay finds the country in a state of conflict between Kyrat's Royal Army, led by the country's eccentric and tyrannical King Pagan Min, and the Golden Path, a rebel movement fighting to free Kyrat from Min's oppressive rule. The choices Ajay makes will determine the fate of Kyrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-story-details-emerge/1100-6419756/|title=Far Cry 4 story details emerge|first=Chris|last=Pereira |date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot===
After the death of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale ([[James A. Woods]]) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by returning her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min ([[Troy Baker]]), the country's eccentric and violent king, who claims to have been romantically involved with Ishwari. After finding his way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal ([[Naveen Andrews]]), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.

In the twenty-odd years since Ishwari and Ajay fled Kyrat, the rebellion has stagnated, with the Golden Path now fighting for their very existence. As the son of Mohan Ghale, Ajay becomes a symbol for the Golden Path to rally around. After freeing a group of hostages and liberating territory held by Pagan, the Golden Path plan on breaking Pagan's stranglehold on power by targeting his three regional governors: Paul "De Pleur" Harmon ([[Travis Willingham]]), who oversees opium production and runs Pagan's torture chambers; Noore Najjar ([[Mylène Dinh-Robic]]), who runs poaching and prostitution rings and who became a victim of Pagan's cruelty herself after he kidnapped her family; and Yuma Lau ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]), Min's adopted sister and trusted general who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of the mystical realm of Shangri-La.

However the Golden Path's newfound momentum is threatened by deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita ([[Janina Gavankar]]), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay find a way to infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.

As the Golden Path secures Kyrat's southern provinces, Ajay is contacted by Willis Huntley ([[Alain Goulem]]), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary in exchange for killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, and that he was sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.

Ajay ends up in Yuma's mountain prison, from which he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother.{{efn|The ''Escape from Durgesh Prison'' downloadable content takes place at this point in the story.}} The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other to prevent them from starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.

====Endings====
Ajay encounters Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at the start of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Mohan sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together: Lakshmana, Ajay's [[half-sister]]. Mohan killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands. The player can choose to shoot down Pagan's helicopter as it flies away, killing Pagan in the process.

In the aftermath, the Golden Path seizes control of Kyrat. The final ending depends on which leader Ajay ultimately sided with. If Amita is placed in charge, she turns Kyrat into an [[authoritarian]] drug state, forcing villagers into work in factories and drug fields, and [[Conscription|conscripting]] [[Child soldiers|children]] into the group as soldiers to bolster their ranks against the remnants of the Royal Army; Ajay also learns that she has had her sister, Bhadra, taken away, "never to come again". If Sabal is placed in charge, Kyrat becomes a religious fundamentalist theocracy where all of Amita's supporters are executed, with Bhadra anointed as a religious symbol for the country to rally around. The player has the choice to kill the Golden Path's leader or leave them alive.

An [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] ending can be found at the beginning of the game. To trigger it, Ajay must simply wait at the dinner table in Pagan's mansion; when Pagan returns, he thanks Ajay during the ensuing conversation for being a "gentleman", and leads him to Lakshmana's shrine, telling Ajay of his family history before he plants his mother's ashes at the shrine. After Ajay exits the shrine, Pagan invites Ajay to join him to "finally shoot some goddamn guns".&lt;ref&gt;Good, Owen. (November 15, 2014).

===''Escape from Durgesh Prison''===
''Escape from Durgesh Prison'' is an additional chapter of the story available as downloadable content. It expands upon Ajay's escape from the Durgesh prison and return to the Golden Path, and on Yuma's planned insurrection against Pagan Min.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/far-cry-4s-dlc-forces-you-to-grind-until-you-die-for-no-1679524914|title=Far Cry 4's New DLC Forces You to Grind Until You Die For No Good Reason|first=Yannick|last=LeJacq|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=January 14, 2015|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Ajay's escape, he is left stranded in the snow at high altitude where he is rescued by Pagan Min. After tending to Ajay's wounds, Min leaves him in a tower in Northern Kyrat, as he is unable to return Ajay to the Golden Path directly. He then leaks news of Ajay's escape to Sabal and Amita, and allows them to secure a Royal Army helicopter so that they can extract him. However, word of this has spread to Yuma, who marshals the forces loyal to her and plans to attack the landing site once Ajay tries to escape. Because of this, Ajay only has a limited window of opportunity to escape, but can buy more time by attacking Yuma's forces. In exchange for disrupting Yuma's plans for a coup, Min promises Ajay support and resources at the landing site. During his missions, Ajay overhears one of the guards of Yuma saying that she was sent to a valley in the northern mountains of Kyrat on an expedition after something of great power called "The Relic". After killing Yuma's lieutenants, disrupting her supply lines, and thwarting her plans to sabotage Min's communications, Ajay ventures to the landing site where he is forced to fight off Yuma's attack long enough for the helicopter to power up. With the landing site secured and Yuma's forces in disarray, Ajay is successfully airlifted out contacts Sabal and Amita saying that he was heading to the valley to learn what is behind the expedition and the Relic.

===''Valley of the Yetis''===
''Valley of the Yetis'' is a downloadable additional chapter of content which takes place directly after ''Escape from Durgesh Prison''.

In his way to the Lost Valley to learn more about the expedition Yuma sent after the Relic, Ajay's helicopter is shot down by an unknown assailant. Ajay survives the crash, but awakens to discover that the pilot has been abducted and taken deeper into the valley. Ajay follows him intent on rescue, only to discover that the valley is occupied by an aggressive army. Liberating a relay station in a bid to re-establish contact with the Golden Path, he is forced to fight off wave after wave of attackers whilst being taunted by a voice over the radio. Investigating further, Ajay discovers the army is calling themselves the Disciples of Yalung, and is a [[cult]] worshiping a demon from Kyrati mythology. The Disciples have harnessed an evil that permeates the valley to transform their followers into "Awakened", or [[yeti]]s, and are amassing their forces to attack Kyrat. Realizing that he cannot return to Kyrat without dealing with the cult, Ajay gradually destroys their ranks before scaling a glacier to find the source of Yalung's influence. After successfully destroying a tree that provides the Disciples with their power, Ajay sees himself as an Awakened, although this is supposedly just a hallucination.

==Development==
The game's development was led by [[Ubisoft Montreal]], which took over the development of the ''Far Cry'' franchise after the release of ''[[Far Cry: Instincts]]'' in 2005. Additional development was handled by four other in-house Ubisoft studios, [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Red Storm Entertainment]], [[Ubisoft Shanghai]], and [[Ubisoft Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-release-date-kyrat/|title=Far Cry 4 – Welcome To Kyrat|first= Gary |last=Steinman|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Montreal studio worked on the game's campaign, the Toronto studio worked on the Shangri-La segments of the campaign, Red Storm handled the development of the competitive multiplayer, the Shanghai studio worked on the hunting missions, and the Kiev studio developed the game's PC version.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/14/how-ubisoft-aims-to-dominate-shooter-open-worlds-with-far-cry-4-interview/2/|title=How Ubisoft aims to dominate open-world shooters with Far Cry 4 (interview)|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Development of the game began in late 2012, after the shipment of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]''. The game's creative director is Alex Hutchinson, who had previously worked on [[Maxis]]'s ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' as well as ''Assassin's Creed III''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/06/25/history-lessons-the-road-from-assassins-creed-iii-to-far-cry-4.aspx|title=History Lessons: The Road From Assassin's Creed III To Far Cry 4|first=Ben|last=Hanson|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 25, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When brainstorming ideas for the new ''Far Cry'' game, the development team originally planned on developing a direct sequel to ''Far Cry 3.'' The sequel would be set on the same tropical island, would expand upon the protagonist's story, and would bring back characters, such as ''Far Cry 3''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s secondary antagonist, Vaas. However, after four days, the team found that a sequel was not what they wanted to achieve. As a result, they decided to scrap the idea and build a brand new game with a new setting and a new set of characters. The team adapted a "we want it all" approach, in which they hoped to experiment with all kinds of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/10/15/far-cry-4-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|title=Far Cry 3.5 was a thing – for about four days, says Ubisoft|first= Stephany|last= Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some team members hoped that the game would allow players to fly, which led to the game's verticality.&lt;ref name="FarCry3.5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-isnt-just-far-cry-3-5/|title=Why Far Cry 4 Isn't Just Far Cry 3.5|first=Gary|last=Steinman|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's director also hoped that players would be able to ride a rampaging elephant, in a place with "exotic mountainsides" and "unique culture". This led to the concept of a mountainous setting and the introduction of elephants in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/14/6970783/i-played-far-cry-4-for-five-hours-and-heres-what-i-think-of-the-game|title=I played Far Cry 4 for five hours, and here's what I think of the game so far ...|first=Colin|last=Campbell|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers aimed for players to consider ''Far Cry 4'' a standalone experience, and therefore they avoided bringing back any characters from ''Far Cry 3'' except for Willis and Hurk{{who|date=March 2018}} The decision to bring the two back was made because the team thought that they should provide some references to previous games in the series, as all of the games are set in the same universe even though they are not directly related.&lt;ref name="DSInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/interviews/a592636/far-cry-4-interview-alex-hutchinson-on-kyrat-pagan-min-and-co-op.html#~pmnhi0dIkd5ao1|title=Far Cry 4 interview: Alex Hutchinson on Kyrat, Pagan Min and co-op|first=Matthew|last=Reynolds|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the gameplay elements were directly taken from ''Far Cry 3''. Exotic locations, hunting, and the freedom for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in ''Far Cry 4''. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make ''Far Cry 4'' an evolution for the series. As a result, the size of the game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/far-cry-4-creative-director-discusses-the-returning-elements-of-far-cry-3|title=Far Cry 4 Creative Director Discusses The Returning Elements of Far Cry 3|first=Cassidee|last=Moser|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also realized that players spent a lot of time interacting with the open world of ''Far Cry 3'', and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat interview"/&gt;

The game's setting, Kyrat, is a fictional country in the Himalayas region. When building Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]], but exaggerated those elements. The map's size is similar to that of ''Far Cry 3'', but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4-interview-with-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-at-e3-2014/|title=Far Cry 4 interview with creative director Alex Hutchinson at E3 2014|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identity for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world.&lt;ref name="DSInterview"/&gt; In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a589108/far-cry-4-behind-the-scenes-trailer-sees-developers-visit-a-hindu-temple.html#~prIxN5ZC6YXODx|title=Exclusive: Far Cry 4 behind-the-scenes trailer sees developers visit a Hindu temple|first=Matthew|last=Reynolds|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world [[Nepalese Civil War]],&lt;ref name="playstationlifestyle.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2014/08/24/far-cry-4-story-inspired-by-nepalese-civil-war/#/slide/1/|title=Far Cry 4 Inspired by Nepalese Civil War According to Ubisoft|last=Khan|first=Zarmena|work=[[PlayStation LifeStyle]]|date=August 24, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to developing unique and interesting characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/playstation4/archive/2014/06/18/to-nepal-and-back-how-ubisoft-montreal-created-a-new-country-for-far-cry-4.aspx|title=Far Cry 4: To Nepal And Back: How Ubisoft Montreal Created A New Country|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the game's most critically acclaimed characters is Pagan Min, the game's major antagonist. The team hoped that players would be "shocked, amazed and intrigued" by him in every encounter. Min has a complex relationship with the playable character, Ghale, as the team wanted players to guess Min's intentions and add a layer of mystery to him.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat interview"/&gt; The team originally hoped to have a villain that had a "punk-rock mentality", but the idea was abandoned as the team thought that the concept was not original. The pink costume Min wears throughout the game was inspired by Beat Takeshi, a character from ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brothers]]'', and Ichi, a character from ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]''. Min is designed to be sadistic yet confident, and the team hired [[Troy Baker]] to provide the voice for Min, as they thought that Baker's voice is charismatic enough to suit Min.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/13/the-face-of-evil-a-look-at-far-cry-4-controversial-villain.aspx|title=Far Cry 4: The Face Of Evil: A Look At Ubisoft's Controversial Villain|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploring-far-cry-4s-sadistic-complicated-villain-/1100-6422572/|title=Exploring Far Cry 4's Sadistic, Complicated Villain Pagan Min|first=Justin|last=Haywald|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Baker, Ubisoft gave him a script for the audition but he chose not to follow it, and instead decided to threaten to cut off the face of an assistant using Min's tone. The interviewer was very pleased with Baker's performance and decided to sign him for the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4s-crazy-pagan-min-audition-involved-threa/1100-6428614/|title=Far Cry 4's Crazy Pagan Min Audition Involved Threat of Cutting Someone's Face Off|first=Chris|last=Pereira|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Ghale, he was designed to be "thin", and his backstory was designed to be revealed as players progressed through the game's story.&lt;ref name="FarCry3.5"/&gt; According to the game's narrative director, Mark Thompson, Ghale learns the history and culture of Kyrat along with players. The developers also hoped that Ghale could be an accessible character for players.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;

In hindsight, the team considered the story of ''Far Cry 3'' "great", even though they thought that it was separated from the game's world. In order to increase players' agency and make the story to feel more connected to the world for players, the team introduced a branching storyline which required players to make choices that would lead to different results and alter the game's ending.&lt;ref name="PolyE3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/a/e3-2014/far-cry-4|title=Far Cry's new creative director talks story, co-op and scope|first=Alexa|last=Ray Corriea|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team hoped that by adding choices, they could add additional depth and meaning to the game's campaign. Thompson added that they twisted the story of ''Far Cry 3'' for ''Far Cry 4'', and made outsiders the villains instead of the heroes. The team considered it a "risk", but they wanted to try something different.&lt;ref name="GINarrative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/06/16/far-cry-4s-new-approach-to-narrative.aspx|title=Embracing Chaos: Far Cry 4's New Approach To Narrative|first=Ben|last=Hanson|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 16, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Far Cry 4 Shangri-La screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The Shangri-La section features a color scheme that is different from Kyrat. It is mostly made up of gold, red, orange, white and blue.]]
For the Shangri-La mission, the team wanted to have a structure similar to ''3'''s  mushroom missions; a game within a game.&lt;ref name="FarCry3.5"/&gt; The Shangri-La missions are not related to Kyrat, but play an important role in the game's narrative. When creating these segments, the team put a lot of emphasis on the use of colors. They hoped that the artistic vision for ''Far Cry 4'' would not feature any resemblance to other typical shooter games. It was originally designed to be a small open world, but was later converted into a linear experience due to time constraints and huge creative differences between developers. The team later decided to simplify it, and re-imagined it into an "ancient, natural world". It is made up of five different colors. The main color of Shangri-La is gold; the developers thought that using gold as the foundation added "warmth" to the dreamland. Meanwhile, red was used heavily to add a sense of strangeness, as well as for establishing a tie to the game's narrative and story. Orange was used as a color of interaction, while white was used to add purity to the world. Blue is the last of Shangri-La's main colors, and represents dangers and honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/3/16/8219481/shangri-la-far-cry-4-artwork-gallery-gdc-2015|title=Painting Shangri-La|first=Dave|last=Tach|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubisoft promised that ''Far Cry 4'' would have much more of a multiplayer element than ''Far Cry 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-will-have-a-lot-more-multiplayer-than-far-cry-3/1100-6419681/|title=Far Cry 4 will have "a lot more multiplayer" than Far Cry 3|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements that were scrapped for ''Far Cry 3'' due to time constraints were featured in ''Far Cry 4'', such as the "Guns for Hire" co-operative multiplayer mode.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat interview"/&gt; Building a co-operative experience was the team's goal starting from the beginning of the game's development. Originally intended to be a separate mode, it was later made to be seamlessly integrated into the main campaign.&lt;ref name="PolyE3"/&gt; The game's competitive multiplayer was designed to give players freedom, allowing players to progress and defeat enemies through a variety of different ways. Red Storm Entertainment also considered players' feedback from the multiplayer aspect of ''Far Cry 3'', and decided to include vehicles to the game. The company chose an asymmetrical structure for the match, so that players could have different experiences in different matches, as well as to make matches feel more chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/iukn6b/far-cry-4-the-making-of-pvp--battles-of-kyrat-|title=Far Cry 4:The Making of PvP (Battles of Kyrat)|work=[[GameTrailers]]|date=December 4, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers originally planned to feature female playable characters, but the plan was scrapped due to animation problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-12-far-cry-4-almost-had-female-co-op-characters|title=Far Cry 4 "almost" had female co-op characters|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft announced a 'Keys to Kyrat' offer for players that owned a copy of the game for the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4. It allows those owners to send out game keys to up to ten other people who do not own a copy of the game. Players who are offered a key can join the person that sent them the key and play the co-operative mode for two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/News/24977/Far-Cry-4-PlayStation-exclusive-Keys-to-Kyrat-offer-unlimited-sessions|title=Far Cry 4 PlayStation exclusive 'Keys to Kyrat' offer 'unlimited sessions'|first=Simon|last=Sayers|work=[[PlayStation Universe]]|date=October 20, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cliff Martinez]] was hired to work on the game's soundtrack. A two disc edition was released that contained 30 tracks heard in the game, and a deluxe edition was released that contained 15 extra tracks. The album was released just before the release of the game, and received positive reviews. Particular praise was directed towards the usage of traditional Nepalese instruments which, combined with electronic samples, suggested high octane action and mystical wondering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/composer-cliff-martinez-officially-working-on-far-cry-4-soundtrack|title=Composer Cliff Martinez Officially Working On Far Cry 4 Soundtrack|first=Lauren|last=Puga|work=[[IGN]]|date=November 3, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Far Cry 4'' received a positive reception upon release. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave the Xbox One version 85.92% based on 12 reviews and 82/100 based on 14 reviews, respectively.&lt;ref name="GRXONE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt; The PlayStation 4 version received 83.76% based on 57 reviews on GameRankings and 85/100 based on 83 reviews on Metacritic,&lt;ref name="GRPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt; and the Microsoft Windows version received 81.00% based on 9 reviews and 80/100 based on 17 reviews, respectively.&lt;ref name="GRPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;

The game's story received mixed responses. Chris Carter from [[Destructoid]] praised the personality of Ajay Ghale, which is "less in-your-face" than that of ''Far Cry 3'''s protagonist [[Jason Brody]]. He also praised the villain, Pagan Min, who he considered took the spotlight every time he appeared in the game.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; Josh Harmon from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' thought that the characters in this game had more depth, and that the choices made by players throughout the game were meaningful.&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; Aoife Wilson from [[Eurogamer]] thought that the game's characters were memorable, but was disappointed by the story.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; Nick Tan, from [[Game Revolution]], also praised Min's personality, but he complained that the character appeared too seldom in the game.&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt; Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, writing for [[GamesRadar]], thought that the story grew tiresome as players progressed, even though some of its characters were interesting. He further criticized the game's writing, which he thought was lackluster.&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt; Mike Splechta from ''GameZone'' praised the game's voice acting and applauded its storyline, calling it satisfying.&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt;

The game's setting received positive responses. Carter thought that the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, as well as the game's long [[draw distance]].&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon thought that the hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable.&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of ''Far Cry 3''.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; Ludwig Kietzmann from [[Joystiq]] praised the content found within the world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.&lt;ref name="Joystiq2"/&gt;

The game's design also received acclaim. Carter from Destructoid thought that the fortress and the outpost system provided players with a sense of accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from ''Far Cry 3'' and was uninspiring. ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from [[IGN]], praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; [[Justin McElroy]] of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt;

The game's multiplayer mode received mixed response. Carter compared the competitive multiplayer to that of ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'', and called it "skippable". He considered the co-operative multiplayer a fun addition to the game, but was disappointed by its limitations. He also added that the game would still be a strong title without these multiplayer elements.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; Bertz from ''Game Informer'' also found the multiplayer shallow and poorly-executed. He also criticized the lack of a large player pool and dedicated servers.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were fun to play, but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was easy to forget.&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt; In contrast, ''GameZone''{{'s}} Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was "a surprise" for him.&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt; Dyer echoed similar statement, and he thought that it had successfully captured the scale and freedom offered by both the game's co-op and campaign.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

Harmon thought that ''Far Cry 4'' was an improvement over ''Far Cry 3'', but he thought that the game felt and played too similarly to ''Far Cry 3'', and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for ''Far Cry 4'' is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by ''Far Cry 4'' did not stray far away from ''Far Cry 3''.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to ''Far Cry 3'', but also other Ubisoft franchises like ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Watch Dogs]]''.&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt; Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by ''Far Cry 4'' was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel.&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt; Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

'''First-year composition''' (sometimes known as '''freshman composition''' or '''freshman writing''') is an introductory core curriculum [[writing]] course in  American colleges.  This course focuses on improving students' abilities to write in a university setting and introduces students to writing practices in the disciplines and professions.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, John. "[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/03/16/essay-value-first-year-writing-courses| Essay on the Value of First-year Writing Courses]." ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''. March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, "Freshman Composition". Scholars working within the field of Composition-Rhetoric often have teaching First-year composition (FYC) courses  as the practical focus of their scholarly work. 

FYC courses are structured in a variety of ways.  Some institutions of higher education require only one term of FYC, while others require two or three courses. There are a number of identifiable [[Pedagogy|pedagogies]] associated with FYC, including: [[formalist theory in composition studies|current-traditional]], [[theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|expressivist]], [[Cognitive rhetoric|social-epistemic]], [[Process theory of composition|process]], post-process and [[Writing about Writing]] (WAW). Each of these [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] can generate a multitude of curricula. 

Composition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and [[Rhetoric]] and [[Composition Studies|Composition]], often focus on a rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of [[audience]], purpose, [[Context (language use)|context]], invention, and [[Stylistics (literature)|style]] to their writing processes. This rhetorical approach has shown that real writing, rather than existing as isolated modes, has more to do with a writer choosing from among many approaches to perform rhetorical tasks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In addition to a focus on rhetoric, many first year composition courses also emphasize writing process, where students are encouraged to interact with classmates and receive feedback to be used for [[revision (writing) | revision]].  These practices can take the form of essay [[peer review]] or workshopping. [[Electronic Portfolio|Portfolios]] are a common way of assessing revised student work.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncte.org/cccc/resources/positions/electronicportfolios| Principles and Practices in Electronic Portfolios]." Conference on College Composition and Communication, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Since the late nineteenth century, college courses on composition have become increasingly common in American higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a longstanding course offering at many colleges, first-year composition remains controversial and marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Susan. ''Textual Carnivals: The Politics of Composition.'' Carbondale and Edwardsville, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, Sue Ellen. "Women's Work: The Feminizing of Composition." ''Rhetoric Review'' 9(2) 1991: 201-229. &lt;/ref&gt;

===First-year requirement debate===

The requirement for a first-year composition course has been debated in [[composition studies]]. This debate centers around how effective the first-year composition course is and the changes that need to be made to develop the field of composition. While most schools do require some form of the first-year composition course, there are some schools that have decided to abolish the first-year composition requirement. Some scholars, such as Sharon Crowley in ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays,'' argue that this requirement should be abolished. Crowley does not suggest the course itself be removed, only the requirement that all freshmen take the course. She states that students would still be interested in the course if the requirement was abolished and that removing the requirement would strengthen the field of composition. She implies that composition studies is marginalized within the university because of the view of the first-year composition course as a skill course. Removing the requirement, she states, would remove the association of composition studies with introductory courses, giving more acknowledgement to the field. &lt;ref&gt; Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1998. pg 241-43. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Crowley's opinion initiated a debate in the composition field, but she is not the only critic who advocates for the removal of this requirement. Scholars Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle also dislike the requirement and instead argue for a writing studies curriculum. &lt;ref&gt; Downs, Douglas and Elizabeth Wardle. ''Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First-Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies'''. College Composition and Communication. 58.4 (2007) 552-584. Web. &lt;/ref&gt; However, there are scholars who do not agree with this stance, argue that the first-year composition course is needed in the university, and believe that the requirement should remain. Scholar David Smit is one critic who favors keeping the requirement. He suggests that the requirement can be kept and the curriculum and structure of the first-year composition course altered for improvement. Smit explains that many of the developmental goals of those who favor abolishing the requirement can still be achieved by offering more writing experiences. He proposes more genre writing in composition courses with a "[[scaffolding]]" progression of discipline writing. If this was done, he suggests, the concerns over the status of composition studies in the university would still be solved, as the course would no longer be seen as skills based. &lt;ref&gt; Smit, David. ''The End of Composition Studies''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2004. pg 183-85. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; There has been no consensus reached in composition studies regarding the status of the first-year composition course requirement. The benefits of the course, as well as the drawbacks, continue to be debated and the scholars noted above are only a few of the voices and perspectives involved in this discussion. Despite the debate about the requirement, it remains in effect at a majority of universities{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Structure of contemporary first-year composition==

First-year composition is designed to meet the goals for successful completion set forth by the [http://wpacouncil.org/positions/outcomes.html/ Council of Writing Program Administrators]. To reach these goals, students must learn rhetorical conventions, [[critical thinking]] skills, [[information literacy]], and the process of writing an academic paper. While there is no American standard curriculum for first-year composition, curriculum is developed at several levels, including the state, institution, department, and [[Writing center|writing program]].

=== First-year composition and rhetoric ===

With the publication of James Kinneavy's ''Theory of Discourse'' in 1971, English departments began incorporating [[rhetoric]] into their composition classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Irene. ''Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing.'' Mahweh, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching [[audience analysis]], [[Aristotle]]'s three appeals ([[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]]), and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse.
According to Brian Sutton in "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper," since 1980, there has been an increasing debate in academic circles as to whether the "generic" approach to writing in first year composition is useful for students whose future writing will be discipline specific (46).&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Brian. "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper." ''Language and Learning Across the Disciplines'' 2.1 (1997) 46–57. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gryf''' is a fictional creature, an omnivorous ''[[Triceratops]]'' invented by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] in his fantasy novel ''[[Tarzan the Terrible]]''. Other members of the ''Triceratops'' genus were strictly [[herbivorous]] and became extinct at the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]], around 65 million years ago. The Gryf survived the extinction event and mutated from a plant-eater to a very dangerous [[predator]], while also retaining its diet of plants. The Gryf has appeared in comic strips by [[Russ Manning]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">The '''hemline index''' is a theory presented by economist [[George W. Taylor (professor)|George Taylor]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Tamar Lewin, The hemline index, updated, ''International Herald Tribune'', October 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Henrietta Prast "Fashionomics", ''[[Wilmott Magazine]]'', June 2005, who cites Paul Nystrom in his 1928 monograph, ''The Economics of Fashion'' as the source of the theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory suggests that [[hemline]]s on women's dresses rise along with stock prices. In good economies, we get such results as [[miniskirts]] (as seen in the 1920s and the 1960s),&lt;ref&gt;Claire Brayford, [http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/34787/The-Hemline-Economy "The Hemline Economy"], ''Daily Express'', February 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or in poor economic times, as shown by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 Wall Street Crash]], hems can drop almost overnight. Non-peer-reviewed research in 2010 supported the correlation, suggesting that "the economic cycle leads the hemline with about three years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publishing.eur.nl/ir/repub/asset/20147/EI%202010-40.pdf |title=The hemline and the economy: is there any match? |authors=Marjolein van Baardwijk, Philip Hans Franses |publisher=publishing.eur.nl |date=2010 |accessdate=2014-03-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306100914/http://publishing.eur.nl/ir/repub/asset/20147/EI%202010-40.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''housefly''' (''Musca domestica'') is a [[fly]] of the suborder [[Cyclorrhapha]]. It is believed to have evolved in the [[Cenozoic]] era, possibly in the Middle East, and has [[Cosmopolitan distribution|spread all over the world]] as a [[commensal]] of humans. It is the most common fly species found in houses. Adults are grey to black, with four dark, longitudinal lines on the thorax, slightly hairy bodies, and a single pair of membranous wings. They have red eyes, set farther apart in the slightly larger female.

The female housefly usually mates only once and stores the [[sperm]] for later use. She lays batches of about 100 eggs on decaying organic matter such as food waste, [[carrion]], or [[faeces]]. These soon hatch into legless white larvae, known as [[maggot]]s. After 2 to 5 days of development, these [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into reddish-brown [[pupae]], about {{convert|8|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long. Adult flies normally live for 2 to 4 weeks, but can hibernate during the winter. The adults feed on a variety of liquid or semiliquid substances, as well as solid materials which have been softened by their [[saliva]]. They can carry [[pathogen]]s on their bodies and in their faeces, contaminate food, and contribute to the transfer of [[food-borne illness]]es, while, in numbers, they can be physically annoying. For these reasons, they are considered [[pest (organism)|pests]].

Houseflies have been used in the laboratory in research into ageing and [[Sex-determination system|sex determination]]. Flies appear in literature from Ancient Greek myth and Aesop's ''[[The Impertinent Insect]]'' onwards. Authors sometimes choose the fly to speak of the brevity of life, as in [[William Blake]]'s 1794 poem "[[The Fly (poem)|The Fly]]", which deals with mortality subject to uncontrollable circumstances.

== Description ==
[[File:House Fly Eye Closeup (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Head of a female housefly with two large [[compound eye]]s and three [[ocelli]]]]

Adult houseflies are usually {{convert|6|to|7|mm|in|abbr=on}} long with a wingspan of {{convert|13|to|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The females tend to be larger winged than males, while males have relatively longer legs. Females tend to vary more in size&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1977.tb01046.x|pmid=28563484|title=Morphometric Adaptation of the Housefly, Musca Domestica L., in the United States|journal=Evolution|volume=31|issue=3|pages=580–596|year=1977|last1=Bryant|first1=Edwin H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is geographic variation with larger individuals in higher latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alves|first=Sueli María|last2=Bélo|first2=Muracy|date=August 2002|title=Morphometric variations in the housefly, Musca domestica (L.) with latitude|journal=Genetica|volume=115|issue=3|pages=243–251|issn=0016-6707|pmid=12440563|doi=10.1023/a:1020685727460}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head is strongly convex in front and flat and slightly conical behind. The pair of large [[compound eye]]s almost touch in the male, but are more widely separated in the female. They have three simple eyes ([[ocelli]]) and a pair of short antennae.&lt;ref name=Hewitt/&gt; Flies process visual information around seven times more quickly than humans, enabling them to identify and avoid attempts to catch or swat them, since they effectively see the human's movements in slow motion with their higher [[flicker fusion rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Ian |title=Q.

[[File:Houseflymouth100x1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Mouthparts, showing the pseudotracheae, semitubular grooves (dark parallel bands) used for sucking up liquid food]]

The mouthparts are specially adapted for a liquid diet; the mandibles and maxillae are reduced and not functional, and the other mouthparts form a retractable, flexible [[proboscis]] with an enlarged, fleshy tip, the labellum.

The [[thorax]] is a shade of gray, sometimes even black, with four dark, longitudinal bands of even width on the dorsal surface. The whole body is covered with short hairs. Like other [[fly|Diptera]], houseflies have only one pair of [[insect wing|wings]]; what would be the hind pair is reduced to small [[halteres]] that aid in [[flight]] stability. The wings are translucent with a yellowish tinge at their base. Characteristically, the medial vein (M1+2 or fourth long [[Insect wing#Wing venation|vein]]) shows a sharp upward bend. Each wing has a lobe at the back, the [[calypter]], covering the haltere. The abdomen is gray or yellowish with a dark stripe and irregular dark markings at the side. It has 10 segments which bear spiracles for respiration. In males, the ninth segment bears a pair of claspers for copulation, and the 10th bears anal cerci in both sexes.&lt;ref name=Hewitt/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/flies/house_fly.HTM |title=House fly: ''Musca domestica'' |author=Sanchez-Arroyo, Hussein; Capinera, John L. |date=20 April 2017 |work=Featured Creatures |accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The housefly is probably the insect with the widest distribution in the world; it is largely associated with humans and has accompanied them around the globe. It is present in the Arctic Circle, as well as in the tropics, where it is abundant. It is present in all populated parts of Europe, Asia, Australasia, and the Americas.&lt;ref name=Hewitt/&gt;&lt;!--pages 7&amp;8--&gt;

==Evolution and taxonomy==

Though the order of flies (Diptera) is much older, true houseflies are believed to have evolved in the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wiegmann, B.M.|author2= Yeates, DK|author3= Thorne, JL|author4= Kishino, H |title=Time flies, a new molecular time-scale for brachyceran fly evolution without a clock |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=745–56 |date=December 2003  |pmid=14668115 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/52.6.745}}&lt;/ref&gt; The housefly's superfamily, [[Muscoidea]], is most closely related to the [[Oestroidea]] (blow flies and allies), and more distantly to the [[Hippoboscoidea]] (louse flies and allies). They are thought to have originated in the southern [[Palearctic]] region, particularly the Middle East. Because of their close, [[commensal]] relationship with humans, they probably owe their worldwide dispersal to co-migration with humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|doi=10.1093/jhered/93.4.254|title=Gene Flow Among Geographically Diverse Housefly Populations (Musca domestica L.): A Worldwide Survey of Mitochondrial Diversity|first1= J.

==Life cycle==
[[File:Musca domestica mating (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Houseflies mating]]

Each female housefly can lay up to 500 [[egg]]s in a lifetime, in several batches of about 75 to 150. The eggs are white and are about {{convert|1.2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in length, and they are deposited by the fly in a suitable place, usually dead and decaying organic matter, such as food waste, carrion, or [[faeces]]. Within a day, larvae ([[maggot]]s) hatch from the eggs; they live and feed where they were laid. They are pale-whitish, {{convert|3|to|9|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} long, thinner at the mouth end, and legless.&lt;ref name=IFAS/&gt; Larval development takes from two weeks, under optimal conditions, to 30 days or more in cooler conditions. The larvae avoid light; the interiors of heaps of animal manure provide nutrient-rich sites and ideal growing conditions, warm, moist, and dark.&lt;ref name=IFAS/&gt;

[[File:The larva and fly of a house fly (Musca domestica). Coloured Wellcome V0022571.jpg|thumb|[[Larva]] and adult, by [[Amedeo John Engel Terzi]] (1872–1956)]]

At the end of their fourth [[instar]], the larvae crawl to a dry, cool place and transform into [[pupa]]e. The pupal case is cylindrical with rounded ends, about {{convert|1.2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} long, and formed from the last shed larval skin. It is yellowish at first, darkening through red and brown to nearly black as it ages. Pupae complete their development in from two to six days at {{convert|35|°C}}, but may take 20 days or more at {{convert|14|°C}}.&lt;ref name=IFAS/&gt;

When [[metamorphosis]] is complete, the adult fly emerges from the pupa. To do this, it uses the [[ptilinum]], an eversible pouch on its head, to tear open the end of the pupal case. The adult housefly lives from two weeks to a month in the wild, or longer in [[benign]] laboratory conditions. Having emerged from the pupa, it ceases to grow; a small fly is not necessarily a young fly, but is instead the result of getting insufficient food during the larval stage.&lt;ref name=IFAS/&gt;

Male houseflies are sexually mature after 16 hours and females after 24. Females produce a [[pheromone]], [[(Z)-9-Tricosene|(Z)-9-tricosene (muscalure)]]. This cuticular hydrocarbon is not released into the air and males sense it only on contact with females;&lt;ref name=insencyc&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dahlem, Gregory A.| pages=469–470|chapter=House Fly (Musca domestica) |title=Encyclopedia of Insects|edition=2|editor1=Resh, Vincent H.| editor2=Carde, Ring T.|year=2009| publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has found use as in pest control, for luring males to fly traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050228| pmid=17713987| year=2007| last1=Thom | first1=C.| last2=Gilley | first2=D.| last3=Hooper | first3=J.| last4=Esch | first4=H.| title=The scent of the waggle dance| volume=5| issue=9| pages=e228| pmc=1994260| journal=PLoS Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epa&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_PC-103201_1-Sep-94.pdf | title=(Z)-9-Tricosene (103201) Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate = 8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male initiates the mating by bumping into the female, in the air or on the ground, known as a "strike". He climbs on to her thorax, and if she is receptive, a courtship period follows, in which the female vibrates her wings and the male strokes her head. The male then reverses onto her abdomen and the female pushes her [[ovipositor]] into his genital opening; copulation, with sperm transfer, lasts for several minutes.

The larvae depend on warmth and sufficient moisture to develop; generally, the warmer the temperature, the faster they grow. In general, fresh swine and chicken manures present the best conditions for the developing larvae, reducing the larval period and increasing the size of the pupae. Cattle, goat, and horse manures produce fewer, smaller pupae, while fully composted swine manure, with a water content under 40%, produces none at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breitwart et al |title=Favorability of conditions in the reproduction and development of the common housefly: a controlled study |journal=International Journal of Entomology |date=2008 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=157-181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pupae can range from about {{convert|8.0|to|20|mg|oz|4|abbr=off}} under different conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Larraín, Patricia|author2= Salas, Claudio  | year=2008 | title=House fly (''Musca domestica'' L.)

The lifecycle can be completed in seven to 10 days under optimal conditions, but may take up to two months in adverse circumstances. In temperate regions, 12 generations may occur per year, and in the tropics and subtropics, more than 20.&lt;ref name=IFAS/&gt;

[[File:Housefly pupae killed by wasp larvae.jpg|thumb|left|Housefly pupae killed by [[parasitoid wasp]] larvae: Each pupa has one hole through which a single adult wasp has emerged; the wasp larvae fed on the housefly larvae.]]

Houseflies play an important ecological role in breaking down and recycling organic matter. Adults are mainly [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]; their primary food is animal matter, [[carrion]], and [[faeces]], but they also consume milk, sugary substances, and rotting fruit and vegetables. Solid foods are softened with saliva before being sucked up.&lt;ref name=Mehlhorn/&gt; They can be opportunistic blood feeders.&lt;ref&gt;West (1951):189.&lt;/ref&gt; Houseflies have a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the bacterium ''[[Klebsiella oxytoca]]'', which can live on the surface of housefly eggs and deter fungi which compete with the fly larvae for nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lam, Kevin|author2= Thu,  Kelsie|author3= Tsang, Michelle|author4= Moore, Margo|author5= Gries, Gerhard |year=2009 |title=Bacteria on housefly eggs, ''Musca domestica'', suppress fungal growth in chicken manure through nutrient depletion or antifungal metabolites |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=96 |issue=9 |pages=1127–1132 |doi=10.1007/s00114-009-0574-1 |bibcode=2009NW.....96.1127L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult houseflies are diurnal and rest at night. If inside a building after dark, they tend to congregate on ceilings, beams, and overhead wires, while out of doors, they crawl into foliage or long grass, or rest in shrubs and trees or on wires.&lt;ref name=IFAS/&gt; In cooler climates, some houseflies [[Hibernation|hibernate]] in winter, choosing to do so in cracks and crevices, gaps in woodwork, and the folds of curtains. They arouse in the spring when the weather warms up, and search out a place to lay their eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where do flies go in winter? |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150204-flies-can-be-active-all-year |newspaper=BBC Earth |date=10 February 2015 |accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houseflies have many predators, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, various insects, and spiders. The eggs, larvae, and pupae have many species of stage-specific [[parasite]]s and [[parasitoid]]s. Some of the more important are the parasitic wasps ''[[Muscidifurax uniraptor]]'' and ''[[Spalangia cameroni]]''; these lay their eggs in the fly larvae tissue and their offspring complete their development before the adult flies can emerge from the pupae.&lt;ref name=IFAS/&gt; [[Histeridae|Hister beetles]] feed on housefly larvae in manure heaps and the predatory mite ''Macrocheles muscae domesticae'' consumes housefly eggs, each mite eating 20 eggs per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vet.entomology.cals.cornell.edu/arthropod-identification/chicken-recommendations/house-flies |title=House flies |year=2017 |publisher=Cornell University: Department of Entomology  |accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pathogenic fungus ''[[Entomophthora muscae]]'' causes a fatal disease in houseflies. After infection, the [[hypha|fungal hyphae]] grow throughout the body, killing the fly in about 5 days. Infected flies have been known to seek high temperatures that could suppress the growth of the fungus. Affected females tend to be more attractive to males, but the fungus-host interactions have not been fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.150941 |pmid=16332215 |url=http://socialevolution.ku.dk/papers/2006/roy2006.pdf |title=Bizarre Interactions and Endgames: Entomopathogenic Fungi and Their Arthropod Hosts |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=51 |pages=331–57 |year=2006 |last1=Roy |first1=H.

==Relationship with humans==

Flies are a nuisance, disturbing people at leisure and at work, but they are disliked principally because of their habits of contaminating foodstuffs. They alternate between breeding and feeding in dirty places with feeding on human foods, during which process they soften the food with saliva and deposit their faeces, creating a health hazard.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/resources/vector302to323.pdf |title=Houseflies |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fly larvae are as nutritious as [[fish meal]], and could be used to convert waste to [[aquaculture|feed for fish]] and [[animal husbandry|livestock]].&lt;ref name="QiuHussein2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Qiu |first1=Xinghui |last2=Hussein |first2=Mahmoud |last3=Pillai |first3=Viju V. |last4=Goddard |first4=Joshua M. |last5=Park |first5=Hui G. |last6=Kothapalli |first6=Kumar S. |last7=Ross|first7=Deborah A.|last8=Ketterings|first8=Quirine M. |last9=Brenna |first9=J.

Flies have been used in art and artefacts in many cultures. In 16th- and 17th-century European [[vanitas]] paintings, flies sometimes occur as ''[[memento mori]]''. They may also be used for other effects as in the Flemish painting, the ''[[Master of Frankfurt]]'' (1496). Fly amulets were popular in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=20, 27|author=Connor, Steven| publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2006| title=Fly |isbn=978-1861892942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/3246|title=Fly Pendants and Cylindrical and Spherical Beads, ca. 1539–1292 B.C.E.

During the [[Second World War]], the Japanese worked on [[entomological warfare]] techniques under [[Shirō Ishii]]. Japanese Yagi bombs developed at Pingfan consisted of two compartments, one with houseflies and another with a bacterial slurry that coated the flies prior to release. ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which causes cholera, was the bacterium of choice, and was used in China in [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]] in 1942, and in northern [[Shandong]] in 1943. Baoshan had been used by the Allies and bombing produced epidemics that killed 60,000 people in the initial stages reaching a radius of 200&amp;nbsp;km, which finally took a toll of 200,000 victims. The Shandong attack killed 210,000; the occupying Japanese troops had been [[vaccination|vaccinated]] in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lockwood |first1=Jeffrey A. |title=Insects as Weapons of War, Terror, and Torture|journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=57 |pages=205–227 |year=2012  |doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-120710-100618 |pmid=21910635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control===
[[File:Detail with fly 1742.png|thumb|left|Detail of a 1742 painting by [[Frans van der Mijn]] that uses a fly in a [[Renaissance]] allegory of touch theme]]
Flies can be controlled, at least to some extent, by physical, chemical, or biological means. Physical controls include screening with small mesh or the use of vertical strips of plastic or strings of beads in doorways to prevent entry of flies into buildings. Fans to create air movement or air barriers in doorways can deter flies from entering, and food premises often use ultraviolet light traps that electrocute insects. Sticky fly papers hanging from the ceiling can  also be effective.&lt;ref name=Service/&gt; Another approach is the elimination as far as possible of potential breeding sites. Keeping garbage in lidded containers and collecting it regularly and frequently, prevents any eggs laid from developing into adults. Unhygienic rubbish tips are a prime fly-breeding site, but if garbage is covered by a layer of soil, preferably daily, this can be avoided.&lt;ref name=Service/&gt;

Insecticides can be used. Larvicides kill the developing larvae, but large quantities may need to be used to reach areas below the surface. Aerosols can be used in buildings to "zap" flies, but outside applications are only temporarily effective. Residual sprays on walls or resting sites have a longer-lasting effect.&lt;ref name=Service/&gt; Many strains of housefly have become immune to the most commonly used [[insecticide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Georghiou, G.P.|author2= Hawley, M.K. |title=Insecticide resistance resulting from sequential selection of houseflies in the field by organophosphorus compounds |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=43–51 |year=1971 |pmid=5316852 |pmc=2427889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keiding, J. |year=1975 |title=Problems of housefly (''Musca domestica'') control due to multiresistance to insecticides |journal=Journal of Hygiene, Epidemiology, Microbiology, and Immunology |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=340–355 |pmid=52667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several means of [[biological pest control]] have been investigated. These include the introduction of another species, the [[Hermetia illucens|black soldier fly]] (''Hermetia illucens''), whose larvae compete with those of the housefly for resources.&lt;ref name=DeBach&gt;{{cite book|author1=DeBach, Paul|author2=Rosen, David|title=Biological Control by Natural Enemies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6dOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 |year=1991|publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=978-0-521-39191-7 |page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[dung beetle]]s to churn up the surface of a manure heap and render it unsuitable for breeding is another approach.&lt;ref name=DeBach/&gt; Augmentative biological control by releasing parasitoids can be used, but flies breed so fast that the natural enemies are unable to keep up.&lt;ref name=Capinera&gt;{{cite book|author=Capinera, John L.|title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA1880 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |page=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In science===

The ease of culturing houseflies, and the relative ease of handling them when compared to the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila]]'', have made them useful as model organism for use in laboratories. The American entomologist [[Vincent Dethier]], in his humorous ''To Know A Fly'' (1962), pointed out that as a laboratory animal, houseflies did not trouble anyone sensitive to animal cruelty. Houseflies have a small number of chromosomes, haploid six or diploid 12.&lt;ref&gt;West (1951):96.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the somatic tissue of the housefly consists of long-lived postmitotic cells, it can be used as an informative model system for understanding [[DNA damage theory of aging|cumulative age-related cellular alterations]]. Oxidative DNA damage 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine &lt;!-- (8-OHdG) --&gt; in houseflies was found in one study to increase with age and reduce life expectancy supporting the hypothesis that oxidative molecular damage is a causal factor in senescence (aging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Agarwal, S. |author2= Sohal, R.

The housefly is an object of biological research, partly for its variable [[Sex-determination system|sex-determination]] mechanism. Although a wide variety of sex-determination mechanisms exists in nature (e.g. male and female [[heterogamy]], [[haplodiploidy]], environmental factors), the way sex is determined is usually fixed within a [[species]]. The housefly is, however, thought to exhibit multiple mechanisms for sex determination, such as male heterogamy (like most [[insect]]s and [[mammal]]s), female heterogamy (like birds), and maternal control over offspring sex. The exact mechanism of sex determination involved is unresolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dübendorfer, A. |author2= Hediger, M|author3= Burghardt, G|author4= Bopp, D |title=''Musca domestica'', a window on the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms in insects |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology|year=2002 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=75–79 |pmid=11902690}}&lt;/ref&gt; but sexual differentiation is controlled as in other insects by an ancient [[evolutionary developmental biology|developmental switch]], [[doublesex]], which is regulated by the [[transformer (gene)|transformer]] protein in many different insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verhulst |first1=Eveline C. |last2=van de Zande |first2=Louis |last3=Beukeboom |first3=Leo W. |title=Insect sex determination: it all evolves around ''transformer'' |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |date=August 2010 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=376–383 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2010.05.001 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X10000791}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antimicrobial peptides produced by housefly maggots are of pharmacological interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/aesa/saw083|title=Flourishing in Filth: House Fly–Microbe Interactions Across Life History|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America|volume=110|pages=6|year=2017|last1=Nayduch|first1=Dana|last2=Burrus|first2=Roxanne G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Impertinent Insect]]'' is a group of five fables, sometimes ascribed to [[Aesop]], concerning an insect, in one version a fly, which puffs itself up to seem important. In the Biblical [[Plagues of Egypt|fourth plague of Egypt]], [[fly|flies]] represent death and decay, while the [[Philistine]] god [[Beelzebub]]'s name may mean "lord of the flies".&lt;ref&gt;"The etymology of Beelzebul has proceeded in several directions. The variant reading Beelzebub (Syriac translators and Jerome) reflects a long-standing tradition of equating Beelzebul with the Philistine deity of the city of Ekron mentioned in 2 Kgs 1:2, 3, 6, 16. Baalzebub (Heb ba˓al zĕbûb) seems to mean "lord of flies" (HALAT, 250, but cf. LXXB baal muian theon akkarōn, "Baal-Fly, god of Akkaron"; Ant 9:2, 1 theon muian).", Lewis, "Beelzebul", in Freedman, D.N. (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (639).

[[Ogden Nash]]'s humorous two-line 1942 poem "God in His wisdom made the fly/And then forgot to tell us why." indicates the debate about the value of biodiversity, given that even those considered by humans as pests have their place in the world's ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henschel, Joh R. |title=Toktok Talkie: Ancient Mariner to Zophosis Moralesi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sFRCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2015 |publisher=Wordweaver Publishing House |isbn=978-99945-82-04-4 |page=6 |quote=Ogden Nash was neither the first nor the last person to puzzle about the value of the fly, not only because flies are frequently considered a nuisance, but also because biodiversity in general is a puzzle. Nash's question can also be interpreted as going to the heart of conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incredible India''' (styled as '''&lt;span style="font-family:serif;font-size:larger"&gt;Incredıble&lt;span style="margin-left:2px"&gt;!ndıa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;''') is the name of an international tourism campaign maintained by the [[Government of India]] since 2002, to promote [[tourism in India]] to an audience of global appeal.

The "Incredible India" title was officially branded and promoted by [[Amitabh Kant]], the then Joint Secretary under the [[Ministry of Tourism (India)|Union Ministry of Tourism]], in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sunil|first=Amitabh Kant|title=Branding India : an incredible story|date=2009|publisher=Collins Business, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers India, a joint venture with the India Today Group|location=Noida|isbn=978-81-7223-809-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itimes.com/brands/incredible-india/followers Followers of Incredible India Interest | itimes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing campaign ==
In 2002, India's Ministry of Tourism launched a campaign to promote India as a popular tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.incredibleindia.org/newsite/cms_page.asp?pageid=2746 | title=Articles - Incredible India Interview | publisher=TIMES NEWS NETWORK | date=2005-03-22 | accessdate=2011-03-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726174312/http://www.incredibleindia.org/newsite/cms_page.asp?pageid=2746 | archivedate=26 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "Incredible India" was adopted as a slogan by the ministry. Before 2002, the Indian government had regularly formulated policies and prepared pamphlets and brochures for the promotion of tourism, however, it had not supported tourism in a concerted fashion. In 2002, the tourism ministry made a conscious effort to bring in more professionalism in its attempts to promote tourism. It formulated an integrated communication strategy with the aim of promoting India as a destination of choice for the discerning traveller. The tourism ministry engaged the services of advertising and marketing firm [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] (O&amp;M) India to create a new campaign to increase tourist inflows into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Webdeveloper |url=http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Marketing/The%20'Incredible%20India'%20Campaign%20-%20Marketing.htm |title=The 'Incredible India' Campaign: Marketing India to the World &amp;#124; Marketing Case Studies &amp;#124; Business Marketing Management Cases &amp;#124; Case Study |publisher=Icmrindia.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign portrayed India as an attractive tourist destination by showcasing different aspects of Indian culture and history like yoga, spirituality, etc. The campaign was conducted globally and received appreciation from tourism industry observers and travellers alike. However, the campaign also attracted criticism from some quarters. Some observers felt that it had failed to cover several aspects of India which would have been attractive to the average tourist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Webdeveloper |url=http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Marketing/The%20'Incredible%20India'%20Campaign.htm#Introduction |title=The 'Incredible India' Campaign: Marketing India to the World &amp;#124; Marketing Case Studies &amp;#124; Business Marketing Management Cases &amp;#124; Case Study |publisher=Icmrindia.org |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Ministry of Tourism launched a campaign targeted at the local population to educate them regarding good behaviour and etiquette when dealing with foreign tourists. Indian actor [[Aamir Khan]] was commissioned to endorse the campaign which was titled "[[Atithi Devo Bhava|Atithidevo Bhava]]", [[Sanskrit]] for "Guests are like God". Atithidevo Bhava was aimed at creating awareness about the effects of tourism and sensitising the local population about preservation of India's heritage, culture, cleanliness and hospitality. It also attempted to instil a sense of responsibility towards tourists and reinforce the confidence of foreign tourists towards India as a preferred holiday destination. The concept was designed to complement the Incredible India campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://65.175.64.197/industry/Tourism/20090129_aamir_khan.html |title=domain-b.com : Aamir Khan in Incredible India campaign |publisher=65.175.64.197 |date=2009-01-29 |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G503ywF9?url=http://65.175.64.197/industry/Tourism/20090129_aamir_khan.html |archivedate=22 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Minister of tourism, [[Selja Kumari|Kumari Selja]] unveiled plans to extend the Incredible India campaign to the domestic tourism sector as well. [[United States dollar|US$]]12 million out of a total budget of US$200 million was allocated in 2009 for the purpose of promoting domestic tourism.

In 2015, Aamir Khan, whose comments on perceived intolerance in the country had created a controversy, ceased to be the mascot for the Incredible India campaign when the contract for it expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aamir Khan no more 'Incredible India' mascot|url=http://www.abplive.in/movies/aamir-khan-no-more-incredible-india-mascot-270562|website=ABP Live|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[brand ambassador]] of Incredible India was [[Narendra Modi]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's official. Modi to be Incredible India's brand ambassador |url=http://m.indiatoday.in/story/modi-incredible-india-brand-ambassador-tourism-ministry/1/744153.html |publisher=India Today |date=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, veteran actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] &amp; actress [[Priyanka Chopra]] were chosen as the new brand ambassadors for the Incredible India campaign.

==Impact on Indian tourism==
[[File:Maharaja Express Índia.jpg|thumb|[[Maharajas' Express]], a train which travels the famous Indian sites. The train was launched by [[Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation|IRCTC]].]]
According to spending data released by [[Visa Inc.|Visa Asia Pacific]] in March 2006, India has emerged as the fastest growing market in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region in terms of international tourist spending. The data revealed that international tourists spent US$372 million in India in the fourth quarter (October–December) of 2005, 25% more than in the fourth quarter of 2004. China, which came second in the region, managed to raise US$784 million from international tourism in Q4 2005, a growth of 23% over its Q4 2004 figures. The tourist spending figures for India would have satisfied the Indian tourism ministry, which had been targeting the high-end market through its long running Incredible India communication campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Webdeveloper |url=http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Marketing/The%20'Incredible%20India'%20Campaign.htm |title=The 'Incredible India' Campaign: Marketing India to the World &amp;#124; Marketing Case Studies &amp;#124; Business Marketing Management Cases &amp;#124; Case Study |publisher=Icmrindia.org |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Reception==
Indian travel industry analysts and tour operators were appreciative of the high standards of the Incredible India campaign. "The promo campaign is making a powerful visual impact and creating a perception of India being a magical place to visit," said Anne Morgaon Scully, President, McCabe Bremer Travel, [[Virginia|Virginia, U.S.]] Average travelers too appeared to find the campaign interesting and informative, going by favourable comments on blogs on travel websites. Although Incredible India was generally well received, industry observers differed in their opinions on the positioning of India in the campaign. G.S.Murari, Director, Fidelis Advertising and Marketing Private Ltd. stated that he was uncomfortable with the tagline "Incredible India" and was of the opinion that since India was not a uni-dimensional country like [[Singapore]] or the [[Maldives]], using a word like 'incredible' to describe India as a whole was not appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Webdeveloper |url=http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Marketing/The%20'Incredible%20India'%20Campaign%20-%20Marketing%20Case.htm |title=The 'Incredible India' Campaign: Marketing India to the World &amp;#124; Marketing Case Studies &amp;#124; Business Marketing Management Cases &amp;#124; Case Study |publisher=Icmrindia.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Arjun Sharma, Managing Director, Le Passage to India, stated that the campaign had lived its life and needed to be reinvented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/199798/incredible-india-campaign-has-run.html |title='Incredible India' campaign has run its course: Experts |publisher=Deccanherald.com |date=2011-10-22 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ministry of Tourism again engaged Ogilvy &amp; Mather for a period of three years, starting in 2012, to redefine the brand and provide a strategic vision for the campaign.

In 2013, Incredible India, Ministry of Tourism partnered with WoNoBo.com to launch [http://incredibleindia.org/walking-tours/walking-tours-in-india.html Walking Tours],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fonearena.com/tech/india/wonobo-com-indias-first-360-degree-street-view-launched/5148/ WoNoBo.com India’s first 360-degree street view launched&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191856/http://www.fonearena.com/tech/india/wonobo-com-indias-first-360-degree-street-view-launched/5148/ |date=2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an online experience where users navigate and route their way through cities based on a choice of themes.

[[Parvez Dewan]] Secretary, Ministry of Tourism launched a personalised itinerary planner called [[Tripigator]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=TBM Staff|title=MoT partners with Worth Your Holidays to launch real-time travel planner, Tripigator.com|url=http://www.travelbizmonitor.com/mot-partners-with-worth-your-holidays-to-launch-realtime-travel-planner-tripigatorcom-23904|accessdate=21 July 2014|work=Travel Biz Monitor|date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tripigator.com Launched in Partnership with Incredible India|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=104992|work=Press Information Bureau|agency=Government of India|date=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a website aimed at providing all travel itineraries in one tab to reduce travellers' efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Travel planning portal tripigator.com launched|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/features/smartbuy/travel-planning-portal-tripigatorcom-launched/article5978792.ece|accessdate=21 July 2014|work=The Hindu Business Line|publisher=The Hindu|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6794">'''Linus's Law''' is a claim about [[software development]], named in honor of [[Linus Torvalds]] and formulated by [[Eric S. Raymond]] in his essay and book ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar |first=Eric S. |last=Raymond |authorlink=Eric S. Raymond |year= | work=catb.org |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar |first=Eric S. |last=Raymond |year=1999 |page=30 | publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |isbn=1-56592-724-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6qgFtLwpJgC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law states that "given enough eyeballs, all [[software bug|bug]]s are shallow"; or more formally: "Given a large enough [[beta test|beta-tester]] and co-[[programmer|developer]] base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone." Presenting the code to multiple developers with the purpose of reaching consensus about its acceptance is a simple form of [[software review]]ing. Researchers and practitioners have repeatedly shown{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} the effectiveness of various types of reviewing process in finding bugs and security issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Charles P. |last=Pfleeger|first2= Shari Lawrence |last2=Pfleeger|title=Security in Computing, 4th Ed. |isbn=0-13-239077-9 |pages=154–157 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] PTR |year=2003 |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3VB-zspJo4C&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also that {{citation span|text=[[code review]]s may be more efficient than testing|date=September 2015}}.

== Validity ==
In ''Facts and Fallacies about Software Engineering,'' [[Robert L. Glass|Robert Glass]] refers to the law as a "mantra" of the [[open source]] movement, but calls it a fallacy due to the lack of supporting evidence and because research has indicated that the rate at which additional bugs are uncovered does not scale linearly with the number of reviewers; rather, there is a small maximum number of useful reviewers, between two and four, and additional reviewers above this number uncover bugs at a much lower rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glass |first=Robert L. |title=Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering |isbn=0-321-11742-5 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |page=174 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ntz-UJzZN0C&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;f=false}} {{ISBN|978-0321117427}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  While closed-source practitioners also promote stringent, independent [[code analysis]] during a software project's development, they focus on in-depth review by a few and not primarily the number of "eyeballs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard |first=Michael |last2=LeBlanc |first2=David |title=Writing Secure Code, 2nd. Ed. |pages=44–45, 615 |isbn=0-7356-1722-8 |publisher=[[Microsoft Press]] |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=1jAVTYK1CI7EsAPilv3GAg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=Uafp7m2wPcMC&amp;dq=Writing+Secure+Code&amp;q=review#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Leblanc.

Although detection of even deliberately inserted flaws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/57135/|title=An attempt to backdoor the kernel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/|title=The Linux Backdoor Attempt of 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be attributed to Raymond's claim, the persistence of the [[Heartbleed]] security bug in a critical piece of code for two years has been considered as a refutation of Raymond's dictum.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Byfield, "Does Heartbleed Disprove 'Open Source is Safer'?", ''[[Datamation]]'', April 14, 2014 [http://www.datamation.com/open-source/does-heartbleed-disprove-open-source-is-safer-1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward W. Felten, Joshua A. Kroll, "Heartbleed Shows Government Must Lead on Internet Security" = "Help Wanted on Internet Security", ''[[Scientific American]]'' '''311''':1 (June 17, 2014) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heartbleed-shows-government-must-lead-on-internet-security1/] {{doi|10.1038/scientificamerican0714-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bugs Aren't Shallow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heartbleed matter" /&gt; Larry Seltzer suspects that the availability of source code may cause some developers and researchers to perform less extensive tests than they would with [[closed source]] software, making it easier for bugs to remain.&lt;ref name="Heartbleed matter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/did-open-source-matter-for-heartbleed/|title=Did open source matter for Heartbleed?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, the [[Linux Foundation]]'s executive director Jim Zemlin argued that the complexity of modern software has increased to such levels that specific resource allocation is desirable to improve its security. Regarding some of 2014's largest global open source [[software vulnerabilities]], he says, "In these cases, the eyeballs weren't really looking".&lt;ref name="Bugs Aren't Shallow"&gt;{{cite web | title=Why All Linux (Security) Bugs Aren't Shallow | date=February 20, 2015 | first=Sean Michael | last=Kerner | publisher=eSecurity Planet | url=http://www.esecurityplanet.com/open-source-security/why-all-linux-security-bugs-arent-shallow.html | accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale experiments or peer-reviewed surveys to test how well the mantra holds in practice have not been performed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9530">[[Nuclear pulse propulsion]] is a common feature of [[hard science fiction]] stories, as the idea offers high thrust and/or high [[specific impulse]] [[spacecraft propulsion|drives]] without requiring new physics.

==Books==
* The 1951 novel ''[[Wine of the Dreamers]]'', by [[John D. MacDonald]], involves the development of a hybrid interstellar ship. Its spacetime-warp drive cannot be used near planets, so the ship would leave Earth by feeding pellets into a "critical mass chamber" of 20 Mohs hardness.
* An early appearance of an Orion-style nuclear pulse propelled rocket in science fiction was in the science fiction novel ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' written by [[A. E. van Vogt]] in 1956. In this novel there is a post-atomic-war interplanetary empire called the Empire of Lynn that uses Orion-type nuclear rockets for interplanetary spaceflight. In the story the past atomic war was an interstellar war fought between humans and hostile aliens from another star somewhere between 800 and 8000 years before.
* A manned mission to [[Venus]] on a ship using Orion-like [[Earth (Noon Universe)#Interstellar Transport|photon engine]] is a core of 1960 science fiction novel ''[[The Land of Crimson Clouds]]'', written by the [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky|Strugatsky brothers]].
* Early versions of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' featured a version of the spaceeship ''[[Discovery One]]'' using this drive. The final vehicle did not use this idea since [[Stanley Kubrick]] decided that showing the ship accelerate by a 'put-put' method might be "too comic" for film, as well as the fact that it might be seen as him having embraced nuclear weapons after his prior film, ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke]], ''[[The Lost Worlds of 2001]]'', pp. 124-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] has references to the Orion drive.
* An Orion spaceship features prominently in the [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Footfall]]'' by [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]. In the face of an alien siege/invasion of Earth, the humans must resort to drastic measures to get a fighting ship into orbit to face the alien fleet.
* In the novel ''[[King David's Spaceship]]'' by [[Jerry Pournelle]] inhabitants of a planet that is to be re-admitted to the [[CoDominium|Empire]] plot to build the spaceship based on an Orion project concept in order to qualify their planet as a higher-developed, Class One Imperial world. However, this craft uses non-nuclear explosives.
* [[Poul Anderson]]'s novel ''[[Orion Shall Rise]]'' features a post-collapse confederation gathering forbidden nuclear materials for some unknown end—although the title gives away the true nature of their mysterious project.
* In ''[[The Stone Dogs]]'' by [[S. M. Stirling]], Orion spacecraft are created during an arms race between the Domination of the [[The Domination|Draka]] and the Alliance for Democracy, and used by both sides in their explorations of the solar system and as warships. The drive itself features as an improvised weapon in the book, being used to keep other ships at a distance.
* In the book ''[[The Shiva Option]]'' by [[David Weber]] and [[Steve White (science fiction)|Steve White]], an arachnid homeworld is destroyed by converting several asteroids into Orion-drive starships and launching them at it.
*Orion was used by [[Michael P. Kube-McDowell]] in ''[[Emprise]]'', the first book of the [[Trigon Disunity]] series.
*The speculative fiction novel ''[[Anathem]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]] features a spacecraft that travels between different dimensions and uses an Orion-style propulsion system. This ship, the [[Daban Urnud]], is discovered by observing the nuclear explosions used to modify its orbit.
*[[Dan Simmons]]' novel ''Olympos'' describes an Orion-style spaceship, designed by the Moravec machine race to emulate 21st century human technology.
*The 1977 short story and [[Hugo Award|Hugo-award]] winner 'Tricentennial' by [[Joe Haldeman]] featured the Daedelus (or [[John F. Kennedy]], or [[Leonid Brezhnev]] - apparently spaceships are also prone to renaming), which was powered by nuclear bombs.
*In [[Vernor Vinge]]'s novel ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'', bobble technology makes this method of travel safe.
*In his 1981 anthology ''Cepheïde'', Dutch SF/Fantasy author [[Tais Teng]] describes a ship with Orion propulsion as one of the most primitive and wasteful methods of interstellar flight, still only achieved by a tiny minority of all intelligent races in the universe. The ship is said to be the last relic of an unknown race exterminated by the dominant YiYiki (descendants of the [[humpback whales]]).
*In the [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]] novel ''The Golden Globe'', the wreck of an Orion spaceship is converted to an interstellar starship.
*John Varley's ''[[Steel Beach]]'' sets several scenes near or within the bulk of the "Robert A. Heinlein," an Orion-style ship which was built and then abandoned when humanity lapsed into apathy for stellar exploration.
*[[Chris Berman]]'s novel, ''The Hive'', involves the use of a ground-launched Orion spacecraft by the People's Republic of China in a gamble to reach an alien artifact in orbit between Jupiter and Saturn before the crew of a spacecraft built by the United States and Russia can reach it first. The novel has been banned in China until "these references are removed" which shows how sensitive the whole subject of nuclear bomb propulsion still is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200902/1235368674.html |title=China Bars Sales of Chris Berman's Novel, The Hive - Breaking news in actress sharon,berman,China, The Hive |publisher=Free-press-release.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s novel ''[[Ark (Baxter novel)|Ark]]'' a starship Ark One is built to save a small group of people as Earth drowns under a global flood. It launches and performs the first phase of its mission using a version of Orion. This version is ground-launched though owing to the situation (the entire planet is about to drown anyway) environmental concerns are set aside.
*In the books ''[[Ilium (novel)|Ilium]]'' and ''[[Olympos (novel)|Olympos]]'' by [[Dan Simmons]] a space ship with Orion thrust is used to travel through the Solar System over the course of a week.
*In the book ''Citadel'' by [[John Ringo]], an Orion Drive is used to upgrade the 9&amp;nbsp;km diameter Battlestation Troy into a mobile spaceship.

==Other media==

* The ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky]]" features a [[generation ship]], constructed out of a hollowed-out iron asteroid, propelled using "Orion class nuclear pulse engines" in which fission bombs were detonated in shafts.  It appeared to have been traveling for about 10,000 years, and had travelled about 30 [[light years]] on its own power.
* The ''[[Space: 1999]]'' episode "[[Voyager's Return]]" featured a fictional nuclear drive probe called "''[[List of Space: 1999 vehicles#Voyager One/Voyager Two|Voyager One]]''", powered by the life-destroying "Queller Drive", which killed all the life forms on two of the Federated Worlds of Sidon. The episode centers on the Sidons's seek for revenge against Earth.
* In the FOX television series ''[[Virtuality (TV series)|Virtuality]]'', ''Phaeton'' (Earth's first starship) is propelled by an Orion drive.
* In the backstory for the video game ''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]'', the [[sleeper ship]] is propelled by an Orion-type drive, the shield of which fails (almost certainly due to [[sabotage]]) when the ship is almost at its destination, causing the passengers on the colony ship to splinter into factions.
* The 1998 film ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' featured a spacecraft named ''Messiah'', which utilized the "Orion drive" and appears to be a variant of nuclear detonation propulsion. In the film, the drive is credited to the Russians.
*The 2006 movie ''Earthstorm'' with [[Steven Baldwin]] and [[Dirk Benedict]]. The crew sent to the moon used nuclear pulse to get to there faster than conventional means.
* The ''Orion'' concept is used in the series premiere of ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien]]'' for Earth's first interstellar spaceship.
* In ''[[Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam]]'', the GRYPS-2 laser cannon and the asteroid base Axis use Orion-type drives.
* While it never comes up in the actual show, in the DVD extras for ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', [[Joss Whedon]] mentions that his idea for the "full burn" propulsion in the title spacecraft class was a directed nuclear detonation.
* The 2011 movie ''Attack of the Moon Zombies'' features an "Orion Atomic Pulse Rocket" that transports people and supplies to a lunar base.  The model was based on the lunar ferry design described in a Project Orion report.
*The 2014 Syfy Channel miniseries ''[[Ascension (TV series)|Ascension]]'' is based on a Project Orion generation ship being built in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=Deadline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/07/jason-blum-ascension-syfy-not-low-budget-tv-series/|title=TCA: Syfy's 'Ascension' Departs From Jason Blum's Microbudget Film Formula|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Melanau calendar''' ({{lang-ms|Bulan Melanau}}) is a [[calendar]] used by the [[Melanau people]] of [[Borneo]]. Its year consists of 12 [[lunar month|months]]. The first month, ''Pengejin'', signifies the celebration of the [[Kaul festival]] (a giving of thanks for the preceding year, with prayers for the year ahead). Each month in the Melanau calendar consists of 30 days. It is guided by the constellations, natural phenomena and [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]]s. Each month is named for occurrences during the month or events which are supposed to have occurred during that particular month, according to [[legend]]. The rise and fall of the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]] and the [[star]]s determine the time for planting, harvesting, fishing, building, [[travel]] and marriage.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

=={{anchor|Melanau Universe|Structure of the Calendar|The Name of the Months}}Melanau universe==
The Melanau concept of the [[universe]] is a multilayered one, in which the territories of all should be respected and a balance maintained. Hence, it is important to be aware of one's surroundings: changes in the [[weather]], the wind, the tides and the position of the [[constellation]]s. The Melanau calendar is a guide for daily activities such as [[fishing]], [[planting]], [[harvesting]], homebuilding and [[marriage]], because the [[calendar]] is guided by the constellations and the ways of nature, spirits and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learn-melanau.blogspot.com/2011/01/melanau-calendar.html|title=The Melanau Calendar|date=January 28, 2011|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Pengejin'':
This month coincides with the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] month of March. During this month it is windy; light rain showers fall during the early part of the month. The wind gradually strengthens, the sun moves north and the moon replaces the original position of the sun. Fish are plentiful in forest ponds, as they search for food; afterwards, they again go into hiding. ''Bulan Pengejin'' marks the beginning of the year. Since it is difficult for the Melanau to work outdoors because of the strong wind, they spend their time indoors cleaning the tools of their trades. At the end of the month, the Melanau purify themselves and call the fish from the beaches and river mouths in a ceremony known as ''[[Kaul festival|Kaul]]''. The Melanau build a large swing (known as a ''Tibow''); during its construction they sing the ''tibow'' song, seeking the blessings of their guardian gods for plentiful flowers, bountiful harvests of fruits and fish and the removal of illness and evil. They send offerings (known as ''Seraheng'') out to sea to appease the gods and invite them to the feast. After the feast, leftover food and drink is left by the shore for the guardians spirits to take with them; nothing is kept.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

;''Pengelawah Umik'':
This second month coincides with the month of April. During ''Pengelawah Umik'', it is said that all the fish will come down to the sea; the sea turns a greenish color, a call to the fish that it is time to surface. For the Melanau, this month begins the fishing season. Melanau fishermen were formerly known for their ''barong panau'', a fishing sailboat which could go out to sea for weeks on end and doubled as a travel and trade boat. The ''barong panau'' is no longer used, since the skills to build them have been lost. A picture of the boat may be found a [[Sarawak#Brooke Dynasty|Brooke-era]] [[postage stamp]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

;''Pengelawah Ayeng'':
The third month coincides with the month of May, when the emerald-greenish sea color first observed in ''Pengelawah Umik'' reaches the shore and the fishing season reaches its peak. Towards the end of this month, the sea loses its opaque green color and the sea floor will be visible from the surface; fishing becomes more challenging at the end of the first fishing season, which concludes at the beginning of ''Paka Umik'', when winds and rain make fishing impossible.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

;''Paka Umik'':
The fourth month coincides with the month of June, when the [[Pleiades|Seven Sisters]] appear in the skies. According to legend the west wind blows hard, to arrange the stars in the sky. During this month the Melanau go into the forest and begin the planting season, cutting large trees and vines and planting their crops. The farmers will continue their jungle-clearing work until the beginning of the next month, ''Paka Ayeng''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

;''Paka Ayeng'':
The fifth month coincides with July. The Seven Sisters are high in the sky, and the [[Orion's Belt|Three Stars]] appear lower in the sky. The wind blows with [[gale]] force; all [[farming]] and fishing activities cease for the month (due to the strong winds) until the next month, ''Pelepa''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

;''Pelepa'':
The sixth month coincides with August. The Three Stars replace the Seven Sisters, rising high in the sky. The wind drops; the sea is calm and the second fishing season begins before the long [[monsoon]] (''suloh''), when no work can be done due to wind and heavy rain. This fishing season lasts until the beginning of the next month, ''Pegalan''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

;''Pegalan'':
The seventh month coincides with September. The sea remains calm, but little fishing is done since the fish are spawning. ''Pegalan'' is named for the [[North Star|''Pegalan'' (North) Star]], which is high in the sky in the evening. Legend has it that this is the month when the Melanau find it difficult to "swallow their saliva" (look for food). Marriage is taboo during this month, since it is believed it would lead to difficulty making a living.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

;''Suwah'':
The eighth month coincides with October. During ''Suwah'', the ground seems to rise like waves; according to Melanau belief this is caused by fish swimming back to the ocean, their fins resembling waves. ''Suwah'' marks the third (and final) fishing season for the year; it is also the time to start planting [[rice]], [[Metroxylon sagu|sago palm]] and other crops. In Melanau tradition, as the earth grows so will the crops that are planted.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

;''Pidai'':
The ninth month, coinciding with November, is the beginning of the monsoon season (''suloh''). Strong winds begin to blow, shifting the location (it is believed) of the sun and moon (called ''bulan tenggara'', the southeast moon). It is the end of the fishing season; in the morning the sea is calm, but by afternoon the waves will be high.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

;''Penangaih'':
The tenth month coincides with December. It is the time when rains come, allowing flowers to blossom and fruits to bear in the forest.

;''Pemalei'':
The eleventh month coincides with January. Legend has it that long a [[shaman]] was beheaded by his wife. His head disappeared from the house (becoming the Taboo Star) and the month is named for the killing of the shaman. During this month all activity (marriage, fishing, planting and homebuilding) is taboo, and ''Pemalei'' is regarded as a month of misfortune.

;''Pengesiseng'':
''Pengesiseng'' coincides with the month of February. Strong winds bring heavy rain, blowing flowers off trees and uprooting them; floodwaters then bring them to the sea, where they are pushed ashore by huge waves. The wind blows branches and [[frond]]s of the [[coconut]], sago palms and other trees, opening them to resemble the gills of a fish (hence its name). ''Pengesiseng'' marks the end of the Melanau year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johan1960.blogspot.com/2008/05/melanau-calendar.html|title=The Melanau Calendar|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hatnote|This article is about the philosophical theory, for the potential anatomic space, see [[Mental space (anatomy)]].}}
The '''mental space''' is a theoretical construct proposed by [[Gilles Fauconnier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics An introduction|last=Evans|first=Vyvyan|authorlink=Vyvyan Evans|last2=Green|first2=Melanie|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2014|isbn=0 7486 1832 5|location=Edinburgh|pages=|chapter=Meaning constructions and mental spaces}}&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to [[possible world]]s in [[truth-conditional semantics]]. The main difference between a mental space and a possible world is that a mental space does not contain a faithful representation of reality, but an [[idealized cognitive model]].&lt;ref name="Fauconnier, 1994"&gt;{{cite book | title=Mental Spaces: Aspects of Meaning Construction in Natural Language| last=Fauconnier| first=Gilles| year=1994| pages=240| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building of mental spaces and establishment of mappings between those mental spaces are the two main processes involved in construction of meaning.&lt;ref name="Evans and Green"&gt;{{cite book | title=Cognitive Linguistics An Introduction| last=Evans| first=Vyvyan |authorlink=Vyvyan Evans|author2=Melanie Green| year=2006| pages=394| publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is one of the basic components in Gilles Fauconnier and [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]]'s [[Conceptual blending|blending theory]], a theory within [[Cognitive semantics]].

== Base space and built space ==
Base space, also known as reality space, presents the interlocutors' shared knowledge of the real world.&lt;ref name="Croft and Cruse"&gt;{{cite book | title=Cognitive Linguistics| last=Croft| first=William|author2=D. Alan Cruse| year=2004| pages=33| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space builders are elements within a sentence that establish spaces distinct from, yet related to the base space constructed.&lt;ref name="Croft and Cruse"/&gt; Space builders can be expressions like prepositional phrases, adverbs, connectives, and subject-verb combinations that are followed by an embedded sentence. They require hearers to establish scenarios beyond the present point of time.&lt;ref name="Evans and Green"/&gt;  A built space depicts a situation that only holds true for that space itself, but may or may not be true in reality.  The base space and built spaces are occupied by elements that map onto each other. These elements include categories that may refer to specific entities in those categories. According to Fauconnier's Access Principle, specific entities of a category in a space can be described by its counterpart category in another space even if it differs from the specific entity in the other space.&lt;ref name="Croft and Cruse"/&gt; An example of a built space can be seen in the example " Mary wants to buy a book". In this case, the built space is not that of reality, but Mary's desire space. Though the book in reality space refers to any book in general, it can still be used to describe the book in Mary's desire space, which may or may not be a specific book.

== Foundation and expansion space ==
‘if A then B’ sentences create another two spaces called foundation space and expansion space in addition to the base space.  The foundation space is a hypothetical space relative to the base space set up by the space builder "if". The expansion space is set up by the space builder "then". If the conditions in the foundation space hold, the expansion space follows.&lt;ref name="Evans and Green"/&gt;

'''''Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn''''' is a book by [[CUNY Graduate Center]] professor [[Cathy Davidson]] published by [[Viking Press]] on August 19, 2011.

==Summary and key themes==

===Outdated approaches to education===
In ''Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn,'' [[Cathy Davidson]] suggests that breakthroughs in [[cognitive science]] should recalibrate our sense of what it means to learn. According to Davidson, those of us in [[higher education]] are paradoxically obsessed with the implications of living in the "[[Information Age|digital age]]," even though we have “yet to rethink how we need to be organizing our institutions—our schools, our offices—to maximize the opportunities of our digital era” (12). We tend to uphold models of teaching and assessments that no longer serve a generation of students who face a myriad of new challenges, as they attempt to learn to think critically in an era of information overload. Technology in all its forms is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of students. Colleges and universities, therefore, need to pay attention to the impact that the appropriate uses of digital tools can have on extending, enhancing, and enriching the student learning experience, both on and off campus. Moreover, and more importantly, Davidson argues that sustained exposure to such a range of [[digital media]] demands a different kind of attention than we previously required.

===The science of attention===
In ''Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn'' Cathy Davidson examines the phenomenon of [[attention blindness]]: humans perceive only a fraction of everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the [[multi-task]] oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic [[neurological]] feature of the [[human brain]]. In the introduction of ''Now You See It,'' Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.

Davidson argues that as a culture, our attention blindness represents a significant challenge that we must examine and meet head on; particularly since the [[Internet]] has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now. The Internet, Davidson suggests, has catapulted us into an immediate, collaborative, and interconnected existence that is characterized by the sudden breakdown of barriers between private and public, work and play, domestic and foreign, office and home, etc. Davidson notes that although our lives have been irrevocably altered in these fundamental ways, our most important educational, corporate, and social institutions have not substantially changed in correlation with these upheavals. She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded to meet the challenges of [[industrialization]]) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes.

“With the Internet, we have seen dramatic rearrangements, in a little over a decade, in the most basic aspects of how we communicate, interact, gather knowledge of the world, develop and recognize our [[social networks]] and our communities, do business and exchange goods, understand what is true, and know what counts and is worthy of attention” (11).

“This book starts from certain core questions: 
*Where do our patterns of attention come from? 
*How can what we know about attention help us change how we teach and learn?
*How can the science of attention alter our ideas about how we test and what we measure?
*How can we work better with others with different skills and expertise in order to see what we're missing in a complicated and interdependent world? 
*How does attention change as we age, and how can understanding the science of attention actually help us along the way?” (19-20)

===Changing workplace===
Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way we learn and process new information in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between the ones we need to read and the ones we don't. In our work environments, we are forced to focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. &lt;blockquote&gt;"When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different. We should pay attention to that feeling… Distraction is one of the best tools for innovation we have at our disposal—for changing patterns of attention and beginning the process of learning new patterns"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Cathy|title=Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn|year=2011|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Re-imagined classroom===
In addition to transforming our workplace and everyday life, Davidson argues that technology allows us a great opportunity to rethink the way we teach and organize our education system. In addition to the famous iPod experiment described earlier, Davidson suggests that gaming, blogging, self-grading, and collaborative learning are among the effective and innovative teaching tools and strategies, whose benefits outweigh those offered by the "one-size-fits-all model of standards that evolved over the course of the twentieth century." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Cathy|title=Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn|year=2011|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the chapter, "Project Classroom Makeover," Davidson argues that the current education system is blind to the ways in which children learn and solve complex problems today, such as: creating and memorizing names and avatars of online game players, creating and writing simple codes to advance in games, searching internet for new information, and engaging with it in new creative ways. If the education system harnesses these natural curiosities through restructured curricula, it can promote creative and critical thinking and allow students to develop in their own, unique ways, rather than forcing them to fit into the standardized system of skills.

As an example of a Made-Over Classroom, Davidson discusses an experimental school [[Quest 2 Learn]]. Q2L is a school whose curriculum is based on the principles of gaming. There students don't just go from class to class, completing regular assignments, they participate in quests, aimed at solving complex problems, advancing from one level to another, culminating in a final project. This model, according to Davidson, has the potential to address the needs of children who are diagnosed with learning disabilities, such as [[ADHD]] or [[autism]], allowing them to learn in ways that focus on their individual strengths without forcing them into a standardized learning structure, which could be detrimental to their engagement and future achievements.

==Critical reception==

Davidson's ''Now You See It'' has received largely positive reviews. Publishers Weekly called ''Now You See It'' "critically important" and "likely to shape discussions for years to come,"&lt;ref&gt;Rev. of Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn. Publishers Weekly 01 Aug. 2011: n. pag. Publishers Weekly. Web. 26 Mar. 2014. &lt;http://reviews.publishersweekly.com/978-0-670-02282-3&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; while Howard Gardner of Harvard University celebrates Davidson for having "a mind that ranges comfortably over literary arts, literacy, psychology, and brain science" and predicts that her "timely book is certain to attract a lot of attention and to catalyze many discussions."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Now-You-See-Technology-Transform/dp/014312126X&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2015, Amazon.com rated the book 4 out of 5 stars, based on 45 separate reviews.

Although mainly positive, a few critical reactions question Davidson's "youth worship" and her "enthusiasm for anything new and digital and by an almost allergic aversion to any practices or artifacts from the pre-Internet era."&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Annie M. "Who's Afraid of Digital Natives? 22 4 0 Let's Not Get Intimidated by Kids and Their Internet Savvy." Rev. of Now You See It: How Technology and Brain Science Will Transform Schools and Business for the 21st Century. Slate 22 Aug. 2011: n. pag. Slate. 22 Aug. 2011. Web. 26 Mar. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a generally positive review of ''Now You See It,'' in the journal ''portal: Libraries and the Academy,'' Andrew Battista wrote "As inspiring as ''Now You See'' It can be, I would say that Davidson uncritically seeks to apply the doctrines of capitalist efficiency into contemporary learning. In fact, at times her vision of education seems to verge on a kind of fluency that will prepare people to compete in a new globalized economy rather than an altruistic experience that sees learning as the preparation of any fit participant in a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Battista. "Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn (review)." ''portal: Libraries and the Academy'' 12.1 (2012): 104-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathy Davidson herself revealed in a comment to an online article titled ''Open Access, Public Intellectualism, and Academic Reform'' that despite not being a neuroscientist herself, she has received only one and a half bad reviews from neuroscientists, while frequently receiving fan notes from other neuroscientists agreeing with her stance on the brain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hastac.org/blogs/trentmkays/2012/01/03/open-access-public-intellectualism-and-academic-reform&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson was appointed by President [[Barack Obama]] to a six-year term on the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/content/cathy-n-davidson National Endowment for the Humanities. Cathy Davidson. Web. 3/28/14]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Pick Me Up'''" is the eleventh episode of the first season of ''[[Masters of Horror]]''. It originally aired in [[North America]] on January 20, 2006. It was based on the short story by [[David Schow]].

==Plot ==

On a two-lane highway, two [[serial killer]]s clash in a [[wikt:turf war|turf war]]: one is named Wheeler ([[Michael Moriarty]]) who kills hitchhikers he picks up in his truck, and the other is named Walker ([[Warren Kole]]) who is a [[hitchhiker]] who murders whoever gives him a ride. Stacia ([[Fairuza Balk]]), a recently divorced woman, falls in between the battle of wits.
 
After a transport bus breaks down, Wheeler and Walker kill the driver and passengers &amp;mdash; save for Stacia, who left previously.  Fascinated, Wheeler and Walker examine each other's victims. Wheeler murders a woman ([[Laurene Landon]]) and hangs her body in the truck, and pistol whips and [[decapitation|decapitates]] a man with the sliding door of the luggage compartment. Walker garrotes the bus driver with a dead snake, shoots a passenger, leaves another passenger to die tied by her wrists to a tree and wrapped in [[barbed wire]] (whom Wheeler finds alive and taunts), slaughters a [[punk rock|punk]], and partially skins his girlfriend before killing her.

Later, at a roadside motel, the two [[psychopath]]s play head games with each other and Stacia, clashing over who will get to kill her. As she is leaving the motel, Wheeler offers her a ride then [[assault]]s her while driving, handcuffing her to the car. He finds Walker on the highway, standing in the lane, and brakes to a stop just before hitting him.  Walker accepts a ride, and the two bicker and draw their pistols, ready to kill Stacia and each other. Stacia, sitting in the middle, slams on the brakes and sends the two murderers through the windshield onto the road and causes the truck's cab to fall on its side. Stacia unsuccessfully struggles to get Wheeler's gun, while the wounded Wheeler and Walker fight to determine who will kill her as an ambulance siren sounds.

In the end, Wheeler and Walker are side by side in the ambulance, still fighting and cursing at one another. Finally, they cease and declare a truce.  Walker attempts to strike a deal with Wheeler as he points out how much fun the two of them could have with an ambulance, revealing that he still has his craft knife he used to torture the stoner's girlfriend. However, one of the EMTs rams syringes full of air into their chests, apparently killing them both. The new killer tells the driver that he plans to save Stacia (bound and gagged in an upper bunk of the ambulance) for later.

A number of scholars suggest that the Roman dessert's [[Byzantine cuisine|Eastern Roman (Byzantine)]] descendants, ''plakountas tetyromenous'' ("cheesy placenta") and ''koptoplakous'' ([[Byzantine Greek]]: κοπτοπλακοῦς), are the ancestors of modern [[tiropita]] ([[börek]] or [[banitsa]]) and [[baklava]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jYa3J6xrjt4C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=koptoplakous&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3KTkT_-0Coiw0AH6kNiACg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=koptoplakous&amp;f=false| Rena Salaman, "Food in Motion the Migration of Foodstuffs and Cookery Techniques" from the Oxford Symposium on Food Cookery, Vol. 2, p. 184]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = faas&gt;{{cite book |last=Faas |first=Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Around the Roman Table |year=2005 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXGlAr17oekC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=Placenta+as+food+Italy+bay+leaves&amp;ei=osZPStvpK4PcygS6nvXRAg |isbn=0226233472 | page = 184-185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speros Vryonis 1971, p. 482"&gt;[[Speros Vryonis]] ''The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor'', 1971, p. 482&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''placenta'' ({{lang-el|"πλατσέντα"}}) is used today on the island of [[Lesbos]] in Greece to describe a baklava-type dessert of layered pastry leaves containing crushed nuts that is baked and then covered in honey.&lt;ref name="Agia Paraskevi"&gt;ΠΟΛΙΤΙΣΤΙΚΟ ΙΔΡΥΜΑ ΟΜΙΛΟΥ ΠΕΙΡΑΙΩΣ, ''ΜΑΓΕΙΡΕΥΟΝΤΑΣ ΜΕ ΛΑΔΙ ΚΑΙ ΑΛΛΑ ΣΤΗΝ ΑΓΙΑ ΠΑΡΑΣΚΕΥΗ ΛΕΣΒΟΥ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostanistas.gr/?i=bostanistas.el.article&amp;id=3528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = cookbook&gt;{{cite book |last= Λούβαρη-Γιαννέτσου |first= Βασιλεία |title=Τα Σαρακοστιανά 50 συνταγές για τη Σαρακοστή και τις γιορτές'' (''Lent foods: 50 recipes for Lent and the holidays'') | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5U0iAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT161&amp;lpg=PT161&amp;dq=πλατσέντα&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gvDhAQ6nmy&amp;sig=hTgGtpI8hDKoMwSoKYw4pBpRlUg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiplfyR5dPOAhUQ6WMKHYx-D7o4ChDoAQhDMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=πλατσέντα&amp;f=false |year=2014 | quote = "Η πλατσέντα είναι σαν τον πλακούντα των αρχαίων Ελλήνων"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant of the Roman dish survived into the modern era as the Romanian [[plăcintă]] cake.

An '''entertainment promoter''' works in entertainment industries, including music and sports, as an individual or organization in the business of [[Promotion (marketing)|marketing and promoting]] live, or [[pay-per-view]] and similar, events, such as [[concert]]s/[[gig (musical performance)|gigs]], [[sports]] events, [[festival]]s, [[rave]]s, and [[nightclub]] performances.

== Description ==

=== Business model ===
Promoters are typically engaged as [[independent contractor]]s or representative companies by entertainment venues, earning a pre-arranged fee, or a share of revenues (colloquially known as a "cut" and "share of the house"), or both. A share of revenues is often a simple percentage of admission fees (called "the door") and/or food and drink sales, with many variations possible, such as minimums or maximums, allowances for various expenses, or limitations (such as only alcohol sales after midnight). Other promoters operate independently, renting venues for a fixed fee, or under a [[revenue sharing]] arrangement with the venue holder, thus keeping larger profits from successful events. One common arrangement for small venues is for the promoter to earn all of the admissions fees, while the venue retains all food and drink revenue.

Some venues have exclusive arrangements with a single promotion company, others work with multiple promoters on a rotating schedule (one night per week, for example), or on an event-by-event basis. Promoters often work together — either as equal partners, or as [[subcontractor]]s to each other's events. Several promoters may work together for a special event, such as a large [[New Year's Eve]] party in a hotel ballroom. They may also engage [[freelance]] hosts for their social influence; these amateur promoters market the events to their circle of friends and/or [[social media]] followers, in exchange for special treatment and/or free admission to the event and at times, and may form or be included in [[street team]]s that promote events at other live venues.

Minimally, an event promoter manages [[publicity]] and [[advertising]]. Depending on the arrangement, they may also handle [[security]], [[Ticket (admission)|ticket sales]], event admission (door policies), decorations, and booking of other entertainers. Many promoters are [[DJ]]s or [[musician]]s themselves, and may perform at their own events. Some bloggers and individuals with a large following on social media may consider themselves as promoters and charge fees promotional service via their social media platform(s), or through their efforts. 

Many musicians and artists act as de facto promoters for their own concerts, either directly or through their manager or [[Talent agent|booking company]]. Historically, promotion has been a [[cottage industry]], with companies operated by one or several well-connected charismatic individuals, often working part-time.  However, with the rise of corporate ownership of live entertainment assets, several large companies have emerged in the field.

=== Contracts and disputes ===
There are often disputes over money in the promotions industry because it is largely cash business with a history of corruption and uneven [[recordkeeping]].  In addition there are many [[accounting]] complexities to manage, particularly for large events: revenue, expenses, and  oversight of [[parking]], [[Cloakroom|coat checks]], [[Concession (contract)|concession]] vendor sales (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[compact disc|CDs]] and [[t-shirt]]s), [[box office]] so-called "[[convenience fee]]s", [[in kind]] trades, promotional give-away items used to lure guests (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;free drinks), costs for [[insurance]], [[janitor|cleaning]] staff, and so on. One area of frequent contention are [[quid pro quo]] [[cross-promotion]]s, where the promoter or some other party connected with the venue will obtain a favor (for example, a price discount) in exchange for giving a future favor to the vendor. If the existence of the scheme, or the relationship between the parties, is undisclosed this may become a form of [[bribery]].  Another opportunity for misunderstanding are the various "lists" of guests who will be admitted for free or with VIP treatment, and the "door policy" used by bouncers to decide who will be admitted and at what price. To deal with these complexities event contracts can become quite long and detailed.  Whether written or not, these arrangements tend to favor the party with the greater sophistication or the more control over the production of the event. Even the most detailed, professionally written and negotiated contracts can become the subject of lawsuits over interpretation.

Because nightclubs are often associated with drug and alcohol consumption, rowdiness, and other late-night behavior, promoters may become entangled in various criminal disputes as well.

=== Methods ===
Promoters bring crowds through a variety of methods.  The most direct are [[guerrilla marketing]] techniques such as plastering [[posters]] on outdoor walls, [[flyposting]], and distributing [[handbills]] on windows of cars parked in entertainment districts. Promoters also keep mailing lists, usually [[email list]]s, of their preferred guests and their wider list of potential customers. Recently, many promoters have taken advantage of online technology such as [[online social network]]s and event listing sites to handle publicity, invitations, mailing lists, and so on. Clubs and promoters are among leaders in [[SMS]] text message advertising to their own lists as well as sponsored snippets on third-party lists for daily content to subscribers. Many fans promote events,products through their Facebook/Twitter/Myspace on their own free will.

Promoters often build a [[brand]] out of their own personalities and the parties they host, marketing the events under a consistent name, style, type of program, and social experience that downplays the branding of the venue or artist.  They may develop a loyal clientele that will follow them from one location to another.

=== Image promotion and VIP hosting ===

In cosmopolitan cities with large affluent populations, there are upscale venues that employ the services of a special kind of promoter called an image promoter.  The role of the image promoter is to bring celebrities or fashion models to high end venues and host them at a VIP table.  In order to entice models and celebrities to come to the venue, the image promoter is provided with a VIP table and complementary alcohol.  High end venues use the presence of models and celebrities to market their venue to an affluent clientele which may often only obtain admittance to the venue through agreeing to spend a certain amount of money on alcohol at the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycnightadventures.com/20/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130082532/http://www.nycnightadventures.com/20/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16319">'''Realistic conflict theory''' (initialized '''RCT'''), also known as '''realistic group conflict theory''' (initialized '''RGCT'''),&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] model of [[group conflict|intergroup conflict]].&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; The theory explains how intergroup hostility can arise as a result of conflicting goals and competition over limited resources, and it also offers an explanation for the feelings of [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] toward the [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] that accompany the intergroup hostility.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=W&amp;K /&gt; Groups may be in competition for a real or perceived [[scarcity]] of resources such as money, political power, military protection, or social status.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; 

Feelings of resentment can arise in the situation that the groups see the competition over resources as having a [[zero-sum game|zero-sums fate]], in which only one group is the winner (obtained the needed or wanted resources) and the other loses (unable to obtain the limited resource due to the "winning" group achieving the limited resource first).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;  The length and severity of the conflict is based upon the perceived value and shortage of the given resource.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; According to RCT, positive relations can only be restored if [[superordinate goals]] are in place.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

== Concept ==

=== History ===
The theory was officially named by [[Donald T. Campbell|Donald Campbell]], but has been articulated by others since the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;  In the 1960s, this theory developed from Campbell's recognition of social psychologists' tendency to reduce all human behavior to [[hedonism|hedonistic goals]]. He criticized psychologists like [[John Thibaut]], [[Harold Kelley]], and [[George C. Homans|George Homans]], who emphasized theories that place food, sex, and pain avoidance as central to all human processes. According to Campbell, hedonistic assumptions do not adequately explain intergroup relations.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Campbell believed that these [[social exchange theory|social exchange theorists]] oversimplified human behavior by likening interpersonal interaction to animal behavior.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; Similar to the ideas of Campbell, other researchers also began recognizing a problem in the psychological understanding of intergroup behavior.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;  These researchers noted that prior to Campbell, social exchange theorists ignored the essence of social psychology and the importance of interchanges between groups.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966"/&gt; To the contrary of prior theories, RCT takes into account the sources of conflict between groups,  which include, incompatible goals and competition over limited resources.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

===Supportive research===

==== Robbers cave study ====

The 1954 Robbers Cave Experiment by [[Muzafer Sherif]] and [[Carolyn Wood Sherif]] represents one of the most widely known demonstrations of RCT.&lt;ref name="W&amp;K"/&gt; The Sherifs' study was conducted over three weeks in a 200-acre summer camp in [[Robbers Cave State Park]], [[Oklahoma]], focusing on intergroup behavior.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; In this study, researchers posed as camp personnel, observing 22 eleven- and twelve-year-old boys who had never previously met and had comparable backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

The experiment was divided into three stages. The first stage being "[[ingroup]] formation", in which upon arrival the boys were split into two approximately equal groups based on similarities. Each group was unaware of the other group's presence. The second stage was the "friction phase", wherein the groups were entered in competition with one another in various camp games.  Valued prizes were awarded to the winners. This caused both groups to develop negative attitudes and behaviors towards the [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]]. The third and final stage was the "integration stage". During this stage, tensions between the groups were reduced through teamwork-driven tasks that required intergroup cooperation.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

The Sherifs made several conclusions based on the three-stage Robbers Cave Experiment.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; From the study, he determined that because the groups were created to be approximately equal, individual differences are not necessary or responsible for intergroup conflict to occur.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; As seen in the study when the boys were competing in camp games for valued prizes, Sherif noted that hostile and aggressive attitudes toward an outgroup arise when groups compete for resources that only one group can attain.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Sherif also establishes that contact with an outgroup is insufficient, by itself, to reduce negative attitudes.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Finally, he concludes that friction between groups can be reduced along with positive intergroup relations maintained, only in the presence of superordinate goals that promote united, cooperative action.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

However a further review of the Robber's Cave Experiments, which were in fact a series of three separate experiments carried out by the Sherifs and colleagues reveals additional deliberations. In two earlier studies the boys ganged up on a common enemy, and in fact on occasion ganged up on the experimenters themselves showing an awareness of being manipulated.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt; In addition, Michael Billig argues that in addition to the two groups of boys, the experimenters themselves form a third group, and one that is arguably the most powerful of the three and that they in fact become the outgroup themselves in the aforementioned experiment.&lt;ref name="Billig" /&gt; 

[[Lutfy Diab]] repeated the experiment with 18 boys from Beirut. The 'Blue Ghost' and 'Red Genies' groups each contained 5 Christians and 4 Muslims. Fighting soon broke out, not Christian vs Muslim but Blue vs Red. &lt;ref&gt; Us and Them, [[David Berreby]], Hutchinson 2006, p178 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions and applications ==

===Implications for diversity and integration===
RCT offers an explanation for negative attitudes toward [[racial integration]] and efforts to promote diversity.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt; This is illustrated in the data collected from the [[American National Election Studies|Michigan National Election Studies]] survey. According to the survey, most whites held negative attitudes toward school districts' attempts to integrate schools via [[Desegregation busing in the United States|school busing in the 1970s]].  In these surveys, there was a general perceived threat that whites had of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt; It can be concluded that, contempt towards racial integration was due to a perception of blacks as a danger to valued lifestyles, goals, and resources, rather than [[symbolic racism]] or prejudice attitudes formulated during childhood.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bobo /&gt;

RCT can also provide an explanation for why competition over limited resources in communities can present potentially harmful consequences in establishing successful [[Diversity (business)|organizational diversity]].&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt; In the workplace, this is depicted by the concept that increased racial [[heterogeneity]] among employees is associated with job dissatisfaction among majority members.&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsui"/&gt; Since organizations are affixed in the communities to which their employees belong, the racial makeup of employees' communities affect attitudes toward diversity in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; As racial heterogeneity increases in a white community, white employees are less accepting of workplace diversity.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt; RCT provides an explanation of this pattern because in communities of mixed races, members of minority groups are seen as competing for economic security, power, and prestige with the majority group.

RCT can help explain discrimination against different ethnic and racial groups.&lt;ref name="Esses"/&gt; An example of this is shown in [[cross-cultural studies]] that determined that violence between different groups escalates in relationship to shortages in resources.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt;  When a group have a notion that resources are limited and only available for possession by one group, this leads to attempts to remove the source of competition.&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt; Groups can attempt to remove their competition by increasing their groups capabilities (e.g. skill training), decreasing the abilities of the outgroups competition (e.g. expressing negative attitudes or applying punitive [[tariffs]]), or by decreasing proximity to the outgroup (e.g. denying immigrant access).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt;

===An extension to unequal groups===
Realistic conflict theory originally only described the results of competition between two groups of equal status.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Duckitt"/&gt; John Duckitt suggests that the theory be expanded to include competition between groups of unequal status. To demonstrate this, Duckitt created a scheme of types of realistic conflict with groups of unequal status and their resulting correlation with prejudice.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt;

Duckitt concluded that there are at least two types of conflict based on ingroups competition with an outgroup.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; The first is 'competition with an equal group' and is explained by realistic conflict theory.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; Thus being, group-based threat that leads ingroup members to feel hostile towards the outgroup which can lead to conflict as the ingroup focuses on acquiring the threatened resource.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; The second type of conflict is 'domination of the outgroup by the ingroup'. This occurs when the ingroup and outgroup do not have equal status. If domination occurs, there are two responses the subordinate group may have. One is stable oppression, in which the subordinate group accepts the dominating group's attitudes on some focal issue and sometimes, the dominant group's deeper values to avoid further conflict. The second response that may occur is unstable oppression. This occurs when the subordinate group rejects the lower status forced upon them, and sees the dominating group as oppressive. The dominant group then may view the subordinates' challenge as either justified or unjustified. If it is seen as unjustified, the dominant group will likely respond to the subordinates' rebellion with hostility. If the subordinates' rebellion is viewed as justified, the subordinates are given the power to demand change.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; An example of this would be the eventual recognition of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prejudice"/&gt;

===An extension to nations===
When group conflict extends to nations or tribes, regality theory argues that the collective danger leads citizens to start having strong feelings of national or tribal identity, preferring strong, hierarchical political system, adopting strict discipline and punishment of deviants, and expressing xenophobia and strict religious and sexual morality&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Reeding''' is a technique wherein "reeds" are carved or milled into a surface.&lt;ref name="TFD"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Reeding The Free Dictionary: "Reeding"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Reeding Dictionary.com: "Reeding"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numismatics==
[[File:King George VI Hong Kong 50 Cents 1951 Security Edge.jpg|thumb|right|Milled edge of a 1951 [[Coins of the Hong Kong dollar|Hong Kong 50¢ coin]]]]

In [[numismatics]], reeded edges are often referred to as "ridged" or "grooved" (US usage), or "milled" (UK usage).&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary (2006): '''mill''', produce regular ribbed markings on the edge of (a coin)&lt;/ref&gt; Some coins, such as [[Quarter (United States coin)|United States quarters]] and [[Dime (United States coin)|dimes]], [[1 euro coin|1 euro]], [[Coins of the Australian dollar|Australian]] 5, 10, 20 cents, 1 and 2 dollars, as well many other current coins, have reeded edges.  One reason for having reeded edges was to prevent counterfeiting.&lt;ref name="Headley20170303"&gt;{{cite web |last=Headley |first=Susan |title=Reeded Edge Defined - What is a Reeded Edge? |url=https://www.thespruce.com/reeded-edge-definition-768474 |date=March 3, 2017 |website=The Spruce |access-date=July 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BSOAF"&gt;[http://superbeefy.com/why-do-some-coins-have-ridges-around-the-edges/ Why do some coins have ridges around the edges?]&lt;/ref&gt; Some gold and silver coins were reeded to discourage [[Methods of coin debasement|clipping]], i.e. scraping off the precious metals from the edge of the coin, to maintain its stated value in precious metal.&lt;ref name="Headley20170303" /&gt; Another benefit of certain coins having reeded edges is that it helps enable different coin denominations to be easily identified and distinguished from each other by sense of touch alone.

==Furniture==
In furniture, reeding is sometimes used around bedposts, and the legs of tables and chairs.  Its use in this fashion was inspired by Greek and Roman architectural styles,&lt;ref name="AboutFurn"&gt;[http://antiques.about.com/od/furniture/a/ReededLeg022110.htm "reeded leg"]&lt;/ref&gt; and is the opposite of [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]].

==Architecture==
In architecture, reeding is a form of [[Molding (decorative)|molding]] usually found on columns, and is sometimes considered to be synonymous with [[gadrooning]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/211529/fluting-and-reeding Encyclopædia Britannica: "Fluting and Reeding"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rigid frame''' in [[structural engineering]] is the load-resisting skeleton constructed with straight or curved members interconnected by mostly [[rigid connections]] which resist movements induced at the joints of members. Its members can take bending moment, shear, and axial loads.

The two common assumptions as to the behavior of a building frame are (1) that its beams are free to rotate at their connections or (2) that its members are so connected that the angles they make with each other do not change under load.  Frameworks with connections of intermediate stiffness will be intermediate between these two extremes.  Frameworks with connections of intermediate stiffness are commonly called semirigid frames.  The AISC specifications recognize three basic frame types: Rigid Frame, Simple Frame, and Partially Restrained Frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaylord|first=Edwin|title=Steel Structures|year=1992|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-07-023054-4|pages=555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AISC standard==
The AISC Steel Specification Commentary on Section B3 provides guidance for the classification of a connection in terms of its rigidity. The secant stiffness of the connection K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is taken as an index property of connection stiffness. Specifically,
&lt;poem&gt;
                                      K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/θ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
         where
            M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = moment at service loads, kip-in (N-mm)
            θ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = rotation at service loads, rads {{sfn|AISC|2016|page=332}}
&lt;/poem&gt;

The secant stiffness of the connection is compared to the rotational stiffness of the connected member as follows, in which L and EI are the length and bending rigidity, respectively, of the beam.

{{quote|If K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;L/EI ≥ 20, it is acceptable to consider the connection to be fully restrained (in other words, able to maintain the angles between members).  If K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;L/EI ≤ 2, it is acceptable to consider the connection to be simple (in other words, it rotates without developing moment).  Connections with stiffnesses between these two limits are partially restrained and the stiffness, strength and ductility of the connection must be considered in the design.{{sfn|AISC|2016|page=332}}}}

'''Sew Fast Sew Easy''' was a [[corporation]] based in [[New York City]], which held [[sewing]] classes, and sold [[sewing pattern]]s and sewing books. It was founded in 1991 by Elissa K. Meyrich, a designer in New York City’s [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] for over 26 years, an instructor at Parsons School of Design, author and contributing writer to sewing publications. The company created the city's first [[Stitch 'n Bitch]] group&lt;!--

The company had a small retail store which stocked sewing and [[knitting]] items. Vice President and Partner Gregory Garvin left in September 2010. After 20 years of business, it closed.

Brands marketed by Sew Fast/Sew Easy included the Sew Fast Sew Easy sewing classes, books, and patterns, and the "Stitch &amp; Bitch" and "Stitch &amp; Bitch Cafe" sewing and knitting products.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

'''''Silent Hill: Homecoming''''' is a [[survival horror]] video game, the sixth installment in the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' series, developed by [[Double Helix Games]].&lt;ref name="gs_harker" /&gt; ''Homecoming'' follows the journey of Alex Shepherd, a soldier returning from war, to his hometown of Shepherd's Glen, where he finds the town in disarray, and his younger brother missing. As he continues on his search to find his younger brother, he discovers more about the Order, a cult, as well as the town's history, and his own past.

The game was released on September 30, 2008, in North America for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], and the [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released in North America on November 6, 2008, exclusively through [[Valve Corporation]]'s [[Steam (software)|Steam]] digital content delivery service.&lt;ref name="steam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5078555/silent-hill-homecoming-finally-hits-steam|title=Silent Hill: Homecoming Finally Hits Steam|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=2008-11-07|date=2008-10-06|first=Mike|last=Fahey}}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions were simultaneously released in Europe, including a retail Microsoft Windows version, on February 27, 2009.

The player assumes the role of Alex Shepherd, a [[Special Forces]] soldier who returns home from an overseas tour of duty to find that his father and younger brother are missing,&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent Hill: Homecoming Review (Xbox 360)|publisher=TeamXbox|url=http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1584/Silent-Hill-Homecoming/p1/=|date=|accessdate=2008-10-01|first=Brent|last=Soboleski|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025005611/http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1584/Silent-Hill-Homecoming/p1/=|archivedate=2008-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that his mother has gone into [[catatonia]].&lt;ref name="review_xplay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/xplay/reviews/1845/Silent_Hill_Homecoming.html|title=Silent Hill: Homecoming|accessdate=2008-10-09|first=Jason|last=D'Aprile|publisher=X-Play}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex begins to search for his brother, leading him to Silent Hill after searching his hometown of Shepherd's Glen.&lt;ref name="review_xplay" /&gt;

Overall gameplay is similar to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time.&lt;ref name="review_1up"&gt;{{cite web| title=1Up Reviews Silent Hill Homecoming| publisher=1Up| url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3170245&amp;p=4&amp;sec=REVIEWS=| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629153457/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3170245&amp;p=4&amp;sec=REVIEWS=| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2012-06-29| date=| accessdate=2008-10-01| first=Anthony| last=Gallegos}}&lt;/ref&gt; To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up;&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox" /&gt; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks.&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox" /&gt; Puzzle elements also play a part in the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries.&lt;ref name="review_1up" /&gt; For the first time in the series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox" /&gt;

In addition to exploration, combat is another major element to the gameplay, and the player must fight the various monsters that appear. In contrast to the more naïve everyman protagonists of previous games, combat in ''Homecoming'' takes into account Alex's experience as a soldier.&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox" /&gt; The player is able to perform light and heavy attacks, or mix them to perform combinations,&lt;ref name="review_cc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheatcc.com/xbox360/rev/silenthillhomecomingreview.html|title=Silent Hill: Homecoming Review|accessdate=2008-10-09|publisher=Cheat Code Central|first=Matthew|last=Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may also perform a variety of finishing moves to ensure that the monsters are dead, a gameplay mechanic first featured in a rudimentary form in ''[[Silent Hill: Origins]]''.&lt;ref name="review_cc" /&gt; Attacking enemies also leaves wounds in them that match the motion carried out by Alex in inflicting the attack.&lt;ref name="handson" /&gt; In terms of controlling Alex, the player may also perform new maneuvers such as targeting the enemy before attacking them, dodging enemy attacks, and performing counter-attacks.&lt;ref name="review_xplay" /&gt; As well as melee weapons, pistols, rifles and shotguns are available as firearms, which can be upgraded to stronger versions later in the game: firearm handling is also rendered in a more realistic manner, with Alex having to shoulder long guns and suffering aim effects like recoil.&lt;ref name="review_1up" /&gt; In addition to the changes in combat, and unlike previous entries in the series, the player is also able to fully control and rotate the camera as they choose;&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox" /&gt; one analog stick controls player movement, and the other controls the camera.

==Plot==
At the start of the game, the player controls Alex through a nightmare concerning his younger brother, Josh, before Alex wakes up in the cab of a truck driven by Travis Grady, the protagonist from ''[[Silent Hill: Origins]]'', who gives him a ride to his hometown of Shepherd's Glen.&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plot_travis"&gt;'''Travis''': Bad dream? '''Alex''': Yeah. ''[They arrive in Shepherd's Glen.]'' '''Travis''': Hometown? '''Alex''': You could say that. '''Travis''': Well, good luck, soldier. '''Alex''': Thanks. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town, named for a distant ancestor who helped found it,&lt;ref name="plot_townname"&gt;'''Alex''': This is my great, great, great, great, great grandfather, Isaac Shepherd. He was one of the founders, and they named the town after him. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is covered in fog and deserted. At home, he finds his mother in a catatonic state, murmuring about his father leaving to find Josh;&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plot_alexmom1"&gt;'''Alex's mother''': Alex. What are you doing here? '''Alex''': I just got discharged. I've been in the hospital for a bit, but I'm all right now. '''Alex's mother''': You've been gone too long. '''Alex''': Yeah. Where is everybody? Where's Josh? '''Alex's mother''': I don't know. Your father went to look for him. But now he's gone. Everyone's gone. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; promising to find Josh, Alex leaves.&lt;ref name="plot_alexmom2"&gt;'''Alex's mother''': I miss your brother, Alex. '''Alex''': Look, I'll find him. I had this dream... I just have a feeling he's in trouble. Don't worry about it, I'll find Joshua. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex soon discovers that many more people have gone missing in Shepherd's Glen since he left when he finds his childhood friend Elle Holloway pinning "missing" signs to a board outside the police department.&lt;ref name="plot_alexelle"&gt;''Elle falls off a chair she is using to reach the noticeboard.'' '''Elle''': Dammit! '''Alex''': You always were a klutz. You okay? '''Elle''': Alex? Oh, my God, Alex! '''Alex''': Hey, Elle. Your mom told me I might find you out here. '''Elle''': Oh my God, it's so good to see you. Feels like it's been forever. [...] '''Alex''': Jesus. What the hell's going on here? '''Elle''': I don't know. Every day there are more flyers to put up, every day more people disappear.&lt;/ref&gt; As Alex explores the town, he witnesses the separate deaths of Mayor Bartlett and Dr. Fitch by monsters in the Otherworld, both of whom have a child who is missing.&lt;ref name="plot_bartlett"&gt;'''Alex''': Mayor Bartlett? Mayor Bartlett, I need to talk to you. [...] What about your son? Don't you wanna protect him? '''Mayor Bartlett''': My boy? I didn't do much right with him, but I did buy him some nice things... remember, Joey? Remember that nice present I got you? '''Alex''': I'm looking for my brother Joshua, and I know he used to be friends with your son. Have you seen either of them? '''Mayor Bartlett''': Joey? Er, Joey doesn't want to play with you. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plot_fitch1"&gt;'''Alex''': Doctor, do you need help? You're bleeding bad. '''Dr. Fitch''': Don't you TOUCH me! I bleed out the sin, but it grows back. So I must let it out every day. '''Alex''': I can stop the bleeding. '''Dr. Fitch''': I don't want your help! These wounds cannot heal. '''Alex''': Why did you come to this place? '''Dr. Fitch''': I come here to remind myself. It's the only place I go where she listens to me. '''Alex''': Who listens to you? Scarlet? Is she here? '''Dr. Fitch''': She's here with me, now. My baby... my beautiful child. Daddy forgot to bring you a present today. She loves dollies. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plot_wheeler1" /&gt; Back in Shepherd's Glen, Alex allies himself with Deputy Wheeler in the police department.&lt;ref name="plot_wheeler1"&gt;'''Alex''': Deputy Wheeler? '''Wheeler''': Well, well. Back in the land of the living. [...] '''Alex''': Last I saw him he was passed out drunk on the ground. [...] I'm just trying to find my brother, okay? I thought the mayor might know something. His son is missing too. [...] '''Wheeler''': So you've seen the creatures too...? {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex eventually learns that his father was involved in the secrets of the town and had left to attempt to resolve the town's problems,&lt;ref name="plot_dadgone"&gt;'''Adam's letter''': I have failed, and they know it. They blame me. They should. I swore to protect this town, but I can't. The streets decay before our eyes. The curse we always feared has come upon us. Worse yet, The Order has returned, kidnapping and killing with impunity [...] But they've taken our people. The only thing left is to face the source of this evil, to fight it, and pray that some hope can be restored. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but before he is able to get answers from his mother at home, he is knocked unconscious when The Order—a religious [[cult]] from Silent Hill which has been taking people from the town—&lt;ref name="plot_dadgone" /&gt; kidnaps his mother.&lt;ref name="plot_kidnap"&gt;'''Alex's mother''': You don't know anything about Silent Hill! '''Alex''': I know dad went there. He went to go fight something. Did he go to get Joshua? Is that where Josh is? God damn it, tell me! '''Alex's mother''': Oh Alex, I'm sorry. '''Alex''': Stop pretending you care about me! Start telling me what's going on! Joshua is the only one you ever cared about, and I can help him, if you tell me what's going on! ''[The Order members arrive and kidnap his mother, and knock Alex to the floor in the struggle.]'' '''Order member''': Forget the Shepherd kid, let's move. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex, Elle, and Wheeler take a boat across Toluca Lake to find Alex's father in Silent Hill but are intercepted by the Order.&lt;ref name="plot_boat"&gt;'''Wheeler''': Alex. There's a light up ahead. I think we might be at the pier. '''Alex''': What should we do? '''Wheeler''': Turn off our light. I don't want anyone to know we're coming. '''Elle''': Aaah! '''Alex''': Elle! ''Two Order members are holding onto Elle at the back of the boat''. '''Elle''': Get your hands off me! ''More Order members grab Wheeler''. '''Alex''': Wheeler! ''Another boat crashes into theirs, sending Alex into the water''. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elle and Wheeler are taken to Silent Hill's penitentiary, where Alex attempts to rescue them.&lt;ref&gt;'''Wheeler''': Alex, are you there? '''Alex''': Wheeler, is that you? '''Wheeler''': Talk quietly, Alex. Thank God you're okay. Listen, they've taken us to the prison. It's horrible. They took Elle, and they're about to... ''The radio cuts out''. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finds his mother bound; the player must make a decision regarding whether to kill her out of mercy or not, which will affect the outcome of the game.&lt;ref&gt;'''Alex''': (whispers) Mom. Jesus, what did they do? '''Alex's mother''': Alex? Is that you? [...] Your father and I, we loved you so much. But they said we could only choose one. [...] Ahhh! It hurts so much. Please stop. Make it stop. '''Alex''': Mom, I... I can't... I... '''Alex's mother''': Please, Alex. please... ''Alex gets his gun out.'' '''Choice 1''': Ok, I'll do it. '''Choice 2''': I'm sorry, I can't. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rescuing Elle's mother, Judge Holloway, and separating from Wheeler once more,&lt;ref&gt;'''Alex''': Judge Holloway... '''Holloway''': Alex!!! '''Wheeler''': Quick, you get her loose before they start pumping the gas, I'll shut off the valves. [...] ''Wheeler is swallowed by a monstrous wall opening''. '''Alex''': Run! Get out! Get out of here! I'll save Wheeler! ''Holloway leaves''. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex finds the Order's church, where he listens to his father in the confessional; the player may choose to forgive him, again affecting the outcome of the game.&lt;ref&gt;'''Alex's father''': Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. It has been four years since my last confession. [...] '''Alex''': What could you have done that was so terrible? '''Alex's father''': I took my role as a father and I turned it into a daily chore. I fed him, I cleaned him, I put him to bed. I treated my dog with more respect. And when I was given a second son, the first might as well have been a stranger sleeping in our house. '''Choice 1''': Sounds like you can change. '''Choice 2''': You don't sound sorry. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex later runs into his father, who reveals that Alex was never a soldier and has been in a mental hospital since "the accident" occurred. He begs forgiveness before he is killed by a monster called the Bogeyman (resembling [[Pyramid Head]] from ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'').&lt;ref&gt;'''Adam''': I never meant to hurt you, son,. I had to make a choice, and now I'm paying for it. We all are. After all I've done, you still wear my old dog tags... that must mean something. '''Alex''': What are you talking about? These are mine... I'm a soldier just like you wanted. '''Adam''': Alex... you've been in the hospital... '''Alex''': I know. I was wounded in battle. '''Adam''': No... a mental hospital. You've been there ever since the accident. [...] Alex, forgive me. '''Alex''': No!!!! ''Adam is skewered and cut in two by the Bogeyman, who then leaves''. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing to the Order's underground facility, Alex is captured by Judge Holloway, who reveals that everything that has happened is due to a broken pact. One hundred and fifty years ago, the four founding families broke away from Silent Hill's Order to move to Shepherd's Glen.&lt;ref name="plot_pact"&gt;'''Holloway''': The founders, they had good intentions. They left the Order to start a new life in Shepherd's Glen. But they feared the wrath of our God, so they made a pact to keep us safe. All that was required was a small sacrifice... our children. Once every 50 years the founding families must make an offering to appease the god. One of our children, our own flesh and blood, struck down by our own hands. I did what was required. I watched the light fade from Nora's eyes as I took her life... Knowing that her death would protect our family, protect Shepherd's Glen. '''Alex''': My god... Josh... '''Holloway''': No Alex, one of us failed—lacked the strength to fulfill his duty. Your father. '''Alex''': Where's Joshua?! '''Holloway''': Don't you see? Because of him, our sacrifices were in vain! The pact with our god was broken, and your father's lack of conviction cursed us all. Our only hope was to revive the Order which our founders abandoned... The true faith. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were allowed to do so on the condition that once every 50 years they would sacrifice one of their children in a preordained fashion.&lt;ref name="plot_pact" /&gt; On this occasion, while Joey Bartlett, Scarlett Fitch and Nora Holloway were successfully sacrificed by their parents, the Shepherd sacrifice failed, and as a result, the Order had been reformed to try to appease their god.&lt;ref name="plot_pact" /&gt; Judge Holloway tries to kill Alex, who kills her in self-defense.&lt;ref name="plot_drill"&gt;''Judge Holloway reaches for a drill''. '''Alex''': Don't... look, I can help you with all this. There must be another way. '''Holloway''': No, Alex. It's time I finished what your father couldn't. ''He screams as she rams the drill through his leg''. '''Alex''': Ahhh!!!!! ''Alex breaks through the restraints, and a struggle ensues; gaining the upper hand, he pushes the drill through her head''. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex rescues Elle from the facility and, after finding Wheeler injured and allowing the player to choose whether to save him—once more affecting the game's ending—continues on alone to find Josh.&lt;ref&gt;'''Alex''': Wheeler... '''Wheeler''': Ahhh! '''Choice 1''': Give him a medkit. '''Choice 2''': No, he's too far gone. '''Alex''': You need to get him out of here. '''Elle''': What about you? '''Alex''': I can't. Not without Joshua. '''Elle''': Be careful. I can't lose you too. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing he was the intended sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;'''Alex''': It's the Shepherd sacrificial altar. There are four names written on the plaque. Daniel Shepherd / Thomas Shepherd / Rebecca Shepherd / Alex Shepherd {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex experiences a flashback showing Josh's true fate. When Alex was younger, he had taken Josh rowing out on the lake, where Josh showed Alex a ring, which his father had chosen to give to him instead of Alex. Out of jealousy, Alex struggled with Josh to try to take the ring, and as they fought Josh accidentally fell into the lake and drowned.&lt;ref&gt;''Alex rows the boat in the lake; Josh has the flashlight''. '''Josh''': What are we doing here, Alex? Dad'll freak if he finds out. [...] '''Alex''': It's okay. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. '''Josh''': Why are we here Alex? What's going on? '''Alex''': What's the matter... you scared? [...] Dad thinks you're a little baby who can't do anything on his own. '''Josh''': Oh yeah? Then why'd he give me this?! '''Alex''' What is that? '''Josh''': Dad's ring, but he told me not to show you, so I guess that makes me cooler. '''Alex''': Let me see it. '''Josh''': No! '''Alex''': What a piece of crap. '''Josh''': No it's not, he told me it's worth more than a million dollars. That's why dad gave it to me. Give it BACK! It's mine! ''They struggle, and Josh slips, falling into the lake''. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father retrieved the body and explained that Alex had "ruined it for all of us", since he had chosen Alex, and not Josh; unable to accept Josh's death, Alex was then sent to the mental hospital, and with Josh instead of Alex sacrificed, the Order's pact was broken.&lt;ref&gt;''Adam holds Josh's lifeless body.'' '''Adam''': This is not the way it's supposed to be. I chose YOU. Now you've ruined it for all of us. '''Alex''': No...no...he's okay...right...? No, I can save him... I can, I can save him. I can save him... he's okay... {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''One of four texts for each family in the entrance hall to the altar room describes the Shepherd family's method of sacrifice''. We, the Family Shepherd, in order to ensure our continued protection and prosperity, do enter into this Holy Contract with our God, accept our duties as Master of Arms and willingly consign our child to the water in God's name. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After fighting the final boss, the manifestation of Josh's spirit, Alex finally has the chance to apologize and states that he never wanted Josh's death. Alex leaves the family ring and their father's angle-head army flashlight on Josh's body and exits the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;''Josh's corpse emerges from the monster's mouth''. '''Alex''': Josh.... I'm sorry, Josh. I never meant for this to happen. ''He places the family ring around his neck, and the flashlight on his chest''. Here buddy. Take this... I forgot... Josh.... I'm sorry... ''He exits.'' {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five endings available, which depend on the player's actions during the game, including whether the player kills Alex's mother, forgives Alex's father, and saves Deputy Wheeler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://guides.ign.com/guides/777941/page_10.html|title= Items &amp; Weapons - Secret Items|accessdate=2008-10-26 |work= Silent Hill: Homecoming Guide (PS3)|publisher= IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; These range from the single positive ending to the game—where Alex comes to terms with his past actions and reunites with Elle to leave Shepherd's Glen—to three other endings: Alex getting drowned by his father, waking up in the hospital and receiving a shock treatment, or being turned into a Bogeyman. There is also a joke ending, where both Alex and Elle are abducted by a UFO while Wheeler witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;''Alex surfaces from a sewer, and a noise sounds''. '''Alex''': Elle... ''They are interrupted by a noise, and the camera pans to a UFO above''. '''Alex''': Aww, shit. ''They float upwards together, and an injured Wheeler limps below them''. '''Wheeler''': So THAT'S where they've been taking everybody. I knew it! ''The UFO flies off''. {{cite video game|title=Silent Hill Homecoming|developer=Double Helix|publisher=Konami|date=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these endings, if the player collects all of Josh's pictures or clears the game on the "hard" difficulty, a first-person post-credits scene is played where Alex finds Josh sitting on the bottom bunk of his bed and Josh takes a picture of Alex with a camera.

==Development==
[[File:Shh transform.jpg|thumb|256px|right|The Otherworld begins to appear as paint falls from the walls and the ceiling light drops down.]]
Chief designer of ''Silent Hill: Homecoming'', Masashi Tsuboyama, announced the game's development in a 2004 interview with [[Eurogamer]],&lt;ref name="interview_eurog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=56340|title=Silent Hill 5 coming to next gen|date=2004-08-17|accessdate=2004-08-18|first=Tom|last=Bramwell|publisher=Eurogamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he also debunked previous internet rumors that it was to be called ''Shadows of the Past''.&lt;ref name="interview_eurog" /&gt; No information was initially imparted about the platform the game would appear on, other than it would be appearing on the next generation of consoles, which had yet to be released.&lt;ref name="interview_eurog" /&gt; Around two years later, an interview with composer [[Akira Yamaoka]] revealed more information; he hinted that they had hoped to carry on "plans of the earlier Silent Hill platforms", and that the team were creating a title with the idea of "fear in daylight", with similar psychological roots to ''[[Silent Hill 2]]''.&lt;ref name="famitsu_kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/konami/akira-yamaoka-talks-silent-hill-5-223716.php|title=Akira Yamaoka Talks Silent Hill 5|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|date=2006-12-21|accessdate=2008-10-08|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion that the story and gameplay would be more like that of the second entry in the series in the way the player is directed, and in the character's behavior, was reaffirmed in a later interview, along with the idea of creating the game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms.&lt;ref name="cvg_details"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=162394|title=Silent Hill 5 details emerge|date=2007-04-20|accessdate=2008-10-08|first=Gavin|last=Ogden|publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most of the ideas previously hinted at were not found in subsequent information releases. At [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] 2007, a new teaser trailer was displayed by [[Konami]] that revealed the title of the game to be ''Silent Hill V'', and that the game would be released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.&lt;ref name="kotaku_details"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/e307/silent-hill-v-first-screens-developer-named-277532.php|title=Silent Hill V First Screens, Developer Named|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=2008-10-08|date=2007-07-11|first=Michael|last=McWhertor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further to this trailer, Konami executives also revealed that the developer would not in fact be Team Silent as in previous iterations, but that, like ''Silent Hill: Origins'', it would be developed by a Western developer, [[The Collective, Inc.|The Collective]].&lt;ref name="kotaku_details" /&gt; The Collective had merged with [[Backbone Entertainment]] in 2005 to form [[Foundation 9 Entertainment]], and Foundation 9 then merged The Collective with Shiny Entertainment to create Double Helix Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doublehelixgames.com/studio.html|title=doublehelixgames.com|quote=Double Helix Games was formed in 2007 from the combination of veteran game developers Shiny Entertainment and The Collective.|accessdate=2008-10-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080403001218/http://www.doublehelixgames.com/studio.html |archivedate = April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team had been working on the production of ''[[Harker (video game)|Harker]]'', another survival horror title, but this was placed on indefinite hiatus during ''Homecoming'''s production.&lt;ref name="gs_harker"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation 9 buries Harker|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6189687.html|accessdate=2008-10-08|date=2008-04-22|first=Tom|last=Magrino|publisher=GameSpot|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102213532/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6189687.html|archivedate=2013-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Double Helix drew inspiration not only from past installments in the game series but also from the first ''Silent Hill'' [[Silent Hill (film)|movie adaptation]]; this is most evident in the transition from the normal world to the Otherworld, whose "ripping" effect almost matches that found in the movie.&lt;ref name="handson" /&gt; Other similarities from the same source includes the reaction of nurses to light, the bug-like creatures seen in the movie, and the [[Pyramid Head]] rendition, known as the "Bogeyman" in this game.&lt;ref name="handson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/874/874245p2.html|title=Silent Hill Homecoming Hands-on|first=Jeff|last=Haynes|accessdate=2008-10-09|date=2008-05-15|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jim|last= Sterling|title= New Silent Hill: Rubbish Pyramid Head confirmed (also, November release)|url= http://www.destructoid.com/new-silent-hill-rubbish-pyramid-head-confirmed-also-november-release--100409.phtml|work= Does it Suck?|publisher= Destructoid.com|date= 2008-08-20|accessdate=2008-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homages to previous games in the series include a reference to the long-running joke of the lead character placing their hand in a toilet bowl to retrieve items.&lt;ref name="handson" /&gt; Lead designer Jason Allen described the intentions of the development team to be to maintain the depth of storytelling and atmosphere of the series whilst making combat more intuitive and less frustrating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evergeek.com/Features/3020.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704225355/http://evergeek.com/Features/3020.aspx |archivedate=2016-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The script, in-game journal entries, and instruction manual were written by Patrick J.

Now, that term "writer" has a different meaning in electronic gaming than it does in television or film. On a game, the entire design team has a large hand in doing much of the writing. Even before we knew that there was a Silent Hill 5 happening, The Collective had broken story and compiled a summary of the game's events - all of which were written by the lead designer, the lead artist and the lead level designer. [...] On top of working on the story, we had to write all the cinematics, environmental signage, hundreds of dialogue slugs, journal entries and the game manual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the change in development team, [[Akira Yamaoka]] returned from past installments in the series to create both music and [[sound effect]]s for the game.&lt;ref name="osv_interview"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Yamaoka |first=Akira |subjectlink=Akira Yamaoka |interviewer=Jayson Napolitano |title=A New Kind of Fear: Silent Hill Homecoming Interview with Akira Yamaoka |publisher = Original Sound Version (OSV) |date=2008-09-26 |accessdate=2008-10-09 |url=http://www.originalsoundversion.com/?p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first game in the series to use surround sound.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.originalsoundversion.com/a-new-kind-of-fear-silent-hill-homecoming-interview-with-akira-yamaoka/&lt;/ref&gt; Yamaoka wrote 70 minutes of music for the game, and insisted on working with [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] to provide vocals, as fan reaction to her voice on previous Silent Hill titles has been favorable.&lt;ref name="osv_interview" /&gt; ''Homecoming''{{'}}s soundtrack was released on November 24, 2008. McGlynn provided vocals for four tracks.

===Censorship===
''Homecoming'' had difficulties in passing censors in some countries before it could go on sale. The Australian classification board, the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] (OFLC), refused to classify the game, due to "impact violence and excessive blood effects".&lt;ref name="oz_censors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/914/914566p1.html|title=Silent Hill Aussie Ban Update|first=Narayan|last=Pattison|date=2008-09-29|accessdate=2008-10-08|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objectionable scenes included various body parts being drilled into, as well as the [[bisection]] of a character by an enemy.&lt;ref name="oz_censors" /&gt; This had the effect of banning the game for sale in the country, and representatives for publisher Atari mentioned that they would be asking Konami to tone down the violence to allow the game to receive the needed MA15+ rating for its sale to be permitted in early 2009.&lt;ref name="oz_censors" /&gt;

The German version of the game was also postponed to 2009 for cuts to be made to pass the German censors after the uncensored version was rejected by the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]].&lt;ref name="germany_censors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silenthill5.net/2008/09/22/silent-hill-homecoming-delayed-until-q2-2009-for-germany.html|title=Silent Hill: Homecoming delayed until Q2 2009 for Germany|author=Furin|date=2008-09-22|accessdate=2008-10-08|publisher=silenthill5.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927051040/http://silenthill5.net/2008/09/22/silent-hill-homecoming-delayed-until-q2-2009-for-germany.html|archivedate=2008-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was re-submitted after being altered in the same way as the Australian version and received the highest rating possible as a result (''Freigegeben ab 18 Jahren gemäß § 14 JuSchG'', meaning 18+).

On November 19, 2010, the Amtsgericht [[Frankfurt am Main]] confiscated all Xbox 360 versions imported from the UK (thus being uncensored) for violation of [[StGB#§ 131: Representation of violence|§ 131 StGB]] (representation of violence), effectively banning it from sale within Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schnittberichte.com/news.php?ID=2468|title=Indizierungen/ Beschlagnahmen Dezember 2010|accessdate=2011-01-01|date=2010-12-31|publisher=schnittberichte.com|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music, written by series regular Akira Yamaoka, and the ambient audio, were received well, being "atmospheric, moody and beautifully presented";&lt;ref name="review_ign" /&gt; combined with "an amazing score",&lt;ref name="review_cc" /&gt; the audio goes "a long way toward establishing the expected Silent Hill mood",&lt;ref name="review_gamerev" /&gt; though some concern was expressed that the music was "somewhat misplaced" and did not fit in so well.&lt;ref name="review_ign" /&gt; Voice acting, which has traditionally been seen as one of the series' weaker points,&lt;ref name="review_cc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="review_gamerev" /&gt; was evaluated as better than the series' usual attempts, but occasionally "flat" when more emotion was needed.&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="review_ign" /&gt;

The game's plot received a largely mixed reception. While some reviewers graded it positively, describing it as "intriguing and disturbing",&lt;ref name="review_teamxbox" /&gt; it was also noted that it "isn't particularly original, and there are no great surprises", even though it "still makes for a very involving journey into the macabre."&lt;ref name="review_xplay" /&gt; Several reviewers likened the story to a subplot of the main ''Silent Hill'' mythos&lt;ref name="review_gamerev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="review_ign" /&gt; which, while able to "stand on its own", "barely mentions certain characters which fairly dominate the backstory of previous SH games."&lt;ref name="review_gamerev" /&gt; Some critics expressed disappointment at the predictability of the main twist in the story regarding Alex's predicament,&lt;ref name="review_ign" /&gt; while others found it "genuinely shocking".&lt;ref name="review_gspy" /&gt; Croshaw's Zero Punctuation review was generally negative, stating that while the level design, story and combat were all competent, the game had little to do with what he liked about the ''Silent Hill'' series and would have been better served as a completely different franchise.&lt;ref name="review_yahtzee" /&gt;

'''Singkíl''' (or '''Sayaw sa Kasingkil''') is a [[folk dance]] of the [[Maranao people]] of [[Lake Lanao]] based on the epic legend ''Darangen''. &lt;ref name="guillermo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guillermo|first1=Artemio R.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Philippines|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810872463|pages=403|url=https://books.google.it/books/about/Historical_Dictionary_of_the_Philippines.html?id=GBWye7c8NuYC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was popularised by the [[Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company]].

==Description==

''Singkil'' originated from the Maranao people who inhabit the shores of [[Lake Lanao]]&lt;ref name="guillermo" /&gt;. It is a re-telling of an episode from the Maranao epic legend ''Darangen'' involving the rescue of Princess Gandingan (abducted by the ''diwatas'') by the legendary Prince Bantugan&lt;ref name="conference"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panaraag|first1=Jiamila E.|last2=Inte|first2=Geldolin L.|title=The Metamorphosis of Selected Maranao Stories into Dances|journal=The Asian Conference on Literature &amp; Librarianship 2015 Official Conference Proceedings|date=18 January 2016|url=http://papers.iafor.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/librasia2015/LibrAsia2015_09604.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a popular dance performed during celebrations and other festive entertainment. Originally only women, particularly royalty, danced the ''Singkil'', which serves as either a conscious or unconscious advertisement to potential suitors. The dance takes its name from the heavy rings worn on the ankles of the Muslim princess&lt;ref name="conference" /&gt;.  A ''[[kulintang]]'' and [[Agung#In agung ensembles|''agung'']] ensemble always accompanies the dance.

The female lead dancer plays the role of Princess Gandingan of the ''Darangen'' epic, wearing the heavy rings around her ankles to keep time while she dances. In an episode of the Maranao epic, the princess is caught in the middle of the forest during an earthquake caused by the ''diwatas'' (or the guardian spirits) of the Kingdom of Bumbaran&lt;ref name="conference" /&gt;. The ''diwatas'' abducted the princess and entrapped her into a forest to teach the philandering Prince Bantugan a lesson&lt;ref name="conference" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hullett|first1=Arthur|title=Pieces of Southeast Asia|date=2017|publisher=BookBaby|isbn=9781483595542|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=tKdWDgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=pieces+of+southeast+asia&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The falling trees during the earthquake (which the princess gracefully avoids) are represented by the bamboo poles arranged in a criss-crossed fashion and clacked together in a unique, syncopated rhythm. During the performance, the female lead dancer graciously steps in and out of the bamboo poles as she manipulates two elaborately designed fans called ''apir''. Another female dancer represents the loyal slave of the princess who accompanies her throughout the ordeal. After a while, a male dancer, representing the legendary Prince Bantugan of the ''Darangen'' epic, performs his dance round and through the bamboo poles clacked together bearing a shield and a sword. The entrance of the male dancer symbolizes the arrival of Prince Bantugan who is determined to rescue the princess from the ''diwatas''. Other dancers skillfully manipulate the ''apir'' fans, which represent the winds which prove to be auspicious. The dance steps require agile movement so that the dancer's feet won't be crushed by the moving bamboos. Meanwhile, the clacking bamboo poles represent the forces which the two characters had to overcome. The dance ends with the princess going home with the prince.

==Adaptations==

===Bayanihan===
When the [[Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company|Bayanihan Dance Company]] began performing the ''Singkíl'', the traditional dance was adapted to convey Western aesthetics. The Bayanihan portrayal, branded as the ''Princess Dance'' or the ''Royal Maranao Fan Dance'', became so popular that it is often mistaken for the authentic version of the dance.

A notable variation from the original is its inclusion of male dancers, as pole clappers and in the role of the Prince, Rajah Bantugan. Additional sets of criss-crossing bamboo poles were also added.

Further adaptation divided the dance into four movements: 
*First movement- "Asik", where the slave with umbrella is introduced.  
*Second movement- entrance of Putri Gandingan, the entourage of female fan or scarf dancers, and the arrival of Rajah Bantugan.  
*Third movement- ''Patay'', which is a slow section, and is a structural dance convention often found in Western performances.  
*Fourth movement- the climax in which all dancers dance to the crescendo of music.

===Other versions===
PCN (Pilipino Cultural Night) festivities held by foreign-based student groups and other theatrical dance companies have modernised interpretations of the dance, resulting in unorthodox portrayals of  the ''Singkíl'' by even the most esteemed of Philippine folk dance choreographers.

The Philippine Barangay Folkdance Troupe portrays the prince dancing scarves rather than with a sword and a shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Namiki|first1=Kanami|title=Ramon Obusan, Philippine Folkdance and Me: From the perspective of a Japanese Dancer|date=2017|publisher=PublishDrive|isbn=9789712730511|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=rI04DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147|accessdate=26 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dance companies have even fused the ''Singkíl'' with [[ballet]], or make use of multiple layers of overlapping bamboos.

== In film==
The ''Singkíl'' was performed in the 2001 [[Cinema of the United States|American]] independent film ''[[The Debut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Anne R.|last2=Omidvar|first2=Iraj|title=Muslims and American Popular Culture [2 volumes]|date=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313379635|page=392|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=W42dAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA392|accessdate=26 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was directed by [[Filipino American]] filmmaker Gene Cajayon and starred [[Dante Basco]]. The film captured the essence of Filipino traditions and the blending of these with modern American culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12247">The '''small schools movement''', also known as the '''Small Schools Initiative''', in the [[United States of America]] holds that many [[high school]]s are too large and should be reorganized into smaller, autonomous schools of no more than 400 students, and optimally under 200. Many private schools of under 200 share design features which draw upon the benefits of organizations of less than 200 people.  In the public school version of the Small Schools Movement, students may be given a choice of which small school they want to join. Each of the smaller schools would offer students a feeling of connectedness between students who share the same or similar interests with them. In many ways, the small schools in high schools would resemble the team system of many [[middle school]]s across the United States. Small schools allow students to have more individual attention from teachers than most average high schools.  Many small schools are created by reforming a failed large school into several small ones in the same building, as is the case with the former [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in the Bronx in New York City.

== Benefits ==
Supporters of small schools claim that "in small schools, student achievement increases... Student attendance improves, graduation rates rise, and college going rates increase. Students are more engaged in their studies and are more likely to participate in extracurricular activities." This is due to the fact that students are more likely to be known by all of the adults and children in the school and are much less likely to "fall through the cracks."

[[Deborah Meier]] has argued that a small school allows all of the teachers to sit around a single table and to create a culture of shared decision-making. This should be a central component of a school that intends to teach children to become powerful members of a democracy--they should see their teachers acting democratically. Face-to-face democracy is much more likely and practical in a small school.&lt;ref name="klonsky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Power-Their-Ideas-Lessons-America/dp/0807031135/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369321806&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+their+ideas |title=Deborah Meier: The Power of Their Ideas |publisher=Beacon Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Democratic-Education-Practice-Mission-Practitioner/dp/0807753807/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367896244&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=matthew+knoester |title=Democratic Education in Practice: Inside the Mission Hill School |publisher=Teachers College Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive gains for student achievement within small schools can be seen in Oakland California. According to a study by the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at [[Brown University]] "small schools in Oakland are outperforming the large schools from which they emerged. In particular, students are completing more rigorous coursework and dropping out at lower rates, compared to the large schools." &lt;ref&gt;Shah, Sema; Kavitha Mediratta and Sara McAlister, [http://www.annenberginstitute.org/pdf/Mott_Oakland_high.pdf Building a Districtwide Small Schools Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626205035/http://www.annenberginstitute.org/pdf/Mott_Oakland_high.pdf |date=2010-06-26 }}, Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University, April 2009, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The American Dream and the Public Schools'' by Jennifer L. Hochschild and Nathan Scovronick, smaller classes sizes contribute to students in "early grades, and consistently challenging academic courses have been demonstrated to help disadvantaged
children achieve, just as they enable middle-class children to achieve." &lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Jennifer L. and Nathan Scovronick. ''The American Dream and the Public School'', Oxford University Press, 2003. p.5 New York&lt;/ref&gt;

"Smaller, more intimate learning communities consistently deliver better results in academics and discipline when compared to their larger counterparts. Big schools offer few opportunities to participate."&lt;ref&gt;WashingtonPost, 8/15/02&lt;/ref&gt; "Students at large schools are more prone to be alienated from their peers or engage in risky behavior." &lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota research, Los Angeles Times, 4/12/02&lt;/ref&gt;

Other benefits of small schools are noted in a study conducted by [[UCLA]] stating that "at their best, small schools are seen as enhancing strong personal bonds, home and community involvement, improved instructional quality and accountability, and improved teacher working conditions and job satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Center for Mental Health in Schools. (2009). Learning Supports and Small Schools. Los Angeles, CA: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading small schools proponent and founder of the Small Schools Coalition&lt;ref name="ssc"&gt;http://www.smallschoolscoalition.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Grauer School]] Dr. Stuart Grauer notes, "Research shows overwhelmingly that small schools lead to greater student academic gains and personal adjustment. In fact, data justifying this has been available for decades; it's just that policy makers have largely ignored it, no doubt due to the costs of such programs (and, of course, the politics). Right now, armed guards, metal detectors, and expulsions fail to get to the heart of the problem. (To a serious extent, they can actually create repressive conditions which make the problem worse.) Consequently, many people are looking for another way, and small schools can't be ignored much longer." Why do we keep building gigantic schools when we have such promising data? Dr. Grauer attributes this not only to economics, but to prevailing myths about American education: "Our collective memory of high school includes nostalgia such as proms, football games, exciting social lives, romance, and first cars. No matter that such memories do not apply to most students. The average high school student does not attend sporting events; indeed the larger the school, the smaller the percentage of student participation in these activities. For most students, the social scene in large high schools is tough and unforgiving, with sharp distinctions made between the small group of social haves and the far larger masses of have-nots. And high school memories seldom include a significant academic component, let alone an intellectual one ( 2001). In other words, many high schools have activities that everyone speaks of with pride—sacred cows like the marching band, the lacrosse team, the boosters. These untouchable activities represent the school's image, and they can't be changed, even though they serve a very small percentage of students and rarely have any connection to the most basic thing of all: the focus on student learning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grauerschool.com/about/philosophy Grauer School]&lt;/ref&gt;

Small schools are gaining popularity in the United States not only with students, but with donors as well. According to the Neal Peirce Column of [[the Washington Post Writers Group]], "far and away the biggest catalyst is the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. It has poured over $1 billion in five years into promoting smaller schools in Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee and other cities. Just this month New York City announced it was coming on board the small schools movement. It will open 60 schools with 500 students or less -- 41 high schools, four traditional middle schools and 15 based on an innovative sixth- or seventh-through-12th grade model." &lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Neal. "COULD SMALLER SCHOOLS BE THE AMERICAN FUTURE?" The Washington Post Writers Group 21 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research and the growing data on small schools have provided some evidence regarding their better academic quality in comparison to their larger counterparts.&lt;ref name="klonsky"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-klonsky-phd/deborah-meier-small-schools_b_859362.html |title=Mike Klonsky: An Interview With Deborah Meier on the Small-Schools Movement |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2011-05-11|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Justice-Challenge-Schools-Teaching/dp/0807739626/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369321089&amp;sr=1-2-fkmr0&amp;keywords=a+simple+justice+pedro+noguera+small+schools |title=A Simple Justice: The Challenge of Small Schools |publisher=Teachers College Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Sharif Shakrani, the co-director of the Education Policy Center at [[Michigan State University]], "Recent studies suggest students in small public high schools perform better academically, have higher attendance rates, feel safer, experience fewer behavior problems and participate more frequently in extracurricular activities." &lt;ref name="Shakrani"&gt;Shakrani, Sharif. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/3e/61/2c.pdf "A Big Idea: Smaller High Schools."]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Education Policy Center, Michigan State University (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakrani also states that "a number of empirical articles document that students in small public and private high schools have higher achievement levels than those in large schools. Studies found higher student gains in reading, mathematics, science and social studies at small high schools than at large schools. Moreover, small schools are more likely to have fewer incidents of violence and misbehavior and that, in turn, has been found to contribute to higher attendance and lower drop-out and truancy rates." &lt;ref name="Shakrani" /&gt;

Small schools tend to emerge, particularly in urban areas, where there is a need for education reform due to failing school systems. High quality small public schools act as a remedy to large public schools that are falling behind in their ability to graduate students, achieve higher test scores and provide students with individual attention. The small school movement has modeled its efforts after small private schools which provide a similar learning environment which is based upon providing for the needs of their students.

== Criticisms ==
Many criticisms stem from the fact that the term "small school" is not uniform.  For instance, schools of between 400 and 1200 students are often researched as small schools despite having few of the attributes of small schools (e.g., a community of 200 or less, class size of less than 15, and similar criteria often applied).&lt;ref name="ssc"/&gt;
Hence, they point out that large schools tend to have a wider diversity of course offerings, as well as more clubs, arts programs, higher performing sports teams, and other extracurricular activities such as school newspapers and social events. Small schools advocates point out that in schools of less than 400 and especially less than 230, students have more access to enrichment and leadership programs. Some schools have abandoned the small school approach after failures to overcome these difficulties, even after being offered grants to continue these experiments. Other districts have expanded this movement by shutting down large schools and opening more smaller ones.&lt;ref&gt;Jehlen, Alain and Cynthia Kopkowski (February 2006) [http://www.nea.org/home/12214.htm "Is Smaller Better?"] ''NEA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gates Foundation, which supports and funds small schools, is beginning to change its focus to working directly on improving instruction, giving grants to improve math and science instruction, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Linda (November 5, 2006) [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003348701_gates05m.html "Foundation's small-schools experiment has yet to yield big results."] ''Seattle Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sports tourism''' refers to [[travel]] which involves either observing or participating in a [[sporting event]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Commonwealth of Australia| year=2000| url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/fulltext/2000/feddep/SportTourismStrategy.pdf| title=Towards A National Sports Tourism Strategy| accessdate=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while staying apart from the tourists' usual environment.  Sport tourism is a fast-growing sector of the global [[Tourism|travel industry]] and equates to $7.68 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sportscommissions.org/Portals/sportscommissions/Documents/About/NASC%20Sports%20Travel%20Industry%20Whitepaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of sport tourism==
There are several classifications of sport tourism. Gammon and Robinson suggested that sports tourism can be categorized as ''Hard Sports Tourism'' or ''Soft Sports Tourism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gammon| first1=Sean| last2=Robinson| first2=Tom| year=2003| title=Sport and Tourism: A Conceptual Framework| journal=Journal of Sport Tourism| volume=8| number=1| pages=21–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Gibson suggested that there are three types of sports tourism: ''Sports Event Tourism'', ''Celebrity and Nostalgia Sport Tourism'' and ''Active Sport Tourism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gibson| first=Heather J.| title=Active Sport Tourism: Who Participates?| subscription=yes| pages=155–170| work=Leisure Studies| volume=17| number=2| url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rlst/1998/00000017/00000002/art00007|  date=1 April 1998| accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hard and soft sport tourism===
The "hard" definition of sport tourism refers to the quantity of people participating at a competitive sport events. Normally these kinds of events are the motivation that attract visitors to the events. [[Olympic Games]], [[FIFA World Cup]], [[Formula 1|F1]] Grand Prix and regional events such as [[NASCAR]] Sprint Cup Series could be described as hard sports tourism.

The "soft" definition of sport tourism is when the tourist travels to participate in recreational sporting, or signing up for leisure interests. [[Hiking]], [[skiing]], [[running]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://360runningbarcelona.com/contact/faq-frequently-asked-questions/|title=What's a Running Tour? Frequently Asked Questions {{!}} 360RunningBarcelona|last=|first=|date=|website=360runningbarcelona.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[canoeing]] can be described as soft sports tourism. Perhaps the most common form of soft sports tourism involves [[golf]] in regards to destinations in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. A large number of people are interested in playing some of the world's greatest and highest ranked courses, and take great pride in checking those destinations off of their list of places to visit.

===Sports event tourism===
''Sports event tourism'' refers to the visitors who visit a city to watch events.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite book| year=1992| title=Adventure, Sport and Health Tourism|  work=Special Interest Tourism| editor1-first=Betty| editor1-last=Weiler| editor2-first=Colin Michael| editor2-last=Hall| url=http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19921850197.html;jsessionid=AF8313BFC1067F7F7F70AF18B30A44E6| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd| location=London| pages=141–58| isbn=978-0471947868| subscription=yes| accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two events that attract the most tourists worldwide are the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup. These events hold once every four years, in a different city in the world. Sport tourism in the United States is more focused on events that happen annually. The major event for the [[National Football League]] is the [[Super Bowl]], held at the end of the year in different city every year. Even though the [[National Hockey League]] started the annual [[NHL Winter Classic]] game in 2008, the 2014 New Year's outdoor hockey game rivaled the Stanley Cup Tournament in popularity and "revitalized the NHL".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 best bucket-list sporting events|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/10greatplaces/2014/06/13/bucket-list-sporting-events/10035217/|website = USA TODAY|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the newest trend in college basketball was to start the season off with annual tournaments such as the [[Maui Invitational Tournament|Maui Invitational]] held in [[Hawaii]], and the Battle for Atlantis which is played in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]. This idea of pairing quality sports events with the Bahamas attractions raised the island's profile and brought in more visitors and dollars to the country. The Battle for Atlantis brought more than 5,000 fans in during [[Thanksgiving]] week for the three-day tournament. The event helped increase hotel capacity from what is typically around 60 percent this time of year to 90 percent.  Sport tourism "is a growing market and many different cities and countries want to be involved,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bahamas Finds Success Creating a Sports Tourism Event|url = http://skift.com/2015/11/28/bahamas-finds-success-creating-a-sports-tourism-event/|website = Skift|accessdate = 2015-12-01|first = Kyle|last = Hightower|first2 = Associated Press-Nov|last2 = 28|first3 = 2015 2:18|last3 = Pm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celebrity and nostalgia sport tourism===
''Celebrity and nostalgia sport tourism'' involves ''visits to the sports halls of fame and venue'' and ''meeting sports personalities in a vacation basis''.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;

===Active sport tourism===
''Active sport tourism'' refers to those who participate in the sports or sport events. [[Rugby football]], [[football]], [[basketball]], etc are considered active sports and many sport events (which we call tournaments or festivals) are organized each year in most of the countries in the world.

The '''Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences''' is the heart of the undergraduate program and grants the majority of [[Stanford University]]'s degrees. The School has 23 departments and
20 interdisciplinary degree-granting programs. The School was officially created in 1948, from the merger of the Schools of Biological Sciences, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences.  Those schools date from the mid-1920s when the university first organized individual departments into schools.&lt;ref name=histoverall&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Schools of the University|url=http://histsoc.stanford.edu/su_schools.shtml|publisher=Stanford Historical Society|accessdate=18 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120133812/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/su_schools.shtml|archivedate=20 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments==

The school is divided into three divisions: Humanities and Arts, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.

=== Humanities and Arts ===

* Art &amp; Art History - One of the original University departments under the name Drawing (1891), Drawing and Painting (1892-1900), back to Drawing (1901–1907), Graphic Arts (1908–1910), Graphic Art (1911–1913, 1927–1947), then Art and Architecture (1948–1969), Art (1970-?) and finally its current name.&lt;ref name="histoverall"/&gt;
* Classics - Stanford started with separate departments for Latin and Greek but these were merged in 1921
* Drama - Started as Public Speaking in 1927 became Speech and Drama in 1937 and Drama in 1971
* East Asian Languages and Cultures
* English - one of the original departments but under the name English Language and Literature
* History - one of the original departments
* Linguistics - established in 1971
* Music - established in 1936
* Philosophy - established sometime in the 1890s
* Religious Studies - started in 1941 as the department of Religion

Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages
* Comparative Literature

* German Studies - one of the original departments under the name Germanic Languages
* Iberian &amp; Latin American Cultures
* Slavic Languages and Literature - established in 1926

=== Natural Sciences ===

* Applied Physics - established in 1969
* Biology
* Chemistry - one of the original departments
* Mathematics - one of the original departments
* Physics - one of the original departments
* Statistics - established in 1936

The current Biology department was formed by merging Botany, Zoology, Entomology, and Physiology to form Biological Sciences.  The name of this department was changed to Biology in 2009.

=== Social Sciences ===

* Anthropology
* Communication - established in 1927 as Journalism
* Economics - established in 1892 as Economics and Social Sciences
* Political Science
* Psychology - one of the original departments with [[Frank Angell]] serving as its first chair. From 1922 to 1942, [[Lewis Terman]] served as its chair.&lt;ref name="psychhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://psychology.stanford.edu/historyofdepartment |title=History of the Psychology Department |newspaper=Https: |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, it was ranked as #1 in the country among all psychology graduate programs in the United States.&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/psychology-rankings |title=Best Psychology Programs |newspaper=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sociology

Stanford was set up with a Political Science department but that was almost immediately renamed Economics and Social Science.  The forerunner of the current Political Science department was established in 1918.

Sociology and Anthropology were originally one department established in 1948.  They split in 1957.  Anthropology itself was split into Anthropological Sciences and Cultural and Social Anthropology from
1999 to 2007 but merged again.

Notable faculty in these departments other than those mentioned above include:
*[[Albert Bandura]] (1925-), David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science 
*[[Carol Dweck]] (1946-), Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology (2004-)
*[[Phillip Zimbardo]] (1933-), professor of Psychology (1968-200), known for the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]]
*[[Joseph Greenberg]] (1915-2001), Ray Lyman Wilbur Professor of Social Science, known for his classification of the [[Niger–Congo languages]]

==Core courses==
At times Stanford has required undergraduate students to take core courses in various subjects in the humanities and sciences.  Some of the core courses include
* Western Culture (1980-1988) - freshmen took courses in  both European and non-European cultures with  “a substantial historical dimension” and include works by women and minorities.&lt;ref name=st37-2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomew|first1=Karen|title=25 years ago (1988)|journal=Sandstone &amp; Tile|volume=37|issue=1|url=http://historicalsociety.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST37no1.pdf|page=22|date=2013|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Cultures, Ideas and Values (CIV) (1988-2000)&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt;
* Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) (2000-2012),&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt; a core freshman  course sequence which consisted of one fall-quarter course followed by a 2-quarter pair of courses during the winter and spring quarters. Fall quarter courses were interdisciplinary while winter-spring focused on a specific disciplinary area.
* Thinking Matters (2012–2016)&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt;
* Ways of Thinking / Ways of Doing (2016–present)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways|title=Stanford Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telephone phobia''' ('''telephonophobia''', '''telephobia''', '''phone phobia''') is reluctance or fear of making or taking [[phone call]]s, literally, "fear of [[telephone]]s".&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{ cite book |title=Social Phobia: From Shyness to Stage Fright |first=John R. |last=Marshall |year=1995 |publisher=BasicBooks |place=New York |ISBN=0-465-07896-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CpVOVXPdJUC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22telephone+phobia%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22telephone%20phobia%22&amp;f=false |chapter=Telephone Phobia }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be a type of [[social phobia]] or [[social anxiety]].&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt; It may be compared to [[glossophobia]], in that both arise from having to engage with an audience, and the associated fear of being criticized, judged or made a fool of.&lt;ref name=doctor&gt;{{cite book|last=Doctor|first=Ronald M.|title=The Encyclopedia of Phobias, Fears, and Anxieties |year=2000 |publisher=Facts On File |place=New York |isbn=0-8160-3989-5 |page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is common with other fears and phobias, there is a wide spectrum of severity of the fear of phone conversations and corresponding difficulties.&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt; In 1993 it was reported that about 2.5 million people in [[Great Britain]] have telephone phobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Newspapers Handbook |first=Richard |last=Keeble |edition=3rd |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=0-415-24083-2 |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMANAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=%22telephone+phobia%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22telephone%20phobia%22&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "telephone [[Fear|apprehension]]" refers to a lower degree of telephone phobia, in which sufferers experience anxiety about the use of telephones, but to a less severe degree than that of an actual phobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fielding|first=Richard G.|title=Telephone apprehension: a study of individual differences in attitudes to, and usage of the telephone. |url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/id/eprint/3120 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufferers may have no problem communicating face to face, but have difficulty doing so over the telephone.

==Causes==
A fear of receiving calls may range from fear of the action or thought of answering the phone to fear of its actual ringing. The ringing can generate a string of anxieties, characterized by thoughts associated with having to speak, perform and converse.&lt;ref name=doctor/&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite book |first=Susie |last=Scott |title=Shyness and Society: the illusion of competence |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2007 |isbn=9781403996039 |pages=105–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers may perceive the other end as threatening or intimidating.&lt;ref name="Rowlands"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rowlands |first=Barbara |title=Health: Don't call me, please, and I won't call you: To most of us, the ringing of the phone is at least a potential pleasure. But to some it is a source of anguish. |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/health-dont-call-me-please-and-i-wont-call-you-to-most-of-us-the-ringing-of-the-phone-is-at-least-a-potential-pleasure-but-to-some-it-is-a-source-of-anguish-barbara-rowlands-reports-1463066.html|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=24 August 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety may be triggered by concerns that the caller may bear bad or upsetting news, or be a [[prank call]]er.

Fear of making calls may be associated with concerns about finding an appropriate time to call, in fear of being a nuisance.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt; A sufferer calling a household or office in which they know several people may be concerned at the prospect of failing to recognize the voice of the person who answers, with resultant embarrassment.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt; Some sufferers may be anxious about having to "perform" in front of a real or perceived audience at their end of the line: this is a particular problem for those required to use a phone in the workplace.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;

Fear of using the phone in any context (for either making or receiving calls) may be associated with anxiety about poor sound quality, and concerns that one or other party will not understand what has been said, resulting either in misunderstandings, or in the need for repetition, further explanation, or other potentially awkward forms of negotiation. These fears are often linked to the absence of [[body language]] over a phone line, and the individual fearing a loss of their sense of control.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rowlands"/&gt; Sufferers typically report fear that they might fail to respond appropriately in the conversation,&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt; or find themselves with nothing to say, leading to embarrassing silence, stammering, or stuttering.&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt; Past experiences, such as receiving traumatic news, or enduring an unpleasant and angry call, may also play a part in creating fear.&lt;ref name=doctor/&gt;

==Symptoms==
A variety of symptoms can be seen in someone suffering from telephone phobia, many of which are shared with [[anxiety]]. These symptoms may include nervous stomach, sweaty palms,&lt;ref name=doctor/&gt; rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, [[nausea]], dry mouth and trembling. The sufferer may experience feelings of panic, terror and dread.&lt;ref name="Telephonophobia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Telephonophobia |url=http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/t/telephonophobia/intro.htm |work=Right Diagnosis|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resulting [[panic attacks]] can include [[hyperventilation]] and stress. These negative and agitating symptoms can be produced by both the thought of making and receiving calls and the action of doing so.

==Effects==
[[File:Good Smile Company offices ladies.jpg|thumb|right|[[Open-plan office]]s, in which phone conversations may be readily overheard by co-workers, pose particular challenges for sufferers from telephone phobia]]
The telephone is important for both contacting others and accessing important and useful services. As a result, this phobia causes a great deal of stress and impacts people's personal lives, work lives and social lives.&lt;ref name=doctor/&gt; Sufferers avoid many activities, such as scheduling events or clarifying information.&lt;ref name="bipo"&gt;"Break the bipolar cycle: a day-by-day guide to living with bipolar disorder", by Elizabeth Brondolo, Xavier Amador, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gs-_eHJYmIcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA179&amp;dq=%22telephone+phobia%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22telephone%20phobia%22&amp;f=false p. 179]&lt;/ref&gt; Strain is created in the workplace because use of phones may play a crucial role within a career.&lt;ref name="Rowlands"/&gt;

==Coping and avoidance strategies==
Coping strategies may consist of planning the conversation ahead of time and rehearsing, writing or noting down what needs to be said.&lt;ref name=doctor/&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt; Anxiety may be lessened by having privacy in which to make a call, so that the sufferer need not be concerned about the conversation being overheard.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;

Associated avoidance behavior may include asking others (e.g. relatives at home) to take phone calls and exclusively using [[answering machine]]s.&lt;ref name="marshall"/&gt; The rise in the use of electronic text-based communication (the [[Internet]], [[email]] and [[text messaging]]) has given many sufferers alternative means of communication that they may find considerably less stressful than the phone.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt; However, some individuals experience "textphobia", a fear or anxiety of texting or messaging, and also avoid those forms of communication.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Sufferers may find it helpful to explain the nature of the phobia to friends, so that a failure to respond to messages is not misinterpreted as rudeness or an unwillingness to communicate.

==Treatment==
Phobias of this sort can usually be treated by different types of therapies, including: [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[psychotherapy]], [[behavior therapy]] and [[exposure therapy]].&lt;ref name="Telephonophobia"/&gt;

Practice may play an important part in overcoming fear. It may be helpful to sufferers to increase phone usage at a slow pace, starting with simple calls and gradually working their way up. For example, they may find it easier to start with automated calls, move on to conversations with family and friends, and then further extend both the length of conversations and the range of people with whom conversations are held.&lt;ref name="Rowlands"/&gt;

'''Textual criticism''' is a branch of [[textual scholarship]], [[philology]], and [[literary criticism]] that is concerned with the identification  of textual variants in either [[manuscripts]] or printed books. [[Scribes]] can make alterations when copying manuscripts by hand.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman 2005, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic might seek to reconstruct the original text ([[Urtext (Biblical studies)|urtext]], [[archetype]] or autograph) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate versions, or [[recension]]s, of a document's transcription history.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent. ''A History of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament'' &lt;br /&gt;"... that process which it sought to determine the original text of a document or a collection of documents, and to exhibit, freed from all the errors, corruptions, and variations which may have been accumulated in the course of its transcription by successive copying."&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the textual critic's work is a better understanding of the creation and historical transmission of texts. This understanding may lead to the production of a "critical edition" containing a scholarly curated text.

There are many approaches to textual criticism, notably  [[#Eclecticism|eclecticism]], [[#Stemmatics|stemmatics]], and [[#Copy-text editing|copy-text editing]]. Quantitative techniques are also used to determine the relationships between witnesses to a text, with methods from evolutionary biology ([[phylogenetics]]) appearing effective on a range of traditions.

In some domains (religious and classical text editing) the phrase "lower criticism" is used to describe the contrast between textual criticism and "[[higher criticism]]", which is the endeavor to establish the authorship, date, and place of composition of the original text.

== History ==
Textual criticism has been practiced for over two thousand years.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Early textual critics, especially the librarians of Hellenistic Alexandria in the last two centuries BC,  were concerned with preserving the works of [[ancient history|antiquity]], and this continued through the [[medieval]] period into [[early modern]] times and the invention of the [[printing press]]. Textual criticism was an important aspect of the work of many Renaissance Humanists, such as [[Desiderius Erasmus]], who edited the Greek New Testament, creating the ''[[Textus Receptus]]''. In Italy, scholars such as [[Petrarch]] and [[Poggio Bracciolini]] collected and edited many Latin manuscripts, while a new spirit of critical enquiry was boosted by the attention to textual states, for example in the work of [[Lorenzo Valla]] on the purported [[Donation of Constantine]].

Many ancient works, such as the [[Bible]] and the [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]], survive in hundreds of copies, and the relationship of each copy to the original may be unclear. Textual scholars have debated for centuries which sources are most closely derived from the original, hence which readings in those sources are correct.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Although biblical books that are letters, like Greek plays, presumably had one original, the question of whether some biblical books, like the [[Gospel]]s, ever had just one original has been discussed.&lt;ref name=tanselle&gt;Tanselle, (1989) ''A Rationale of Textual Criticism''&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in applying textual criticism to the [[Quran]] has also developed after the discovery of the [[Sana'a manuscripts]] in 1972, which possibly date back to the 7–8th centuries.

In the English language, the works of [[Shakespeare]] have been a particularly fertile ground for textual criticism—both because the texts, as transmitted, contain a considerable amount of variation, and because the effort and expense of producing superior editions of his works have always been widely viewed as worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis 1995, pp. 1–17&lt;/ref&gt;
The principles of textual criticism, although originally developed and refined for works of antiquity and the [[Bible]], and, for Anglo-American Copy-Text editing, Shakespeare,&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
have been applied to many works, from (near-)contemporary texts to the earliest known written documents. Ranging from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to the twentieth century, textual criticism covers a period of about five millennia.

== Basic notions and objectives ==
The basic problem, as described by [[Paul Maas (classical scholar)|Paul Maas]], is as follows:
{{quote|We have no [[autograph]] [handwritten by the original author] manuscripts of the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] classical writers and no copies which have been [[collated]] with the originals; the manuscripts we possess derive from the originals through an unknown number of intermediate copies, and are consequently of questionable trustworthiness. The business of textual criticism is to produce a text as close as possible to the original (''constitutio textus'').&lt;ref&gt;Maas P. 1958. ''Textual criticism''. Oxford. p1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Maas comments further that "A dictation revised by the author must be regarded as equivalent to an autograph manuscript". The lack of autograph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than Greek and Roman. In such a situation, a key objective becomes the identification of the first ''exemplar'' before any split in the tradition. That exemplar is known as the ''[[archetype]]''. "If we succeed in establishing the text of [the archetype], the ''constitutio'' (reconstruction of the original) is considerably advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Maas 1958, p2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The textual critic's ultimate objective is the production of a "critical edition".{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This contains the text that the author has determined most closely approximates the original, and is accompanied by an ''apparatus criticus'' or [[critical apparatus]].  The critical apparatus presents the author's work in three parts: first, a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called [[sigla]]); second, the editor's analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating),{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}; and third, a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;"The ''apparatus criticus'' is placed underneath the text simply on account of bookprinting conditions and in particular of the format of modern books. The practice in ancient and medieval manuscripts of using the outer margin for this purpose makes for far greater clarity." Maas 1958, pp. 22–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[Image:P46.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio from [[Papyrus 46]], containing [[2 Corinthians]] 11:33–12:9]]
Before mechanical printing, literature was copied by hand, and many variations were introduced by copyists. The age of printing made the scribal profession effectively redundant. Printed editions, while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission, are nonetheless not immune to introducing variations from an author's autograph. Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources. An edited text that draws from multiple sources is said to be ''eclectic''. In contrast to this approach, some textual critics prefer to identify the single best surviving text, and not to combine readings from multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;Greetham 1999, p. 40.&lt;br&gt;"Tanselle thus combines an Aristotelian ''praktike'', a rigorous account of the phenomenology of text, with a deep Platonic suspicion of this phenomenology, and of the concrete world of experience (see my ' Materiality' for further discussion). For him—and, I would contend, for the idealist, or 'eclectic' editing with which he and Greg-Bowers are often identified, whereby an idealist 'text that never was' is constructed out of the corrupt states of extant documents—ontology is only immanent, never assuredly present in historical, particularized text, for it can be achieved only at the unattainable level of nous rather than phenomenon. Thus, even the high aims of eclectic (or, as it is sometimes known, 'critical') editing can be called into question, because of the unsure phenomenological status of the documentary and historical."&lt;/ref&gt;

When comparing different documents, or "witnesses", of a single, original text, the observed differences are called ''variant readings'', or simply ''variants'' or ''readings''. It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be ''un''-original, hence establishing a "critical text", or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both "external" evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and "internal" or "physical" considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done).&lt;ref name=tanselle /&gt;

The collation of all known variants of a text is referred to as a [[variorum]], namely a work of textual criticism whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication.&lt;ref&gt;McGann 1992, p. xviiii&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bible]] and the works of [[William Shakespeare]] have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works, such as [[Walt Whitman]]'s [[Leaves of Grass]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradley 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
and the prose writings of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Gosse 1902&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eclecticism ==
[[Eclecticism]] refers to the practice of consulting a wide diversity of witnesses to a particular original. The practice is based on the principle that the more independent transmission histories there are, the less likely they will be to reproduce the same errors. What one omits, the others may retain; what one adds, the others are unlikely to add. Eclecticism allows inferences to be drawn regarding the original text, based on the evidence of contrasts between witnesses.

Eclectic readings also normally give an impression of the number of witnesses to each available reading. Although a reading supported by the majority of witnesses is frequently preferred, this does not follow automatically. For example, a second edition of a Shakespeare play may include an addition alluding to an event known to have happened between the two editions. Although nearly all subsequent manuscripts may have included the addition, textual critics may reconstruct the original without the addition.

The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. It is not a copy of any particular manuscript, and may deviate from the majority of existing manuscripts. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Comfort, Comfort 2005, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no ''a priori'' bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament (currently, the United Bible Society, 5th ed. and Nestle-Aland, 28th ed.). Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.&lt;ref name=ISBN9039001057&gt;Aland, B. 1994, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

=== External evidence ===
External evidence is evidence of each physical witness, its date, source, and relationship to other known witnesses. Critics will often prefer the readings supported by the oldest witnesses. Since errors tend to accumulate, older manuscripts should have fewer errors. Readings supported by a majority of witnesses are also usually preferred, since these are less likely to reflect accidents or individual biases. For the same reasons, the most geographically diverse witnesses are preferred. Some manuscripts show evidence that particular care was taken in their composition, for example, by including alternative readings in their margins, demonstrating that more than one prior copy (exemplar) was consulted in producing the current one. Other factors being equal, these are the ''best'' witnesses. The role of the textual critic is necessary when these basic criteria are in conflict.  For instance, there will typically be fewer early copies, and a larger number of later copies.  The textual critic will attempt to balance these criteria, to determine the original text.

There are many other more sophisticated considerations. For example, readings that depart from the known practice of a scribe or a given period may be deemed more reliable, since a scribe is unlikely on his own initiative to have departed from the usual practice.&lt;ref name=textandinterpretation&gt;Hartin, Petzer, Mannig 2001, pp. 47–53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal evidence ===
Internal evidence is evidence that comes from the text itself, independent of the physical characteristics of the document. Various considerations can be used to decide which reading is the most likely to be original. Sometimes these considerations can be in conflict.&lt;ref name=textandinterpretation /&gt;

Two common considerations have the Latin names ''[[lectio brevior]]'' (shorter reading) and ''lectio difficilior'' (more difficult reading). The first is the general observation that scribes tended to add words, for clarification or out of habit, more often than they removed them. The second, ''[[lectio difficilior potior]]'' (the harder reading is stronger), recognizes the tendency for harmonization—resolving apparent inconsistencies in the text. Applying this principle leads to taking the more difficult (unharmonized) reading as being more likely to be the original. Such cases also include scribes simplifying and smoothing texts they did not fully understand.&lt;ref&gt;Aland K., Aland, B. 1987, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scribal tendency is called [[homoioteleuton]], meaning "same endings". Homoioteleuton occurs when two words/phrases/lines end with the same sequence of letters. The scribe, having finished copying the first, skips to the second, omitting all intervening words. ''Homeoarchy'' refers to eye-skip when the ''beginnings'' of two lines are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~sreimer/ms-course/course/scbl-err.htm|title=Manuscript Studies: Textual analysis (Scribal error)|author=|date=|website=www.ualberta.ca|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404214516/http://www.ualberta.ca/~sreimer/ms-course/course/scbl-err.htm|archivedate=4 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic may also examine the other writings of the author to decide what words and grammatical constructions match his style. The evaluation of internal evidence also provides the critic with information that helps him evaluate the reliability of individual manuscripts. Thus, the consideration of internal and external evidence is related.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

After considering all relevant factors, the textual critic seeks the reading that best explains how the other readings would arise. That reading is then the most likely candidate to have been original.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

=== Canons of textual criticism ===
[[Image:Codex Sinaiticus-small.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 11:2 in [[Codex Sinaiticus]]]]
Various scholars have developed guidelines, or ''canons'' of textual criticism, to guide the exercise of the critic's judgment in determining the best readings of a text. One of the earliest was [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] (1687–1752), who in 1734 produced an edition of the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]. In his commentary, he established the rule ''Proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua'', ("the harder reading is to be preferred").&lt;ref name=bengelrules&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Bengel|title=Critical Rules of Johann Albrecht Bengel|publisher=Bible-researcher.com|accessdate=2008-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213010108/http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Bengel|archivedate=2010-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Jakob Griesbach]] (1745–1812) published several editions of the New Testament. In his 1796 edition,&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Griesbach, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=BLk9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=novum+testamentum+graece&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=r8sem3b7JS&amp;sig=1unsVXlqNzwWrCXEi1oQW-s3m0I ''Novum Testamentum Graece'']&lt;/ref&gt; he established fifteen critical rules. Among them was a variant of Bengel's rule, ''Lectio difficilior potior'', "the harder reading is better." Another was ''Lectio brevior praeferenda'', "the shorter reading is better", based on the idea that scribes were more likely to add than to delete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Griesbach|title=Critical Rules of Johann Albrecht Bengel|publisher=Bible-researcher.com|accessdate=2008-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213010108/http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Griesbach|archivedate=2010-02-13|df=}}&lt;br /&gt; "Brevior lectio, nisi testium vetustorum et gravium auctoritate penitus destituatur, praeferenda est verbosiori. Librarii enim multo proniores ad addendum fuerunt, quam ad omittendum."&lt;/ref&gt; This rule cannot be applied uncritically, as scribes may omit material inadvertently.

[[Brooke Foss Westcott]] (1825–1901) and [[Fenton Hort]] (1828–1892) published an edition of the [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|New Testament in Greek in 1881]]. They proposed nine critical rules, including a version of Bengel's rule, "The reading is less likely to be original that shows a disposition to smooth away difficulties." They also argued that "Readings are approved or rejected by reason of the quality, and not the number, of their supporting witnesses", and that "The reading is to be preferred that most fitly explains the existence of the others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Hort|title=Theories of Westcott and Hort|publisher=Bible-researcher.com|accessdate=2008-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213010108/http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Hort|archivedate=2010-02-13|df=}}&lt;br /&gt;"The reading is to be preferred that makes the best sense, that is, that best conforms to the grammar and is most congruous with the purport of the rest of the sentence and of the larger context." (2.20)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these rules, although originally developed for biblical textual criticism, have wide applicability to any text susceptible to errors of transmission.

=== Limitations of eclecticism ===

Since the canons of criticism are highly susceptible to interpretation, and at times even contradict each other, they may be employed to justify a result that fits the textual critic's aesthetic or theological agenda. Starting in the 19th century, scholars sought more rigorous methods to guide editorial judgment. Stemmatics and copy-text editing&amp;nbsp;– while both eclectic, in that they permit the editor to select readings from multiple sources&amp;nbsp;– sought to reduce subjectivity by establishing one or a few witnesses presumably as being favored by "objective" criteria.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  The citing of sources used, and alternate readings, and the use of original text and images helps readers and other critics determine to an extent the depth of research of the critic, and to independently verify their work.

=== Overview ===
[[File:Howald-sigerist.png|thumb|right|250px|Scheme of descent of the manuscripts of [[Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius]] by [[Henry E. Sigerist]] (1927)]]
'''Stemmatics''' or '''stemmatology''' is a rigorous approach to textual criticism. [[Karl Lachmann]] (1793–1851) greatly contributed to making this method famous, even though he did not invent it.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Timpanaro, ''The Genesis of Lachmann's Method'', ed. and trans. by Glenn W. Most (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005) [trans. from ''Genesi del metodo del Lachmann'' (Liviana Editrice, 1981)].&lt;/ref&gt; The method takes its name from the word ''stemma''. The [[Ancient Greek]] word στέμματα&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"&gt;Liddell, H.G. &amp; Scott, R. (1940). ''A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[loanword]] in [[classical Latin]] ''stemmata''&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis &amp; Short"&gt;Lewis, C.T. &amp; Short, C. (1879). ''A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saalfeld1884"&gt;Saalfeld, G.A.E.A. (1884). ''Tensaurus Italograecus. Ausführliches historisch-kritisches Wörterbuch der Griechischen Lehn- und Fremdwörter im Lateinischen.'' Wien: Druck und Verlag von Carl Gerold's Sohn, Buchhändler der Kaiserl. Akademie der Wissenschaften.&lt;/ref&gt; may refer to "[[family tree]]s". This specific meaning shows the relationships of the surviving witnesses (the first known example of such a stemma, albeit with the name, dates from 1827).&lt;ref&gt;Collín, H. S. and C. J. Schlyter (eds), ''Corpus iuris Sueo-Gotorum antiqui: Samling af Sweriges gamla lagar, på Kongl. Maj:ts. nådigste befallning'', 13 vols (Stockholm: Haeggström, 1827–77), vol. 1, table 3; the volume is available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=aZgyAAAAIAAJ&amp;] but the scan unfortunately omits the stemma. William Robins, `Editing and Evolution', ''Literature Compass'' 4 (2007): 89–120, at pp. 93–94, {{doi|10.1111/j.1741-4113.2006.00391.x.&lt;/ref&gt; The family tree is also referred to as a ''[[cladogram]]''.&lt;ref name="isbn90-272-2153-7"&gt;Mulken &amp; van Pieter 1996, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The method works from the principle that "community of error implies community of origin." That is, if two witnesses have a number of errors in common, it may be presumed that they were derived from a common intermediate source, called a ''hyparchetype''. Relations between the lost intermediates are determined by the same process, placing all extant manuscripts in a family tree or ''[[stemma codicum]]'' descended from a single ''archetype''. The process of constructing the stemma is called ''recension'', or the Latin ''recensio''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-814371-0"&gt;Wilson and Reynolds 1974, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Having completed the stemma, the critic proceeds to the next step, called ''selection'' or ''selectio'', where the text of the archetype is determined by examining variants from the closest hyparchetypes to the archetype and selecting the best ones. If one reading occurs more often than another at the same level of the tree, then the dominant reading is selected. If two competing readings occur equally often, then the editor uses judgment to select the correct reading.&lt;ref name="isbn0-312-21713-7"&gt;Roseman 1999, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''selectio'', the text may still contain errors, since there may be passages where no source preserves the correct reading. The step of ''examination'', or ''examinatio'' is applied to find corruptions. Where the editor concludes that the text is corrupt, it is corrected by a process called "emendation", or ''emendatio'' (also sometimes called ''divinatio''). Emendations not supported by any known source are sometimes called [[conjecture (textual criticism)|''conjectural'' emendations]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8006-0471-7"&gt;McCarter 1986, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of ''selectio'' resembles eclectic textual criticism, but applied to a restricted set of hypothetical hyparchetypes. The steps of ''examinatio'' and ''emendatio'' resemble copy-text editing. In fact, the other techniques can be seen as special cases of stemmatics in which a rigorous family history of the text cannot be determined but only approximated. If it seems that one manuscript is by far the best text, then copy text editing is appropriate, and if it seems that a group of manuscripts are good, then eclecticism on that group would be proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol07/SWH2002/|title=The Greek Vorlage of the Syra Harclensis|author=|date=|website=rosetta.reltech.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205218/http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol07/SWH2002/|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hodges–Farstad edition of the Greek New Testament attempts to use stemmatics for some portions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/CriticalEds.html Critical Editions of the New Testament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414211207/http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/CriticalEds.html |date=2009-04-14 }} at the ''Encyclopaedia of Textual Criticism''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phylogenetics ===
[[Image:Canterbury Tales.png|thumb|200px|''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', Woodcut 1484]]
[[Phylogenetics]] is a technique borrowed from [[biology]], where it was originally named ''phylogenetic systematics'' by [[Willi Hennig]]. In biology, the technique is used to determine the [[evolution]]ary relationships between different [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuh 2000, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In its application in textual criticism, the text of a number of different witnesses may be entered into a computer, which records all the differences between them, or derived from an existing apparatus. The manuscripts are then grouped according to their shared characteristics. The difference between phylogenetics and more traditional forms of statistical analysis is that, rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groupings according to their overall similarity, phylogenetics assumes that they are part of a branching family tree and uses that assumption to derive relationships between them. This makes it more like an automated approach to stemmatics. However, where there is a difference, the computer does not attempt to decide which reading is closer to the original text, and so does not indicate which branch of the tree is the "root"—which manuscript tradition is closest to the original. Other types of evidence must be used for that purpose.

Phylogenetics faces the same difficulty as textual criticism: the appearance of characteristics in descendants of an ancestor other than by direct copying (or miscopying) of the ancestor, for example where a scribe combines readings from two or more different manuscripts ("contamination"). The same phenomenon is widely present among living organisms, as instances of [[horizontal gene transfer]] (or lateral gene transfer) and [[genetic recombination]], particularly among bacteria. Further exploration of the applicability of the different methods for coping with these problems across both living organisms and textual traditions is a promising area of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221145935_Chi-Squares_and_the_Phenomenon_of_Change_of_Exemplar_in_the_Dyutaparvan |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816060750/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221145935_Chi-Squares_and_the_Phenomenon_of_Change_of_Exemplar_in_the_Dyutaparvan |archivedate=2017-08-16 |df= }} Wendy J.

Software developed for use in biology has been applied successfully to textual criticism; for example, it is being used by the Canterbury Tales Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textualcommunities.usask.ca/web/canterbury-tales/wiki/ Canterbury Tales Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030165945/http://www.textualcommunities.usask.ca/web/canterbury-tales/wiki |date=2016-10-30 }}, Official Website&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the relationship between the 84 surviving manuscripts and four early printed editions of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. Shaw's edition of Dante's Commedia uses phylogenetic and traditional methods alongside each other in a comprehensive exploration of relations among seven early witnesses to Dante's text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sd-editions.com/Commedia/index.html Commedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531035812/http://www.sd-editions.com/Commedia/index.html |date=2017-05-31 }} Shaw edition, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations and criticism ===

The stemmatic method assumes that each witness is derived from one, and only one, predecessor. If a scribe refers to more than one source when creating his copy, then the new copy will not clearly fall into a single branch of the family tree. In the stemmatic method, a manuscript that is derived from more than one source is said to be ''contaminated''.

The method also assumes that scribes only make new errors—they do not attempt to correct the errors of their predecessors. When a text has been improved by the scribe, it is said to be ''sophisticated'', but "sophistication" impairs the method by obscuring a document's relationship to other witnesses, and making it more difficult to place the manuscript correctly in the stemma.

The stemmatic method requires the textual critic to group manuscripts by commonality of error. It is required, therefore, that the critic can distinguish erroneous readings from correct ones. This assumption has often come under attack. [[W. W. Greg]] noted, "That if a scribe makes a mistake he will inevitably produce nonsense is the tacit and wholly unwarranted assumption."&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Anton Knittel]] defended the traditional point of view in theology and was against the modern textual criticism. He defended an authenticity of the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|Pericopa Adulterae]] (John 7:53–8:11), [[Comma Johanneum]] (1 John 5:7), and [[Testimonium Flavianum]]. According to him [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] in his [[Novum Instrumentum omne]] did not incorporate the ''Comma'' from [[Codex Montfortianus]], because of grammar differences, but used [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglotta]]. According to him the ''Comma'' was known for [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref&gt;Knittel, ''Neue Kritiken über den berühmten Sprych: Drey sind, die da zeugen im Himmel, der Vater, das Wort, und der heilige Geist, und diese drei sind eins'' Braunschweig 1785&lt;/ref&gt;

The stemmatic method's final step is ''emendatio'', also sometimes referred to as "conjectural emendation". But in fact, the critic employs conjecture at every step of the process. Some of the method's rules that are designed to reduce the exercise of editorial judgment do not necessarily produce the correct result. For example, where there are more than two witnesses at the same level of the tree, normally the critic will select the dominant reading. However, it may be no more than fortuitous that more witnesses have survived that present a particular reading. A plausible reading that occurs less often may, nevertheless, be the correct one.&lt;ref&gt;Tov 2001, pp. 351–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the stemmatic method assumes that every extant witness is derived, however remotely, from a single source. It does not account for the possibility that the original author may have revised his work, and that the text could have existed at different times in more than one authoritative version.

==Best-text editing==

The critic [[Joseph Bédier]] (1864–1938), who had worked with stemmatics, launched an attack on that method in 1928. He surveyed editions of medieval French texts that were produced with the stemmatic method, and found that textual critics tended overwhelmingly to produce bifid trees, divided into just two branches. He concluded that this outcome was unlikely to have occurred by chance, and that therefore, the method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses. He suspected that editors tended to favor trees with two branches, as this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment (as there would be no third branch to "break the tie" whenever the witnesses disagreed). He also noted that, for many works, more than one reasonable stemma could be postulated, suggesting that the method was not as rigorous or as scientific as its proponents had claimed.

Bédier's doubts about the stemmatic method led him to consider whether it could be dropped altogether. As an alternative to stemmatics, Bédier proposed a Best-text editing method, in which a single textual witness, judged to be of a 'good' textual state by the editor, is emended as lightly as possible for manifest transmission mistakes, but left otherwise unchanged. This makes a Best-text edition essentially a documentary edition. For an example one may refer to Eugene Vinaver's edition of the Winchester Manuscript of Malory's [[Le Morte D'Arthur]]

== Copy-text editing ==

When copy-text editing, the scholar fixes errors in a base text, often with the help of other witnesses. Often, the base text is selected from the oldest manuscript of the text, but in the early days of printing, the copy text was often a manuscript that was at hand.

Using the copy-text method, the critic examines the base text and makes corrections (called emendations) in places where the base text appears wrong to the critic. This can be done by looking for places in the base text that do not make sense or by looking at the text of other witnesses for a superior reading. Close-call decisions are usually resolved in favor of the copy-text.

The first published, printed edition of the Greek [[New Testament]] was produced by this method. [[Erasmus]], the editor, selected a manuscript from the local Dominican monastery in Basle and corrected its obvious errors by consulting other local manuscripts. The [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]] text, which was the basis for the [[Revised Version]] of the English bible, also used the copy-text method, using the [[Codex Vaticanus]] as the base manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== McKerrow's concept of copy-text ===

The bibliographer [[Ronald B. McKerrow]] introduced the term ''copy-text'' in his 1904 edition of the works of [[Thomas Nashe]], defining it as "the text used in each particular case as the basis of mine." McKerrow was aware of the limitations of the stemmatic method, and believed it was more prudent to choose one particular text that was thought to be particularly reliable, and then to emend it only where the text was obviously corrupt. The French critic [[Joseph Bédier]] likewise became disenchanted with the stemmatic method, and concluded that the editor should choose the best available text, and emend it as little as possible.

In McKerrow's method as originally introduced, the copy-text was not necessarily the earliest text. In some cases, McKerrow would choose a later witness, noting that "if an editor has reason to suppose that a certain text embodies later corrections than any other, and at the same time has no ground for disbelieving that these corrections, or some of them at least, are the work of the author, he has no choice but to make that text the basis of his reprint."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Greg 1950, pp.  23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1939, in his ''Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare'', McKerrow had changed his mind about this approach, as he feared that a later edition—even if it contained authorial corrections—would "deviate more widely than the earliest print from the author's original manuscript." He therefore concluded that the correct procedure would be "produced by using the earliest "good" print as copy-text and inserting into it, from the first edition which contains them, such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author." But, fearing the arbitrary exercise of editorial judgment, McKerrow stated that, having concluded that a later edition had substantive revisions attributable to the author, "we must accept all the alterations of that edition, saving any which seem obvious blunders or misprints."&lt;ref&gt;McKerrow 1939. pp. 17–18, quoted in Greg 1950, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

=== W. W. Greg's rationale of copy-text ===

Anglo-American textual criticism in the last half of the 20th century came to be dominated by a landmark 1950 essay by [[Walter Wilson Greg|Sir Walter W. Greg]], "The Rationale of Copy-Text". Greg proposed:

{{quotation|[A] distinction between the significant, or as I shall call them 'substantive', readings of the text, those namely that affect the author's meaning or the essence of his expression, and others, such in general as spelling, punctuation, word-division, and the like, affecting mainly its formal presentation, which may be regarded as the accidents, or as I shall call them 'accidentals', of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Greg observed that compositors at printing shops tended to follow the "substantive" readings of their copy faithfully, except when they deviated unintentionally; but that "as regards accidentals they will normally follow their own habits or inclination, though they may, for various reasons and to varying degrees, be influenced by their copy."&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

He concluded:

{{quotation|The true theory is, I contend, that the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals, but that the choice between substantive readings belongs to the general theory of textual criticism and lies altogether beyond the narrow principle of the copy-text. Thus it may happen that in a critical edition the text rightly chosen as copy may not by any means be the one that supplies most substantive readings in cases of variation. The failure to make this distinction and to apply this principle has naturally led to too close and too general a reliance upon the text chosen as basis for an edition, and there has arisen what may be called the tyranny of the copy-text, a tyranny that has, in my opinion, vitiated much of the best editorial work of the past generation.&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Greg's view, in short, was that the "copy-text can be allowed no over-riding or even preponderant [[Authority (textual criticism)|authority]] so far as substantive readings are concerned." The choice between reasonable competing readings, he said:

{{quotation|[W]ill be determined partly by the opinion the editor may form respecting the nature of the copy from which each substantive edition was printed, which is a matter of external authority; partly by the intrinsic authority of the several texts as judged by the relative frequency of manifest errors therein; and partly by the editor's judgment of the intrinsic claims of individual readings to originality—in other words their intrinsic merit, so long as by 'merit' we mean the likelihood of their being what the author wrote rather than their appeal to the individual taste of the editor.&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Greg argued that an editor should be free to use his judgment to choose between competing substantive readings, he suggested that an editor should defer to the copy-text when "the claims of two readings&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;appear to be exactly balanced.&amp;nbsp;... In such a case, while there can be no logical reason for giving preference to the copy-text, in practice, if there is no reason for altering its reading, the obvious thing seems to be to let it stand."&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The "exactly balanced" variants are said to be ''indifferent''.

Editors who follow Greg's rationale produce ''eclectic'' editions, in that the authority for the "accidentals" is derived from one particular source (usually the earliest one) that the editor considers to be authoritative, but the authority for the "substantives" is determined in each individual case according to the editor's judgment. The resulting text, except for the accidentals, is constructed without relying predominantly on any one witness.

=== Greg–Bowers–Tanselle ===

W. W. Greg did not live long enough to apply his rationale of copy-text to any actual editions of works. His rationale was adopted and significantly expanded by [[Fredson Bowers]] (1905–1991). Starting in the 1970s, [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] vigorously took up the method's defense and added significant contributions of his own. Greg's rationale as practiced by Bowers and Tanselle has come to be known as the "Greg–Bowers" or the "Greg–Bowers–Tanselle" method.

==== Application to works of all periods ====
[[Image:A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' ([[First Folio]])]]
In his 1964 essay, "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors", Bowers said that "the theory of copy-text proposed by Sir Walter Greg rules supreme".&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1964, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers's assertion of "supremacy" was in contrast to Greg's more modest claim that "My desire is rather to provoke discussion than to lay down the law".&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Greg had limited his illustrative examples to English Renaissance drama, where his expertise lay, Bowers argued that the rationale was "the most workable editorial principle yet contrived to produce a critical text that is authoritative in the maximum of its details whether the author be [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[John Dryden|Dryden]], [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], or [[Stephen Crane]]. The principle is sound without regard for the literary period."&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1973, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; For works where an author's manuscript survived—a case Greg had not considered—Bowers concluded that the manuscript should generally serve as copy-text. Citing the example of Nathaniel Hawthorne, he noted:

{{quotation|When an author's manuscript is preserved, this has paramount authority, of course. Yet the fallacy is still maintained that since the first edition was proofread by the author, it must represent his final intentions and hence should be chosen as copy-text. Practical experience shows the contrary. When one collates the manuscript of ''[[The House of the Seven Gables]]'' against the first printed edition, one finds an average of ten to fifteen differences per page between the manuscript and the print, many of them consistent alterations from the manuscript system of punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and word-division. It would be ridiculous to argue that Hawthorne made approximately three to four thousand small changes in proof, and then wrote the manuscript of ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]'' according to the same system as the manuscript of the ''Seven Gables'', a system that he had rejected in proof.&lt;ref name="Bowers 1964, p. 226"&gt;Bowers 1964, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following Greg, the editor would then replace any of the manuscript readings with substantives from printed editions that could be reliably attributed to the author: "Obviously, an editor cannot simply reprint the manuscript, and he must substitute for its readings any words that he believes Hawthorne changed in proof."&lt;ref name="Bowers 1964, p. 226"/&gt;

==== Uninfluenced final authorial intention ====

McKerrow had articulated textual criticism's goal in terms of "our ideal of an author's fair copy of his work in its final state".&lt;ref&gt;McKerrow 1939, pp. 17–8, quoted in Bowers 1974, p. 82, n. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers asserted that editions founded on Greg's method would "represent the nearest approximation in every respect of the author's final intentions."&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1964, p.  227&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers stated similarly that the editor's task is to "approximate as nearly as possible an inferential authorial fair copy."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Tanselle 1976, p.  168&lt;/ref&gt; Tanselle notes that, "Textual criticism&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;has generally been undertaken with a view to reconstructing, as accurately as possible, the text finally intended by the author".&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1995, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowers and Tanselle argue for rejecting textual variants that an author inserted at the suggestion of others. Bowers said that his edition of [[Stephen Crane]]'s first novel, ''Maggie'', presented "the author's final and uninfluenced artistic intentions."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Zeller 1975, p.  247&lt;/ref&gt; In his writings, Tanselle refers to "unconstrained authorial intention" or "an author's uninfluenced intentions."&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1986, p.  19&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a departure from Greg, who had merely suggested that the editor inquire whether a later reading "is one that the author can reasonably be supposed to have substituted for the former",&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; not implying any further inquiry as to ''why'' the author had made the change.

Tanselle discusses the example of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Typee]]''. After the novel's initial publication, Melville's publisher asked him to soften the novel's criticisms of missionaries in the South Seas. Although Melville pronounced the changes an improvement, Tanselle rejected them in his edition, concluding that "there is no evidence, internal or external, to suggest that they are the kinds of changes Melville would have made without pressure from someone else."&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1976, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowers confronted a similar problem in his edition of ''Maggie''. Crane originally printed the novel privately in 1893. To secure commercial publication in 1896, Crane agreed to remove profanity, but he also made stylistic revisions. Bowers's approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896, but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that Crane was fulfilling the publisher's intention rather than his own. There were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of Bowers's choices came under fire—both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of ''Maggie''.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1977, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Zeller argued that it is impossible to tease apart the changes Crane made for literary reasons and those made at the publisher's insistence:

{{quotation|Firstly, in anticipation of the character of the expected censorship, Crane could be led to undertake alterations which also had literary value in the context of the new version. Secondly, because of the systematic character of the work, purely censorial alterations sparked off further alterations, determined at this stage by literary considerations. Again in consequence of the systemic character of the work, the contamination of the two historical versions in the edited text gives rise to a third version. Though the editor may indeed give a rational account of his decision at each point on the basis of the documents, nevertheless to aim to produce the ideal text which Crane would have produced in 1896 if the publisher had left him complete freedom is to my mind just as unhistorical as the question of how the first World War or the history of the United States would have developed if Germany had not caused the USA to enter the war in 1917 by unlimited submarine combat. The nonspecific form of censorship described above is one of the historical conditions under which Crane wrote the second version of ''Maggie'' and made it function. From the text which arose in this way it is not possible to subtract these forces and influences, in order to obtain a text of the author's own. Indeed I regard the "uninfluenced artistic intentions" of the author as something which exists only in terms of aesthetic abstraction. Between influences on the author and influences on the text are all manner of transitions.&lt;ref&gt;Zeller 1975, pp.  247–248&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

Bowers and Tanselle recognize that texts often exist in more than one authoritative version. Tanselle argues that:

{{quotation|[T]wo types of revision must be distinguished: that which aims at altering the purpose, direction, or character of a work, thus attempting to make a different sort of work out of it; and that which aims at intensifying, refining, or improving the work as then conceived (whether or not it succeeds in doing so), thus altering the work in degree but not in kind. If one may think of a work in terms of a spatial metaphor, the first might be labeled "vertical revision," because it moves the work to a different plane, and the second "horizontal revision," because it involves alterations within the same plane. Both produce local changes in active intention; but revisions of the first type appear to be in fulfillment of an altered programmatic intention or to reflect an altered active intention in the work as a whole, whereas those of the second do not.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1976, p.  193&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He suggests that where a revision is "horizontal" (''i.e.'', aimed at improving the work as originally conceived), then the editor should adopt the author's later version. But where a revision is "vertical" (''i.e.'', fundamentally altering the work's intention as a whole), then the revision should be treated as a new work, and edited separately on its own terms.

==== Format for apparatus ====

Bowers was also influential in defining the form of [[critical apparatus]] that should accompany a scholarly edition. In addition to the ''content'' of the apparatus, Bowers led a movement to relegate editorial matter to appendices, leaving the critically established text "in the clear", that is, free of any signs of editorial intervention. Tanselle explained the rationale for this approach:

{{quotation|In the first place, an editor's primary responsibility is to establish a text; whether his goal is to reconstruct that form of the text which represents the author's final intention or some other form of the text, his essential task is to produce a reliable text according to some set of principles. Relegating all editorial matter to an appendix and allowing the text to stand by itself serves to emphasize the primacy of the text and permits the reader to confront the literary work without the distraction of editorial comment and to read the work with ease. A second advantage of a clear text is that it is easier to quote from or to reprint. Although no device can insure accuracy of quotation, the insertion of symbols (or even footnote numbers) into a text places additional difficulties in the way of the quoter. Furthermore, most quotations appear in contexts where symbols are inappropriate; thus when it is necessary to quote from a text which has not been kept clear of apparatus, the burden of producing a clear text of the passage is placed on the quoter. Even footnotes at the bottom of the text pages are open to the same objection, when the question of a photographic reprint arises.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1972, pp. 45–6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some critics believe that a clear-text edition gives the edited text too great a prominence, relegating textual variants to appendices that are difficult to use, and suggesting a greater sense of certainty about the established text than it deserves. As Shillingsburg notes, "English scholarly editions have tended to use notes at the foot of the text page, indicating, tacitly, a greater modesty about the "established" text and drawing attention more forcibly to at least some of the alternative forms of the text".&lt;ref&gt;Shillingsburg 1989, p. 56, n. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The MLA's CEAA and CSE ====

In 1963, the [[Modern Language Association|Modern Language Association of America]] (MLA) established the Center for Editions of American Authors (CEAA). The CEAA's ''Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures'', first published in 1967, adopted the Greg–Bowers rationale in full. A CEAA examiner would inspect each edition, and only those meeting the requirements would receive a seal denoting "An Approved Text."

Between 1966 and 1975, the Center allocated more than $1.5&amp;nbsp;million in funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities to various scholarly editing projects, which were required to follow the guidelines (including the structure of editorial apparatus) as Bowers had defined them.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1975, pp. 167–8&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davis, the funds coordinated by the CEAA over the same period were more than $6&amp;nbsp;million, counting funding from universities, university presses, and other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1977, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Scholarly Editions (CSE) replaced the CEAA in 1976. The change of name indicated the shift to a broader agenda than just American authors. The Center also ceased its role in the allocation of funds. The Center's latest guidelines (2003) no longer prescribe a particular editorial procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/cse.htm|title=Aims and Services of the Committee on Scholarly Editions|publisher=The Committee on Scholarly Editions, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis|accessdate=2008-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523101341/http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/cse.htm|archivedate=2008-05-23|df=}} &lt;br /&gt;"The editorial standards that form the criteria for the award of the CSE "Approved Edition" emblem can be stated here in only the most general terms, since the range of editorial work that comes within the committee's purview makes it impossible to set forth a detailed, step-by-step editorial procedure."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to religious documents ==
All texts are subject to investigation and systematic criticism where the original verified first document is not available.  Believers in [[sacred text]]s and scriptures sometimes are reluctant to accept any form of challenge to what they believe to be divine [[revelation]].  Some opponents and [[polemicist]]s may look for any way to find fault with a particular religious text.  Legitimate textual criticism may be resisted by both believers and skeptics.

=== Book of Mormon ===
{{See also|Historicity of the Book of Mormon}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[LDS Church]]) includes the [[Book of Mormon]] as a foundational reference.  LDS members typically believe the book to be a literal historical record.

Although some earlier unpublished studies had been prepared, not until the early 1970s was true textual criticism applied to the Book of Mormon.  At that time BYU Professor Ellis Rasmussen and his associates were asked by the LDS Church to begin preparation for a new edition of the Holy Scriptures.  One aspect of that effort entailed digitizing the text and preparing appropriate footnotes, another aspect required establishing the most dependable text.  To that latter end, [[Stanley R. Larson]] (a Rasmussen graduate student) set about applying modern text critical standards to the manuscripts and early editions of the Book of Mormon as his thesis project—which he completed in 1974.  To that end, Larson carefully examined the Original Manuscript (the one dictated by [[Joseph Smith]] to his scribes) and the Printer's Manuscript (the copy [[Oliver Cowdery]] prepared for the Printer in 1829–1830), and compared them with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions of the Book of Mormon to determine what sort of changes had occurred over time and to make judgments as to which readings were the most original.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley R. Larson, “A Study of Some Textual Variations in the Book of Mormon, Comparing the Original and Printer's MSS., and Comparing the 1830, 1837, and 1840 Editions,” unpublished master's thesis (Provo: BYU, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Larson proceeded to publish a useful set of well-argued articles on the phenomena which he had discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Larson, “Early Book of Mormon Texts: Textual Changes to the Book of Mormon in 1837 and 1840,” ''Sunstone'', 1/4 (Fall 1976), 44–55; Larson, “Textual Variants in the Book of Mormon Manuscripts,” ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', 10/4 (Autumn 1977), 8–30 [FARMS Reprint LAR-77]; Larson,  “Conjectural Emendation and the Text of the Book of Mormon,” ''BYU Studies'', 18 (Summer 1978), 563–569 [FARMS Reprint LAR-78].&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of his observations were included as improvements in the 1981 LDS edition of the Book of Mormon.

By 1979, with the establishment of the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] ([[FARMS]]) as a California non-profit research institution, an effort led by [[Robert F. Smith (historian)|Robert F. Smith]] began to take full account of Larson's work and to publish a Critical Text of the Book of Mormon.  Thus was born the FARMS Critical Text Project which published the first volume of the 3-volume Book of Mormon Critical Text in 1984.  The third volume of that first edition was published in 1987, but was already being superseded by a second, revised edition of the entire work,&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Smith, ed., ''Book of Mormon Critical Text'', 2nd ed., 3 vols. (Provo: FARMS, 1986–1987).&lt;/ref&gt; greatly aided through the advice and assistance of then Yale doctoral candidate [[Grant Hardy]], Dr. [[Gordon C. Thomasson]], Professor [[John W. Welch]] (the head of FARMS), Professor [[Royal Skousen]], and others too numerous to mention here.  However, these were merely preliminary steps to a far more exacting and all-encompassing project.

In 1988, with that preliminary phase of the project completed, Professor Skousen took over as editor and head of the FARMS Critical Text of the Book of Mormon Project and proceeded to gather still scattered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and to have advanced photographic techniques applied to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments.  He also closely examined the Printer's Manuscript (owned by the [[Community of Christ]]—RLDS Church in Independence, Missouri) for differences in types of ink or pencil, in order to determine when and by whom they were made.  He also collated the various editions of the Book of Mormon down to the present to see what sorts of changes have been made through time.

Thus far, Professor Skousen has published complete transcripts of the Original and Printer's Manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;''The Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon'' (Provo: FARMS, 2001); ''The Printer's Manuscript of the Book of Mormon'', 2 vols. (FARMS, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a six-volume analysis of textual variants.&lt;ref&gt;''Analysis of Textual Variants of the Book of Mormon'', 6 vols. (Provo: FARMS, 2004–2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Still in preparation are a history of the text, and a complete electronic collation of editions and manuscripts (volumes 3 and 5 of the Project, respectively).  Yale University has in the meantime published an edition of the Book of Mormon which incorporates all aspects of Skousen's research.&lt;ref&gt;Skousen, ed., ''The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text'' (Yale Univ. Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the New Testament, changes, corruptions, and erasures have been found, particularly in the Masoretic texts. This is ascribed to the fact that early ''soferim'' (scribes) did not treat copy errors in the same manner later on.&lt;ref&gt;Tov 2001, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three separate new editions of the Hebrew Bible currently in development: ''[[Biblia Hebraica Quinta]]'', the ''[[Hebrew University Bible Project|Hebrew University Bible]]'', and the ''[[Oxford Hebrew Bible]]''.  ''Biblia Hebraica Quinta'' is a [[diplomatics|diplomatic]] edition based on the [[Leningrad Codex]].  The ''Hebrew University Bible'' is also diplomatic, but based on the [[Aleppo Codex]].  The ''Oxford Hebrew Bible'' is an eclectic edition.&lt;ref&gt;Hendel, R., "The Oxford Hebrew Bible: Prologue to a New Critical Edition", ''Vetus Testamentum, vol. 58'', no. 3 (2008). pp.&amp;nbsp;325–326&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Testament ===
{{main|Textual criticism of the New Testament}}
Early [[New Testament]] texts include more than 5,800 [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages (including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Ethiopic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]).  The manuscripts contain approximately 300,000 textual variants, most of them involving changes of word order and other comparative trivialities.&lt;ref name=wallace_on_majority&gt;{{cite web|last= Wallace|first= Daniel|title= The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical?|url= https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical|accessdate= 23 November 2013|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000201/https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical|archivedate= 3 December 2013|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Westcott and Hort|title= The New Testament in The Original Greek: Introduction Appendix|url= https://books.google.com/?id=7ZxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=The+New+Testament+in+the+Original+Greek#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate= 23 November 2013|year= 1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2017}}  Thus, for over 250 years, New Testament scholars have argued that no textual variant affects any doctrine.  Professor [[D. A. Carson]] states: "nothing we believe to be doctrinally true, and nothing we are commanded to do, is in any way jeopardized by the variants. This is true for any textual tradition. The interpretation of individual passages may well be called in question; but never is a doctrine affected."&lt;ref name=wallace_on_majority/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, chiefly in that it makes stemmatics in many cases impossible, because many writers used two or more different manuscripts as sources. Consequently, New Testament textual critics have adopted [[eclecticism]] after sorting the witnesses into three major groups, called text-types. {{As of | 2017}} the most common division distinguishes:

| The [[Alexandrian text-type]]&lt;br /&gt;(also called the "Neutral Text" tradition; less frequently, the "Minority Text")||2nd–4th centuries CE|| This family constitutes a group of early and well-regarded texts, including [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Most representatives of this tradition appear to come from around [[Alexandria, Egypt]] and from [[Coptic Church|the Alexandrian Church]]. It contains readings that are often terse, shorter, somewhat rough, less harmonised, and generally more difficult. The family was once{{when|date=August 2017}} thought{{by whom|date=August 2017}} to result from a very carefully edited 3rd-century [[recension]], but now is believed to be merely the result of a carefully controlled and supervised process of copying and transmission.

It is much less controlled than the Alexandrian family and its witnesses are seen to be more prone to [[paraphrase]] and other corruptions.  It is sometimes called the [[Caesarean text-type]].  Some [[New Testament]] scholars would argue that the Caesarean constitutes a distinct text-type of its own.||[[Vetus Latina]]

=== Quran ===

Textual criticism of the Quran is a beginning area of study,&lt;ref&gt;Christian-Muslim relations: yesterday, today, tomorrow Munawar Ahmad Anees, Ziauddin Sardar, Syed Z. Abedin&amp;nbsp;– 1991 For instance, a Christian critic engaging in textual criticism of the Quran from a biblical perspective will surely miss the essence of the quranic message. Just one example would clarify this point.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Studies on Islam Merlin L. Swartz&amp;nbsp;– 1981 One will find a more complete bibliographical review of the recent studies of the textual criticism of the Quran in the valuable article by Jeffery, "The Present Status of Qur'anic Studies," Report on Current Research on the Middle East&lt;/ref&gt; as Muslims have historically disapproved of [[higher criticism]] being applied to the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Religions of the world Lewis M. Hopfe&amp;nbsp;– 1979 "Some Muslims have suggested and practiced textual criticism of the Quran in a manner similar to that practiced by Christians and Jews on their bibles. No one has yet suggested the [[higher criticism]] of the Quran."&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries textual criticism can be seen as apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt's culture wars: politics and practice&amp;nbsp;– Page 278 Samia Mehrez&amp;nbsp;– 2008 Middle East report: Issues 218–222; Issues 224–225 Middle East Research &amp; Information Project, JSTOR (Organization)&amp;nbsp;– 2001 Shahine filed to divorce Abu Zayd from his wife, on the grounds that Abu Zayd's textual criticism of the Quran made him an apostate, and hence unfit to marry a Muslim. Abu Zayd and his wife eventually relocated to the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims consider the original Arabic text to be the final revelation, revealed to Muhammad from AD 610 to his death in 632. In Islamic tradition, the Quran was memorised and written down by Muhammad's companions and copied as needed.

Recently, the oldest known Quranic fragments were found at the University of Birmingham. As quoted by the lead researcher Prof. Thomas:
"These portions must have been in a form that is very close to the form of the Koran read today, supporting the view that the text has undergone little or no alteration and that it can be dated to a point very close to the time it was believed to be revealed.".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-33436021&lt;/ref&gt; This academically supports the viewpoint that the Quran today has not been altered from the original revelation.

In the 1970s, 14,000 fragments of Quran were discovered in the [[Great Mosque of Sana'a|Great Mosque]] of [[Sana'a]], the Sana'a manuscripts. About 12,000 fragments belonged to 926 copies of the Quran, the other 2,000 were loose fragments. The oldest known copy of the Quran so far belongs to this collection: it dates to the end of the 7th–8th centuries.

The examination by Gerd R. Puin, who led the restoration project, revealed no textual change, but only minor variants in word spelling. To be precise and quoting from a text he wrote:
"...These Yemeni Qur'anic fragments do not differ from those found in museums and libraries elsewhere, with the exception of details that do not touch the Qur'an itself, but are rather differences in the way words are spelled. This phenomenon is well-known, even in the Qur'an published in Cairo in which is written:

Ibrhim next to Ibrhm
Quran next to Qrn
Simahum next to Simhum
In the oldest Yemeni Qur'anic fragments, for example, the phenomenon of not writing the vowel alif is rather common." &lt;ref name="individual.utoronto.ca"&gt;http://individual.utoronto.ca/fantastic/The_History_of_the_Quranic_Text_from_Revelation_to_Compilation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His full letter appeared in the newspaper: Ath-Thawra issue 11.3.1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The other finding was that the ordering of the Surahs were different in one fragment. However, this is also a normative occurrence as the ordering of the Surah's can be changed without controversy. In fact, the original ordering was roughly based on Surah length. As well, it should be mentioned here that the oldest Quran copies discovered in this collection had no variations with present versions. Only fragments of parallel versions to these in time (i.e., both the Quran copies/fragments were dated to the same time or the deviant fragment copy was dated to a later time) had the above-mentioned variations-thus, this may be attributed to mistakes of Quranic students (something that is exemplified by the fact that some of these Quran copies were written on erased parchment layers containing older writing-as if a student was continuously erasing and rewriting the text). And so, there is no chronological dependence to these deviant fragment copies. Also, it is of scholarly consensus that&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto.ca"/&gt; particularly, in the fragment of reference, the ordering of the Surahs was different due it being a collection of some Surahs and not a complete Quran. This was wide spread practice as one complete Quranic Mushaf could be quite substantial in weight and volume and thus unpractical to carry on a person.&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto.ca"/&gt;

=== Talmud ===
Textual criticism of the Talmud has a long pre-history but has become a separate discipline from Talmudic study only recently.&lt;ref&gt;Economic analysis in Talmudic literature: rabbinic thought in the .Roman A. Ohrenstein, Barry Gordon.. Page 9 2009 "In fact, textual criticism of the Talmud is as old as the Talmud itself. In modern times, however, it became a separate scholarly concern, where scientific method is applied to correct corrupt and incomprehensible passages.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the research is in Hebrew and German language periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;The treatise Ta'anit of the Babylonian Talmud: [[Henry Malter]]&amp;nbsp;– 1978 It goes without saying that the writings of modern authors dealing with textual criticism of the Talmud, many of which are scattered in Hebrew and German periodicals, are likewise to be utilized for the purpose.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical texts ==
Textual criticism originated in the classical era and its development in modern times began with classics scholars, in an effort to determine the original content of texts like [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-23200-1"&gt;Habib 2005, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; There are far fewer witnesses to classical texts than to the Bible, so scholars can use stemmatics and, in some cases, copy text editing.  However, unlike the New Testament where the earliest witnesses are within 200&amp;nbsp;years of the original, the earliest existing manuscripts of most classical texts were written about a millennium after their composition.  All things being equal, textual scholars expect that a larger time gap between an original and a manuscript means more changes in the text.

== Legal protection ==
Scientific and critical editions can be protected by copyright as works of authorship if enough creativity/originality is provided. The mere addition of a word, or substitution of a term with another one believed to be more correct, usually does not achieve such level of originality/creativity. All the notes accounting for the analysis and why and how such changes have been made represent a different work autonomously copyrightable if the other requirements are satisfied. In the European Union critical and scientific editions may be protected also by the relevant neighboring right that protects critical and scientific publications of public domain works as made possible by art. 5 of the [[Copyright Term Directive]]. Not all EU member States have transposed art. 5 into national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Digital textual scholarship==
Digital textual criticism is a relatively new branch of textual criticism working with digital tools to establish a critical edition. The development of digital editing tools has allowed editors to transcribe, archive and process documents much faster than before. Some scholars claim digital editing has radically changed the nature of textual criticism; but others believe the editing process has remained fundamentally the same, and digital tools have simply made aspects of it more efficient.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== History ===
From its beginnings, digital scholarly editing involved developing a system for displaying both a newly "typeset" text and a history of variations in the text under review. Until about halfway through the first decade of the twenty-first century, digital archives relied almost entirely on manual transcriptions of texts. However, over the course of this decade, image files became much faster and cheaper, and storage space and upload times ceased to be significant issues. The next step in digital scholarly editing was the wholesale introduction of images of historical texts, particularly high-definition images of manuscripts, formally offered only in samples.&lt;ref name="ecommons.luc.edu"&gt;Shillingsburg, Peter, "Literary Documents, Texts, and Works Represented Digitally" (2013). Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities Publications. 3. {{cite web |url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/ctsdh_pubs/3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816064103/http://ecommons.luc.edu/ctsdh_pubs/3/ |archivedate=2017-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
In view of the need to represent historical texts primarily through transcription, and because transcriptions required encoding for every aspect of text that could not be recorded by a single keystroke on the [[QWERTY]] keyboard, encoding was invented. [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) uses encoding for the same purpose, although its particulars were designed for scholarly uses in order to offer some hope that scholarly work on digital texts had a good chance of migrating from aging operating systems and/or digital platforms to new ones, and the hope that standardization would lead to easy interchange of data among different projects.&lt;ref name="ecommons.luc.edu"/&gt;

=== Software ===
Several computer programs and standards exist to support the work of the editors of critical editions.  These include
* The [[Text Encoding Initiative]]. The Guidelines of the TEI provide much detailed analysis of the procedures of critical editing, including recommendations about how to mark up a computer file containing a text with critical apparatus.  See especially the following chapters of the Guidelines: [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html 10. Manuscript Description], [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html 11. Representation of Primary Sources], and [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html 12. Critical Apparatus].
* [http://www.juxtasoftware.org/about/ Juxta] is an open-source tool for comparing and collating multiple witnesses to a single textual work. It was designed to aid scholars and editors examine the history of a text from manuscript to print versions.  Juxta provides collation for multiple versions of texts that are marked up in plain text or TEI/XML format.
* The [http://tug.org/edmac EDMAC] macro package for Plain [[TeX]] is a set of macros originally developed by John Lavagnino and Dominik Wujastyk for typesetting critical editions. "EDMAC" stands for "EDition" "MACros." EDMAC is in [[maintenance mode]].
* The [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ledmac ledmac] package is a development of EDMAC by Peter R. Wilson for typesetting critical editions with [[LaTeX]]. [[ledmac]] is in [[maintenance mode]].&lt;ref&gt;See further the useful guidelines offered by {{cite web|last=Dekker|first=D-J.|title=Typesetting Critical Editions with LaTeX: ledmac, ledpar and ledarab|url=http://www.djdekker.net/ledmac/|accessdate=14 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905044748/http://www.djdekker.net/ledmac/|archivedate=5 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eledmac eledmac] package is a further development of ledmac by Maïeul Rouquette that adds more sophisticated features and solves more advanced problems. [[eledmac]] was forked from ledmac when it became clear that it needed to develop in ways that would compromise [[backward-compatibility]]. [[eledmac]] is [[maintenance mode]].
* The [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/reledmac reledmac] package is a further development of eledmac by Maïeul Rouquette that rewrittes many part of the code in order to allow more robust developments in the future. In 2015, it is in active development.
* [http://www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/critedltx.html ednotes], written by Christian Tapp and Uwe Lück is another package for typesetting critical editions using [[LaTeX]].
* [http://cte.oeaw.ac.at// Classical Text Editor] is a word-processor for critical editions, commentaries and parallel texts written by Stefan Hagel.  CTE is designed for use on the Windows operating system, but has been successfully run on Linux and OS/X using [[Wine (software)|Wine]].  CTE can export files in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] format.  CTE is currently (2014) in active development.
* [http://karas.ch/cet/cetinfo.htm Critical Edition Typesetter] by Bernt Karasch is a system for typesetting critical editions starting from input into a word-processor, and ending up with typesetting with [[TeX]] and [[EDMAC]].  Development opf CET seems to have stopped in 2004.

'''''The Cyberiad''''' ({{lang-pl|Cyberiada}}) is a series of humorous science fiction [[short story|short stories]] by Polish writer [[Stanisław Lem]], originally published in 1965, with an English translation appearing in 1974. The main [[protagonist]]s of the series are Trurl and Klapaucius, the "constructors".

The vast majority of characters are either [[robot]]s or intelligent [[machine]]s. The stories focus on problems of the individual and society, as well as on the vain search for human happiness through technological means. Two of these stories were included in the book ''[[The Mind's I]].''

The word "Cyberiad" is used in the series only once as a name of a pretty woman in a poem by Elektrybałt, an electronic poet invented by Trurl.&lt;ref&gt;Lem Stanisław. ''Listy albo opór materii'',  Kraków, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a steel statue of Elektrybalt in the [[Copernicus Science Centre]], Warsaw. &lt;ref&gt;[http://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/warszawa/56,95080,20930000,elektrybalt-czyli-elektroniczny-poeta,,3.html "Elektrybałt, czyli elektroniczny poeta "], ''Gazeta Wyborcza''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trurl and Klapaucius==
Trurl and Klapaucius are brilliant (robotic) engineers, called "constructors" (because they can construct practically anything at will), capable of almost God-like exploits. For instance, on one occasion Trurl creates an entity capable of extracting accurate information from the random motion of gas particles, which he calls a ''"Demon of the Second Kind"''. He describes the ''"Demon of the First Kind"'' as a [[Maxwell's demon]]. On another, the two constructors re-arrange [[star]]s near their home planet in order to advertise.

The duo are best friends and rivals. When they are not busy constructing revolutionary mechanisms at home, they travel the universe, aiding those in need. As the characters are firmly established as good and righteous, they take no shame in accepting handsome rewards for their services. If rewards were promised and not delivered, the constructors may even severely punish those who deceived them.

==The world and its inhabitants==
The universe of ''The Cyberiad'' is pseudo-[[Middle Ages|medieval]]. There are [[monarchy|kingdom]]s, [[knight]]s, [[princess]]es, and even [[dragon]]s in abundance. Robots are usually [[anthropomorphic]], to the point of being divided into sexes. Love and marriage are possible. Physical and mental disabilities, old age and death, particularly in case of accidents or murder, are also common, though mechanical language is used to describe them. Death is theoretically avoidable (by means of repair), and sometimes even reversible.

In fact, the teacher of Trurl and Klapaucius, Master Cerebron, is deceased, but can still be reanimated at his tomb. The level of technology of the vast majority of inhabitants is pseudo-Medieval also, with swords, robotic steeds, and gallows widespread. With this co-exist [[Spaceflight|space travel]], extremely advanced technology made by the Constructors and futuristic weapons and devices used or mentioned on occasion. There even exists a civilization that has achieved the ''"HPLD"'' – Highest Possible Level of Development.

==Romantic stories==
Some stories are basically self-conscious parodies of romantic novels about knights, with more profound issues of psychology and social dynamics under a cartoonish and swashbuckling facade. Three of them were published in an earlier collection, ''[[Fables for Robots]]''.

A typical example is the fairy tale ''O królewiczu Ferrycym i królewnie Krystalii'' ("Prince Ferrix and the Princess Crystal"). A princely (robotic) knight falls in love with a beautiful (robotic) princess. Unfortunately, the princess is somewhat eccentric, and is captivated by stories of an alien non-robotic, "paleface" civilization (the humans). She declares that she will only marry a "paleface". Therefore, the knight decides to masquerade as a paleface. He covers himself with mud, starting to resemble one, and then comes to woo her.

Meanwhile, a real "paleface" captive arrives, given as a gift to the king. It immediately becomes obvious to the princess who is the "muddier" one, but the "paleface" turns out to be too squishy and overall disgusting. Not wanting to back down at the last minute, however, the princess declares a [[joust]] between the two suitors to select the worthier one. When the "paleface" charges at the robot, he splatters himself on the latter's metal chest, revealing the metallic body to all. The princess, beholding the beauty of the exposed robot (compared with the ugliness of the "paleface"), changes her mind. The knight and the princess live happily ever after.

==Stories involving technology and the Constructors==
Most of the stories involve Trurl and Klapaucius using their extraordinary technological abilities to help the inhabitants of the medieval planets, usually involving neutralizing tyrants.

Trurl and Klapaucius come to a planet ruled by a king who loves hunting. He has already "conquered" all the most dangerous of predators, and now hires constructors (engineers) to make new, mighty robotic beasts for him to hunt. He has already executed all of the previous constructors who visited because they could not build beasts that would be challenging enough to hunt. When the two famous Constructors arrive, they are arrested and ordered to construct a worthy foe for the king within twelve days.

The two face a dilemma: if they make something that the king will kill, they will be executed by the mad king. But if the king himself is killed, then they will be executed, for the next king will be pressured to show his respect for the previous. They solve the problem by building an animal that survives the hunt (involving both cyber-hounds and nuclear tipped missiles unleashed upon it, in the characteristic cartoonish manner) and takes the king hostage by, nothing less, turning into several police officers and presenting an order for his arrest. All the king's men fail to find and free the king (partially because in searching for the fake policemen one half of the real police force arrests the other half), and he is released only after the Constructors' numerous demands are met.

On another occasion, Trurl and Klapaucius are captured by an interstellar "PHT" pirate. Trurl offers to build a machine capable of turning hydrogen into gold (something he can do manually, which he demonstrates by hand, mixing up protons and putting electrons around). However, the pirate turns out to have a PhD and cares not for the riches, but for knowledge (and in fact points out that gold becomes cheap if it is abundant). Trurl therefore makes a modified [[Maxwell's demon]] for him, an entity that looks at moving particles of gas and reads information that is, coincidentally, encoded in their random perturbations. This way, all the information in the universe becomes easily available. The demon prints out this information on a long paper tape, but before the pirate realizes most of the information is completely useless (although strictly factual) he is buried under the endless rolls of tape, ceasing to bother anyone.

==Stories involving the search for happiness and ideal society==
Lem was very interested in the issue of the nature of an ideal society: compare his ''[[Peace on Earth (novel)|Peace on Earth]]'', ''[[The Futurological Congress]]'' and ''[[Observation on the Spot]]''.

'''The Highest Possible Level of Development civilization.''' A gravely injured hermit comes to Trurl's house and tells Trurl of Klapaucius's adventure: Klapaucius wanders across an old robot, who tells him that he has logically deduced the existence of a civilization that reached the highest possible level of development (hence "HPLD"). He has inferred the existence of such a civilization by figuring that if there are different stages of development, there will be one that is the highest. He was then faced with a problem of identifying that one; as he noted, everyone claimed that theirs was the HPLD.

Upon much research and thought, he decided that the only way to find it is by looking for a "wonder", i.e. something that has no rational explanation. Eventually Klapaucius discovers one such wonder: a star in the shape of a cube, orbited by a planet also shaped like a cube with the huge letters HPLD written on it. He lands and meets its inhabitants: a group of about 100 individuals lying around doing nothing. When the HPLDs grow tired with Klapaucius's efforts to extract answers from them, they teleport him and his ship far into outer space, albeit after filling the ship with gifts.

Seeing how he will not get anywhere this way, Klapaucius constructs a massive machine capable of simulating the entire universe, including a member of the HPLD civilization. Upon questioning the simulation, he is informed that over six million such interrogations took place in the past. The simulation also reveals that the civilization in question has long since achieved the HPLD, and thus has nothing else to strive for.

When Klapaucius asks why the HPLD civilization does not continuously engage in helping other, less advanced civilizations, the simulation explains that their attempts to do so in the past have proven extremely counter-productive. For instance, having dropped some millions of wish-fulfilling devices on a planet, they saw it blow up in a matter of hours. Eventually, the HPLD representative provides Klapaucius with the formula for "Altruizine" – a substance that allows individuals within a limited area to completely share all feelings and emotions, including both pain and joy. The idea behind Altruizine is that people who feel each other's pain as their own should treat each other as they would themselves.

'''Altruizine.''' Klapaucius produces a large quantity of the substance and sends the above-mentioned hermit (who is eager to help others) in human guise to experiment on the population of a single planet. Some of the results include villagers feeling the birth pains of a cow, depressed people being violently attacked and driven off and a crowd storming the house of the newlyweds to vicariously participate in their unaccustomed sensations.

Eventually, the hermit is identified for a robot (because he does not feel the humans' pain), is thoroughly beaten and tortured, then shot into outer space via a cannon. He then lands near Trurl's house, where the story began. Concluding his tale, the hermit assures Trurl that his thirst for altruism has vanished.

'''Trurl and the construction of happy worlds.''' Trurl is not deterred by the cautionary tale of altruizine and decides to build a race of robots happy by design. His first attempt are a culture of robots who are not capable of being unhappy (e.g. they are happy if seriously beaten up). Klapaucius ridicules this. Next step is a collectivistic culture dedicated to common happiness. When Trurl and Klapaucius visit them, they are drafted by the Ministry of Felicity and made to smile, sing, and otherwise be happy, in fixed ranks (with other inhabitants).

Trurl annihilates both failed cultures and tries to build a perfect society in a small box. The inhabitants of the box develop a religion saying that their box is the most perfect part of the universe and prepare to make a hole in it in order to bring everyone outside the Box into its perfection, by force if needed. Trurl disposes of them and decides that he needs more variety in his experiments and smaller scale for safety.

He creates hundreds of miniature worlds on microscope slides (i.e. he has to observe them through a microscope). These microworlds progress rapidly, some dying out in revolutions and wars, and some developing as regular civilizations without any of them showing any intrinsic perfection or happiness. They do achieve inter-slide travel though, and many of these worlds are later destroyed by rats.

Eventually, Trurl gets tired of all the work and builds a computer that will contain a programmatic clone of his mind that would do the research for him. Instead of building new worlds, the computer sets about expanding itself. When Trurl eventually forces it to stop building itself and start working, the clone-Trurl tells him that he has already created lots of sub-Trurl programs to do the work and tells him stories about their research (which Trurl later finds out is bogus). Trurl destroys the computer and temporarily stops looking for universal happiness.

Note that the last section of the story, does not appear in [[Michael Kandel]]'s English translation of ''The Cyberiad'', and neither does in Italian translation.

== Adaptation ==
In 1970, [[Krzysztof Meyer]] composed ''[[Cyberiada (opera)|Cyberiada]]'' – an opera to his own libretto based on selected stories.

''The Seventh [[wikt:sally|Sally]] or How Trurl's Own Perfection Led to No Good'' (Polish title: ''Wyprawa siódma, czyli o tym jak własna doskonałość Trurla do złego przywiodła'') was adapted as part of the plot for the film ''[[Victim of the Brain]]'', there called ''The Perfect Imitation''.

''The Seventh Sally'' was also an inspiration of the game ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]''.&lt;ref name="NY Times Archive"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D71F3AF936A25755C0A96F948260

'''''The Godfather Effect''''' is a 2012 critically acclaimed study of the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' films - as well as [[Mario Puzo]]'s novel - and their effect on [[American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywoods-influence-analyzed-292682&amp;ct=ga&amp;cad=CAcQAhgAIAAoATABOAFAsb-d-gRIAVgBYgJlbg&amp;cd=s8mCdalV8lI&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJG9D_h1eztLSAjzYPPlqgSrv-wQ Hollywood Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577180912290622798?mod=googlenews_wsj ''Wall Street Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt; Written by biographer [[Tom Santopietro]], the book demonstrates how ''[[The Godfather]]'' was a turning point in American cultural consciousness. With its emphasis on proud ethnicity, ''The Godfather'' changed not just the way [[Italian-Americans]] saw themselves, but how Americans of all backgrounds viewed their individual and national self-identities, their possibilities, and attendant disappointments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfather Effect'', p. 83; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Godfather Effect'' had a broader philosophical dimension, as well. As noted by Santopietro, "what Puzo delivered - brilliantly - was nothing less than a disquisition on the madness, glory, and failure of the [[American dream]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfather Effect'', p. 7; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the novel, [[Amerigo Bonasera]] declares “I believe in America.” The novel then depicts a nation where Mafia and [[big business]] are two sides of the same coin: both are corrupt, tell the truth selectively, and do exactly as they wish.&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfather Effect'', p. 81; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Godfather Effect'' was widely reviewed, and well received by the press. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it "a beautiful narrative of the way pop culture shapes our self-image."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywoods-influence-analyzed-292682&amp;ct=ga&amp;cad=CAcQAhgAIAAoATABOAFAsb-d-gRIAVgBYgJlbg&amp;cd=s8mCdalV8lI&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJG9D_h1eztLSAjzYPPlqgSrv-wQ Hollywood Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' declared that "part memoir, part devotional film essay and part reflection on the meaning of ethnicity in American life, ''The Godfather Effect'' defines how the ''Godfather'' movies, along with the 1969 Mario Puzo novel from which they were adapted, reflected the madness, glory and failure of the American dream. By exploring that dream in distinctly Italian-American terms, the movies succeeded in delivering nothing less than the Italianization of American culture. In other words, they were so cool that everyone wanted to seem a little Italian."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577180912290622798?mod=googlenews_wsj Wall Street Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsday]]'' appreciated the personal dimension in Santopietro's book, noting, "In the end, it's the personal moments, such as Santopietro taking his aging dad to revisit the field where he played baseball as a child, that are most rewarding. The films make up the shell of ''The Godfather Effect'', but it's the connections with family that give it a center as sweet as cannoli cream."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/books/the-godfather-effect-by-tom-santopietro-1.3552803 Newsday]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New York Journal of Books'' found that Santopietro “capably weaves together the memoirist elements, the history, and the analyses of the formal and thematic aspects of the films.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/godfather-effect-changing-hollywood-america-and-me ''New York Journal of Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was recognized for its historical value by ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'', the official publication of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html ''Smithsonian Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Pat Kramer of Tasty Meadows is an ordinary suburban housewife and mother of two children. Her husband Vance is an advertising executive. After exposure to an experimental perfume and other chemicals from her husband's company, she begins to shrink, gradually at first, then rapidly.

A few weeks pass and Pat has shrunk to the height of her children. Eventually, she becomes a celebrity of sorts, appearing on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and captures the hearts of the American people. Soon, she is less than a foot tall, making her like a doll and forcing her to move into a dollhouse.

Pat is kidnapped by a group of [[mad scientist]]s, who make it seem that she perished in the kitchen garbage disposal. They plan to shrink everyone in the world by performing experiments on her to learn her secret. With the help of a kind young lab custodian and a super-intelligent gorilla named Sydney, she escapes.

Speaking of her escape to a crowd of people, she continues to shrink, saying her goodbyes before becoming microscopic in size. Vanishing from sight, she is again presumed dead, but in fact she falls into a puddle of spilled household chemicals - which return her to her original size. After her homecoming celebrating her returning to a normal size she notices that her wedding ring is now too tight while her foot is splitting her shoe open, suggesting she might ''still'' be growing.

==Production notes==
Lily Tomlin plays four characters in this film: lead character Pat Kramer; her neighbor Judith Beasley (a character derived from Tomlin's live shows); Tomlin's ''[[Laugh-In]]'' characters Ernestine (a [[Switchboard operator|telephone operator]]); and Edith Ann, (a little girl - seen only in the TV version of the film).

The film reunited Lily Tomlin with fellow ''Laugh-In'' cast member Henry Gibson.

Lily Tomlin and Elizabeth Wilson previously appeared together in ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' as Violet Newstead and Roz Keith, respectively.

Rick Baker, who plays Sydney the Gorilla in the film, was the  first recipient of the Oscar for Best Make-Up for ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' when the category was first introduced in 1981. Baker's career, especially his early fascination with gorillas and his work in three movies featuring them, is told in the TV documentary ''Gorillas: Primal Contact.''

Actor [[Dick Wilson]] plays a fussy supermarket manager - much like his famous [[Charmin|Charmin tissue]] TV commercial character: [[Mr. Whipple]].

The film's writer, Jane Wagner, is Tomlin's wife and frequent collaborator.

The movie started principal photography in February 1979 with [[John Landis]] directing, but was suspended after a few days, with the reason stated as budget issues. Production resumed August 13, 1979, with Joel Schumacher replacing Landis.

According to  Landis, on an episode of Shock Waves Podcast, he wanted a trailer in theaters "one year before ''Shrinking Woman'' comes out" featuring [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in silhouette. The trailer would have Hitchcock speaking to the camera: "Good evening, work is underway here at Universal Studios in Hollywood on potentially the most important motion picture of all time - ''The Incredible Shrinking Woman'' starring Lily Tomlin." At this point, Hitchcock would uncup his hands from his desk, and a miniature-sized Tomlin would appear underneath.&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/shock-waves/id1109880594&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film opened to predominantly negative reviews from critics.

Upon release, ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[Vincent Canby]] called the film: {{quote|"an amiably funny variation on Jack Arnold's classic 1957 science-fiction film, ''The Incredible Shrinking Man,'' which had been based on Richard Matheson's novel ''The Shrinking Man,''" and went on to write that the film was "a low-key comedy that rambles from one comic idea to the next with the slightly uneasy manner of a nightclub comedian doing a new improvisation. It succeeds in bits and pieces that are separated by long patches that are more remarkable for their good will than for their wit."}} Regarding Jane Wagner's screenplay, he wrote: {{quote|"Miss Wagner has a great talent for the kind of monologues, sketches and oddball characters that made Miss Tomlin's ''Appearing Nitely'' so memorable on Broadway, but not for creating a sustained comic narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B01EFDF153BF933A05752C0A967948260 | title=The Incredible Shrinking Woman (1981) | date=January 30, 1981 | accessdate=July 24, 2012 | author=Canby, Vincent|publisher= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The [[Chicago Sun-Times]]''' [[Roger Ebert]] was more enthusiastic for the comedy, calling it: {{quote|"a terrific movie for kids and teenagers. It's a melancholy fact of the times we live in that any movie of even moderate ambition is supposed to become a blockbuster - and that "family movies", with few exceptions, are inane, innocent, and boring. But The ''Incredible Shrinking Woman'' is not inane, is sometimes wickedly knowing, and is only periodically boring."}} Ebert noted that the movie was: {{quote|"also funny in its visual approach, showing us a suburban world in which everything is done in hideously jolly colors and everybody, even the TV anchorman, wears peach blazers. America in this movie looks like a gigantic paint-color chart,"}} but ultimately remarked that while the movie succeeds on several levels, it does so: {{quote|"without ever breaking through to become a really inspired comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/101010342/1023 | title=The Incredible Shrinking Woman | date=January 1, 1981 | accessdate=July 24, 2012 | author=Ebert, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"'''The New Breed'''" is an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' television show. It first aired on 23 June 1995, during the first season.

==Introduction==
Dr. Stephen Ledbetter makes a technological and medical breakthrough when he creates a type of tiny machine, known as [[molecular nanotechnology|nanobots]], capable of curing [[nanomedicine|any disease or imperfections]] in the human body.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|''Man has long worked to stave off the diseases that can ravage us. But what can happen when the cure grows more fearsome than the disease?''}}

==Plot==
Stephen's best friend Dr. Andy Groenig tells him that he has proposed to Stephen's sister, Judy. Overjoyed at the news, Stephen shows Andy the nanobots and explains what a remarkable breakthrough they are.

Later that day Andy discovers that he has pelvic cancer, and has approximately one year to live if the hip and leg are not removed. In desperation he sneaks into Stephen's lab and injects himself with the nanobots. They quickly eliminate his cancer.

When Andy tells Stephen about the success of his nanobots, Stephen becomes concerned about the impact they may have on Andy's health—and about the possibility that he may go to prison for using an untested drug on another person. Andy tells Stephen not to worry because he injected himself without Stephen's knowledge.  Stephen still wants to deactivate the nanobots, but Andy refuses.

The nanobots not only cure Andy's cancer, they improve his health in other ways, including: removing a scar, improving his eyesight, and making him more energetic and sexually active with his fiancée. In Stephen's lab, Andy puts his hand over a [[bunsen burner]] causing a severe burn, but the nanobots repair the damaged skin in seconds.

Stephen embarks on a series of tests to find out exactly what the nanobots are capable of. Andy is submerged in water and unable to breathe, but the nanobots keep him alive. Things begin to go wrong when he wakes up the following day to find that the nanobots have responded to the tests by giving him [[gills]], allowing him to breathe underwater in the future. After telling Stephen of this, they both agree that the nanobots must be deactivated immediately. Stephen is unsuccessful—he takes measure after measure to stop them, but he is never able to eradicate all of them.

The nanobots continue making "improvements" to Andy, including giving him eyes in the back of his head, bones above his stomach, 
extra keen hearing, and jellyfish-like stinging tentacles on his skin.

Stephen is ultimately unable to deactivate or remove the nanobots, and Andy wants to die to keep his fiancée from seeing the monster he has become. Stephen kills Andy with electrocution and burns his laboratory, destroying any remaining nanobots and his research. The episode ends with Andy's grieving fiancée having cut her finger on a shattered photograph of him. The wound heals immediately, implying that the nanobots have spread to her as well.

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|''Over millions of years man has become the very paragon of animals, but we must take care not to alter what nature has taken so long to forge—or risk being burned by the very fires of creation.''}}

==Outdoor Filming Locations==
The outdoor scenes were filmed at [[Capilano University]], in [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.  
*The external of Stephen's office at The University is the Cedar building.
*The scene in which Andy first tells Stephen that he has injected himself takes place in the Library courtyard, outside of the Cedar building.
*The path on which Andy and his fiancée are jogging runs between the Library and Maple buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1890">'''Tourism in Lesotho''' is a growing industry in the country.

In 2013, travel and tourism contributed about 5.5% to the [[GDP]] of [[Lesotho]], with this proportion expected to increase to 6.1% of GDP by 2024.&lt;ref name=lesothoreview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesothoreview.com/tourism-2015.php |title=Tourism |publisher=The Lesotho Review |accessdate=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sector employed 25,000 people in 2013, 4.6% of total national employment.&lt;ref name=lesothoreview/&gt;

Residents of [[South Africa]], which completely surrounds Lesotho, make up over 90% of the visitors to the country. Many trips are to visit friends and family.&lt;ref name=lesothoreview/&gt;

Various outdoor pursuits form the most popular leisure activities for tourists in the country. The mountainous terrain draws tourists for hiking, pony trekking and skiing, as well as the use of [[four-wheel drive]] trails. The [[Afriski]] ski resort operates during the winter months.

The most used entry-points into Lesotho include [[Moshoeshoe I International Airport]] and the land border crossing points of [[Maseru]] and [[Maputsoe]].&lt;ref name="A.2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Camillo, Angelo A.|title=Handbook of Research on Global Hospitality and Tourism Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQx4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330|date=17 August 2015|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-8607-6|pages=314–|chapter=Points and Means of Tourist Entry into Lesotho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism in the country is overseen by the Ministry of Tourism, Environment &amp; Culture, based in the capital, Maseru.

'''Turkology''' (or '''Turcology''') is a complex of humanities sciences studying languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and [[ethnology]] of people speaking [[Turkic languages]] and [[Turkic peoples]] in chronological and comparative context. This includes ethnic groups from the [[Sakha people|Sakha]] in East [[Siberia]] to the [[Balkan]] Turks and [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]] in [[Moldova]].

==History==
Ethnological information on Turkic tribes for the first time was systemized by the 11th-century Turkic philologist [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] in the ''Dīwān ul-Lughat it-Turk'' (Dictionary of Turkic language). Multi-lingual dictionaries were compiled from the late 13th century for the practical application of participants in international trade and political life: Kipchak (Cuman)-Persian-Latin-German  ''Codex Cumanicus'', ''Armenian-Kipchak'', and ''Russian-Kipchak'' dictionaries. By the Middle Ages the Turkology was centred around [[Byzantium|Byzantine]]/[[Greece|Greek]] historians, ambassadors and travelers, and geographers.  In the 15th-17th centuries the main subject of Turkology was the study of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Turkish language]], and the Turkic languages of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Western Asia]]. In 1533 a first hand-written primer appeared, and by 1612 a printed grammar by Jerome Megizer was published, followed by [[Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski|F. Mesgnien-Meninski]]'s 4-volume ''Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalium'' published in 1680.

P. S. Pallas initiated a more scientific approach to Turkology with his ''Comparative dictionaries of all languages and dialects'' (1787) which included lexical materials from Tatar, Mishar, Nogai, Bashkir, and other Türkic languages. In the 19th century, Turkology was further developed by M. A. Kazembek's ''Grammar of the Turkish-Tatar language'' (1839), O. N. Betlingk ''Grammar of the Yakut language'' (1851). A major achievement was the deciphering at the end of the 19th century of the Early Middle Age [[Old Turkic script|Orkhon]] inscriptions by [[V. Thomsen]] and [[W. W. Radloff]] (1895). By the end of the 19th century, Turkology developed into a complex discipline that included linguistics, history, ethnology, archeology, arts and literature. In the 20th century the Turkology complex included physical anthropology, numismatics, genetics, ancient Turkic alphabetic scripts, typology, genesis, and etymology, onomastics and toponymy. The appearance of ''Türkische Bibliothek'' (1905–27) inaugurated specialised periodicals, followed by ''Mitteilungen zur Osmanischen Geschichte'' (1921–26). Scientific developments allowed calibrated dating, dendrochronology, metallurgy, chemistry, textile, and other specialized disciplines which contributed to the development of the Turkological studies. Deeper study of the ancient sources allowed better understanding of economical, social, mythological and cultural forces of the sedentary and nomadic societies. Linguistic studies uncovered pre-literate symbioses and mutual influences between different peoples.

===Persecution in Soviet Russia===

On 9 August 1944 the Central Committee VKP(b), the ruling party of the USSR, published an edict prohibiting "ancientization" of Turkic history. The edict was followed by a consecutive wave of mass arrests, imprisoning and killing of the [[intelligentsia]], massive creation of replacement "scientists", and re-writing of history pages on an industrial scale. Combined with the concurrent wholesale deportation of indigenous populations to remote areas in [[Middle Asia]] and [[Siberia]], the wipe-out of the science was nearly complete, and the impact of the action subsided only partially in the newly independent countries after the collapse of the USSR. In the two decades after the [[Bolshevik]]'s assuming power, the tradition of Turkological studies in Russia and dependent countries was practically [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|wiped out]].

On the other hand, this edict brought unintended benefits to Turkology. One was the nearly immediate linguistic development of an alternate lexicon which replaced the nouns and adjectives containing the word "Türk" by a wealth of euphemisms: "nomads, Siberians, Paleosiberians, Middle Asians, Scythians, Altaians, Tuvians", etc. that filled scientific publications. The other was "writing into a drawer", when results of the years of fruitful work were written down for future publication. When the bonds relaxed, the publications exploded. Another was a flight of scientists from European Russia into remote areas, which brought first class scientists to many intellectually starved outlying areas of Middle Asia. Another one was connected with the statewide efforts to re-invent the history, when a wealth of Turkological facts were found in the process of search for "correct" history. And another one was a built-up of the public interest for the forbidden subjects, that resulted that no print size could satisfy the demand. [[Lev Gumilev|L.N.Gumilev]] and [[Olzhas Suleimenov|O.Suleimenov]] inflamed a surge in the new generation of Turkology scholars.

With the physical culling of the scholars from the society, concurrently was also organized a total extermination of all their published and unpublished works, their books were removed from the libraries and destroyed from private collections by intimidated population, articles and publications were culled, published photographs were retouched, private photographs were destroyed, published scientific references were erased, or publications with undesired references were destroyed. Very few of the early 20th century expedition diaries, ethnographical notes, reports and drafts for publications were ever recovered.

A '''votive ship''', sometimes called a '''church ship''', is a [[ship model]] displayed in a [[church (building)|church]]. As a rule, votive ships are constructed and given as gifts to the church by seamen and ship builders.&lt;ref name=ne&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ne.se/votivskepp|title= Votivskepp|language=Swedish|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Nationalencyklopedin|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Votive ships are relatively common in churches in the [[Scandinavia]]n countries [[Denmark]],&lt;ref name=kristendom.dk&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kristendom.dk/artikel/418937:Indfoering--Kirkeskibet---symbolet-paa-rejsen-fra-jorden-til-himlen|title= Kirkeskibet - symbolet på rejsen fra jorden til himlen|language=Danish|last1=Nørhøj|first1=Henning|date= 24 May 2011|website= kristendom.dk|publisher= Kristeligt Dagblad|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sweden]], [[Norway]]&lt;ref name=hovag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hovag.org/sider/tekst.asp?side=17|title=Høvåg kirke|language=no|last1=Lilleholt|first1=Håkon|last2=|first2=|date=|website=Høvåg kirke &amp; bedehus|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116102821/http://hovag.org/sider/tekst.asp?side=17|archive-date=16 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Finland]], as well as on [[Åland]]&lt;ref name=aland&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.visitaland.com/se/fakta/artiklar?articleid=2805|title= Piratskepp i Kökars kyrka|language=Swedish|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Åland Official Travel Guide|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Faroe islands]], but are known also to exist in [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref name=glasgow&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.glasgowcathedral.org/votive-ship/|title= Votive Ship|last1=White|first1=Ian M|date= 4 April 2007|website= |publisher= Glasgow Cathedral|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=kristendom.dk/&gt;

The practice of displaying model ships in churches stems from the [[Middle Ages]] and appears to have been known throughout [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Europe]], in both [[Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] countries.&lt;ref name="Aston2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aston|first=Nigel|title=Art and Religion in Eighteenth-Century Europe|date=15 July 2009|publisher=Reaktion Books|language=English|isbn=9781861898456|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known remaining votive ship is a Spanish ship model from the 15th century. A model ship originally displayed in [[Storkyrkan|Stockholm Cathedral]] but today in the [[Maritime Museum (Stockholm)|Stockholm Maritime Museum]] dating from circa 1590 is the oldest surviving example in the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref name=kristendom.dk/&gt;
Votive ships are quite common in France, in coastal towns (and in some inland ones as well) either as model ships (generally made by sailors after escaping a shipwreck ) or as paintings (generally depicting some awkward situation) they are known under the Latin term of '''Ex-Voto''' (made after a vow).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
The church of Sainte Anne d'Auray in [[Brittany]] has the biggest French collection of marine ex-votos, but the practice even extends to the Mediterranean French shores, including [[Corsica]].
