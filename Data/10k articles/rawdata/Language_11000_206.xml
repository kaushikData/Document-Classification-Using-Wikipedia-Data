'''Arazaire''' and '''Arasa''' are a pair of closely related languages of uncertain affiliation.

These have been claimed to be either [[Panoan languages|Panoan]] or [[Tacanan language|Takanan]], or Takanan with Panoan words. Campbell (2012) says they are too poorly attested to classify.  However, Fleck (2013) classifies them definitely in the Madre de Dios branch of Panoan, and says that the confusion is due to a second, Takanan language that also went by the names ''Arazaire'' and ''Arasa''; a similar naming problem has caused confusion with its close relative [[Yamiaka language|Yamiaka]]. 

The name ''Arasairi'' has been used for a yet another language, better known as [[Toyeri language|Toyeri]].

'''Arjen Arî''' (1956 in [[Nusaybin]], Turkey – 30 October 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evrensel.net/haber/81718/arjen-ar-siir-yarismasinda-kazanan-belli-oldu]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Diyarbakır|Amed]]/[[Diyarbakir]]) was a contemporary [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] poet and writer.

==Biography==
He was born in the village of [[Çalê]] located in the region of [[Nusaybin]] in southeastern [[Turkey]]. He graduated from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] department of Diyarbakir College of Education in 1979. He was arrested for one week on charges of owning and distributing Kurdish and Turkish political pamphlets in 1976.

His writings have appeared in many Kurdish literary magazines including:  ''Tîrêj'', ''Berbang'', ''Nûdem'', ''Çira'', ''Pelîn'',  and ''Rewşen''. After being attacked by unidentified gunmen in 1992, he moved to [[Diyarbakir]] where he lived till his death.

He was one of the founders of the Kurdish Writers Association in 2004 and he served as its public relations officer.

Byki software is no longer available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Byki discontinued |url=https://www.transparent.com/byki-discontinued.html |website=Transparent Language |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Before You Know It''' (usually '''Byki''') is [[language acquisition]] software that listens to students and gives them detailed feedback on their pronunciation. There is also [[freeware]] for both [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] which does not check pronunciation.&lt;ref name="Laura K. Lawless"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/gr/byki.htm| title= Before You Know It - French Learning Software| publisher= [[about.com]]| first= Laura| last= Lawless| accessdate= 2010-06-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100509215315/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/gr/byki.htm| archivedate= 9 May 2010| deadurl= no| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Paid versions present continuous text, which can be used in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Byki|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/3/category/byki/1.html|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freeware version uses a [[flashcard]] software system. Courses may be branded as Byki or Transparent Language, and are available in over 70 languages.&lt;ref name="Transparent Language"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.byki.com/| title= Learn Spanish, French, German, Italian and over 70 languages with Byki software.| publisher= Transparent Language| accessdate= 2010-06-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100618105032/http://www.byki.com/| archivedate= 18 June 2010| deadurl= no| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The system  is based on [[declarative learning]] of a new language with English as the base language (except English is taught with Spanish as the base language), using the idea that the best way to approach a new language is through its vocabulary and pronunciation. The software has a [[virtual community]] of users who make the vocabulary database bigger.

This [[flashcard]] software [[Computer program|program]] helps learning and remembering dozens of foreign languages [[vocabulary]] words and is available for both [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]]. The [[language software]] has interactive vocabulary practice, progress tracker and sound files. It aims to be a personalized language-learning system that locks foreign language words and phrases into memory.

A distinctive feature in paid versions is their ability to record and graph the learner's pronunciation in detail, and compare it to the native speaker's pronunciation of the same words stored in the program. Paid versions teach 1,000-1,500 words per language

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8725">A '''biosignal''' is any [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] in living [[being]]s that can be continually [[Measuring instrument|measured]] and [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitored]]. The term biosignal is often used to refer to bioelectrical signals, but it may refer to both electrical and non-electrical signals. The usual understanding is to refer only to time-varying signals, although spatial parameter variations (e.g. the nucleotide sequence determining the [[genetic code]]) are sometimes subsumed as well.

== Electrical biosignals ==
Electrical biosignals, or bioelectrical time signals, usually refers to the change in [[electric current]] produced by the sum of an [[electrical potential]] difference across a specialized tissue, organ or cell system like the [[nervous system]]. Thus, among the best-known bioelectrical signals are:
* [[Electroencephalogram]] (EEG)
* [[Electrocardiogram]] (ECG)
* [[Electromyogram]] (EMG)
* [[Mechanomyogram]] (MMG)
* [[Electrooculography]] (EOG)
* [[Galvanic skin response]] (GSR)
* [[Magnetoencephalogram]] (MEG)

EEG, ECG, EOG and EMG are measured with a [[differential amplifier]] which registers the difference between two electrodes attached to the skin. However, the galvanic skin response measures [[electrical resistance]] and the MEG measures the [[magnetic field]] induced by electrical currents ([[electroencephalogram]]) of the brain.

With the development of methods for remote measurement of electric fields using new sensor technology, electric biosignals such as EEG&lt;ref name="us-bulletin-2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/internal/bulletin/archive/08feb02/article7.shtml|title=Remote heartbeat monitor will outperform current technology|publisher=University of Sussex Bulletin|date=8 February 2002|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sussex-2002-10-24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressrelease/media/media260.html|title=New non-invasive sensor can detect brainwaves remotely|publisher=University of Sussex|date=24 October 2002|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan-et-al-2007"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=T.

This can be applied for example for remote monitoring of brain waves and heart beat of patients who must not be touched, in particular patients with serious burns.

Electrical currents and changes in [[electrical resistance]]s across tissues can also be measured from plants.

Biosignals may also refer to any non-electrical signal that is capable of being monitored from biological beings, such as mechanical signals (e.g. the [[mechanomyogram]] or MMG), acoustic signals (e.g. phonetic and non-phonetic utterances, breathing), chemical signals (e.g. [[pH]], [[oxygenation (medicine)|oxygenation]]) and optical signals (e.g. movements).

==Use in artistic contexts==
In recent years, the use of biosignals has gained interest amongst an international artistic community of performers and composers who use biosignals to produce and control sound. Research and practice in the field go back decades in various forms&lt;ref&gt;Brouse, Andrew.

In [[social science]], the term '''built environment''', or '''built world''', refers to the [[human impact on the environment|human-made surroundings]] that provide the setting for [[human behavior|human activity]], ranging in scale from buildings to parks. It has been defined as "the human-made space in which people live, work, and recreate on a day-to-day basis."&lt;ref name=roof&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roof|first=K|author2=Oleru N.|title=Public Health: Seattle and King County's Push for the Built Environment.|journal=J Environ Health|year=2008|volume=75|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "built environment encompasses places and spaces created or modified by people including buildings, parks, and transportation systems." In recent years,{{when|date=January 2015}} [[public health]] research has expanded the definition of "built environment" to include [[healthy diet|healthy]] [[food security|food access]], [[community gardening|community garden]]s, [[mental health]],&lt;ref&gt;http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44398590/14-IJTPE-Issue26-Vol8-No1-Mar2016-pp81-87.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1483131396&amp;Signature=gIDntD2bsxFSNNgi%2BR2REeETjFc%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DIJTPE_Journal_IMPACT_OF_BUILT_ENVIRONMEN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Assari, A Birashk, B Nik, M Mousavi Naghdbishi, R|year=2016|title=IMPACT OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT ON MENTAL HEALTH: REVIEW OF TEHRAN CITY IN IRAN|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44398590/14-IJTPE-Issue26-Vol8-No1-Mar2016-pp81-87.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1483131396&amp;Signature=gIDntD2bsxFSNNgi%2BR2REeETjFc%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DIJTPE_Journal_IMPACT_OF_BUILT_ENVIRONMEN.pdf|journal=International Journal on Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering|volume=8 |issue=26|pages=81–87|via=IJTPE}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[walkability]]", and "[[bikeability]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=V|title=Strategies for Enhancing the Built Environment to Support Healthy Eating and Active Living|url=http://www.preventioninstitute.org/component/jlibrary/article/id-60/127.htm|work=Prevention Institute|accessdate=29 April 2012|author2=Mikkelsen, L|author3=Srikantharajah, J|author4=Cohen, L}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
Early concepts of built environment date to [[Classical Antiquity]]: [[Hippodamus]] of [[Miletos]], known as the "father of urban planning,"{{by whom|date=January 2015}} developed [[Ancient Greece|Greek cities]] from 498&amp;nbsp;BC to 408&amp;nbsp;BC that created order by using grid plans that mapped the city. These early city plans eventually gave way to the City Beautiful movement in the late&amp;nbsp;1800s and early&amp;nbsp;1900s, inspired by [[Daniel Hudson Burnham]], a reformist for the Progressivism movement who actively promoted "a reform of the landscape in tandem with political change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The City Beautiful Movement|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~cap/citybeautiful/city.html |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was in partnership with others who believed that beautifying American cities would improve the moral compass of the cities and encourage the upper class to spend their money in cities. This beautification process included parks and architectural design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture: The City Beautiful Movement|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/61.html|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-century modernist "indifferent" design influenced the character of work and public spaces, followed by what Alexander describes as a late twentieth century "revival of interest relating to the concept of place (including the built environment), and its relevance to mental health and other fields of study."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Donald|date=2008|title=Physical determinism, modernism and mental health|journal=Environments|issue=35 no.3|doi=|pmid=|hdl=10613/2722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern built environment==
Currently, built environments are typically used to describe the [[interdisciplinary]] field that addresses the design, construction, management, and use of these man-made surroundings as an interrelated whole as well as their relationship to human activities over time (rather than a particular element in isolation or at a single moment in time). The field is generally not regarded as a traditional profession or [[academic discipline]] in its own right, instead drawing upon areas such as [[economics]], law, [[public policy]], public health, [[management]], [[geography]], design, engineering, technology, and [[environmental sustainability]]. Within the field of public health, built environments are referred to as building or renovating areas in an effort to improve the community's well-being through construction of “aesthetically, health improved, and environmentally improved landscapes and living structures”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Built Environment and Health: 11 Profiles of Neighborhood Transformation|url=http://www.preventioninstitute.org/index.php?option=com_jlibrary&amp;view=article&amp;id=114&amp;Itemid=127|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: community forest user group in Nepal is multidimensional institution, which serves goods and services to the communities through natural resource management (see [[Climate change adaptation in Nepal]]).

==Public health==
In public health, built environment refers to physical environments that are designed with health and wellness as integral parts of the communities. Research has indicated that the way neighbourhoods are created can affect both the physical activity and mental health of the communities’ residents.&lt;ref name=renalds&gt;{{cite journal|last=Renalds|first=A|author2=Smith, T|author3=Hale, P|title=A Systematic Review of Built Environment and Health|journal=Family and Community Health|year=2010|volume=33|issue=1|pages=68–78|doi=10.1097/fch.0b013e3181c4e2e5|pmid=20010006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that built environments that were expressly designed to improve physical activity are linked to higher rates of physical activity, which in turn, positively affects health.&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=C|author2=Aytur, S|author3=Gardner, K|author4=Rogers, S|title=Complexity in Built Environment, Health, and Destination Walking: A Neighborhood-Scale Analysis|journal=J Urban Health|year=2012|volume=89|issue=2|pages=270–84|doi=10.1007/s11524-011-9652-8|pmid=22350512|pmc=3324613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WTM3 Gnarly 0028.jpg|thumb|A separated bike lane in New York City.]]
Neighbourhoods with more [[walkability]] had lower rates of [[obesity]] as well as increased physical activity among its residents. They also had lower rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], higher [[social capital]], and less [[alcohol abuse]]. Walkability features in these neighbourhoods include safety, [[sidewalk]] construction, as well as destinations in which to walk.&lt;ref name=renalds /&gt; In addition, the perception of a walkable neighbourhood, one that is perceived to have good sidewalks and connectivity, is correlated with higher rates of physical activity.&lt;ref name=carlson /&gt;

Assessments of walkability have been completed through the use of [[GIS]] programs, such as the Street Smart Walk Score. This example of a walkability assessment tool determines distances to grocery stores and other amenities, as well as connectivity and intersection frequency using specific addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walk Score Methodology|url=http://www2.walkscore.com/pdf/WalkScoreMethodology.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085256/http://www2.walkscore.com/pdf/WalkScoreMethodology.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessments such as the Street Smart Walk Score can be utilized by city and country planning departments to improve existing walkability of communities. 

To implement walkable neighbourhoods, community members and local leaders should focus on policy development. An effective framework that has been utilized in an abundance of communities is the Complete Streets concept of community planning that has been developed by the National Complete Streets Coalition (NCSC). &lt;ref name="policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete Streets local policy workbook, Smart Growth America| url=https://smartgrowthamerica.org/resources/complete-streets-local-policy-workbook|archivedate=21 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCSC states that the most successful policies are those that reflect input from a broad group of stakeholders, including transportation planners and engineers, elected officials, transit agencies, public health departments, and members of the community. &lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; According to Riggs, 2016, policies may focus on a “Complete Streets” investment, which includes sidewalk bulb-outs and refuges to reduce crossing distances or street widths for pedestrians. Other investments should include installing crosswalks, road markings, benches, shelters and sidewalk art installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riggs|first1=William|title=Inclusively walkable: exploring the equity of walkable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area|journal=Local Environment|volume=21|issue=5|pages=527–554|doi= 10.1080/13549839.2014.982080|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every community will have a unique method of policy development depending on whether it is an urban, suburban, or rural community and how the policy will combine the variety of transportation modalities. Communities may choose to focus on walkability, but will also need to consider biking, wheeling/rolling, driving, and emergency vehicles. The NCSC policy workbook gives descriptive guidance on how to proceed with policy development whether they be council-driven, council-approved, directives, or citizen vote. &lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; When deciding how to proceed with walkability policy development, considerations should be made regarding current and past transportation policies, local community and government support, and how transportation policies have been implemented in the past. 

[[File:Community garden.jpg|thumb|A [[community garden]] located in Montreal, Canada.]]
Public health also addresses additional components of built environments including “[[bikeability]]” and healthy food access such as proximity to grocery stores and [[community garden]]s. Bikeability refers to the access that an area has granted to safe biking through multiple bike paths and [[bike lane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horacek|first=TM|author2=White AA|author3=Greene GW|title=Sneakers and spokes: an assessment of the walkability and bikeability of U.S. postsecondary institutions|journal=J Environ Health|year=2012|volume=74|issue=2|pages=8–15|display-authors=etal|pmid=21949979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both walkability and bikeability have been cited as determinants of physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cochrane|first=T|author2=Davey, R|title=Increasing uptake of physical activity: A social ecological approach|journal=J R Soc Promot Health|year=2008|volume=128|issue=1|pages=31–40|pmid=18274328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to healthy food is also an important component of the built environment. A higher density of convenience stores has been associated with obesity in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grafova|first=I|title=Overweight Children: Assessing The Contribution Of The Built Environment.|journal=Prev Med|year=2008|volume=47|issue=3|pages=304–308|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.04.012|pmid=18539318}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, improved access to community supermarkets and farmer's markets is correlated with lower overweight status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahman|first=T|author2=Cushing RA|author3=Jackson RJ|title=Contributions of built environment to childhood obesity|journal=Mt Sinai J Med|year=2011|volume=78|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1002/msj.20235|pmid=21259262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in low income neighbourhoods, the presence of a local grocery store is correlated with lower BMI/overweight risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zick|first=C|author2=Smith, K|author3=Fan, J|author4=Brown, B|author5=Yamada, I|author6=Kowaleski-Jones, L|title=Running to the store? The relationship between neighborhood environments and the risk of obesity|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=2009|volume=69|issue=10|pages=1493–500|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.08.032|pmid=19766372|pmc=2791711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community gardens are also considered a part of the built environment, and have been shown to increase fruit and vegetable intake among gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Litt|first=J|author2=Soobader, M|author3=Turbin, M|author4=Hale, J|author5=Buchenau, M|author6=Marshall, J|title=The influence of social involvement, neighborhood aesthetics, and community garden participation on fruit and vegetable consumption|journal=Am J Public Health|year=2011|volume=101|issue=8|pages=1466–73|doi=10.2105/ajph.2010.300111|pmid=21680931|pmc=3134498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars say that community gardens have also been shown to have positive social and psychological impacts that lead to lower levels of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], [[hypertension]], and an improved sense of wellness, affecting the overall health of the individual and the community.

The intersection of public health with other disciplines is evident in the design process of built environments which includes [[environmental planning]], [[policy development]] and [[land-use planning]].&lt;ref name=roof /&gt; Research suggests that people are more active in [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use communities]] or those that incorporate retail and residential and densely populated areas as well as those with good street connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heath|first=G|author2=Brownson, R|author3=Kruger, J|title=The effectiveness of urban design and land use and transport policies and practices to increase physical activity: a systematic review|journal=J Phys Act Health|year=2006|volume=3|issue=s1|pages=S55–S76|display-authors=etal|pmid=28834525|doi=10.1123/jpah.3.s1.s55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who preferred to walk and live in walkable environments often have lower obesity rates and drive less compared to those who preferred living in auto-dependent environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frank|first=L|author2=Saelens, B|author3=Powell, K|author4=Chapmen, J|title=Stepping towards causation: Do built environments or neighborhood and travel preferences explain physical activity, driving, and obesity?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2007|volume=65|issue=9|pages=1898–1914|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.053 |pmid=17644231}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Built environments containing recreational facilities have been associated with greater physical activity among children.&lt;ref name="Sallis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallis |first1=James F. |last2=Floyd |first2=Myron F. |last3=Rodriguez |first3=Daniel A. |last4=Saelens |first4=Brian E. |title=The Role of Built Environments in Physical Activity, Obesity, and CVD |journal=Circulation |date=February 2012 |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=729–37 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.969022 |pmid=22311885 |pmc=3315587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one study found that walking paths, parks with playgrounds, swimming areas, basketball courts and other various recreational facilities increased physical activity among adolescent girls. &lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Deborah A. |last2=Ashwood |first2=Scott |last3=Scott |first3=Molly M. |last4=Overton |first4=Adrian |last5=Evenson |first5=Kelly R. |last6=Staten |first6=Lisa K. |last7=Porter |first7=Dwayne |last8=McKenzie |first8=Thomas L. |last9=Catellier |first9=Diane |title=Public Parks and Physical Activity Among Adolescent Girls |journal=Pediatrics |date=November 2006 |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=e1381–9 |pmid=17079539 |pmc=2239262 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/5/e1381.long?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token |accessdate=October 29, 2018|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning and its utilization of mixed use development are key factors affecting childhood obesity. Mixed use spaces are composed of residential, commercial, cultural, and institutional components. &lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Planning and Community Health Research Center: Mixed Use Development |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207034351/https://www.planning.org/nationalcenters/health/mixedusedevelopment.htm |website=American Planning Association |accessdate=October 29, 2018|date=2013-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of development helps to reduce the distance residents have to travel to access a grocery store or school. It also creates a more walkable and bike friendly environment for residents. It has been proven that high-density environments, meaning mixed use spaces and neighborhoods with higher walkability and bikeability, will increase physical activity. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; A multivariable cross-sectional study done by the Harvard School of Public Health examined the association of walkable built environment characteristics with body mass index (BMI) scores among a large sample of children and adolescents. &lt;ref name="duncan2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Dustin T. |last2=Sharifi |first2=Mona |last3=Melly |first3=Steven J. |last4=Marshall |first4=Richard |last5=Sequist |first5=Thomas D. |last6=Rifas-Shiman |first6=Sheryl L. |last7=Taveras |first7=Elsie M. |title=Characteristics of walkable built environments and BMI z-scores in children: evidence from a large electronic health record database |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |date=December 2014 |volume=122 |issue=12 |pages=1359–65 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1307704|pmid=25248212 |pmc=4256697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight geographic information system variables were used to characterize a walkable built environment. (1) A distance less than 15 km to a private or public recreational open space has been linked to an increase in physical activity among children. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt;This may be due to the influence children have on one another when they see others playing.&lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (2) Also, a higher number of open spaces increases the likelihood of physical activity among children. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (3) A more densely populated residential area can increase children’s proximity to their peers creating a more walkable environment. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (4) Less traffic density can also increase physical activity among children because their parents feel safe when they are walking in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (5-7) Lower neighborhood speed limits with more sidewalks and intersections also create a safer environment for children increasing their likelihood to walk in the neighborhood. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (8) Finally, a greater variety of land use mix, or mixed use spaces, result in more children walking. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; These built environment characteristics that can increase walkability were found to be generally associated with a lower BMI scores among the children sampled. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; Another study looking at active commuting, those reporting walking, biking, or skateboarding to school more than three times a week, among elementary aged children had significantly lower BMI than non-active commuters. &lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Dori E. |last2=Sallis |first2=James F. |last3=Conway |first3=Terry L. |last4=Cain |first4=Kelli L. |last5=McKenzie |first5=Thomas L. |title=Active Transportation to School Over 2 Years in Relation to Weight Status and Physical Activity |journal=Obesity |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=1771–6 |date=September 2012 |doi=10.1038/oby.2006.204 |pmid=17062807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reason, mixed use lands within the built environment are imperative to helping address childhood obesity. Urban sprawl, which has been positively associated with increased obesity, and an overall decline in active transportation in recent decades presents a real need for improving health within the built environment. &lt;ref name="Rosenberg" /&gt; &lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lopez |first1=Russ |title=Urban Sprawl and Risk for Being Overweight or Obese |journal=Am J Public Health |date=September 2004 |volume=94 |issue=9 |pages=1574–9 |pmid=15333317 |pmc=1448496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-density environments bring schools, parks, and grocery stores closer to residents making it convenient to potentially eat healthier foods and exercise on a regular basis. Comprehensive urban planning, such as mixed use development, promotes healthier lifestyles in general. 

The strength of the evidence for reducing obesity through environment has been highlighted by the [[Center for Disease Control]] in its Common Community Measures for Obesity Prevention Project, which includes measures of healthy food access and physical activity environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahn|first=LK|author2=Sobush K|author3=Keener D|title=Recommended community strategies and measurements to prevention obesity in the United States|journal=MMWR Recomm Rep|year=2009|volume=58|issue=RR-7|pages=1–26|display-authors=etal|pmid=19629029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape architecture==
In [[landscape architecture]], the built environment is understood to mean a human-made landscape, as distinguished from the [[natural environment]]; for example, a [[city park]] is a built environment.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

'''Burate''' is a [[Papuan language]] of the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Papua (province)|Papua]], on the eastern shore of [[Cenderawasih Bay]]. The specific areas that the Burate language is spoken in include the [[Papua (province)|Papua Provence]], the [[Wapoga River|Wapoga river]] mouth, one village of the [[Waropen Regency|Waropen Bawah]] subdistrict, and the [[Yapen Islands Regency|Yapen Waropen]] regency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.verbix.com/maps/language/Burate.html|title=Where on earth do they speak Burate?|website=www.verbix.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Burate is lexically similar to the [[East Geelvink Bay languages]] and presumably belongs in that family, but is too poorly attested to be sure.

{{Corporate finance}}
A '''business plan''' is a formal written document containing business goals, the methods on how these goals can be attained, and the time frame that these goals need to be achieved. It also describes the nature of the business, includes background information on the organization, the organization's financial projections, and the strategies it intends to implement to achieve stated targets. In its entirety, this document serves as a road map that provides direction to the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/business-plan|title=Business Plan Definition - Entrepreneur Small Business Encyclopedia|website=Entrepreneur|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written business plans are often required to obtain a bank loan or other kind of financing.

==Audience==

Business plans may be internally or externally focused.  Externally-focused plans draft goals that are important to outside stakeholders, particularly financial stakeholders.  These plans typically have detailed information about the organization or the team making effort to reach its goals.  With for-profit entities, external stakeholders include investors and customers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/planning/sbabusplan.html Small Business Notes] business plan outline for small    business start-up&lt;/ref&gt;  for non-profits, external stakeholders refer to donors and clients,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152438/http://ase.tufts.edu/yet/pdf/Non-Profit%20Incorporating%20%20The%20Business%20Plan.pdf Tufts University] non-profit business plan&lt;/ref&gt;  for government agencies, external stakeholders are the tax-payers, higher-level government agencies, and international lending bodies such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], various economic agencies of the [[United Nations]], and [[Multilateral development bank|development banks]].

Internally-focused business plans target intermediate goals required to reach the external goals.   They may cover the development of a new product, a new service, a new IT system, a restructuring of finance, the refurbishing of a factory or a restructuring of the organization.  An internally-focused business plan is often developed in conjunction with a [[balanced scorecard]] or a list of critical success factors.  This allows success of the plan to be measured using non-financial measures.  

Business plans that identify and target internal goals, but provide only general guidance on how they will be met are called [[Strategic planning|strategic plans]].

Operational plans describe the goals of an internal organization, working group or department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doa.louisiana.gov/opb/faf/OPFormatWord_FY01MWLayout.pdf State of Louisiana, USA]  government agency operational plan&lt;/ref&gt; Project plans, sometimes known as project frameworks, describe the goals of a particular project.  They may also address the project's place within the organization's larger strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egovernment.tas.gov.au/themes/project_management/project_management/knowledge_base Tasmanian government project management knowledge base] government project plan {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622211235/http://www.egovernment.tas.gov.au/themes/project_management/project_management/knowledge_base |date=June 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

Business plans are [[decision-making tools]].  The content and format of the business plan is determined by the goals and audience. For example, a business plan for a non-profit might discuss the fit between the business plan and the organization's mission.  Banks are quite concerned about defaults, so a business plan for a bank loan will build a convincing case for the organization's ability to repay the loan.  [[Venture capitalists]] are primarily concerned about initial investment, feasibility, and exit valuation.  A business plan for a project requiring equity financing will need to explain why current resources, upcoming growth opportunities, and [[sustainable competitive advantage]] will lead to a high exit valuation.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Preparing a business plan draws on a wide range of knowledge from many different business disciplines: [[finance]], human resource management, [[intellectual property]] management, [[supply chain management]], operations management, and [[marketing]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/mba/academics/bplan.html Boston College, Carroll School of Management, Business Plan Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116051622/http://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/mba/academics/bplan.html |date=2008-01-16 }} The business school advises students that "To create a robust business plan, teams must take a comprehensive view of the enterprise and incorporate management-practice knowledge from every first-semester course." It is increasingly common for business schools to use business plan projects to provide an opportunity for students to integrate knowledge learned through their courses.&lt;/ref&gt;   It can be helpful to view the business plan as a collection of sub-plans, one for each of the main business disciplines.&lt;ref name="Eric S. Siegel 1993"&gt;Eric S. Siegel, Brian R. Ford, Jay M. Bornstein (1993), ''''The Ernst &amp; Young Business Plan Guide'''' (New York: John Wiley and Sons) {{ISBN|0-471-57826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"... a good business plan can help to make a good business credible, understandable, and attractive to someone who is unfamiliar with the business. Writing a good business plan can’t guarantee success, but it can go a long way toward reducing the odds of failure." &lt;ref name="Eric S. Siegel 1993" /&gt;

== Presentation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
The format of a business plan depends on its presentation context. It is common for businesses, especially start-ups, to have three or four formats for the same business plan.

An "[[elevator pitch]]" is a short summary of the plan's executive summary. This is often used as a teaser to awaken the interest of potential investors, customers, or strategic partners. It is called an elevator pitch as it is supposed to be content that can be explained to someone else quickly in an elevator. The elevator pitch should be between 30 and 60 seconds.&lt;ref name="inc magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/05/mastering-business-elevator-pitch.html|title=How to Master Your Elevator Pitch|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sales presentation|pitch deck]] is a slide show and oral presentation that is meant to trigger discussion and interest potential investors in reading the written presentation.  The content of the presentation is usually limited to the executive summary and a few key graphs showing financial trends and key decision making benchmarks. If a new product is being proposed and time permits, a demonstration of the product may be included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/07/pitchdeck/|title=How To Create An Early-Stage Pitch Deck For Investors|first=|last=Contributor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A written presentation for external stakeholders is a detailed, well written, and pleasingly formatted plan targeted at external stakeholders.

An internal operational plan is a detailed plan describing planning details that are needed by management but may not be of interest to external stakeholders.  Such plans have a somewhat higher degree of candor and informality than the version targeted at external stakeholders and others.

== Revising the business plan ==

=== Cost overruns and revenue shortfalls ===

Cost and [[revenue]] estimates are central to any business plan for deciding the viability of the planned venture. But costs are often underestimated and revenues overestimated resulting in later cost overruns, revenue shortfalls, and possibly non-viability. During the [[dot-com bubble]] 1997-2001 this was a problem for many technology start-ups. [[Reference class forecasting]] has been developed to reduce the risks of cost overruns and revenue shortfalls and thus generate more accurate business plans.

==Legal and liability issues==

=== Disclosure requirements ===
An externally targeted business plan should list all legal concerns and financial liabilities that might negatively affect investors.  Depending on the amount of funds being raised and the audience to whom the plan is presented, failure to do this may have severe legal consequences.

=== Limitations on content and audience ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[Non disclosure agreement]]s (NDAs) with third parties, [[non-compete agreement]]s, conflicts of interest, privacy concerns, and the protection of one's [[trade secrets]] may severely limit the audience to which one might show the business plan.  Alternatively, they may require each party receiving the business plan to sign a contract accepting special clauses and conditions.

This situation is complicated by the fact that many venture capitalists will refuse to sign an NDA before looking at a business plan, lest it put them in the untenable position of looking at two independently developed look-alike business plans, both claiming originality.  In such situations one may need to develop two versions of the business plan: a stripped down plan that can be used to develop a relationship and a detail plan that is only shown when investors have sufficient interest and trust to sign an NDA.

==Open business plans==
Traditionally business plans have been highly confidential and quite limited in audience.
The business plan itself is generally regarded as secret.

An open business plan is a business plan with unlimited audience. The business plan is typically
web published and made available to all.

In the free software and open source business model, trade secrets, [[copyright]] and patents can no longer
be used as effective locking mechanisms to provide sustainable advantages to a particular business and therefore a secret business plan is less relevant in those models.

== Uses ==
*[[Education]]
**Business plans are used in some primary and secondary programs to teach economic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Economic Spa|url=http://www.economicspa.org/products.asp?cat=15&amp;hierarchy=02|title= Pennsylvania Business Plan Competition}} competition intended to teach economic principles to K-12 students&lt;/ref&gt;  
:*[[Wikiversity]] has a [[v:Lunar Boom Town|Lunar Boom Town]] project where students of all ages can collaborate with designing and revising business models and practice evaluating them to learn practical business planning techniques and methodology

*Fundraising
Fundraising is the primary purpose for many business plans, since they are related to the inherent probable success/failure of the company risk.
:*[[Angel investor]]s
:*[[Business loan]]s
:*[[Grant (money)|Grants]]
:*[[Startup company]] funding
:*[[Venture capital]]

*Internal use
:*[[Management by objectives]] (MBO) is a process of agreeing upon objectives (as can be detailed within business plans) within an organization so that management and employees agree to the objectives and understand what they are in the organization.
:*[[Strategic planning]] is an organization's process of defining its strategy, or direction, and making decisions on allocating its resources to pursue this strategy, including its capital and people. Business plans can help decision makers see how specific projects relate to the organization's strategic plan.
:*[[Total quality management]] (TQM) is a business management strategy aimed at embedding awareness of quality in all organizational processes. TQM has been widely used in manufacturing, education, call centers, government, and service industries, as well as NASA space and science programs.

==Not for profit businesses==
The business goals may be defined both for [[non-profit]]  or for-profit organizations.  For-profit business plans typically focus on financial goals, such as profit or creation of wealth.  Non-profit, as well as government agency business plans tend to focus on the "organizational mission" which is the basis for their governmental status or their non-profit, tax-exempt status, respectively—although non-profits may also focus on optimizing revenue.

The primary difference between profit and non-profit organizations is that "for-profit" organizations look to maximize wealth versus non-profit organizations, which look to provide a greater good to society. In non-profit organizations, creative tensions may develop in the effort to balance mission with "margin" (or revenue).

==Satires==
The business plan is the subject of many satires.  Satires are used both to express cynicism about business plans and as an educational tool to improve the quality of business plans.  For example,
* In his presentation, ''Five Criteria For a Successful Business Plan in Biotech'', Dr. Roger Bernier, uses ''[[Dilbert]]'' comic strips to remind people what ''not'' to do when researching and writing a business plan for a biotech start-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mta.ca/rendezvousbiosciences/day3panel-ppt/Roger%20Bernier.ppt |title=Five Criteria For a Successful Business Plan in Biotech |author=Bernier, Roger Laurent |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106201111/http://www.mta.ca/rendezvousbiosciences/day3panel-ppt/Roger%20Bernier.ppt |archivedate=January 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* Selena Maranjian's "Fool on the Hill" article in ''[[The Motley Fool]]'', "'South Park's' Investing Lesson" (November 8, 2001), references the "Underpants Gnomes" to illustrate the fallacy of focusing on goals without a clear implementation strategy. That "[[Gnomes (South Park)|Gnomes]]" episode satirizes the business plans of the [[Dot.com bubble|Dot-com era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='South Park's' Investing Lesson|author=Maranjian, Selena|date=November 8, 2001|work=The Motley Fool|url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm|access-date=2007-10-16|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ArVrcEB?url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm#|archive-date=2012-03-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chapter 26 of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1999 novel [[Cryptonomicon]] begins with the business plan of a fictional high tech company, satirizing both the writing style and the physical form of slickly produced business publications like business plans and [[annual report]]s.

The '''Bwa languages''' (Bwamu, Bomu) are a branch of the [[Gur languages]] spoken by over half a million [[Bwa people]] of [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]].

The Bwa people, and their languages, are one of several called [[Bobo people|Bobo]] in [[Bambara language|Bambara]]. The Bwa are distinguished as the ''Bobo Wule/Oule'' "Red Bobo". The Bwa languages are not [[mutually intelligible]]; ''Ethnologue'' calculates that the intelligibility of the Ouarkoye and Cwi is 30%, though other varieties are closer.

'''Cameo lighting''' in film is a [[Stage lighting instrument|spotlight]] that accentuates a single person and maybe a few props in a [[Scene (film)|scene]]. It creates an 'angelic' shot, such as one where God is shining down and a light shines down onto this person.

Cameo lighting derives its name from the art form in which a light relief figure is set against a darker background.  It is often achieved by using [[Barn doors#Barn doors|barn-doored spotlights]]. It helps focus on the subject and not its environment. A problem with cameo lighting is that it can lead to color distortion and noise in the darkest areas.&lt;ref&gt;Television Production Handbook, Zettl, pg. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chayahuita''' is an endangered [[Amazonian languages|Amazonian language]] spoken by thousands of native Chayahuita people in the Amazon basin of north-central. Spoken along the banks of the Paranapura, Cahuapanas, Sillay, and Shanusi rivers, it is also known as Chayawita, Shawi, Chawi, Tshaahui, Chayhuita, Chayabita, Shayabit, Balsapuertino, Paranapura, and Cahuapa. There is a 1-5% literacy rate, compared with 5-15% for Spanish, and a dictionary since 1978. It can not be understood by [[Jebero language|Jebero]] speakers although there is some overlap in vocabulary, especially some [[Southern Quechua|Quechua]] terms.

'''David''' (or '''Dovid''') '''Bergelson''' (דוד בערגעלסאָן) (12 August 1884 – 12 August 1952) was a [[Yiddish language]] writer. [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born, he lived for a time in [[Berlin, Germany]]. He moved back to the [[Soviet Union]] when [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany. He was ultimately executed during an [[anti-semitism|antisemitic]] campaign against "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]s".

==Biography==
Born in the Ukrainian [[shtetl]] of Okhrimovo (also known as Okhrimovka), he first became known as a writer in the wake of the failed [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. From a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] background, but having received both religious and secular education, much of his writing is reminiscent of [[Anton Chekhov]]: stories of "largely secular, frustrated young people…, ineffectual intellectuals…",{{sfn|Hoberman|2005|page=34}} frustrated by the provincial shtetl life. Writing at first in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], he only met success when he turned to his native Yiddish; his first successful book was ''Arum Vokzal'' (''At the Depot'') a [[novella]], published at his own expense in 1909 in [[Warsaw]].

In 1917, he founded the [[avant garde]] Jidishe [[Kultur Lige]] (Yiddish Culture League) in [[Kiev]]. In spring 1921 he moved to Berlin, which would be his base throughout the years of the [[Weimar Republic]], although he traveled extensively through [[Europe]] and also visited the [[United States]] in 1929-30, to cities such as Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York (as documented by video link.&lt;ref name=YIVO&gt;{{cite web|title=YIVO/Dovid Bergelson|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/search.aspx?query=A+man+diving+into+the+new+swimming+pool|website=YIVO|publisher=YIVO Institute for Jewish Research|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  According to [[J. Hoberman]], he was "the best-known (and certainly the best-paid) Russian Yiddish writer of the 1920s".{{sfn|Hoberman|2005|page=36}} Until the mid-1920s he wrote for the [[New York City]]-based Yiddish-language newspaper ''[[The Forward]]''.

His 1926 essay "Three Centers" expressed a belief that the Soviet Union (where Yiddish language and literature were then receiving official patronage) had eclipsed the [[cultural assimilation|assimilationist]] United States and backwards [[Poland]] as the great future locus of Yiddish literature. He began writing for the [[Communism|Communist]] Yiddish press in both New York ([[Morgen Freiheit]]) and [[Moscow]] (''Emes''), and moved to the Soviet Union in 1933, around the time the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power in Germany.

He was positively impressed with the [[Jewish Autonomous Republic]] of [[Birobidzhan]], and participated in the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] during [[World War II]]. However, like many Jewish writers, he became a target of the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] campaign against "rootless [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitans]]". Arrested in January 1949, he was tried secretly and executed by a [[firing squad]] in the event known as the [[Night of the Murdered Poets]] on 12–13 August 1952. After Stalin's death, he was [[Wiktionary:posthumous|posthumously]] [[rehabilitate (Soviet)|rehabilitate]]d in 1955, and his complete works were published in the Soviet Union in 1961.
 
Bergelson's only child, Lev, was an eminent Soviet [[biochemist]] who also served as a Soviet Army captain during World War II. Prof. Lev Bergelson emigrated to [[Israel]] in 1991 with his wife Naomi, where both he and his wife died in 2014.

[[File:Non-delivery return cover Russia 2008.jpg|thumb|2008 Russian letter with affixed return label and reason for return checked]]
'''Dead letter mail''' or '''undeliverable mail''' is [[mail]] that cannot be delivered to the addressee or returned to the sender. This is usually due to lack of compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and [[return address]], or the inability to [[mail forwarding|forward the mail]] when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing undeliverable mail.

The term 'dead mail' is perhaps a misnomer, and several jurisdictions have opted for the use of the term 'undeliverable mail' as more clearly representing the status of the item whose transmission has been impeded. Being internal departments within postal administrations, little information about the [[dead letter office]] function has ever been made public. A few journal articles and at least one recently published book (Canadian) dealing with this topic have appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plain |first=Brian C. |title=The dead letter office in Canada, 1830-2002: an illustrated postal history |edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=British North America Philatelic Society |location=Surrey, BC   |isbn=0-919854-88-5 |oclc= 84985892|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allison  | first = Sue  | title = No Return Address | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/no-return-address-29982057/ | journal = Smithsonian  | volume = 31  | issue = 4  | date = July 2000  | accessdate = 2017-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classification as a dead letter is one of the few instances where postal personnel are allowed to violate [[secrecy of correspondence]], ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter's origin or destination. Countries must also set up regulations for the disposal of dead letters, particularly when they contain items of value.  Some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by [[Marc Chagall]] which turned up in a [[United States Postal Service]] sorting center in [[Topeka, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Real Chagall |work=USPS Memo to Mailers |publisher=[[USPS]] |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |accessdate=2009-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606083631/http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |archivedate=2002-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increased collection and study of the [[postal marking]]s originating from such offices, the body of literature on this obscure topic may grow.  Many countries, including [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office.  Genuinely used examples are highly prized by collectors, although mint labels, because they have no postage value, are often fairly common.

People interested in [[Mail|postal service]]s throughout the world sometimes deliberately send mail to fictional addresses throughout the world to see if a particular nation's postal authority would return the mail to the sender. Collectors of postal markings also use this method in order to receive uncommon postal markings seldom seen in everyday mail.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Aside from its literary use, the ellipsis has a counterpart in film production. It is there to suggest an action by simply showing what happens before and after what is observed. The vast majority of films use ellipses to clear actions that add nothing to the narrative. Beyond these "convenience" ellipses, ellipses are also used to advance the story.

==Description==
An ellipsis in [[narrative]] leaves out a portion of the story. This can be used to condense time, or as a stylistic method to allow the reader to fill in the missing portions of the narrative with their imagination.&lt;ref name="Australian National University"&gt;{{cite web|last=Australian National University|title=A Basic Glossary of Film Terms|url=http://www.springhurst.org/cinemagic/glossary_terms.htm#ellipsis|publisher=Springhurst.org|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellipsis was also used in literature, as in the modernist works of [[Ernest Hemingway]] who pioneered the [[Iceberg Theory]], also known as the theory of omission.

[[Virginia Woolf]]'s [[novel]] ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' contains famous examples of literary ellipses. Between the first and second parts of the novel, many years pass and [[World War I]] is fought and won. The reader is left to infer the events that have taken place during the elapsed time by the changes evident in the characters in the novel. Another example is found in [[Edith Wharton]]'s ''[[The Age of Innocence]].''&lt;ref name=Tomsyek&gt;{{cite web|last=Tomsyek|first=Sarah|title=Narrative Gaps in Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence|url=http://departments.knox.edu/engdept/commonroom/Volume_Three/number_one/stomsyck/page2.html|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellipsis is a common procedure in [[film]] narrative, where movement and action unnecessary to the telling of a story will often be removed by editing. For example, there would be no need to show a character standing up from a chair and walking the length of a room to open a door. Instead, the character may be shown standing up from the chair and then in the next cut—normally viewed from a different angle, or with a cutaway shot in between, necessary to smooth over the gap—he would have already crossed the room and be over by the door. Narrative logic allows the viewer to disregard the ellipsis in this case. At the start of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), for example, a giant chronological leap is taken as the narrative jumps from the first tool of humankind (a bone) to what was then the most current (a space station). In this instance, however, the ellipsis – a [[match cut]] in film language – is filled by the metaphorical parallelism between the two objects, visually similar in shape and joined by a deep anthropological significance.

The [[Japan]]ese director [[Yasujirō Ozu]] is also famous for his use of ellipsis. Important people or events would be omitted in his narration, leaving what has happened evident to audiences only through subsequent dialogue. For example, in  ''[[Late Spring]]'' (1949), Noriko is shown about to leave for her wedding in her kimono, while the next scene shows Mr. Somiya in a bar after the wedding.

'''Eteocypriot''' was a [[pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European]] language spoken in [[Iron Age]] [[Cyprus]]. The name means "true" or "original Cyprian" parallel to [[Eteocretan language|Eteocretan]], both of which names are used by modern [[scholarship]] to mean the pre-Greek languages of those places.&lt;ref&gt;The derivation is given in Partridge, Eric (1983) ''Origins: A short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English'', New York: Greenwich House, {{ISBN|0-517-41425-2}}. The term Eteocypriot was devised by Friedrich in 1932, according to Olivier Masson in ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070606231601/http://www.maticasrpska.org.yu/download/kls45.pdf ETEO-CYPRIOT]'', an article in Zbornik, Issues 4–5, 2002–2003. [[Eteocretan]] is based on a genuine [[Ancient Greek]] word.&lt;/ref&gt; Eteocypriot was written in the [[Cypriot syllabary]], a syllabic script derived from [[Linear A]] (via the Cypro-Minoan variant [[Cypro-Minoan syllabary|Linear C]]). The language was under pressure from [[Arcadocypriot]] Greek from about the 10th century BC and finally became extinct in  about the 4th century BC.

The language is as yet unknown except for a small vocabulary attested in bilingual inscriptions. Such topics as [[syntax]] and possible [[inflection]] or [[agglutination]] remain a mystery. Partial translations depend to a large extent on the language or language group assumed by the translator, but there is no consistency. It is conjectured by some linguists to be related to the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] and [[Lemnian language|Lemnian]] languages, and by others to be [[Northwest Semitic]]. Those who do not advocate any of those theories often adopt the default of an unknown pre-Greek language. Due to the small number of texts found, there is currently much unproven speculation.

== Corpus ==
Several hundred inscriptions written in the Cypriot syllabary (VI-III BC) cannot be interpreted in Greek. While it does not necessarily imply that all of them are non-Greek, there are at least two locations where multiple inscriptions with clearly non-Greek content were found:
* Amathus (including a bilingual Eteocypriot-Greek text)
* a few short inscriptions from Golgoi (currently [[Athienou]]: [[Markus Egetmeyer]] suggested that their language may be different from those of Amathus&lt;ref&gt;[[Markus Egetmeyer|M. Egetmeyer]], ‘„Sprechen Sie Golgisch?“ Anmerkungen zu einer übersehenen Sprache’ [https://archive.is/20151119230058/http://www.aegeussociety.org/en/index.php/new-books/etudes-myceniennes-2012/ Études mycéniennes 2010: 427-434]&lt;/ref&gt;).

While the language of [[Cypro-Minoan]] inscriptions is often supposed to be the same as (or ancestral to) Eteocypriot, that has yet to be proved, as the script is only partly legible.

==Amathus bilingual==
The most famous Eteocypriot inscription is a bilingual text inscribed on a black marble slab found on the [[acropolis]] of [[Amathus]] about 1913, dated to around 600 BC and written in both the [[Attic dialect]] of [[Ancient Greek]] and Eteocypriot. The Eteocypriot text in Cypriot characters runs right to left; the Greek text in all capital Greek letters, left to right. The following are the syllabic values of the symbols of the Eteocypriot text (left to right) and the Greek text as is:

:Eteocypriot:
:: 1: '''a-na ma-to-ri u-mi-e-s[a]-i mu-ku-la-i la-sa-na a-ri-si-to-no-se a-ra-to-wa-na-ka-so-ko-o-se'''
:: 2: '''ke-ra-ke-re-tu-lo-se ta-ka-na-[?-?]-so-ti a-lo ka-i-li-po-ti'''&lt;ref&gt;The inscription is given as portrayed in Gordon, ''Evidence'', Page 5. Breaks in the stone obscure the syllables in brackets.&lt;/ref&gt;

:A suggested pronunciation is:
:: 1: '''Ana mator-i um-iesa-i Mukula-i Lasana Ariston-ose Artowanaksoko-ose'''
:: 2: '''kera keretul-ose. Ta kana (kuno) sot-i, ail-o kail-i pot-i.'''
::{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

:Greek:
:: 3: '''Η ПΟΛΙΣ Η АΜАΘΟΥΣΙΩΝ ΑΡΙΣΤΩΝΑ'''
:: 4: '''ΑΡΙΣΤΩΝΑΚΤΟΣ ΕΥΠΑΤΡΙΔΗΝ'''

:which might be rendered into modern script as:
:: 3: '''{{lang|grc|Ἡ πόλις ἡ Ἀμαθουσίων Ἀριστῶνα}}'''
:: 4: '''{{lang|grc|'Ἀριστώνακτος, εὐπατρίδην}}.'''

[[Cyrus H. Gordon]] translates this text as
::''The city of the Amathusans (honored) the noble Ariston (son) of Aristonax.''&lt;ref name=Gordon120&gt;''Forgotten Scripts'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon's translation is based on Greek inscriptions in general and the fact that "the noble Ariston" is in the [[accusative case]], implying a [[transitive verb]]. Gordon explains that "the verb is omitted ... in such dedicatory inscriptions".

The inscription is important as verifying that the symbols of the unknown language, in fact, have about the same phonetic values as they do when they are used to represent Greek. Gordon says, "This bilingual proves that the signs in Eteocypriot texts have the same values as in the Cypriot Greek texts...."&lt;ref name="Gordon120" /&gt; However, as a bilingual it uses only a few Greek syllables to translate many Eteocypriot ones, which adds to its mystery.

The '''Finisterre–Huon languages''' comprise the largest [[language family|family]] within the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] (TNG) in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]]. They were part of the original TNG proposal, and [[William A. Foley]] considers their TNG identity to be established. The languages share verbs which are [[suppletion|suppletive]] depending on the person and number of the object, strong morphological evidence that they are related.

Huon and Finisterre, and then the connection between them, were identified by [[Kenneth McElhanon]] (1967, 1970). When McElhanon compared notes with his colleague Clemens Voorhoeve, who was working on the languages of southern Irian Jaya, they developed the concept of Trans–New Guinea. Apart from the evidence which unites them, the Finisterre and Huon families are clearly valid language families in their own right, each consisting of several fairly-well defined branches. (See [[Finisterre languages]] and [[Huon languages]].)

Ross reconstructs the pronouns as follows:

:{|
! !!sg!!du!!pl
|-
!1
|*na||*na-t, *ni-t||*na-n, *n-in
|-
!2
|*ga||*ja-ł, *ji-ł, *gi-ł||*ja-n, *ji-n, *gi-n
|-
!3
|*[y]a, *wa, *i||*ya-ł, *i-ł||*ya-n, *i-n
|}

These are not all coherent:  3sg *ya and *i are found in Huon, for example, while 3sg *wa is found in Finisterre.  In other cases, however, the multiple forms are found in both branches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11005">[[File:Brigniais.jpg|thumb|upright|The French army harassed by members of a free company.]]
A '''free company''' (sometimes called a '''great company''' or ''grande companie'') was an army of [[mercenaries]] between the [[12th century|12th]] and [[14th century|14th centuries]] recruited by private employers during wars. They acted independently of any government, and were thus "free".  They regularly made a living by [[plunder]] when they were not employed; in France they were the ''[[routiers]]'' and ''[[écorcheurs]]'' who operated outside the highly structured law of arms.&lt;ref&gt;M.H. Keen, ''The Laws of War in the Late Middle Ages'' (University of Toronto Press) 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "free company" is most applied to those companies of soldiers which formed after the [[Peace of Brétigny]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and were active mainly in France, but it has been applied to other companies, such as the [[Catalan Company]] and companies that operated elsewhere, such as in Italy&lt;ref&gt;The free companies headed by ''[[condottiero|condottieri]]'' are discussed as a social rather than biographical phenomenon in Michael Mallett, ''Mercenaries and Their Masters: Warfare in Renaissance Italy'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The free companies, or companies of adventure, have been cited as a factor as strong as [[Black Death|plague]] or famine in the reduction of [[Siena]] from a glorious rival of Florence to a second-rate power during the later fourteenth century; Siena spent 291,379 florins between 1342 and 1399 buying off the free companies.&lt;ref&gt;William Caferro, ''Mercenary Companies and the Decline of Siena'' (Johns Hopkins University Press) 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White Company]] of [[John Hawkwood]], probably the most famous free company, was active in Italy in the latter half of the fourteenth century.

==Early history==
Mercenary groups first appeared in the 12th century, when they participated in [[the Anarchy]] (a conflict of succession between [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda]] between 1137 and 1153).

In the 1180s, similar groups were integrated into the armies of the King of France under [[Philip II of France]]. These troops of seasoned mercenaries were organized and mobile, a valuable advantage during the battles of the time and were important elements of the armies of [[Henry II of England]] and his son, [[Richard I]]. [[John, King of England|King John]], used them at the beginning of his reign, when he was richer and more powerful than the King of France. However, in 1204, he did not pay the mercenaries. [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] used them to overcome the [[Plantagenets]].

[[File:Sack of the town.jpg|thumb|right|The Tard-Venus pillage Grammont in 1362, from [[Froissart's Chronicles]].]]

During the [[Hundred Years War]] between England and France there were intermittent hostilities punctuated by periods of truce, when soldiers would be laid off en masse. In the absence of civilian skills and opportunities many, especially the foreign soldiers, formed armed bands known as ''bandes de [[routiers]]'' or ''[[écorcheurs]]'' and made a living by pillaging the countryside of southern France until hostilities resumed. Similar events occurred in Spain and Germany. By the time of the [[Treaty of Brétigny]] (1360), which brought about a several years suspension of the Hundred Years War, the bands had grown in size to the point where they had evolved an internal structure and adopted romantic names. The Tards-venus (''late-comers''), led by [[Seguin de Badefol]] ravaged [[Burgundy]] and [[Languedoc]] and even defeated the forces of the Kingdom of France at the [[Battle of Brignais]] in 1362.

The [[Catalan Company]], formed in Spain in the early 1300s, fought in the Byzantine Empire before ending up in what is now Greece and the [[Navarrese Company]], also formed in Spain, followed them there.

By 1356, free companies, men at arms, and [[brigand]]s had spread throughout the country from the [[Seine]] to the [[Loire]] engaging in unlawful activities. They had especially infested the roads from [[Paris]] to [[Orleans]], [[Chartres]], [[Vendôme]], and [[Montargis]].

==Brigands==
[[Brigandage|Brigands]] were recruited from all nations, but mainly from troops dismissed from the army of [[Edward III of England]] after the peace treaty of Brétigny. On October 24, 1360, after the Treaty of Calais ratified the ceasefire of 8 May, Edward III had ordered the evacuation of English troops from fortresses in many parts of France.

One of the main brigand leaders was a [[Welsh people|Welshman]] named Ruffin, who was enriched by robberies and became a [[knight]]. These bands of brigands occupied and ransomed towns such as [[Saint-Arnoult-des-Bois|Saint-Arnoult]], [[Gallardon]], [[Bonneval, Eure-et-Loir|Bonneval]], [[Cloyes-sur-le-Loir|Cloyes]], [[Étampes]], [[Arpajon|Châtres]], [[Montlhéry]], Pithiviers-en-Gatinais, [[Larchant]], [[Milly-la-Forêt]], [[Château-Landon]] and [[Montargis]]. Meanwhile, [[Robert Knolles]] headed an Anglo-[[Navarre|Navarrese]] band of [[brigand]]s near the borders of [[Normandy]], where he earned 100,000 [[écus]].
 
Eventually the King of France sent his constable to escort these bands to [[Spain]] in order to rid France of them. There they could assist [[Henry II of Castile| Henry of Trastamara]] in his ongoing feud with his half-brother [[Peter of Castile]]. However, after placing [[Henry II of Castile|Henry]] of [[House of Trastámara|Trastamara]] on the throne of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], the companies returned to [[France]]. One company plundered [[Vire]] in 1368&lt;ref&gt;Yves Buffetaut, « La prise de Vire par les grandes compagnies », Itinéraires de Normandie, no 15, septembre 2009, p. 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt; and another, conducted by John Cresswell and Folquin Lallemant, seized [[Château-Gontier]].

The [[Tard-Venus]] were mercenaries who had been demobilized after the [[Treaty of Brétigny]] of 8 May 1360. Under the orders of [[Seguin de Badefol]], they raged from [[Burgundy]] to [[Languedoc]]. In 1362, in [[Brignais]], they defeated [[James I, Count of La Marche|Jacques de Bourbon]], [[Count of La Marche]].

The [[White Company]] (Compagnia Bianca) was also formed after the Treaty of Brétigny and was under the command of [[John Hawkwood]].

The [[Bretons]] and the [[English people|English]] in [[Dauphiné]] were companies which operated from 1374 to 1411, and accompanied the Counts of [[Count of Armagnac|Armagnac]], [[Turenne]] and [[Duguesclin]] during their conflicts in [[Provence]] and [[Italy]], which brought about the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] between the [[popes of Avignon]] and [[Rome]]. One of their achievements was taking the Château de Soyons in 1381, from which they were later dislodged by Bouville, governor of Dauphine and Marshal Clisson. Their leaders were Guilhem Camisard, [[Amaury de Sévérac]] (the Bastard of Bertusan) and John Broquiers.

The [[Écorcheurs]] were demobilized mercenaries who desolated France in the [[15th century]] after the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] in 1435.

==Italy==
The structure of 14th-century Italy, where a patchwork of rich city states were in a state of perpetual dispute with their neighbours, provided an ideal base for the later and larger mercenary groups with their complements of cavalry, infantry and archers and complex internal structure. Predominantly made up of English, Spanish and German troops, they included the  [[Great Company (German)|Great Company]] formed by the German knight [[Werner von Urslingen]] (1342), the [[Compagnia di San Giorgio]] formed by the Italian nobleman [[Lodrisio Visconti]] in 1339, the [[White Company]] formed by Albert Sterz  (1360) and the [[Compagnia della Stella]] of Anichino di Bongardo (Hannekin Baumgarten) (1364).

The companies made a good living by extortion (Siena paid the companies 37 times not to attack them) or by contracting to fight on behalf of one city state against another. They came to be known, in particular their leaders, as ''[[Condottieri]]'', from the Italian word for contractor. On several occasions the companies were contracted by different states to fight each other.

By the mid-1400s the power of the Free Companies had come to an end  with the rise in centralised state power and military force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deremilitari.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/caferro.pdf|title=Italy and the Companies of Adventure - William Caffero|accessdate= 28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Comics navbar|title=Glossary of comics terminology}}

{{not a typo|[[Comics]] has}} developed specialized terminology.  Several attempts have been made to formalise and define the terminology of comics by authors such as [[Will Eisner]], [[Scott McCloud]], [[R. C. Harvey]] and [[Dylan Horrocks]].  Much of the terminology in English is under dispute, so this page will list and describe the most common terms used in comics.

==Comics==

"'''Comics'''" is used as a [[non-count noun]], and thus is used with the singular form of a verb,{{sfn|Chute|Devoken|2012|p=175}} in the way the words "politics" or "economics" are, to refer to the medium, so that one refers to the "comics industry" rather than the "comic industry".  "Comic" as an adjective also has the meaning of "funny", or as pertaining to comedians, which can cause confusion and is usually avoided in most cases ("comic strip" being a well-entrenched exception).{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=162}}

"'''Comic'''" as a singular noun is sometimes used to refer to individual comics periodicals, what are known in North America as "[[comic book]]s".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

"'''[[Underground comix]]'''" is a term first popularized by cartoonists in the [[underground comix]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s in an attempt to move the word away from its etymological origins.  [[Art Spiegelman]] in particular has been a proponent of its usage, hoping to highlight the fact that the medium is capable of mature, non-comedic content, as well as to emphasize the hybrid nature of the medium ("co-mix").{{sfn|Markstein|2010}}

"'''[[Alternative comics]]'''" is a term covering a range of American comics that have appeared since the 1980s, following the comix movement of the late 1960s/early 1970s.

Other terms used as synonyms for "comics" are "'''[[sequential art]]'''", a term coined and popularized by [[Will Eisner]],{{sfn|Markstein|2010}} and '''[[graphic novel]]''', which is normally used to denote book-form comics—although this usage is not consistent.{{sfnm|1a1=Goldsmith|1y=2005|1p=16|2a1=Karp|2y=2012|2pp=4–6}}

==Layout==

[[File:Comics page layout example.png|thumb|alt=|A typical comics page layout.{{legend|#ffddff|'''A''' is a '''panel'''}}{{legend|#ddddff|'''B''' is a '''borderless''' panel}}{{legend|#bbbbdd|are the '''gutters'''}}{{legend|#aaffaa|is a '''tier'''}}]]

===Panel===

A '''panel''' (alternatively known as '''frame''' or '''box'''){{sfn|Eisner|1985|p=45}} is one drawing on a page,{{sfn|Lee|1978|p=15}} and contains a segment of action.  A page may have one or many panels, and panels are frequently, but not always,{{sfn|Eisner|1985|p=45}} surrounded by a '''border''' or '''outline''',{{sfn|Eisner|1985|p=28}} whose shape can be altered to indicate emotion, tension or flashback sequences.{{sfn|Eisner|1985|pp=44, 46–47}}  The size, shape and style of a panel, as well as the placement of figures and speech balloons inside it, affect the timing or pacing of a story.{{sfn|Eisner|1985|p=30}}  Panels are used to break up and encapsulate sequences of events in a narrative.{{sfn|Eisner|1985|p=38}}  What occurs in a panel may be ''asynchronous'', meaning that not everything that occurs in a single panel necessarily occurs at one time.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=315}}

===Gutter===

The '''gutter''' is the space between panels.{{sfnm|1a1=Lee|1y=1978|1p=15|2a1=Eisner|2y=1985|2p=157|3a1=McCloud|3y=1993|3p=66}}
Vertical gutters can be made thinner than horizontal gutters in order to encourage the reader to group each row of panels for easier reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panel Layout: The Golden Ratio|url=http://www.makingcomics.com/2014/05/07/panel-layout-golden-ratio/|website=MakingComics|accessdate=15 March 2016|quote=Greater horizontal proximity encourages the reader to group each row of panels for easier reading.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tier===

A '''tier''' is a singular row of panels.{{sfn|Chapman|2012|p=50}}

===Splash===

A '''splash''' or '''splash page''' is a large, often full-page illustration which opens and introduces a story.{{sfn|Lee|1978|p=15}}  It is rarely less than half a page, and occasionally covers two pages.{{sfn|Markstein|2010}}  Often designed as a decorative unit, its purpose is to capture the reader's attention, and can be used to establish time, place and mood.{{sfn|Eisner|1985|p=62}}

===Spread===

A '''[[Spread (typography)|spread]]''' is an image that spans more than one page.  The '''two-page spread''' or '''double-page spread'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/10/02/the-death-of-the-double-page-spread/&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common, but there are spreads that span more pages, often by making use of a foldout (or [[gatefold]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Elements==

[[File:PunchandJudyComicsV01-0145-panel3.jpg|thumb|A '''caption''' (the yellow box) gives the narrator a voice.  The characters dialogue is given through '''speech balloons'''.  The character speaking is indicated by the '''tail''' of the balloon.]]

===Speech bubble===

A '''[[speech balloon|speech/word/dialogue balloon]]''' or '''speech/word/dialogue bubble''' is a speech indicator, containing the characters' dialogue.  The indicator from the balloon that points at the speaker is called a '''pointer'''{{sfn|Lee|1978|p=15}} or '''tail'''.{{sfn|Markstein|2010}}{{sfn|Eisner|1985|p=62}}&lt;ref name="DIY112" /&gt;

The speech balloon bridges the gap between word and image—"the word made image", as expressed by Pierre Fresnault-Druelle.&lt;ref name="AoC28" /&gt;  In early renderings, speech balloons were no more than ribbons emanating from their speakers' mouths, but as it evolved and became more sophisticated, it became a more expressive device.  Its shape came to convey meaning as well.{{sfn|Eisner|1985|p=27}}  A '''thought balloon''' contains copy expressing a character's unvoiced thoughts, usually shaped like a cloud, with bubbles as a pointer.{{sfn|Lee|1978|p=15}}  Emotions can be expressed by the shape of the balloon—spiked balloons can indicate shouting, and "dripping" balloons can indicate sarcasm.{{sfn|Eisner|1996|p=174}}

===Caption===

In a '''caption''', words appear in a box separated from the rest of the panel or page, usually to give voice to a narrator, but sometimes used for the characters' thoughts or dialogue.{{sfnm|1a1=Lee|1y=1978|1p=15|2a1=Lyga|2a2=Lyga|2y=2004|2p=161}} In some comics, where speech balloons are not used, the caption provide the reader with text about what is happening in the images. This genre is called ''[[text comics]]''.

===Sound effects===

'''Sound effects''' or '''[[onomatopoeia]]''' are words that mimic sounds.&lt;ref name="PoC318" /&gt;  They are non-vocal sound images, from the subtle to the forceful.&lt;ref name="PoC156" /&gt;

==Concepts==

===Closure===

The reader performs '''closure''' by using background knowledge and an understanding of panel relations to combine panels mentally into events.&lt;ref name="PoC316" /&gt;

===Encapsulation===

'''Encapsulation''' is the capturing of prime moments in a story.  Not every moment of a story is presented in comics.  For the artist, encapsulation involves choosing what will be presented in which panels, how many panels will be used to present the action, and the size and layout of the panels.  The layouts of the panels can influence the way the panels interact with each other to the reader.  This interaction can lend more meaning to the panels than what they have individually.  Encapsulation is distinctive to comics, and an essential consideration in the creation of a work of comics.&lt;ref name="PoC10" /&gt;

==Division of labour&lt;!--'Comic book creator', 'Comics creator', 'Comic creator', 'Comic book writer/artist', 'Comic book writer and artist', 'Graphic narrator' redirect here--&gt;==

Sometimes all aspects of a comics production down to the editing, publishing and distribution are done by a single person; in such cases the term "'''comic book creator'''" (also "'''comics creator'''") is employed (occasionally the term "[[graphic novelist]]" is also employed,&lt;ref&gt;M. Keith Booker (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 172: "[[William Erwin Eisner]] was a comic book creator, graphic novelist, teacher, entrepreneur, and advocate of comics."&lt;/ref&gt; but ambiguity may arise because the same term is also used to refer to the person who only writes the script&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', Volume 195, Gale, 2005, p. 167: "(Full name [[Neil Richard Gaiman]]) English graphic novelist".&lt;/ref&gt;). The sophisticated term "'''graphic narrator'''" is also found in the academic literature on [[art education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elliot W. Eisner]] and Michael D. Day (eds.), ''Handbook of Research and Policy in Art Education'', Routledge, 2004, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other extreme, the labour behind the comics creation is sometimes divided up into different specialties.

===Cartoonist===

{{Main|Cartoonist}}

A '''cartoonist''' (also '''comic strip creator''') may refer to a person who does most or all of the art duties, and frequently, but not always, implies that the artist is also the writer.&lt;ref name="PoC315" /&gt;{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=161}}

===Writer===

{{Main|Script (comics)}}

Also sometimes called '''scripter''', '''plotter''' or '''author''',&lt;ref&gt;Booker, M. Keith (ed.), ''Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2014, pp. 174 and 867.&lt;/ref&gt; the '''writer''' scripts the work—scripting may include plot, dialogue and action—in a way that the artist (or artists) can interpret the story into visuals for the reader.{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=165}}  Writers can communicate their stories in varying amounts of detail to the artist(s) and in a number of ways, including verbally, by script or by thumbnail layout.&lt;ref name="PoC8" /&gt;

===Artist===

{{Main|Comics artist}}

The '''artist''' is the person who handles the visuals.  This job may be broken down further into:

====Penciller====

{{Main|Comics artist|Penciller}}

The '''penciller''' or '''penciler''' lays down the basic artwork for a page, deciding on panel placement and the placement of figures and settings in the panels,{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=161}} the backgrounds and the characters' facial expressions and poses.{{sfn|Markstein|2010}}

====Inker====

{{Main|Inker}}

An '''[[inker]]''' or '''finisher''' "finishes" and sometimes enhances, the pencilled artwork using ink (traditionally [[India ink]]) and a pen or brush to create a high-contrast image for photographing and printing.{{sfnm|1a1=Markstein|1y=2010|2a1=Lyga|2a2=Lyga|2y=2004|2p=161|3a1=Lee|3y=1978|3p=145}}  The extent of the inker's job varies depending on how tight the [[#Penciller|penciller]]'s work is, but nonetheless requires the skill of an artist,{{sfn|Markstein|2010}} and is more or less active depending on the completeness of the pencils provided.&lt;ref name="PoC8" /&gt;

====Colourist====

{{Main|Colorist}}

The '''[[Colorist|colourist]]''' or '''colorist''' adds colours to the finished artwork, which can have an effect on mood and meaning.&lt;ref name="PoC315" /&gt;  Colourists can work with a variety of media, such as [[rubylith]], paints, and computers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Digital colorists may employ a [[Flatter]] to assist them.

===Letterer===

{{Main|Letterer}}

Normally separate from the writer, the '''[[letterer]]''' is the person who fills (and possibly places) [[speech balloon]]s and captions with the dialogue and other words meant to be read.  Letterers may also provide the lettering for sound, although this is often done by the artist even when a letterer is present.{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=163}}  In the West, comics have traditionally been hand-lettered, although computer typesetting has become increasingly common.{{sfn|Markstein|2010}}&lt;ref name="DIY110" /&gt;  The manner in which the letterer letters the text influences how the message is interpreted by the reader,&lt;ref name="PoC8" /&gt; and the letterer can suggest the [[paralanguage]] of dialogue by varying the weight, size and shape of the lettering.&lt;ref name="PoC145" /&gt;

==Formats==

===Comic strip===

A [[comic strip]] is a short work of comics which has its origins in the world of newspapers, but may also appear in magazines or other periodicals, as well as in books and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  In comic strips, generally the only unit of [[#Encapsulation|encapsulation]] is the [[#Panel|panel]].&lt;ref name="PoC6" /&gt;

[[File:Mutt and Jeff - motorcycle cop.jpg|thumb|alt=|''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'' [[daily comic strip]] (1913)]]

====Dailies====

As the name implies, a '''[[daily comic strip]]''' is a comic strip that is normally run six days a week in a newspaper, historically in black and white, although colour examples have become common.  They normally run every day in a week but one (usually Sunday), in which the strip appears larger and usually in colour.  The [[Sunday comics|Sunday strips]] are often outside the ongoing story in the case of strips that have continuity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Usually, daily strips are short and limited to one tier.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[File:1922 0121 krazykat det 650.jpg|thumb|alt=Krazy Kat Sunday comic strip|Full-page ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' Sunday comic strip (1922)]]

====Sundays====

'''[[Sunday comics]]''' are comic strips that traditionally run in newspapers on Sundays (Saturdays in some papers), frequently in full colour.  Before [[World War II]], cartoonists normally were given an entire page to themselves, and often would devote the page to a single comic strip, although many would divide the page between a main strip and a "[[Topper (comic strip)|topper]]" (which would sometimes run on the bottom).  Wartime paper shortages brought down the size of strips, and to this day Sunday pages normally are made up of a multitude of strips.{{sfn|Markstein|2010}}

===Gag and editorial cartoons===

'''[[Gag cartoon]]s''' and '''[[Editorial cartoonist|editorial]]''' cartoons are usually single-panel comics, although sequential examples are not rare.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A '''gag cartoon''' (a.k.a. '''panel cartoon''' or '''gag panel''') is most often a single-panel cartoon, usually including a hand-lettered or typeset caption beneath the drawing. A pantomime cartoon carries no caption. In some cases, dialogue may appear in speech balloons, following the common convention of comic strips. As the name implies—"gag" being a show business term for a comedic idea—these cartoons are most often intended to provoke laughter.

An '''editorial cartoon''' or '''political cartoon''' is most often a single-panel comic that contain some level of political or social commentary. Such cartoons are used to convey and question an aspect of daily news or current affairs in a national or international context. Political cartoons generally feature a [[caricaturist]] style of [[drawing]], to capture the likeness of a politician or subject. Political cartoonists may also employ humor or [[satire]] to ridicule an individual or group, emphasize their point of view, or comment on a particular event. The traditional and most common outlet for political cartoons is the [[editorial page]] of a newspaper, or in a [[pocket cartoon]], in the front news section of a newspaper. Editorial cartoons are not usually found in the dedicated comic section, although certain cartoons or [[comic strips]] have achieved crossover status.

===Comic book===

A '''[[comic book]]''', also known as a '''comic''' or '''floppy''', is a periodical, normally thin in size and stapled together.{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=164}}  Comic books have a greater variety of units of encapsulation than comic strips, including the [[#Panel|panel]], the page, the [[#Spread|spread]], and inset panels.  They are also capable of more sophisticated layouts and compositions.&lt;ref name="PoC6" /&gt; A floppy comic is also known as an [[American comic book]].

====Graphic novel====

'''[[Graphic novel]]''' is a term whose definition is hard to pin down, but usually refers to self-contained, book-length form.  Some would have its use restricted only to long-form narratives, while at the other extreme are people who use it as a synonym for "comics" or "comic book".{{sfnm|1a1=Weiner|1a2=Weiner|1y=2010|1p=227|2a1=Markstein|2y=2010|3a1=Semley|3y=2011}}  Others again define it as a book with a square-bound spine, even if it is a collection of short strips.&lt;ref name="WiaGN" /&gt;  Still others have used the term to distance their work from the negative connotations the terms "comic" or "comic book" have for the public, or to give their work an elevated air.  Other than in presentation and intent, they hardly differ from comic books.&lt;ref name="PoC4" /&gt;

Some prefer not use the term "graphic novel" at all.  Amongst the criticisms are that the use of the word "novel" excludes non-novelistic genres, such as journalism, biography or history.  Others believe the term has become too general, a catch-all for all kinds of content, and thus meaningless.{{sfn|Weiner|Weiner|2010|p=227}}

Towards the close of the 20th century, the three major comics-producing traditions—American, western European (especially the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian]]), and Japanese—converged in a trend towards book-length comics: the '''[[comic album]]''' in Europe, the {{transl|ja|'''''[[tankōbon]]'''''}}{{efn|{{nihongo|tankōbon|単行本|extra=translation close to "independently appearing book"}}}} in Japan, and the graphic novel in the English-speaking countries.

===Webcomics===

'''[[Webcomic]]s''', comics published via the [[Internet]] on the [[World Wide Web]], have emerged since the beginning of the 21st century.  As they are not limited by the size and shape of a physical page, they can make use of what [[Scott McCloud]] calls the '''[[infinite canvas]]''', where the individual comics can make use of different sizes and dimensions. Webcomics are also capable of incorporated multimedia elements, such as sound, animation and bigger panels (scrolling panels). In South Korea, an infinite canvas format caught on called the '''[[webtoon]]'''. A [[slide show]]-like format for webcomics was described by French cartoonists Balak in 2010, which he dubbed '''[[Turbomedia]]'''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==International comics==
Comics of non-English origin are often referred to by the terms used in those comics' language of origin.  The most widespread example is when fans of Japanese comics use the term '''[[manga]]''',{{sfn|McCloud|2006|p=215}} which is also applied to non-Japanese comics done in a Japanese style.{{sfn|Markstein|2010}}  One also sees '''BD''' or '''bandes dessinées''' used to refer to [[Franco-Belgian comics]],&lt;ref name="PoC315"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DIY110"/&gt; '''[[manhwa]]''' and '''[[manhua]]''' to refer to Korean and Chinese comics respectively, and '''fumetti''' to refer to [[Italian comics]], although this term is also used in English to refer to comics whose graphics are made using photographs rather than illustrations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4423">'''Hüseyin Erdem''' (born 1949) is a Kurdish author and screenwriter who has published several works in German, Turkish and Kurdish. He has lived in Germany since 1980 and is a language teacher of Turkish and Kurdish. In 1988 he founded the [[PEN International|PEN Centre]] of Kurdish literature.

==Early life and career==
Erdem was born in [[Yayladere]], [[Turkey]]. Growing up in [[Instanbul]] he studied German and Slavic Linguistics and Literature as well as Law. From 1969 to 1976 he was chief editor of the Turkish Literary Magazine "Yeni Ufuklar" ("New Horizons"). In 1980 he emigrated to Germany and has been living there since.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood Hama Tschawisch, Die kurdische Exilliteratur in Deutschland von den 70er Jahren bis heute, Marburg, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling in Germany, Erdem began to write about the conditions of foreign or migrant workers living in Germany (so called [[Gastarbeiterl]] Literature). His first work, called ''Annäherungen - Prosa, Lyrik und Fotografiken aus dem Gastarbeiteralltag'', was published in 1982 in the anthology  ''Annäherungen - Prosa, Lyrik und Fotografiken aus dem Gastarbeiteralltag'', and was edited by [[Franco Biondi]], [[Jusuf Naoum]] und [[Rafik Schami]]. In the following years he published poems and short stories dealing with Turkish and Kurdish immigrant culture in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood Hama Tschawisch, Die kurdische Exilliteratur in Deutschland von den 70er Jahren bis heute, Marburg, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 he published the fairy tale ''Siyabend and Xecê'' in German and Kurdish  as a retelling of an ancient Kudish Folklore. In 1991 his book was adapted into a film by the Turkish Senar Film Company and German WDR, for which Erdem also wrote the screenplay. This German/Turkish co-production was the first movie ever to be filmed in Kurdish language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32087027/Siyabend-u-Xece.pdf Der Kameramann 12/1991, Georg Berg: ''Spielfilmproduktion im Ausnahmezustand'']{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF-Datei; 535&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the German WDR also produced and released a radio play written by Erdem, called ''Das Feuer wird nie erlöschen'' (''The Fire Will Never Be Extinguished''), which deals with the topic of Kudish minorities living in Turkey. Another one of his radio plays, ''[[Gurbet Türküleri|Turkish Songs About The Exile]]'' has been honoured with the European [[Civis]] prize
At the internationalen PEN-Conference in 1988, taking place in Cambridge, he founded the Kurdish P.E.N. Centre, most of the members of which all live in Germany today. He also founded the departments of Kurdish and Turkish  Languages and Literature at the University of Cologne at which he has been teaching until today. In addition to his work as a university teacher and writer in Turkish and Kurdish he also writes in German and is a member of the German P.E.N.

'''Kinyarwanda''' ({{IPA-rw|iciɲɑɾɡwɑːndɑ|IPA}} or {{IPA-rw|iɟiɲɑɾgwɑ:ndɑ|IPA}}), known as '''Urufumbira''' in [[Kisoro]], [[Uganda]], is an [[official language]] of [[Rwanda]] and a dialect of the [[Rwanda-Rundi language]] spoken by at least 12 million people in Rwanda, Eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and adjacent parts of southern [[Uganda]] ([[Kirundi]] dialect is the official language of neighbouring [[Burundi]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Rundi", [[Ethnologue]], 16th Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinyabwisha and Kinyamulenge are the mutually intelligible dialects spoken in [[North Kivu]] and [[South Kivu]] provinces of neighbouring DR Congo.
  		  	
Kinyarwanda is one of the four official languages of Rwanda (along with [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Swahili language|Kiswahili]]) and is spoken by almost all of the native population. That contrasts with most modern African states, whose borders were drawn by [[colonisation of Africa|colonial powers]] and do not correspond to ethnic boundaries or precolonial kingdoms.{{sfn|Boyd|1979|p=1}}

===Tone===
Kinyarwanda is a [[tonal language]]. Like many [[Bantu languages]], it has a two-way contrast between high and low tones (low-tone syllables may be analyzed as toneless). The realization of tones in Kinyarwanda is influenced by a complex set of [[phonological rule]]s.

===Orthography===
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Letter(s) 
| a || b || c || cy || d || e || f || g || h || i || j || jy || k || m || n || ny || o || p || pf || r || s || t || ts || u || v || w || y || z
|-
! [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] 
| a, aː || β, b || t͡ʃ || c || d || e, eː || f || g, ɟ || h || i, iː || ʒ || ɟ || k, c || m || n, ŋ || ɲ || o, oː || p || p͡f || ɾ || s || t || t͡s || u, uː || v || w || j || z
|}

Except in a few morphological contexts, the sequences 'ki' and 'ke' may be pronounced interchangeably as [ki] and [ke] or [ci] and [ce] according to speaker's preference.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The letters 'a', 'e', or 'i' at the end of a word followed by a word starting with a vowel often follows a pattern of omission (observed in the following excerpt of the Rwandan anthem) in common speech, though the orthography remains the same. For example, ''Reka tukurate tukuvuge ibigwi wowe utubumbiye hamwe twese Abanyarwanda uko watubyaye berwa, sugira, singizwa iteka.'' would be pronounced as "Reka tukurate tukuvug' ibigwi wow' utubumiye hamwe twes' abanyarwand' uko watubyaye berwa, sugira singizw' iteka."

In the colloquial language, there are some discrepancies from orthographic ''Cw'' and ''Cy.'' Specifically, ''rw'' (as in ''Rwanda)'' is often pronounced {{IPA|[ɾɡw]}}. The differences are the following:

::{| class=wikitable
! Orthog. !! Pron.
|-
| ''pw'' || {{IPA|[pk]}}
|-
| ''bw'' || {{IPA|[bɡ]}}
|-
| ''tw'' || {{IPA|[tkw]}}
|-
| ''dw'' || {{IPA|[dɡw]}}
|-
| ''mw'' || {{IPA|[mŋ]}}
|-
| ''nw'' || {{IPA|[nŋw]}}
|-
| ''fw'' || {{IPA|[fk]}}
|-
| ''vw'' || {{IPA|[vɡ]}}
|-
| ''sw'' || {{IPA|[skw]}}
|-
| ''zw'' || {{IPA|[zɡw]}}
|-
| ''shw'' || {{IPA|[ʃkw]}}
|-
| ''jw'' || {{IPA|[ʒɡw]}}
|-
| ''pfw'' || {{IPA|[p͡fk]}}
|-
| ''tsw'' || {{IPA|[t͡skw]}}
|-
| ''cw'' || {{IPA|[t͡ʃkw]}}
|-
| ''rw'' || {{IPA|[ɾɡw]}}
|-
| ''py'' || {{IPA|[pc]}}
|-
| ''by'' || {{IPA|[bɟ]}}
|-
| ''ty'' || {{IPA|[tc]}}

|-
| ''my'' || {{IPA|[mɲ]}}
|-
| ''sy'' || {{IPA|[sc]}}
|-
| ''ry'' || {{IPA|[ɾɟ]}}
|}

Note that these are all sequences; {{IPA|[bɡ]}}, for example, is not [[Labial-velar consonant|labio-velar]] {{IPAblink|ɡ͡b}}. Even when ''Rwanda'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɾwanda/}}, the onset is a sequence, not a [[labialization|labialized]] {{IPA|[ɾʷ]}}.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===
Kinyarwanda uses 16 of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[noun class]]es. Sometimes these are grouped into 10 pairs so that most singular and plural forms of the same word are included in the same class. The table below shows the 16 noun classes and how they are paired in two commonly used systems.

===Verbs===
All Kinyarwanda verb [[infinitive]]s begin with ''ku-'' (morphed into ''kw-'' before vowels, and into ''gu-'' before stems beginning with a [[voiceless consonant]] due to [[Dahl's Law]]).  To [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugate]], the infinitive prefix is removed and replaced with a prefix agreeing with the [[subject (grammar)|subject]].  Then a [[tense (grammar)|tense]] marker can be inserted.

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| I    || ''a-''   || ''y-''  || ''ba-''  || ''b-''

The prefixes for pronouns are as follows:
* 'I' = ''n-''
* 'you' (sing.) = ''u-''
* 'he/she' = ''y-''/''a-'' (i.e. the singular Class I prefix above)
* 'we' = ''tu-''
* 'you' (pl.) = ''mu-''
* 'they' (human) = ''ba-'' (i.e. the plural Class I prefix above)

Tense markers include the following.
* Present ('I do'): ''-'' (no infix)
* Present progressive ('I am doing'): ''-ra-'' (morphs to ''-da-'' when preceded by ''n'')
* Future ('I will do'): ''-za- ''
* Continuous progressive ('I'm still doing'): ''-racya- ''

===[[Causative]]s===

Kinyarwanda employs the use of periphrastic [[causative]]s, in addition to morphological causatives.

The [[periphrastic]] causatives use the verbs ''-teer-'' and ''-tum-'', which mean ''cause''. With ''-teer-'', the original subject becomes the object of the main clause, leaving the original verb in the infinitive (just like in English):{{sfn|Kimenyi|1980|pp=160–61}}

:{{interlinear|number = (1a)
|Ábáana '''b-a-gii-ye'''.
|children '''they-PST-go-ASP'''
|"The children '''left'''."}}

:{{interlinear|number = (1b)
|Umugabo y-a-tee-ye ábáana '''ku-geend-a'''.
|man he-PST-cause-ASP children '''INF-go-ASP'''
|"The man caused the children '''to go'''.}}

In this construction, the original S can be deleted.{{sfn|Kimenyi|1980|p=161}}

:{{interlinear|number = (2a)
|Abanntu ba-rá-bon-a.
|people they-PRES-see-ASP
|"People see"}}

:{{interlinear|number = (2b)
|Ku-geenda gu-teer-a (abaantu) ku-bona.
|INF-go it-cause-ASP (people) INF-see
|"To travel causes to see."}}

With ''-túm-'', the original S remains in the embedded clause and the original verb is still marked for person and tense:{{sfn|Kimenyi|1980|pp=161–2}}

:{{interlinear|number = (3a)
|'''N-a-andits-e''' amábárúwa meênshi. 
|'''I-PST-write-ASP''' letters many
|"'''I wrote''' many letters."}}

:{{interlinear|number = (3b)
|Umukoôbwa y-a-tum-ye '''n-á-andik-a''' amábárúwa meênshi.
|girl she-PST-cause-ASP '''I-PST-write-ASP''' letters many
|"The girl caused '''me to write''' many letters."}}

Derivational causatives use the instrumental marker ''-iish-''. The construction is the same, but it is instrumental when the subject is inanimate and it is causative when the subject is animate:{{sfn|Kimenyi|1980|p=164}}

:{{interlinear|number = (4a)
|Umugabo a-ra-andik-'''iish'''-a umugabo íbárúwa.
|man he-PRES-write-'''CAUS'''-ASP man letter
|"The man is making the man write a letter."}}

:{{interlinear|number = (4b)
|Umugabo a-ra-andik-'''iish'''-a íkárámu íbárúwa.
|man he-PRES-write-'''INSTR'''-ASP pen letter
|"The man is writing a letter with the pen."}}

This morpheme can be applied to intransitives (3) or transitives (4):{{sfn|Kimenyi|1980|p=164}}

:{{interlinear|number = (3a)
|Ábáana ba-rá-ryáam-ye.
|children they-PRES-sleep-ASP
|"The children are sleeping."}}

:{{interlinear|number = (3b)
|Umugóre a-ryaam-'''iish'''-ije ábáana
|woman she-sleep-'''CAUS'''-ASP children
|"The woman is ''putting'' the children to sleep."}}

:{{interlinear|number = (4a)
|Ábáana ba-ra-som-a ibitabo.
|children they-PRES-read-ASP books
|"The children are reading the books."}}

:{{interlinear|number = (4b)
|Umugabo a-ra-som-''eesh''-a ábáana ibitabo.
|man he-PRES-read-''CAUS''-ASP children books
|"The man is ''making'' the children read the books."}}

However, there can only be one animate direct object. If a sentence has two, one or both is deleted and understood from context.{{sfn|Kimenyi|1980|pp=165–166}}

The suffix ''-iish-'' implies an indirect causation (similar to English ''have'' in "I had him write a paper), while other causatives imply a direct causation (similar to English ''make'' in "I made him write a paper").{{sfn|Kimenyi|1980|p=166}}

One of these more direct causation devices is the deletion of what is called a "neutral" morpheme ''-ik-'', which indicates state or potentiality. Stems with the ''-ik-'' removed can take ''-iish'', but the causation is less direct:{{sfn|Kimenyi|1980|p=166}}

:{|
| ''-mének-'' || "be broken" || ''-mén-'' || "break" || -''méneesh-'' || "have (something) broken"
|-
| ''-sáduk-'' || "be cut" || ''-sátur-'' || "cut" || ''-sátuz-'' || "have (something) cut"
|}

Another direct causation maker is ''-y-'' which is used for some verbs:{{sfn|Kimenyi|1980|p=167}}

:{{interlinear|number = (5a)
|Ámáazi a-rá-shyúuh-a.
|water it-PRES-warm-ASP
|"The water is being warmed."}}

:{{interlinear|number = (5b)
|Umugóre a-rá-shyúush-'''y'''-a ámáazi.
|woman she-PRES-warm-'''CAUS'''-ASP water
|"The woman is '''warming''' the water."}}

:{{interlinear|number = (5c)
|Umugabo a-rá-shyúuh-'''iish'''-a umugóre ámáazi
|man he-PRES-warm-'''CAUS'''-ASP woman water
|"The man is '''having''' the woman warm the water.}}

'''Krikor Zohrab Effendi''' ({{lang-hy|Գրիգոր Զօհրապ}}; June 26, 1861 – 1915) was an influential [[Armenia]]n writer, politician, and lawyer from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. At the onset of the [[Armenian Genocide]] he was arrested by the Turkish government and sent to appear before a military court in [[Diyarbakır]]. En route, at a locality called Karaköprü or Şeytanderesi on the outskirts of [[Şanlıurfa|Urfa]], he was murdered by a band of known brigands under the leadership of Çerkez Ahmet, Halil and Nazım some time between 15 July and 20 July 1915&lt;ref name="d'histoire arménienne"&gt;{{fr icon}} Kévorkian, Raymond H.

== Life ==
Zohrab was born into a wealthy family in [[Beşiktaş]], [[Istanbul]] on 26 June 1861.&lt;ref name=baliozian&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baliozian|first1=Ara|title=Zohrab: an introduction|date=1985|publisher=Impressions|location=Kitchener, Ont.|isbn=0-920553-00-1|pages=13–6|url=https://www.academia.edu/15109941/Ara_Baliozian_Zohrab_An_Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early education was completed at a local [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] school. He received a civil engineering degree from Galatasaray Institute, but did not work in that field. Instead, he enrolled in a newly opened law school, the Imperial University of Jurisprudence (today: [[Istanbul University]] Faculty of Law), and received his law degree in 1882. He was a revered lawyer in the courts of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empire. He became a professor at the university, teaching law. At the age of 27, he married Clara Yazejian, and fathered two daughters and two sons. One of the daughters, [[Dolores Zohrab Liebmann]], eventually became an American philanthropist.

Krikor Zohrab defended successfully many Armenians charged with a variety of political and criminal offenses between 1895-96. As a result of his defense of a Bulgarian revolutionary in the course of which he accused a Turkish official of torture, he was disbarred and forced to live abroad.&lt;ref name=baliozian /&gt;

In 1908, following the revolution of the [[Young Turks]], he became a member of parliament in the Ottoman Council, and also served his community as an Armenian councilor.&lt;ref name=baliozian /&gt;

=== Personality and lifestyle ===
Zohrab was a great intellectual that lived a very busy life. He had to balance his professional life with his personal life. He had a rich personality along with a generous heart. He loved life and its pleasures. Although he usually was open to progressive ideas he was steadfastly conservative to women's role in society. He believed that women should keep their traditional roles and not venture further.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Political activity ===

Ever since he was a teenager, Zohrab showed great interest in national work and contributed heavily to his community. At the age of 30 he was chosen to be part of the national council of Constantinople and served on the council until his death. He was one of the very first victims of Turkish genocide. 
From 1908 onwards, Zohrab was a member of parliament and known for his eloquent speeches. He vehemently defended Armenian interests and rights inside the council and at all levels of the government. In 1909 during the [[Adana massacre]], he strongly criticized the Turkish authorities for their actions and demanded that those responsible be brought to [[justice]].

To serve the Armenian cause, he wrote an influential paper in French called "La question arménienne à la lumière des documents" (The Armenian question in light of documents), published in 1913 under the pseudonym Marcel Leart in [[Paris]]. It dealt with many aspects of the hardships endured by the Armenian populace and denounced the government's inaction.

===Publications===
[[File:Grigor Zohrab stamp.jpg|thumb|Krikor Zohrab, stamp of the Armenian Post, 2011.]]

Zohrab wrote many articles in Armenian daily newspapers such as ''Masis'' (Մասիս), ''Hairenik'' (Հայրենիք), and ''Arevelk'' (Armenian: Արեւելք). One of his famous articles, entitled "Broom," criticized Armenian nationals and works saying they needed some "sweeping" to bring them back to order.

One of his characteristics was that he would regularly express himself in a provocative fashion with disregard to the Turkish state's repressive authority. He had condemned the state on countless occasions for their many shortcomings.

== Writing Style ==
Zohrab can be said to be the master of the Armenian short story. Despite being influenced by the romantic writers as a youngster, he quickly joined the [[French people|French]] [[Literary realism|realism]] movement propelled by such writers as [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Alphonse Daudet]] and [[Émile Zola]]. He is probably the best Armenian writer of the genre.

He lived and wrote about what he lived through. He said that writing was an exhilarating activity into which he could delve himself and forget the pains of everyday life. He had a very sharp eye for human characteristics, both physical and psychological. Descriptions of the human persona were one of his stronger points. He was able to accurately portray faces and gestures in a vivid way. In short, dense, but highly expressive lines, he was able to clearly illustrate a tragedy or a character's qualities.

== Arrest and assassination ==
[[File:Krikorzohrabhouse.JPG|thumb|Residence of Krikor Zohrab]]
During the mass arrests and execution that would signal the start of the Armenian Genocide in and around April 24, 1915, Zohrab was diligently working to try to stop the atrocities. As a member of Parliament he tried to contact the Turkish authorities and to plea for the immediate cessation of the massacres. He even contacted his supposed friend [[Talat Pasha]] to protest and ask for redress, but to no avail. Zohrab told Talat that one day he would demand an explanation for these actions. This would be the last time the two would meet. Some in his immediate circle strongly encouraged him to leave the country, but he refused.&lt;ref name="ma"/&gt;

The following day, on May 21, 1915, Zohrab was arrested by the Turks, together with another deputy to the Ottoman Parliament. Ordered to appear before a court martial in [[Diyarbakır]], they traveled together by train to [[Aleppo]], escorted by one gendarme. They remained in Aleppo for a few weeks, waiting for the results of attempts by the Ottoman governor of the city to have them sent back to the capital. Some sources state that Cemal Pasha himself tried to secure their return,&lt;ref&gt;Üngör, Uğur, ''The Making of Modern Turkey: Nation and State in Eastern Anatolia, 1913-1950''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; but Talaat Pasha insisted on having the pair court martialed. They were then dispatched to [[Şanlıurfa|Urfa]] and remained there for some time in the house of a Turkish deputy friend. Later, they were taken under police escort and taken to Diyarbakır by car. They were allegedly{{According to whom|date=March 2013}} accompanied on a voluntary basis by some notable Urfa Armenians. Many sources state that they were murdered by the well-known band of brigands led by Çerkez Ahmet, Halil and Nazım, at a locality called Karaköprü or Şeytanderesi in the outskirts of Urfa, some time between 15 July and 20 July 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Haigazn K. Kazarian, "The Murder of 6 Armenian Members of the Ottoman Parliament," ''[[Armenian Review]]'' 22 (Winter 1970), pp. 26-33; "'How Krikor Zohrab was Murdered': The Account of a Sergeant of Gendarmes at Urfa," ''Armenian Review'' 35 (Spring 1982), pp. 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The murderers were tried and executed in [[Damascus]] by [[Cemal Pasha]] in September 1915, and the assassinations became the subject of a 1916 investigation by the Ottoman Parliament led by [[Artin Boşgezenyan|Artin Boshgezenian]], the deputy for Aleppo.&lt;ref name="d'histoire arménienne"/&gt;

== Works ==
Some of his published writings:
*''A Vanished Generation'' (Անհետացած սերունդ մը) is one of his works. Considered a great piece of realist writing.
*''Familiar Faces'' (Ծանօթ դէմքեր), a piece where he draws portraits of prominent figures of his time.
*''From the Journeyman's Diary'' (Ուղեւորի օրագրէն), a book about European travels and the impressions they left on him.

'''Lakshmi''' ({{lang-ta|லட்சுமி}}), is the pseudonym of '''S. Thiripurasundari''' ({{lang-ta|திரிபுரசுந்தரி}}, 21 March 1921 - 7 January 1987) a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] writer from [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]].

==Biography==
Thiripurasundari was born in Thottiyam in [[Ammapettai (Thanjavur district)|Ammapettai]] near [[Chidambaram]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. Her parents were Dr. Srinivasan and Pattammal (Sivakami). She was schooled at [[Thottiyam]], [[Musiri]] and Holy Cross School, [[Trichy]]. She studied in [[Stanley Medical College]] and became a medical doctor. She began publishing short stories in ''[[Ananda Vikatan]]'' while still at college. She used "Lakshmi" as her pseudonym. Her first short story to be published was ''Thagunda thandanaya?'' (lit. An apt punishment?). Her first novel to be published was ''Bhavani''. After completing her medical education, she practiced at [[Chennai]]. She married Kannabiran in 1955 and moved to [[South Africa]], where she lived for the next twenty two years. Her husband died in 1966. She returned to India in 1977 and took up full time writing. She died in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lakshmi Obituary|newspaper=[[Ananda Vikatan]]|date=25 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiripurasundari was a prolific writer who has published hundreds of short stories and novels. Her novels ''Penn manam'' and ''Mithila Vilas'' were awarded the ''Tamil Valarchi Kazhagam'' price. In 1984, she was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Tamil language|Tamil]] for her novel ''Oru Kaveriyai pola''(lit.

'''Louis Couturat''' ({{IPA-fr|kutyʁa|lang}}; 17 January 1868 – 3 August 1914) was a [[French people|French]] [[logic]]ian, [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[linguistics|linguist]].

==Life==
Born in [[Ris-Orangis]], [[Essonne]], France. In 1887 he entered [[École Normale Supérieure]] to study [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]]. In 1895 he lectured in philosophy at the [[University of Toulouse]] and 1897 lectured in [[philosophy of mathematics]] at [[University of Caen Normandy]], taking a stand in favor of [[transfinite number]]s. After a time in [[Hanover]] studying the writings of Leibniz, he became an assistant to [[Henri-Louis Bergson]] at [[Collège de France]] in 1905.

He was ''the'' French advocate of the [[symbolic logic]] that emerged in the years before World War I, thanks to the writings of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Giuseppe Peano]] and his school, and especially to ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' by Couturat's friend and correspondent [[Bertrand Russell]]. Like Russell, Couturat saw symbolic logic as a tool to advance both mathematics and the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. In this, he was opposed by [[Henri Poincaré]], who took considerable exception to Couturat's efforts to interest the French in symbolic logic. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that Couturat was in broad agreement with the [[logicism]] of Russell, while Poincaré anticipated [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]]'s [[intuitionism]].

His first major publication was Couturat (1896). In 1901, he published ''La Logique de Leibniz'', a detailed study of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] the logician, based on his examination of the huge Leibniz ''[[Nachlass]]'' in Hanover. Even though Leibniz had died in 1716, his ''Nachlass'' was cataloged only in 1895. Only then was it possible to determine the extent of Leibniz's unpublished work on logic. In 1903, Couturat published much of that work in another large volume, his ''Opuscules et Fragments Inedits de Leibniz'', containing many of the documents he had examined while writing ''La Loqique''. Couturat was thus the first to appreciate that Leibniz was the greatest logician during the more than 2000 years that separate [[Aristotle]] from [[George Boole]] and [[Augustus De Morgan]]. A significant part of the 20th century Leibniz revival is grounded in Couturat's editorial and exegetical efforts. This work on Leibniz attracted Russell, also the author of a 1900 book on Leibniz, and thus began their professional correspondence and friendship.

In 1905, Couturat published a work on logic and the [[foundations of mathematics]] (with an appendix on Kant's philosophy of mathematics) which was originally conceived as a translation of Russell's ''Principles of Mathematics''.  In the same year, he published ''L'Algèbre de la logique'', a classic introduction to [[Boolean algebra]] and the works of [[C.S. Peirce]] and [[Ernst Schröder]].

In 1907, Couturat helped found the [[constructed language]] [[Ido (language)|Ido]], an offshoot of [[Esperanto]], and was Ido's principal advocate over the remainder of his life. By advocating a constructed international language, constructed along logical principles and with a vocabulary taken from existing European languages, Couturat was paralleling [[Peano]]'s advocacy of [[Latino sine flexione|Interlingua]]. By pushing Ido, Couturat walked in Leibniz's footsteps; Leibniz called for the creation a universal symbolic and conceptual language he named the [[characteristica universalis]].

Couturat, a confirmed [[pacifism|pacifist]], was killed when his car was hit by a car carrying orders for the mobilization of the [[French Army]], in the first stage of [[World War I]].

He appears as a character in [[Joseph Skibell]]'s 2010 novel, ''A Curable Romantic''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14638">'''Mass mobilization''' (also known as '''social mobilization''' or '''popular mobilization''') refers to [[mobilization]] of [[civilian]] [[population]] as part of [[contentious politics]]. Mass mobilization is often used by [[grassroot]]s-based [[social movements]], including [[revolutionary movement]]s, but can also become a tool of [[elite]]s and the [[State (polity)|state]] itself. The process usually takes the form of large public [[Meeting|gathering]]s such as [[mass meetings]], marches, [[parade]]s, [[procession]]s and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]]. Those gatherings usually are part of a [[protest|protest action]].

Mass mobilization is defined as a process that engages and motivates a wide range of partners and allies at national and local levels to raise awareness of and demand for a particular development objective through face-to-face dialogue. Members of institutions, community networks, civic and religious groups and others work in a coordinated way to reach specific groups of people for dialogue with planned messages. In other words, social mobilization seeks to facilitate change through a range of players engaged in interrelated and complementary efforts.&lt;ref name="refname1" /&gt;

==Government mass mobilization==
Governments can promote mass mobilization to support the causes they promote.  Many governments attempt to mobilize the population to participate in elections and other voting events.  In particular, it is important for political parties in any country to be able to mobilize voters in order to gain support for their party, which affects voter turnout in general.&lt;ref name="refname5" /&gt;

===Examples===
[[Nazi Germany]] applied mass mobilization techniques to win support for their policies.  The [[Nazi Party]] mobilized the population with mass meetings, parades, and other gatherings.  These events appealed to the people's [[emotions]].&lt;ref name="refname4" /&gt;

[[North Korea]] frequently employs mass mobilization to convene its people to publicly express loyalty around important events and [[Public holidays in North Korea|holidays]]. Mobilization is also used to acquire workforce for tasks such as construction, farm work, keeping public places clean, and urgent disaster relief. Mass mobilization is also used to acquire [[hard currency]]. Participating in mobilization campaigns is mandatory and failure to appear may result in penalties. However, for some, it is possible to bribe themselves out of the duty.&lt;ref name="newf_Alif"&gt;{{Cite web | title = A lifetime of mass mobilization in North Korea | work = NEW FOCUS International | date = August 16, 2015 | accessdate = August 18, 2015 | url = http://newfocusintl.com/a-lifetime-of-mass-mobilization-in-north-korea/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass mobilization in social media==
[[Social media]] and the [[Interne]]t have made mass mobilization easier to organize and disseminate ideas.  The Internet has grown in political importance, and has played a significant role in many mass mobilization efforts.&lt;ref name="refname2" /&gt;

==Nonviolence vs Violent Tactics==
According to [[Donatella della Porta]] and [[Sidney Tarrow]], the mechanism that produces violence in the declining phase of the collective action cycle is a result of the competition that arises among different sectors of the social movement. Together they formed a theory stating that as mass mobilization winds down, political violence rises in magnitude and intensity.&lt;ref name="refname26" /&gt;

===Examples===

====Italy====
In his study of the wave of mass protests that took place in Italy between 1965 and 1975, [[Sidney Tarrow]] stated that “[i]n the final stages of the cycle, there was an increase in the deliberate use of violence against others. But this increase was a function of the decline of mass protest, not of its extension. Indeed, deliberate targeted violence did not become common until 1972-3, when all the other forms of collective action had declined.” All of which leads him to forcefully conclude that “[o]rganized violence was the product of demobilization.” &lt;ref name="refname27" /&gt;
[[Donatella della Porta]], in her comparative analysis of political 
violence and cycles of protest in Italy and Germany between 1960 and 1990, maintains 
that “when mass mobilization declined, the movements went back to more institutional 
forms of collective action, whereas small groups resorted to more organized forms of 
violence.” &lt;ref name="refname28" /&gt;

====USSR====
Mark R. Beissinger, in his study on cycles of protest and 
nationalist violence in the Soviet Union between 1987 and 1992, also detects this 
pattern, but in this case violence takes the form of ethnic communal conflict rather than 
terrorism. As he says, “the rise of violence in the USSR in significant part was 
associated with the decline of nonviolent mobilization contesting interrepublican 
borders.” &lt;ref name="refname29" /&gt;

====Russia====
During the 1870s, the “populists” or “[[nihilists]]”, the proponents of a Russian variant of [[anarchism]], organized the so-called 
“pilgrimages to the people”, which involved small groups of members of the urban, petit [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[intelligentsia]] going into small villages to persuade peasants of the
necessity of revolution. However, their efforts had little effect on the peasantry, and it was after this bitter experience that they made the momentous decision to adopt terrorist 
tactics.&lt;ref name="refname30" /&gt;

{{Dutch dialects}}

'''Meuse-Rhenish''' (German: ''Rheinmaasländisch'', Dutch: ''Maas-Rijnlands'', and French: ''francique rhéno-mosan'') is a modern term that refers to the literature written in the Middle Ages in the greater Meuse-Rhine area. This area stretches in the northern triangle roughly between the rivers [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] (in Belgium and the Netherlands) and [[Rhine]] (in Germany). It also applies to the [[Low Franconian]] dialects that have been spoken in that area in continuation from mediaeval times up to now.

It includes varieties of [[South Guelderish]] ([[Zuid-Gelders]]) and [[Limburgish]] in the Belgian and Dutch provinces of [[Province of Limburg (1815–1839)|Limburg]], and their German counterparts '''Low Rhenish'''  (German: ''Niederrheinisch'') including ''[[East Bergish]]'' in German Northern [[Rhineland]]. Although some dialects of this group are spoken within the language area where German is the standard, they actually are [[Low Franconian]] in character, and are more closely related to Dutch than to [[High German]], and could therefore also be called Dutch (see also [[Dutch dialects]]). With regard to this German part only, Meuse-Rhenish equals the total of Low Rhenish vernaculars.

==Low Rhenish and Limburgish==
'''Low Rhenish''' ({{lang-de|Niederrheinisch}}, {{lang-nl|Nederrijns}}) is the collective name in German for the regional [[Low Franconian]] language varieties spoken alongside the so-called [[Lower Rhine]] in the west of Germany.
Low Franconian is a language or dialect group that has developed in the lower parts of the [[Frankish Empire]], northwest of the [[Benrath line]]. From this group both the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and later the [[Afrikaans]] standard languages have arisen. The differences between Low Rhenish and Low Saxon are smaller than between Low Rhenish and [[High German]]. Yet, Low Rhenish does not belong to [[Low German]], but to Low Franconian. Therefore, it could properly be called ''German Dutch''. Indeed, ''Deutschniederländisch'' was the official term under the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian Reign]] of the 19th century.

[[File:Niederrhein-region-map.png|thumb|right|The German Lower Rhine region &lt;br&gt;(East Meuse-Rhenish dialect area)]]

Today, Low Franconian dialects are spoken mainly in regions to the west of the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[IJssel]] in the [[Netherlands]], in the Dutch speaking part of [[Belgium]], but also in Germany in the [[Lower Rhine]] area. Only the latter have traditionally been called ''Low Rhenish'', but they can be regarded as the German extension or counterpart of the [[Limburgish]] [[dialect]]s in the Netherlands and Belgium, and of [[Zuid-Gelders]] (''South Guelderish'') in the Netherlands.

Low Rhenish differs strongly from High German. The more to the north it approaches the Netherlands, the more it sounds like Dutch.  As it crosses the Dutch-German as well as the Dutch-Belgian borders, it becomes a part of the language landscape in three neighbouring countries. In two of them Dutch is the standard language. In Germany, important towns on the Lower Rhine and in the  [[Rhine]]-[[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] area, including parts of the Düsseldorf Region, are part of it, among them [[Kleve]], [[Xanten]], [[Wesel]], [[Moers]], [[Essen]], [[Duisburg]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Oberhausen]] and [[Wuppertal]]. This language area stretches towards the southwest along cities such as [[Neuss]], [[Krefeld]] and [[Mönchengladbach]], and the [[Heinsberg]] district, where it is called [[Limburgish]], crosses the German-Dutch border into the Dutch province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], passing cities east of the [[Meuse]] river (in both Dutch and German called ''Maas'') such as [[Venlo]], [[Roermond]] and [[Geleen]], and then again crosses the [[Meuse]] between the Dutch and Belgian provinces of Limburg, encompassing the cities of [[Maastricht]] (NL) and [[Hasselt]] (B). Thus a mainly political-geographic (not linguistic) division can be made into western (Dutch) South Guelderish and Limburgish at the west side, and eastern (German) Low Rhenish and South East Low Franconian at the east side of the border. The eastmost varieties of the latter, east of the Rhine from Düsseldorf to Wuppertal, are referred to as [[Bergish dialects|Bergish]].

Limburgish is recognised as a [[regional language]] in the Netherlands. As such, it receives moderate protection under chapter 2 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The area in which Limburgish is spoken roughly fits within a wide circle from [[Venlo]] (NL) to [[Düsseldorf]] (D) to [[Aachen]] (D) to [[Maastricht]] (NL) to [[Hasselt]] (B) and back to Venlo. In Germany, it is common to consider the Limburgish varieties as belonging to the Low Franconian language varieties; in the Netherlands and Belgium, however, all these varieties are traditionally considered to be [[West Central German]], part of [[High German]]. This difference is caused by a difference in definition: linguists of the Low Countries define a High German variety as one that has taken part in any of the first three phases of the [[High German consonant shift]].
In German sources, the dialects linguistically counting as Limburgish spoken east of the river Rhine are often called "[[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]" (after the former [[Duchy of Berg]]). West of the river Rhine they are called "Low Rhenish", "Limburgish" or "Ripuarian". Limburgish is not recognised by the German government as an official language. Low Rhenish is considered as a group of dialects in Germany. Together all these varieties belong to a greater continuum; this superordinating group is called Meuse-Rhenish. These insights are rather new among dialectologists on both sides of the national Dutch-German border.

German population in the Meuse-Rhine area are used to let the geographic 'Lower Rhine' area begin approximately with the Benrath line, coincidentally. They do mostly not think of the [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]]-speaking area as Low Rhenish, which includes the [[South Bergish]] or Upper Bergish area east of the Rhine, south of the [[Wupper]], north of the [[Sieg]].

==The Meuse-Rhine triangle==
This whole region between the Meuse and the Rhine was linguistically and culturally quite coherent during the so-called [[Early modern period]] (1543–1789), though politically more fragmented. The former predominantly Dutch speaking duchies of [[Guelders]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] lay in the heart of this linguistic landscape, but eastward the former duchies of [[Cleves]] (entirely), [[Jülich]], and [[Berg (state)|Berg]] partially, also fit in.
The northwestern part of this [[triangular]] area came under the influence of the Dutch standard language, especially since the founding of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815. The southeastern part became a part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] at the same time, and from then it was subject to [[High German]] language  domination. At the dialectal level however, mutual understanding is still possible far beyond both sides of the national borders.

The close relation between Limburgish of Belgium and the Netherlands and [[Bergish dialects|Bergish]] is paralleled with that between [[Zuid-Gelders]] and [[Kleverlandish]]-[[East Bergish]], which are even more clearly belonging to Low Franconian. By including Zuid-Gelders-Kleverlandish-East Bergish in this continuum, we are enlarging the territory and turn the wide circle of Limburgish into a triangle with its top along the line [[Arnhem]] - [[Kleve]] - [[Wesel]] - [[Duisburg]] - [[Wuppertal]] (along the [[Rhine]]-[[IJssel]] Line). The [[Diest]]- [[Nijmegen]] Line is its western border, the [[Benrath line]] (from [[Eupen]] to [[Wuppertal]]) is a major part of the southeastern one.

Within the Dutch speaking area, the Western continuance of Low Rhenish is divided into [[Limburgish]] and [[Zuid-Gelders]]. Together they belong to the greater triangle-shaped [[Meuse]]-[[Rhine]] area, a large group of southeastern Low Franconian dialects, including areas in Belgium, the Netherlands and the German Northern [[Rhineland]].

==Southeast Limburgish around Aachen==
''[[Southeast Limburgish]]'' is spoken around [[Kerkrade]], [[Bocholtz]] and [[Vaals]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[Aachen]] in [[Germany]] and [[Raeren]] and [[Eynatten]] in [[Belgium]]. In [[Germany]] it is mostly considered as a form of [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]], instead of Limburgish. According to a contemporary vision, all varieties in a wider half circle some 20&amp;nbsp;km around Aachen, including 2/3 of Dutch South Limburg and also the so-called [[Low Dietsch]] area between [[Voeren]] and [[Eupen]] in Belgium, can be taken as a group of its own, which recently has been named ''Limburgish of the Three Countries Area'' (Dutch: ''Drielandenlimburgs'', German: ''Dreiländerplatt''), referring to the place where the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany meet. This variety still possesses interesting syntactic idiosyncrasies, probably dating from the period in which the old [[Duchy of Limburg]] existed. In Belgium, the south-eastern boundary between Meuse-Rhenish or (French) ''francique rhéno-mosan'' and Ripuarian is formed by the  [[Low Dietsch]] language area.
If only tonality is to be taken as to define this variety, it stretches several dozen kilometers into [[Germany]]. In Germany, the consensus is to class it as belonging to [[High German languages|High German]] varieties. But this is a little over-simplified. In order to include them properly, a more encompassing concept is needed. The combination of Meuse-Rhenish and Ripuarian, including their overlapping transitional zones of [[Southeast Limburgish]] and [[Low Dietsch]], will do.

==Works==

===Philosophy===
I. ''Ideals and Aims of [[Interpretation (philosophy)|Interpretation]]''. Michael Krausz’s interests in the theory of interpretation address the following cluster of questions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, “Interpretation and Its Objects: A Synoptic View,” chap. 2.  In Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, ed., ''Interpretation and Its Objects: Studies in the Philosophy of Michael Krausz''. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; For such cultural phenomena as works of [[art]], [[music]], [[literature]], and the [[self]], can a single admissible interpretation exist? Or, for such phenomena, can a multiplicity of admissible interpretations exist?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Rightness and Reasons: Interpretation in Cultural Practices'', Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1993, chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For such phenomena, can opposing interpretations be jointly defended?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz. “Interpretation and Its Objects,” chap. 7. In Michael Krausz, ed. ''Is There A Single Right Interpretation?'' Philadelphia: Penn State University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Does interpretive activity affect the nature and number of that which is interpreted?&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Rightness and Reasons'', chap. 3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation: Explorations in Art and the Self''. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2007, chap. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Does interpretation aim for the elucidation of its objects, the edification of its interpreters, or both?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', Lanham, Md.: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2000, chap. 11&lt;/ref&gt; How does the question of singularity or multiplicity of admissible interpretations bear on the singularity or multiplicity of life paths and projects?&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation'', chap. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Singularism asserts that objects of interpretation always answer to one and only one ideal interpretation.  In contrast, multiplism asserts that objects of interpretation may answer to more than one opposed interpretation. Both singularism and multiplism require that competing interpretations address one and the same object of interpretation. Where different interpretations address different objects of interpretation, an innocuous pluralism occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Rightness and Reasons'', chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Where objects of interpretation cannot be delineated as to number, neither singularism nor multiplism can apply.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation'', chap. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz probes the relation between these ideals of interpretation and their ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, “Interpretation and Its Objects.”&lt;/ref&gt; Singularism and multiplism are each compatible with either [[Philosophical realism|realism]] or [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]]. Singularism does not uniquely [[logical consequence|entail]] realism (and vice versa) and multiplism does not uniquely entail constructivism (and vice versa). Orthodox combinations include singularist-realism and multiplist-constructivism.Heterodox combinations include singularist-constructivism and multiplist-realism.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, “Interpretation and Its Objects.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz affirms that the contest between singularism and multiplism is logically detachable from the contest between realism and constructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', chap. 4,5.&lt;/ref&gt; He further shows that the contest between singularism and multiplism is detachable from a range of other ontologies that fall under the reconciliatory heading of “constructive realism.”&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', chap. 5–9&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the ontologies in Krausz’s inventory of constructive realisms uniquely entails either singularism or multiplism (and vice versa).  Yet Krausz denies that his “detachability thesis” demonstrates that ontology as such is unnecessary for the theory of interpretation.  For the question of the countability of objects of interpretation as well as interpretations themselves is ontological.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz. “Interpretation and Its Objects.”&lt;/ref&gt; Krausz extends the notion of ideals of interpretation to ideals of life paths or projects, such as self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation'', chap. 9, 10&lt;/ref&gt; That is, directional singularism is the view that for a given person there is one admissible life path, and directional multiplism is the view that for a given person there may be more than one admissible life path. He develops the idea of directional multiplism from a non-essentialist or non-foundational view of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', chap. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

II. ''[[Relativism]]''. In addition, Krausz’s work on relativism canvasses the range and significance of relativistic doctrines and rehearses their virtues and vices.  He considers relativism as the claim that [[truth]], [[good and evil|goodness]], or [[beauty]] (among other values) is relative to some reference frame, and no absolute standards to adjudicate between reference frames exist. He defines and differentiates various strands of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolutism]]: [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[universalism]] and [[foundationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, “Mapping Relativisms,” chap. 1. In Michael Krausz, ed., ''Relativism: A Contemporary Anthology''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Krausz argues that when these strands of absolutism are unwoven, and when relativism is understood as the negation of these strands, classical self-refutation arguments against relativism do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, “Mapping Relativisms.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, “The Debate,” chap. 1. In Michael Krausz and Rom Harré, eds. Varieties of Relativism. Oxford: Basil Blackwell Publishers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Krausz considers whether the idea of “undifferentiated [[wikt:unity|unity]]” survives the relativist challenge. He suggests that the assertion of undifferentiated unity, instanced for example in some Asian soteriologies, is compatible with relativism as here he defines it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Dialogues on Relativism, Absolutism, and Beyond: Four Days in India'', Lanham, Md.: Rowman and Littlefield, 2011, Day Four.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Michael Krausz is the founding Artistic Director and Conductor of the Great Hall Chamber Orchestra at Bryn Mawr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Krausz studied violin with Cleveland Orchestra concertmaster Josef Gingold. He received his early conducting coaching from his father, Laszlo Krausz, noted violist with l'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the Cleveland Orchestra, and conductor of the Akron Symphony Orchestra. Frederik Prausnitz of the Peabody Conservatory, and Luis Biava, Resident Conductor Laureate of the Philadelphia Orchestra also coached Michael Krausz. Krausz has been guest conductor of professional orchestras in Bulgaria, including the Pleven, Vratsa and Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestras.

===Art===
[[File:End of texts3.jpg|thumb|125px|right| &lt;center&gt;End of Texts 35"x26"&lt;/center&gt;]]Michael Krausz has had thirty-three solo and duo shows in galleries in the U.S., U.K., and India, and he has participated in many group exhibitions. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (F.R.S.A.) in 1973. Krausz studied at the Philadelphia College of Art and Haystack Mountain School of Crafts.  He was Resident Fellow at the Ossabaw Foundation. Krausz's artworks have been reproduced in numerous publications including the British journal, ''Leonardo''. He is a member of Artist's Exchange, DE, and Delaware by Hand, which, in 2009, awarded him the status of “Master.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Master Artisans| work =| publisher =Delaware By Hand| date =| url =http://www.delawarebyhand.org/master_artisans.htm| doi =| accessdate =September 27, 2010| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20101120053534/http://delawarebyhand.org/master_artisans.htm| archivedate =November 20, 2010| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz's paintings depict various spatial planes at once, embodying scripted messages of no literal significance. They are concerned with the emergence and dissolution of ciphers in infinite spaces. The works embody a kind of automatic writing arising from conductorial musical gestures in meditative spaces. The paintings are done with dry pigment on museum board and other mixed media.

An example is if one says: "I may agree that if two plus two equals five, then I am a monkey's uncle". "I'll be a monkey's uncle" has been said to date from after 1925, the date of the widely publicized [[Scopes Trial]] in the United States, where the term first appears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MveDuTv3XF8C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22Monkey%27s+uncle%22+darwin&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5KPeTr_xCcWsiAeSsMSZBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Monkey%27s%20uncle%22%20darwin&amp;f=false Now You Know Big Book of Answers 2 | title=Now You Know Big Book of Answers 2 | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Lennox, Doug | pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'s earliest example is the phrase ''If that's a joke I'm a monkey's uncle,'' from an [[Ohio]] newspaper on 8 February 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/121265?rskey=63B7vd&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=true#eid36273007|chapter=Monkey, noun: 9|quote=1925 Elyria (Ohio) Chronicle Telegram 8 Feb., If that's a joke I'm a monkey's uncle. | accessdate=2011-12-06}} ''Available online to subscribers, and also in print''&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally a sarcastic remark made by [[creationist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://h2g2.com/dna/h2g2/plain/A3628 | title=A Monkey's Uncle | publisher=BBC | accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion "that [people] were descended from apes was considered blasphemous...by Darwin's contemporaries", and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2zbkWEXRCwC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22Monkey%27s+uncle%22+darwin&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EqTeTsabFqmXiAfk2MmxBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Monkey%27s%20uncle%22%20darwin&amp;f=false | title=Science, theology, and consciousness: the search for unity | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Arden, John Boghosian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Quinion]] notes that the phrase ''Monkey's uncle'' occurs in a parody of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' which was reprinted in [[James Parton]]'s ''The Humorous Poetry of the English Language'', published in 1881, and observes ''This may be just an accident of invention, but the date fits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinion|first=MIchael|title=Monkey's Uncle|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-mon3.htm|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=6 December 2011|date=1 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monkey's Uncle'' is the name of a song by [[the Selecter]] on their album ''Reel to Real'' criticizing religious dogma that contradicts scientific evidence.

Chronicler [[Carlos Heitor Cony]] alleges that Mário could have been an illegitimate son of [[Machado de Assis]], since both Mário and Joaquim suffered from [[epilepsy]], while José de Alencar did not. Mário also called Machado de Assis "father" constantly in his letters addressed to him. This affair allegedly served as inspiration for Assis' famous novel ''[[Dom Casmurro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/110899/p_138.html Mário de Alencar: Machado de Assis' son?] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms '''horse race''' and '''handicapping the horse race''', have been used to describe media coverage of elections. The terms refer to any news story or article whose main focus is describing how a particular candidate or candidates is faring during the election, in other words, trying to predict the outcome. This category includes polls. There is a thin line between a horse race news story and a non horse race news story. For example, an article simply describing a candidate's economic policy is a non horse race article, but an article which is about how certain groups of voters are angry at a candidate's economic policy is a horse race article.

==Criticisms of horse race coverage==
Critics of the news media say that the vast majority of all articles during a political election are horse race style. Different criticisms have been raised as to why this is bad:

*  It is argued that news sources tend to use [[horse race journalism]] as a ploy to lure in audiences and tighten polls during election cycles by discrediting candidates favored to win and hyping [[underdog (competition)|underdogs]]
*Horse Race coverage is considered by some to actually cause voters to change their perceptions on a candidate in a sort of [[vicious cycle]], for example a poll showing a third party candidate having a low support percentage may discourage other people from voting for that person so as to avoid the [[spoiler effect]]. This effect is magnified if a particular media outlet has a biased point of view that they want to get across. One way a biased news outlet would use this technique is similar to the "some say" rhetorical device, namely by making uncited references to constituent outrage or support of some particular issue.
*Some say horse race coverage destroys coverage of the issues, because often an article is mostly about how groups reacted to a speech or other presentation of a candidate on an issue, and has little room to discuss the candidate's point of view itself.
*A horse race style of article allows for the use of [[weasel words]], that is, a subtle way of editorializing on the part of the author by focusing on the criticisms or praise of an anonymous or small group of voters
*It is argued that horse race coverage distracts voters from issues surrounding candidates by emphasizing poll results, regardless of how reliable the polls may be.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5444">{{About|normative factors favoring a belief or action|other related topics|Reasons (disambiguation)|the human faculty of reason or rationality|reason}}

A '''reason''' is a consideration which justifies or explains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reason Merriam-Webster.com] Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition of reason&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons are what people appeal to when making [[arguments]] about what people should do or believe. (Those are reasons in the '''normative''' sense.)  For example, that a doctor's patient is grimacing is a reason to believe the patient is in pain. That the patient is in pain is a reason for the doctor to do things to alleviate the pain.

In another sense of the term, reasons are explanations of why things happened. (These are reasons in the '''explanatory''' sense.)  For example, the reason the patient is in pain is that her nerves are sending signals from her tissues to her brain.

A reason, in many cases, is brought up by the question "why?", and answered following the word ''because''. Additionally, words and phrases such as ''since'', ''due to'', ''as'', ''considering'' (''that''), ''a result'' (''of''), and ''in order to'', for example, all serve as explanatory locutions that precede the reason to which they refer.

==Normative vs. explanatory reasons==
'''Normative reasons''' (i.e. ''justifying reasons'') are often said to be "considerations which count in favor" of some state of affairs (this is, at any rate, a common view, notably held by [[T. M. Scanlon]] and [[Derek Parfit]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What We Owe to Each Other|last=Scanlon|first=T.M.|date=2000-11-15|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=9780674004238|page=17|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  book|last= Parfit |first= Derek |url=http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/chang/Papers/OnWhatMatters1.pdf |format=PDF |page= |title=On What Matters (forthcoming)|publisher=Rutgers University |date=January 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331074040/http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/chang/Papers/OnWhatMatters1.pdf |archivedate=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explanatory reasons''' are considerations which serve to explain why things have happened—they are ''reasons'' events occur, or why states of affairs are the way they are. In other words, "reason" can also be a synonym for "[[cause]]". For example, a reason a car starts is that its ignition is turned. In the context of explaining the actions of beings who act for reasons (i.e., [[rational agent]]s), these are called ''motivating reasons''—e.g., the reason Bill went to college was to learn; i.e., that he would learn was his motivating reason. At least where a rational agent is acting rationally, her motivating reasons are those considerations which she believes count in favor of her so acting.{{citation needed|reason=Supporting this paragraph with the same &amp;quot;considerations which count in favor&amp;quot; phrasing used to support the previous one blurs the needed distinction and raises doubt about its validity. |date=December 2014}}

==Normative reasons==
Some philosophers (one being [[John Broome (philosopher)|John Broome]]&lt;ref&gt;Broome, John. "Reasons". In ''Reason and Value: Themes from the Moral Philosophy of Joseph Raz.'' Edited by R. Jay Wallace et al. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;) view normative reasons as the same as "explanations of ought facts". Just as explanatory reasons explain why some descriptive fact obtains (or came to obtain), normative reasons on this view explain why some normative facts obtain, i.e., they explain why some state of affairs ought to come to obtain (e.g., why someone should act or why some event ought to take place).

===Epistemic vs. practical reasons===
Philosophers, when discussing reasoning that is influenced by [[norm_(philosophy) | norms]], commonly make a distinction between ''theoretical reason'' and ''practical reason''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/practical-reason/|title=Practical Reason|last=Wallace|first=R. Jay|date=2014-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are capacities that draw on ''epistemic reasons'' (matters of fact and of explanation) or ''practical reasons'' (reasons for action) respectively.  Epistemic reasons (also called ''theoretical'' or ''evidential'' reasons) are considerations which count in favor of believing some proposition to be true.  Practical reasons are considerations which count in favor of some action or the having of some attitude (or at least, count in favor of wanting or trying to bring those actions or attitudes about).

====Epistemic reasons in argumentation====
{{Original research|section|date=January 2012}} 
In [[informal logic]], a '''reason''' consists of either a single [[premise]] or [[co-premise]]s in support of an [[argument]]. In [[Logic|formal symbolic logic]], only single premises occur. In informal reasoning, two types of reasons exist. An ''evidential reason'' is a foundation upon which to believe ''that'' or ''why'' a [[main contention|claim]] is true. An ''explanatory reason'' attempts to convince someone ''how'' something is or could be true, but does not directly convince one ''that it is'' true.

'''Shirvani Arabic''' is a variety of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] that was once spoken in what is now central and northwestern [[Azerbaijan]] (historically known as [[Shirvan]]) and [[Dagestan]] (southern [[Russia]]).

==History==
Arabic had been spoken in the region since the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim conquest]] of the [[South Caucasus]] at the beginning of the eighth century. It was brought there by Arab settlers consisting mostly of military staff, merchants and craftsmen from [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]], and was used as an official language. It experienced decline after the weakening of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Caliphate]] in the thirteenth century and was gradually replaced by [[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Tat language (Azerbaijan)|Tat]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]. Groups of Arabs (mostly from [[Yemen]]) continued to immigrate to southern Dagestan influencing the culture and literary traditions of the local population who had already become [[Islamization|Islamized]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih6b9iupT6oC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;ots=4zJYgx7ilz&amp;dq=Anna+Zelkina&amp;sig=bJc3Du4qtncsoaY9T2MWkkYK6ag Anna Zelkina. ''The Arabic Linguistic and Cultural Tradition in Dagestan: an Historical Overview'']. ''Arabic as a Minority Language'' by Jonathan Owens (ed.). Walter de Gruyter Publ. Berlin: 2000. {{ISBN|3-11-016578-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest documentation of the existence of Shirvani Arabic is attributed to the Azeri historian [[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov]] who mentioned in his 1840 historical work ''Golestan-i Iram'' that "to this day a group of Shirvan Arabs speaks an altered version of Arabic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus2/Bakihanov/framevved.htm Golestan-i Iram] by [[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov]]. Translated by [[Ziya Bunyadov]]. Baku: 1991, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic continued to be spoken in Dagestan until the 1920s mostly by upper-class feudals as a second or third language, as well as a language of literature, politics and written communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/ivl/vl6/vl6-4322.htm Literatures of the North Caucasus and Dagestan] by L.G. Golubeva ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|[[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] resentment of the [[Russians]] for robbing them of their national history is doubled for the Daghestanis by the forced loss of their [[Arabic language|Arabic]] patrimony. In the nineteenth century, it was considered that the best [[Modern Standard Arabic|literary Arabic]] was spoken in the mountains of [[Daghestan]]. Daghestani [[Arabist]] scholars were famous, attracting students from the whole Muslim world. The ''lingua franca'' in Daghestan before the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]] was [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]]. Then, in the 1920s and 1930s, the main thrust of the [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1928–1941)|anti-religious campaign]], was to eradicate Arabic, a religious language, and replace it with Russian. The finest flower of Arabist scholarship disappeared in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purges]].|Bryan, p. 210&lt;ref name=CHC2&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryan|first=Fanny.

&lt;!-- Commented out 2013-09-27: This is inaccurate and contradicts other articles as well as current linguistic consensus. Slavic developed as part of Balto-Slavic for a while first, then split off, and only then the rapid changes started.

Once it split off from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], the proto-Slavic period probably encompassed a period of stability lasting 2000 years.  Following this period of stability, a small period of time—only several centuries—of rapid change occurred before the breakup of Slavic linguistic unity. Slavic migrations in the early sixth century are the most likely catalyst of subsequent dialectal differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Wijk|1956|pp=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lehr-Spławiński|1957|pp=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proto-Slavic and its development into today's [[Slavic languages]] have been reconstructed using the [[comparative method]] (which has also been used to reconstruct its mother tongue, Proto-Indo-European).--&gt;

The following list is a comparison of basic Proto-'''Slavic vocabulary''' and the corresponding reflexes in the modern languages, for assistance in understanding the discussion in [[Proto-Slavic]] and [[History of the Slavic languages]].  The word list is based on the [[Swadesh list|Swadesh word list]], developed by the linguist [[Morris Swadesh]], a tool to study the evolution of languages via comparison, containing a set of 207 basic words which can be found in every language and are rarely borrowed. However, the words given as the modern versions are ''not'' necessarily the normal words with the given meaning in the various modern languages, but the words directly descended from the corresponding Proto-Slavic word (the ''reflex''). The list here is given both in the orthography of each language, with accent marks added as necessary to aid in pronunciation and Proto-Slavic reconstruction. See below for a capsule summary of how to pronounce each language, as well as some discussion of the conventions used.

== Conventions in the table ==
* Common Slavic accents follow Serbo-Croatian conventions: ''á'' (long rising), ''à'' (short rising), ''â'' (long falling), ''ȁ'' (short falling), ''ā'' (length in unstressed syllable). The Late Common Slavic [[neoacute]] is indicated as ''ã''. This was pronounced as short rising in ь̃ ъ̃; long rising in ẽ õ in most languages, but short rising in Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian; and consistently long rising over other vowels.
*The accent pattern (a, b or c) of Common Slavic nouns, verbs and adjectives is indicated. These patterns are as follows: a = consistent root accent; b = predominant suffix accent; c = mobile accent.
*Nouns are given in the nominative singular; a form in parentheses is genitive singular except as indicated (''acc.'' = accusative singular, ''pl.'' = nominative plural).
*Verbs are given in the infinitive (but the first singular present in Bulgarian, which has no infinitives). A form in parentheses is first singular present except as indicated (''2sg.'' = second singular, ''3sg.'' = third singular). A second form in parentheses is third singular present.
*When multiple forms of an adjective are given, the order is masculine, feminine, neuter.
*[[Chakavian]] forms are given in the Vrgada dialect except as indicated (''Novi'' = Novi dialect, ''Orb.'' = Orbanići dialect).

== Transcription of Russian and Bulgarian ==
Transcription of Bulgarian follows the standard conventions for academic [[transliteration of Cyrillic]], with the exception that Cyrillic ъ is represented as ''ǝ'' instead of ''ă'' for ease of reading, particularly when combined with a stress mark (''ǝ́'' instead of ''ắ''). This is a one-to-one [[transliteration]] that directly represents the spelling of Cyrillic. This transliteration also represents Bulgarian phonology quite well (unlike the situation in Russian).

Transcription of Russian is based on the same standard, but deviates from it in order to consistently represent palatalization (always written with a following apostrophe, e.g. ''l', n', t', v''') and the phoneme /j/ (always written ''j''), both of which are spelled in multiple ways in Cyrillic. The following indicates how to convert between the two:
{|class="wikitable"
! Cyrillic letters !! Letter class !! Academic transliteration !! This article's transcription
|-
! а э ы о у !! Non-palatal vowels
| ''a è y o u'' || ''a e y o u''
|-
! я е и ё ю !! Palatal vowels
| ''ja e i ë ju'' || If following a consonant letter, ''a e i o u'' with preceding apostrophe (''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''); elsewhere, ''ja je ji jo ju''.
|-
! й ў !! Semivowels
| ''j ŭ'' || same
|-
! ь !! Soft sign
| ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' || same
|-
! ъ !! Hard sign
| ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' || not written
|-
! щ !! A consonant sign
| ''šč'' || ''šš'''
|}

The result is that this article's transcription is almost directly phonemic, making it significantly easier for readers not familiar with the complications of Cyrillic spelling. Note that the transcription used here continues the standard practice of representing the Cyrillic letters ы и as ''y i'', although they are normally considered [[allophone]]s of each other.  This is because the pronunciation of the two letters is significantly different, and Russian ы normally continues Common Slavic *y {{IPA|[ɨ]}}, which was a separate phoneme.

The letter щ is conventionally written ''št'' in Bulgarian, ''šč'' in Russian. This article writes ''šš''' in Russian to reflect the modern pronunciation {{IPA|[ɕɕ]}}.

Both transcriptions indicate stress with an acute accent (á é í ó ú ý ǝ́). Stress is indicated in Cyrillic in the same fashion, except with the letter ё, which is always stressed.

== Pronunciation ==

===Capsule summary of Russian pronunciation===

The transcription used in this article is [[morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] rather than strictly phonemic, i.e. it writes the underlying phonemes rather than the phonemes actually heard when pronounced. The difference occurs particularly in the representation of unstressed vowels, where multiple underlying phonemes merge. For example, underlying ''e'' and ''i'' merge into the same sound when unstressed, but the difference is revealed in related forms based on the same root: e.g. ''z'eml'á'' {{IPA|[zʲɪmˈlʲæ]}} "land" has accusative ''z'éml'u'' {{IPA|[ˈzʲemlʲʉ]}}, but ''z'imá'' {{IPA|[zʲɪˈma]}} "winter" has accusative ''z'ímu'' {{IPA|[ˈzʲimu]}}. When the transcription (which is derived from the spelling) disagrees with the actual morphophonemic pronunciation, the latter is indicated specially, e.g. čto /što/; š'it' /šyt'/; ž'óltyj /žóltyj/; ž'ená /žená/ {{IPA|[ʐɨˈna]}}; sólnc'e /sónce/ {{IPA|[ˈsont͡sə]}}. This occurs mostly with the letters ''š, ž, c'', which are normally written palatal but pronounced non-palatal; but it is also due to occasional assimilations. Note that the rules for unstressed vowels still need to be applied (see below).

*''á, é, í'' etc. indicates stress.
* ''š'' {{IPA|[ʂ]}}, ''ž'' {{IPA|[ʐ]}} and ''c'' {{IPA|[t͡s]}} are never palatal, while ''č'' {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}} and ''šš'' {{IPA|[ɕɕ]}} are always palatal, regardless of spelling.
*''y'' {{IPA|[ɨ]}}: allophone of ''i'' [i] after non-palatal consonants, but written differently by convention. Written ''i'' sounds as ''y'' after ''š, ž, c'', regardless of whether indicated as palatal in the spelling: ''ž'it'' {{IPA|[ʐɨtʲ]}} "to live".
* Vowel mergers in unstressed syllables are extensive, but not written.
** After palatal, vowels ''a, o, e, i'' all merge as {{IPA|[ɪ]}}: ''t'až'ólyj'' {{IPA|[tʲɪˈʐolɨj]}} "heavy", ''v'el'ík'ij'' {{IPA|[vʲɪˈlʲikʲɪj]}} "big".
** After non-palatal, vowels ''a'' and ''o'' merge as {{IPA|[ɐ]}} directly before the stress and absolutely word-initially, {{IPA|[ə]}} elsewhere: ''molokó'' {{IPA|[məlɐˈko]}} "milk", ''sobáka'' {{IPA|[sɐˈbakə]}} "dog", ''č'elov'ék'' {{IPA|[t͡ɕɪlɐˈvʲek]}} "man (human)".
** After non-palatal, vowels ''e'' and ''i/y'' merge as {{IPA|[ɨ]}}: ''ž'ená'' {{IPA|[ʐɨˈna]}}.
** Exception: Absolutely word-finally after a palatal, ''e, i'' merge as {{IPA|[ɪ]}} but ''a, o'' merge as {{IPA|[ə]}}: ''s'ém'a'' {{IPA|[ˈsʲemʲə]}} "seed".
* Obstruents are devoiced word-finally, and agree in voicing in a cluster before another obstruent: ''muž'' {{IPA|[muʂ]}} "husband", ''vs'o'' {{IPA|[fsʲɵ]}} "everything", ''vokzál'' {{IPA|[vɐɡˈzal]}} "railway station". But ''v'' does not trigger voicing of preceding obstruent, nor is it devoiced.
* The reflexive suffix ''-s'a'' and reflexive infinitive ''-t'-s'a'' are pronounced without palatalization, i.e. as if written ''-sa'' and ''-t-sa''.

===Capsule summary of Bulgarian pronunciation===

*''á, é, í'' etc. indicates stress.
*Stressed ''ǝ'' is actually {{IPA|[ɤ]}}; unstressed ''a'' and ''ǝ'' tend to merge as {{IPA|[ɐ]}}.
*Obstruent voicing/devoicing as in Russian.

===Capsule summary of Czech pronunciation===

*''á, é, í'' etc. indicates vowel length.
*''ů'' {{IPA|[uː]}} &lt; ''*ó''. ''ou'' {{IPA|[oʊ̯]}} &lt; ''*ú''.
*''h'' {{IPA|[ɦ]}}, ''ch'' {{IPA|[x]}}.
*''č'' {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, ''š'' {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, ''ž'' {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, ''ř'' {{IPA|[r̝]}} (a palatal [[Alveolar trill#Voiced alveolar raised non-sonorant trill|fricative trill]], sounding a bit like {{IPA|[rʑ]}}).
*''ď'' {{IPA|[ɟ]}}, ''ť'' {{IPA|[c]}}, ''ň'' {{IPA|[ɲ]}}. Also indicated by ''d, t, n'' before ''i'', ''í'' or ''ě''.
*''y'' = ''i'' but indicates normal rather than palatal pronunciation after ''d t n''.
*''ě'' = short ''e'' but signals palatal nature of previous consonant: ''dě, tě, ně'' = ''ďe, ťe, ňe''; ''vě, fě, bě, pě'' = ''vje, fje, bje, pje''; ''mě'' = ''mňe''.
*Obstruent voicing/devoicing as in Russian. ''ř'' after obstruent is itself devoiced rather than trigger voicing: přímý {{IPA|[pr̝̊iːmiː]}} "straight".

===Capsule summary of Slovak pronunciation===
{{empty section|date=June 2017}}

===Capsule summary of Polish pronunciation===

*Retroflex consonants: ''sz'' {{IPA|[ʂ]}}, ''cz'' {{IPA|[t͡ʂ]}}, ''ż'' {{IPA|[ʐ]}}, ''rz'' {{IPA|[ʐ]}} &lt; ''*ř'' (as in Czech), ''dż'' {{IPA|[d͡ʐ]}}.
*Alveolopalatal consonants: ''ś'' or ''si'' {{IPA|[ɕ]}}, ''ć'' or ''ci'' {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}}, ''ź'' or ''zi'' {{IPA|[ʑ]}}, ''dź'' or ''dzi'' {{IPA|[d͡ʑ]}}, ''ń'' or ''ni'' {{IPA|[ɲ]}}.
*All consonants are palatalized before ''i''. Note that alveolar ''s'', ''z'', ''n'' become [[alveolopalatal]] when palatalized, absorbing the ''i'' before another vowel: ''chodzić'' {{IPA|[ˈxɔd͡ʑit͡ɕ]}} "to walk", ''siedzieć'' {{IPA|[ˈɕɛd͡ʑɛt͡ɕ]}} "to sit".
*''h'' or ''ch'' {{IPA|[x]}}, ''w'' {{IPA|[v]}}, ''ł'' {{IPA|[w]}}.
*''y'' {{IPA|[ɨ]}}, ''ó'' {{IPA|[u]}} &lt; ''*oː'', ''ę'' {{IPA|[ɛ̃]}}, ''ą'' {{IPA|[ɔ̃]}}.
*Obstruent voicing/devoicing as in Russian and Czech. However, ''w'' and ''rz'' do not voice a preceding voiceless obstruent, but instead are devoiced: ''kwiat'' {{IPA|[kfʲat]}} "flower", ''przyjść'' {{IPA|[pʂɨjɕt͡ɕ]}} "to come" &lt; ''*prʲijtʲ'' (cf. Russian ''pr'ijt'í'').

===Capsule summary of Serbo-Croatian pronunciation===

* Accents: ''á'' (long rising), ''à'' (short rising), ''â'' (long falling), ''ȁ'' (short falling), ''ā'' (length in unstressed syllable), ''ã'' (long rising in Chakavian dialect = Common Slavic neoacute).
* ''š'' {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, ''č'' {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, ''ž'' {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, ''dž'' {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, ''ć'' {{IPA|[tɕ]}}, ''đ'' {{IPA|[dʑ]}}, ''nj'' {{IPA|[ɲ]}}, ''lj'' {{IPA|[ʎ]}}.
*Russian-style obstruent voicing/devoicing does not occur.

==Dialectal differentiation==
After the three palatalizations of Proto-Slavic, dialectal variation became more apparent. Some dialects (such as Proto-East Slavic), applied the second regressive palatalization across an intervening *v.&lt;ref name="harvcoltxt|Channon|1971|p=9"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Channon|1971|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[Russian language|Russian]]: *gwojzda &gt; *gwězda &gt; zvězda &gt; {{IPA|[zʲvʲɪˈzda]}} ('star')
*[[Polish language|Polish]]: *gwojzda &gt; *gwězda &gt; gwiazda &gt; {{IPA|[ˈɡvʲazda]}} ('star')
Also, the realization of the palatalizations' sibilants varied a little amongst dialects.  {{harvcoltxt|Belić|1921}} argues that the phonetic character of the palatalizations was uniform throughout Common Slavic and that West Slavic languages developed *š later on by [[Analogy#Linguistics|analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Belić|1921|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In all dialects (except for Lechitic), {{IPA|[dz]}} was deaffricated to {{IPA|[z]}}:&lt;ref name="harvcoltxt|Channon|1971|p=9"/&gt;
*[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: *zvizda&gt; z'vizda; and zyrka/z'irka&gt; Cf. Pol.: gwiazda-&gt; GV/ZV + I + ZD; Z'/Z + Y/I + R + K +A ( zIr &gt; vision).

The final cutoff point for the Proto-Slavic period was the change of *ě to *a after palatal consonants and *j, which then created *ča/*ka contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Channon|1971|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, and the shortening and elision of weak [[yer]]s (*ь/ĭ and *ъ/ŭ) (see [[Havlík's law]]) that created newly formed closed syllables&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bethin|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ended the period of syllabic synharmony characteristic of  Common Slavic.

For many Common Slavic dialects—including most of West Slavic, all but the northernmost portions of East Slavic, and some western parts of South Slavic— *g lenited from a [[voiced velar plosive]] to a [[voiced velar fricative]] ({{IPA|[ɡ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɣ]}}).  Because this change was not universal and because it did not occur in a number of East Slavic dialects (such as Belarusian and South Russian) until after the application of Havlík's law, {{Harvcoltxt|Shevelov|1977}} calls into question early projections of this change and postulates three independent instigations of lenition, dating the earliest to before 900 AD and the latest to the early thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shevelov|1977|pp=137, 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the reflexes for the nasal vowels *ę and *ǫ differ so widely, it's very likely that their phonetic value in Late Proto-Slavic was not uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schenkdar|2002|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31401">'''Speech production''' is the process by which thoughts are translated into speech. This includes the selection of [[word]]s, the organization of relevant [[Grammar|grammatical]] forms, and then the articulation of the resulting sounds by the [[motor system]] using the [[vocal apparatus]]. Speech production can be spontaneous such as when a person creates the words of a [[conversation]], reactive such as when they name a picture or [[reading (process)|read]] aloud a [[writing|written word]], or imitative, such as in [[speech repetition]]. Speech production is not the same as [[language production]] since [[language]] can also be produced manually by [[sign language|sign]]s.

In ordinary fluent [[conversation]] people pronounce roughly four [[syllables]], ten or twelve [[phoneme]]s and two to three words out of their [[vocabulary]] (that can contain 10 to 100 thousand words) each second.&lt;ref name="Levelt99"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~rmk7/HC/HC_Readings/Levelt.pdf |pmid=10354575|year=1999|last1=Levelt|first1=WJ|title=Models of word production.|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in speech production are relatively rare occurring at a rate of about once in every 900 words in spontaneous speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garnham, A, Shillcock RC, Brown GDA, Mill AID, Culter A|year=1981|url=http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/15615/1/6017.pdf|title= Slips of the tongue in the London–Lund corpus of spontaneous conversation|journal=Linguistics |volume=19|pages=805–817|doi=10.1515/ling.1981.19.7-8.805|issue=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words that are [[Frequency list|commonly spoken]] or learned early in life or easily imagined are quicker to say than ones that are rarely said, learnt later in life, or are abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Oldfield  RC, Wingfield  A |year=1965|title=Response latencies in naming objects|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=17|pages=273–281|doi=10.1080/17470216508416445|pmid=5852918|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/33/1/73.full.pdf|pmid=11296722|year=2001|last1=Bird|first1=H|last2=Franklin|first2=S|last3=Howard|first3=D|title=Age of acquisition and imageability ratings for a large set of words, including verbs and function words|volume=33|issue=1|pages=73–9|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers|doi=10.3758/BF03195349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally speech is created with pulmonary pressure provided by the [[lung]]s that generates sound by [[phonation]] through the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]] that then is modified by the [[vocal tract]] into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However speech production can occur without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]] by using the upper parts of the vocal tract. An example of such alaryngeal speech is [[Donald Duck talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=5163900|year=1971|last1=Weinberg|first1=B|last2=Westerhouse|first2=J|title=A study of buccal speech|volume=14|issue=3|pages=652–8|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Research|bibcode=1972ASAJ...51Q..91W|doi=10.1121/1.1981697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocal production of speech may be associated with the production of hand [[gestures]] that act to enhance the comprehensibility of what is being said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McNeill D|year=2005|title=Gesture and Thought|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-51463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of speech production throughout an individual's life starts from an infant's first babble and is transformed into fully developed speech by the age of five.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"&gt;Harley, T.A. (2011), Psycholinguistics. (Volume 1). SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of speech doesn't occur until around age one (holophrastic phase). Between the ages of one and a half and two and a half the infant can produce short sentences (telegraphic phase). After two and a half years the infant develops systems of [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]]s used in speech production. Around four or five the child's lemmas are largely increased, this enhances the child's production of correct speech and they can now produce speech like an adult. An adult now develops speech in four stages: Activation of lexical concepts, select lemmas needed, [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] and [[phonologically]] encode speech, and the word is phonetically encoded.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt;

==Three stages==
The production of [[spoken language]] involves three major levels of processing: conceptualization, formulation, and articulation.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levelt89"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levelt | first = WJM | year = 1989 | title = Speaking: From Intention to Articulation | publisher = MIT Press | isbn = 978-0-262-62089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jescheniak"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jescheniak | first1 = JD | last2 = Levelt | first2 = WJM | year = 1994 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.133.3919 | title = Word frequency effects in speech production: retrieval of syntactic information and of phonological form | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | pages = 824–843 | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.20.4.824 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first is the processes of [[conceptualization]] or conceptual preparation, in which the intention  to create speech links a desired concept to the particular spoken words to be expressed. Here the preverbal intended messages are formulated that specify the concepts to be expressed.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition"&gt;Levelt, W. (1999). "The neurocognition of language", p.87 -117. Oxford Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The second stage is formulation in which the linguistic form required for the expression of the desired message is created. Formulation includes grammatical encoding, morpho-phonological encoding, and phonetic encoding.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt; Grammatical encoding is the process of selecting the appropriate syntactic word or [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]]. The selected lemma then activates the appropriate [[Syntax|syntactic]] frame for the conceptualized message. Morpho-phonological encoding is the process of breaking words down into syllables to be produced in overt speech. Syllabification is dependent on the preceding and proceeding words, for instance:
''I-com-pre-hend'' vs. ''I-com-pre-hen-dit''.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;
The final part of the formulation stage is phonetic encoding. This involves the activation of [[articulatory gestures]] dependent on the syllables selected in the morpho-phonological process, creating an articulatory score as the utterance is pieced together and the order of movements of the [[vocal apparatus]] is completed.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;

The third stage of speech production is articulation, which is the execution of the articulatory score by the lungs, glottis, larynx, [[tongue]], [[lips]], [[jaw]] and other parts of the vocal apparatus resulting in speech.&lt;ref name="Levelt89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;
[[File:Blausen 0215 CerebralHemispheres.png|thumb|141x141px|For right handed people, the majority of speech production activity occurs in the left cerebral hemisphere.]]

==Neuroscience==

The [[motor control]] for speech production in [[right handed|right handed people]] depends mostly upon areas in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]]. These areas include the bilateral [[supplementary motor area]], the left posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]], the left [[Insular cortex|insula]], the left [[primary motor cortex]] and [[temporal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2002.06.001|pmid=15037128|year=2004|last1=Indefrey|first1=P|last2=Levelt|first2=WJ|title=The spatial and temporal signatures of word production components|volume=92|issue=1–2|pages=101–44|journal=Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also subcortical areas involved such as the [[basal ganglia]] and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17189619|year=2007|last1=Booth|first1=JR|last2=Wood|first2=L|last3=Lu|first3=D|last4=Houk|first4=JC|last5=Bitan|first5=T|title=The role of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in language processing|volume=1133|issue=1|pages=136–44|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.11.074|pmc=2424405|journal=Brain Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ackermann"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 18471906|year= 2008|last1= Ackermann|first1= H|title= Cerebellar contributions to speech production and speech perception: psycholinguistic and neurobiological perspectives|volume= 31|issue= 6|pages= 265–72|doi= 10.1016/j.tins.2008.02.011|journal= Trends in Neurosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum aids the sequencing of speech syllables into fast, smooth and rhythmically organized words and longer utterances.&lt;ref name="Ackermann" /&gt;

==History of speech production research==
[[File:Speecherrorchart2.png|thumb|608x608px|Examples of speech errors. The target is what the speaker intended to say. The error is what the speaker actually said. These mistakes have been studied to learn about the structure of speech production.]]
Until the late 1960s research on speech was focused on comprehension. As researchers collected greater volumes of [[speech error]] data, they began to investigate the psychological processes responsible for the production of speech sounds and to contemplate possible processes for fluent speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Bernstein|first2=Nan|title=Speech Production Processing Models|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|isbn=0155041061|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from speech error research were soon incorporated into speech production models. Evidence from speech error data supports the following conclusions about speech production.

Some of these ideas include:

# Speech is planned in advance.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstien Ratner|first2=Nan|title=Chapter 7 Speech Production|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|isbn=0155041061|pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[lexicon]] is organized both semantically and phonologically.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; That is by meaning, and by the sound of the words.
# [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphologically]] complex words are assembled.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; Words that we produce that contain morphemes are put together during the speech production process. [[Morpheme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are the smallest units of language that contain meaning. For example, "ed" on a past tense word.
# [[Affix]]es and  functors behave differently from context words in slips of the tongue.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; This means the rules about the ways in which a word can be used are likely stored with them, which means generally when speech errors are made, the mistake words maintain their functions and make grammatical sense.
# [[Speech error]]s reflect rule knowledge.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; Even in our mistakes, speech is not nonsensical. The words and sentences that are produced in speech errors are typically grammatical, and do not violate the rules of the language being spoken.

== Aspects of speech production models ==
Models of speech production must contain specific elements to be viable. These include the elements from which speech is composed, listed below. The accepted models of speech production discussed in more detail below all incorporate these stages either explicitly or implicitly, and the ones that are now outdated or disputed have been criticized for overlooking one or more of the following stages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=John|title=Psycholinguistics|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415258901|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attributes of accepted speech models are:

a) a conceptual stage where the speaker abstractly identifies what they wish to express.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

b) a syntactic stage where a frame is chosen that words will be placed into, this frame is usually [[Syntax|sentence structure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

c) a lexical stage where a search for a word occurs based on meaning. Once the word is selected and retrieved, information about it becomes available to the speaker involving [[phonology]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

d) a phonological stage where the abstract information is converted into a speech like form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

e) a [[Phonetics|phonetic]] stage where instructions are prepared to be sent to the [[Vocal muscle|muscles of articulation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Also, models must allow for forward planning mechanisms, a buffer, and a monitoring mechanism.

Following are a few of the influential models of speech production that account for or incorporate the previously mentioned stages and include information discovered as a result of speech error studies and other disfluency data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstein|first2=Nan|title=Speech Production Processing Models|isbn=0155041061|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Tip of the tongue|tip-of-the-tongue]] research.

==Models==

===The Utterance Generator Model (1971)===

The Utterance Generator Model was proposed by Fromkin (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Bernstein Ratner|first2=Nan|title=Chapter 7 Speech Production|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers|location=Florida|isbn=0155041061|pages=328–337|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of six stages and was an attempt to account for the previous findings of speech error research. The stages of the Utterance Generator Model were based on possible changes in representations of a particular utterance. The first stage is where a person generates the meaning they wish to convey. The second stage involves the message being translated onto a syntactic structure. Here, the message is given an outline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|title=Utterance Generator Model of Speech Production in Psycho-linguistics|date=1971|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=0155041061|page=328|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third stage proposed by Fromkin is where/when the message gains different stresses and intonations based on the meaning. The fourth stage Fromkin suggested  is concerned with the selection of words from the [[lexicon]]. After the words have been selected in Stage 4, the message undergoes phonological specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|title=Utterance Generator Model of Speech Production in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt|page=330|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth stage applies rules of pronunciation and produces syllables that are to be outputted. The sixth and final stage of Fromkin's Utterance Generator Model is the coordination of the motor commands necessary for speech. Here, phonetic features of the message are sent to the relevant muscles of the vocal tract so that the intended message can be produced. Despite the ingenuity of Fromkin's model, researchers  have criticized this interpretation of speech production. Although The Utterance Generator Model accounts for many nuances and data found by speech error studies, researchers decided it still had room to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|title=The Garrett Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt College|isbn=0155041061|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butterworth|title=Psycho-linguistics|date=1982|publisher=Harcourt College|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garrett model (1975)===

A more recent (than Fromkin's) attempt to explain speech production was published by Garrett in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstein|first2=Nan|title=The Garret Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt College|isbn=0155041061|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett also created this model by compiling speech error data and there are many overlaps between this model and the Fromkin model off which it was based, but he did add a few things to the Fromkin model that filled some of the gaps being pointed out by other researchers. The Garrett Model and the Fromkin model both distinguish between three levels—a conceptual level, and sentence level, and a motor level. These three levels are common to contemporary understanding of Speech Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|last2=Fromkin|first2=V.A.|last3=Ratner|first3=N.B|title=The Garrett Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt College|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moraghfigure4.png|thumb|240x240px|This is an interpretation of the Dell's model. The  words at the top represent the semantic category. The second level represents the words that describe the semantic category. And, the third level represents the phonemes ( syllabic information including onset, vowels, and codas).]]

===Dell's model (1994)===

In 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production - Wikiversity|url = https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics/Models_of_Speech_Production|website = en.wikiversity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell proposed a model of the lexical network that became fundamental in the understanding of the way speech is produced.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt; This model of the lexical network attempts to symbolically represent the lexicon, and in turn, explain how people choose the words they wish to produce, and how those words are to be organized into speech. Dell's model was composed of three stages, semantics, words, and phonemes. The  words in the highest stage of the model represent the semantic category. (In the image, the words representing semantic category are winter, footwear, feet, and snow represent the semantic categories of boot and skate.) The second level represents the words that describe the semantic category (In the image, boot and skate). And, the third level represents the phonemes ( [[Syllable|syllabic information]] including [[Onset (linguistics)|onset]], vowels, and codas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Analysis of Sentence Production|last = Dell|first = G.S.|date = 1997|journal = Psychology of Learning and Motivation|doi = 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60270-4|pmid = |pages=133–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levelt model (1999) ===

Levelt further refined the lexical network proposed by Dell. Through the use of speech error data, Levelt recreated the three levels in Dell's model. The conceptual stratum, the top and most abstract level, contains information a person has about ideas of particular concepts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=d6b00eb6-6f33-46fd-9144-85377e4868eb%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=126&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=000080761300003&amp;db=edswsc|title = Models of Word Production|last = Levelt|first = Willem J.M|date = 1999|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01319-4|pmid = 10354575|access-date = 25 October 2015|volume=3|pages=223–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptual stratum also contains ideas about how concepts relate to each other. This is where word selection would occur, a person would choose which words they wish to express. The next, or middle level, the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]]-stratum, contains information about the syntactic functions of individual words including [[Tense (grammar)|tense]] and function.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt;  This level functions to maintain syntax and place words correctly into sentence structure that makes sense to the speaker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The lowest and final level is the form stratum which, similarly to the Dell Model, contains syllabic information. From here, the information stored at the form stratum level is sent to the motor cortex where the vocal apparatus are coordinated to physically produce speech sounds.

==Places of articulation==
{{main|Place of articulation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Human vocal apparatus used to produce speech|left|168x168px]]
The physical structure of the human nose, throat, and vocal cords allows for the productions of many unique sounds, these areas can be further broken down into [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]]. Different sounds are produced in different areas, and with different muscles and breathing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Consonantal Place of Articulation|last = Keren, Rice|publisher = John Wily &amp; Sons Inc.|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-4443-3526-2|location = |pages = 519–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our ability to utilize these skills to create the various sounds needed to communicate effectively is essential to our speech production. Speech is a psychomotor activity. Speech between two people is a [[conversation]] - they can be casual, formal, factual, or transactional, and the language structure/ narrative genre employed differs depending upon the context. Affect is a significant factor that  controls speech, manifestations that disrupt memory in language use due to affect include feelings of tension, states of apprehension, as well as physical signs like nausea. Language level manifestations that affect brings could be observed with the speaker's hesitations, repetitions, false starts, incompletion, syntactic blends, etc. Difficulties in [[manner of articulation]] can contribute to speech difficulties and [[Speech impediment|impediments]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speech Disorders : Causes, Treatments, and Social Effects|last = Harrison|first = Allen. E|publisher = Nova Science Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 9781608762132|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that infants are capable of making the entire spectrum of possible vowel and consonant sounds. [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] has created a system for understanding and categorizing all possible speech sounds, which includes information about the way in which the sound is produced, and where the sounds is produced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is extremely useful in the understanding of speech production because speech can be transcribed based on sounds rather than spelling, which may be misleading depending on the language being spoken. Average speaking rates are in the 120 to 150 words per minute (wpm) range, and same is the recommended guidelines for recording audiobooks. As people grow accustomed to a particular language they are prone to lose not only the ability to produce certain speech sounds, but also to distinguish between these sounds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Articulation===
Articulation, often associated with speech production, is the term used to describe how people physically produced speech sounds. For people who speak fluently, articulation is automatic and allows 15 speech sounds to be produced per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=John|title=Psycholinguistics The Key Concepts|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415258901|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effective articulation of speech include the following elements – fluency, complexity, accuracy, and comprehensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rebecca Hughes|author2=Beatrice Szczepek Reed|title=Teaching and Researching Speaking: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cC4lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-43299-9|pages=6+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Fluency: Is the ability to communicate an intended message, or to affect the listener in the way that is intended by the speaker. While accurate use of language is a component in this ability, over-attention to accuracy may actually inhibit the development of fluency. Fluency involves constructing coherent utterances and stretches of speech, to respond and to speak without undue hesitation (limited use of fillers such as uh, er, eh, like, you know). It also involves the ability to use strategies such as simplification and gestures to aid communication. Fluency involves use of relevant information, appropriate vocabulary and [[syntax]].  

*Complexity: Speech where the message is communicated precisely. Ability to adjust the message or negotiate the control of conversation according to the responses of the listener, and use subordination and clausal forms appropriate per the roles and relationship between the speakers. It includes the use of sociolinguistic knowledge – the skills required to communicate effectively across cultures; the norms, the knowledge of what is appropriate to say in what situations and to whom.

*Accuracy: This refers to the use of proper and advanced grammar; subject-verb agreement; word order; and word form (excited/exciting), as well as appropriate word choice in spoken language. It is also the ability to self-correct during discourse, to clarify or modify spoken language for grammatical accuracy.

*Comprehensibility: This is the ability to be understood by others, it is related with the sound of the language.  There are three components that influence one’s comprehensibility and they are: ''Pronunciation'' – saying the sounds of words correctly; ''Intonation'' – applying proper stress on words and syllables, using rising and falling pitch to indicate questions or statements, using voice to indicate emotion or emphasis, speaking with an appropriate rhythm; and ''Enunciation'' – speaking clearly at an appropriate pace, with effective articulation of words and phrases and appropriate volume.

==Development==
{{main|Language acquisition}}
Before even producing a sound, infants imitate facial expressions and movements.&lt;ref name="Redford, M. A. 2015"&gt;Redford, M. A. (2015). The handbook of speech production. Chichester, West Sussex ; Malden, MA : John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 7 months of age, infants start to experiment with communicative sounds by trying to coordinate producing sound with opening and closing their mouths.

Until the first year of life infants cannot produce coherent words, instead they produce a reoccurring [[babbling]] sound. Babbling allows the infant to experiment with articulating sounds without having to attend to meaning. This repeated babbling starts the initial production of speech. Babbling works with [[object permanence]] and understanding of location to support the networks of our first [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] items or words.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; The infant’s vocabulary growth increases substantially when they are able to understand that objects exist even when they are not present.

The first stage of meaningful speech does not occur until around the age of one. This stage is the holophrastic phase.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. 2005"&gt;Shaffer, D., Wood, E., &amp; Willoughby, T. (2005). Developmental Psychology Childhood and Adolescence. (2nd Canadian Ed). Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt; The holistic stage refers to when infant speech consists of one word at a time (i.e. papa).

The next stage is the telegraphic phase. In this stage infants can form short sentences (i.e., Daddy sit, or Mommy drink). This typically occurs between the ages of one and a half and two and a half years old. This stage is particularly noteworthy because of the explosive growth of their [[lexicon]]. During this stage, infants must select and match stored representations of words to the specific perceptual target word in order to convey meaning or concepts.&lt;ref name="Redford, M. A. 2015"/&gt; With enough vocabulary, infants begin to extract sound patterns, and they learn to break down words into [[phonological]] segments, increasing further the number of words they can learn.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; At this point in an infant's development of speech their lexicon consists of 200 words or more and they are able to understand even more than they can speak.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. 2005"/&gt;
 
When they reach two and a half years their speech production becomes increasingly complex, particularly in its semantic structure. With a more detailed [[semantic network]] the infant learns to express a wider range of meanings, helping the infant develop a complex conceptual system of [[lemma (psycholinguistics)|lemma]]s.

Around the age of four or five the child lemmas have a wide range of diversity, this helps them select the right lemma needed to produce correct speech.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; Reading to infants enhances their lexicon. At this age, children who have been read to and are exposed to more uncommon and complex words have 32 million more words than a child who is [[linguistically]] impoverished.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, M. (2005). Proust and the squid:The story and science of the reading brain, New York, NY. Harper&lt;/ref&gt; At this age the child should be able to speak in full complete sentences, similar to an adult.

'''Teófilo Odorico Dias de Mesquita''' (November 8, 1854 – March 29, 1889) was a [[Brazil]]ian poet, journalist and lawyer, nephew of the famous [[Romanticism|Romantic]] author [[Gonçalves Dias]].

He is the patron of the 36th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

The literary critic [[Alfredo Bosi]] considers his 1882 work ''Fanfarras'' to have launched the [[Parnassian]] movement in [[Brazilian literature]].{{sfn|Bosi|2015|p=233}}

==Life==

[[File:Teophilo Dias.jpg|thumb|left|Teófilo Dias.]]

Teófilo Dias was born in 1854, to Odorico Antônio de Mesquita and Joana Angélica Dias de Mesquita (who was the sister of poet [[Gonçalves Dias]]). His initial schooling happened in [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]], at the Instituto de Humanidades.

Moving to [[Rio de Janeiro]], he was lodged in a convent for two years (1875–1876) and prepared to ingress at a [[Law]] course. In Rio, he met many influential people, such as [[Alberto de Oliveira]], [[Artur de Oliveira]], [[Aluísio Azevedo]], [[Benjamin Constant Botelho de Magalhães]], [[José do Patrocínio]] and [[Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis]].

In 1881, he finished the Law course at the [[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo]]. As a journalist, he wrote for the newspapers ''A Província de São Paulo'', ''A República'' and [[José Veríssimo]]'s ''Revista Brasileira''.

He was also a teacher of Philosophic Grammar and [[French language|French]] in Colégio Aquino.

He married Gabriela Frederica Ribeiro de Andrada, a daughter of [[Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada]], the brother of famous statesman [[José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva]]. He had with her two children.

He became a deputy in 1885, remaining in the post until the following year.

He died in 1889.

[[File:Rudi Dutschke (1976).jpg|thumb|right|Rudi Dutschke]]
[[File:Long march Mao.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mao Tse-tung|Mao]] on the Chinese Red Army's [[Long March]]]]

'''The long march through the institutions''' ({{lang-de|der lange Marsch durch die Institutionen}}) is a slogan coined by student activist [[Rudi Dutschke]] to describe his strategy for establishing the conditions for revolution: subverting society by infiltrating institutions such as the professions.  The phrase "long march" is a reference to the prolonged struggle of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]], which included a physical [[Long March]] of their army across China.{{sfn|Kimball|2001|p=15}}

==Influences==
The main influence on Dutschke's thinking is commonly thought to be the work of Italian communist [[Antonio Gramsci]] who, while imprisoned by [[Mussolini]], wrote about [[cultural hegemony]] and the need for a "war of position" to establish the conditions for a revolutionary "war of manoeuvre".{{sfn|Davidson|2006|p=261}}  Degroot also identifies [[Ernst Bloch]] as a major influence.{{sfn|Degroot|2014|p=110}}  Bloch met Dutschke at [[Bad Boll]] in 1968 and admired his integrity and determination – qualities which he had written about in [[The Principle of Hope|''Das Prinzip Hoffnung'' (The Principle of Hope)]] as being essential for the achievement of [[utopia]].{{sfn|Degroot|2014|p=110}}
 
[[Herbert Marcuse]] corresponded with Dutschke in 1971 to agree with this strategy, "Let me tell you this: that I regard your notion of the 'long march through the institutions' as the only effective way..."{{sfn|Marcuse|2014|p=336}}  In his 1972 book, ''[[Counterrevolution and Revolt]]'', Marcuse wrote{{quote|To extend the base of the student movement, Rudi Dutschke has proposed the strategy of the ''long march through the institutions'': working against the established institutions while working within them, but not simply by 'boring from within', rather by 'doing the job', learning (how to program and read computers, how to teach at all levels of education, how to use the mass media, how to organize production, how to recognize and eschew planned obsolescence, how to design, et cetera), and at the same time preserving one's own consciousness in working with others.}}

==Outcome==
As a result of the conditions after the Second World War, including the [[baby boom]], the [[Cold War]] and the [[sexual revolution]], a [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter culture]] developed in the 1960s which culminated in the [[protests of 1968]].  That young generation then became established in the institutions of society which then reflected their views but, in western societies, this did not immediately result in full-scale revolution.{{sfn|Suri|2009}}

A peculiarity of '''Venetian grammar''' is a "semi-analytical" verbal flexion, with a compulsory "[[clitic]] subject pronoun" before the verb in many sentences, "echoing" the subject as an ending or a weak pronoun. As will be clear from the examples below, Venetian subject clitics are neither "redundant" nor "pleonastic" because they provide specific information, not present on verbal endings. Independent/emphatic pronouns (e.g. ''ti''), on the contrary, are optional.

* Italian: ''(Tu) eri sporco''  ("You were dirty").
* Venetian: ''(Ti) te jèra onto'' or even ''Ti te jèri/xeri onto'' (lit. "(You) you were dirty").
* Italian: ''Il cane era sporco''  ("The dog was dirty").
* Venetian: ''El can el jèra onto''  (lit. "The dog he was dirty").
* Italian: ''(Tu) ti sei domandato'' ("You have asked yourself").
* Venetian: ''(Ti) te te à/gà/ghè domandà''  (lit. "(You) you yourself have asked").

The clitic subject pronoun (''te, el/ła, i/łe'') is used with the 2nd and 3rd person singular, and with the 3rd person plural.  This feature may have arisen as a compensation for the fact that the 2nd- and 3rd-person inflections for most verbs, which are still distinct in Italian and many other Romance languages, are identical in Venetian. (The [[Piedmontese language]] also has clitic subject pronouns, but the rules are somewhat different.)

The function of clitics is particularly visible in long sentences, which do not always have clear intonational breaks to easily tell apart vocative and imperative in sharp commands from exclamations with "shouted indicative". In Venetian the clitic ''el'' marks the indicative verb and its masculine subject, otherwise there is an imperative preceded by a vocative:

* Venetian: ''Marco 'l canta ben, dai!'' ("Mark ''(subj.)'' sings well, you have to admit it!" - exclamation: subject + indicative)
* Venetian: ''Marco canta ben, dai!'' ("Mark ''(voc.)'' sing well, come on!" - command: vocative+imperative)
* Ven.Ital.: ''Marco canta ben, dai!'' (both exclamative and imperative)
* Std.Ital.: ''Marco canta bene, dai!'' (both exclamative and imperative)

Indeed, the verbal forms requiring subject clitics can often change or even drop their endings without problems of confusion because the clitic itself provide the necessary information (in Piedmontese and Milanese the clitic is not sufficient to mark the verb and often requires the cooccurence of a specific ending). Because Venetian subject clitics mark number (e.g. ''te'' = 2nd singular, ''el'' = 3rd singular, ''i'' = 3rd plural) and gender (''ła'' = feminine 3rd singular, ''łe'' = feminine 3rd plural), they convey specific information that is not (or might not be) present on the endings. Thus, they act like a bridge that provide number and gender agreement between verb and subject (some languages, like [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Basque language|Basque]] may show number/gender agreement on verbal endings). Thus, although some traditional grammars consider subject clitics as "redundant" or "pleonastic" elements, Venetian subject clitics are neither redundant nor pleonastic.

The clitics are the same in whole Veneto with two exceptions: ''te'' becomes ''ti'' in Venice (but is different from emphatic ''TI''!) and becomes ''tu'' in some bellunese areas. ''El'' becomes ''Al'' in bellunese.

==2nd singular person present indicative of "magnar"==
* Venetian in Venice: ''(TI) ti magn'''i'''''  (lit." (You) you eat")
* Venetian in Padua-Vicenza-Rovigo-Verona: ''(TI) te magn'''i'''''  (=lit. "(You) you eat")
* Venetian in Treviso-Belluno: ''(TI) te magn'''a'''''  (=lit. "(You) you eat")

==2nd singular person imperf. indicative of "magnar"==
* Venetian in Venice: ''(TI) ti magnav'''i''''' (lit. "(You) you used to eat")
* Venetian in Pad-Vic-Rov-Ver: ''(TI) te magnav'''i''''' (lit. "(You) you used to eat")
* Venetian in Treviso-Belluno: ''(TI) te/tu magnav'''a'''''/magné'''a'''''(lit. "(You) you used to eat")

==2nd singular person present indicative of "sentir"==
* Venetian in Venice-Verona: ''(TI) te/ti sent'''i'''   (lit. "(You) you hear/you feel")
* Venetian in Vic-Pad-Rov: ''(TI) te s'''i'''nti''  (lit. "(You) you hear/you feel")
* Venetian in Treviso: ''(TI) te sent'''e'''''  (lit. "(You) you hear/you feel")
* Venetian in Belluno: ''(TI) te/tu sen'''t'''  (lit. "(You) you hear/you feel")

==3rd singular person present indicative of "sentir"==
* Venetian Ven-Ver-Vic-Pad-Rov: ''(EL CAN) el sent'''e''''' (lit. "(The dog) he hears/he feels")
* Venetian Trev-Bell: ''(EL CAN) el/al sen'''t'''''  (lit. "(The dog) he hears/he feels")

Such variations in last and internal vowels do not block reciprocal comprehension between people in Veneto because what is felt as important to mark the verb is the clitic ("te, el").

Also general Venetian forms exist with no endings:
* Venetian (in whole Veneto): ''te vie'''n''' / ti vie'''n''''' ("you come")
* Venetian (in whole Veneto): ''el vie'''n''''' (lit. "he come" as there was no ''-s'')
* Venetian (in whole Veneto): ''i vie'''n''''' ("they come")

Note that when the subject is postverbal (motion verbs, unaccusative verbs) the clitic is banned and the past participle of compound forms (if any) is invariably masc.singular, yielding a semi-impersonal form which does not exist in Italian:

==Normal form==
* Italian: ''Le mie sorelle sono arrivat'''e''''' ("[as for] My sisters have arrived-''f.pl.''")
* Venetian: ''Mé sorełe '''łe''' xe/è rivà'''e''''' (lit."[as for] My sisters they-''cl.f.pl.'' have arrived-''f.pl.''")

==Impersonal form (only in Venetian)==
* Italian: ''Sono arrivat'''e''' le mie sorelle'' (hey, the news! "my sisters have arrived")
* Venetian: ''Xe/Gh'è/Iè rivà mé sorełe'' (lit. "(there) has arrived-''m.sg.'' my sisters") --- no clitic and an invariable m.sg. past participle

In Italian the past participle is always inflected while in the Venetian in the impersonal form it is invariable and the verb has no plural (fem.) clitic, differently from the normal flection.

The '''Veronese Riddle''' ({{lang-it|Indovinello veronese}}) is a riddle written in late [[Vulgar Latin]] on the margin of a [[parchment]], on the [[Verona Orational]], probably in the 8th or early 9th century, by a [[Nicene Christianity|Christian]] [[monastery|monk]] from [[Verona]], in northern [[Italy]]. It is an example of the internationally widespread [[writing-riddle]], very popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and still in circulation in recent times. Discovered by [[Luigi Schiaparelli]] in 1924, it is considered the [[List of languages by first written accounts|oldest existing document]] in the [[Italian language]] along with the [[Placiti Cassinesi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multimediadidattica.it/dm/origini/origini.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507235754/http://www.multimediadidattica.it/dm/origini/origini.htm |archivedate=May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The text, with a literal translation, runs:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|it|Se pareba boves
alba pratalia araba
albo versorio teneba
negro semen seminaba}}
|
In front of him (he) led oxen
White fields (he) plowed
A white plow (he) held
A black seed (he) sowed.}}

==Explanation==
The lines of this riddle tell us of a somebody with « oxen » (''boves'') who used to plow « white fields » (''alba pratalia'') with a « white plow » (''albo versorio''), sowing a « black seed » (''negro semen''). This person is the writer himself, the monk whose business is to copy old manuscripts. The oxen are his fingers which draw a white feather (the white plow) across the page (the white fields), leaving black ink marks (black seed).

==Origins of the ''Indovinello''==

This document dates to the late 10th-early 11th century and was followed by a small thanksgiving prayer in Latin: ''gratias tibi agimus omnip(oten)s sempiterne d(eu)s'' ("we thank you almighty everlasting God"). These lines were written on codex LXXXIX (89) of the ''[[Chapter Library of Verona|Biblioteca Capitolare di Verona]]''. The parchment, discovered by Schiapparelli in 1924 is a [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] oration by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Christianity|Christian Church]], i.e. a document in a Romance language first written in Spain in an area influenced by the [[Moorish]] culture, probably around [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. It was then brought to [[Cagliari]] and then [[Pisa]] before reaching the [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] of Verona.

==Text analysis and comments==
Many more European documents seem to confirm that the distinctive traits of [[Romance languages]] occurred all around the same time (e.g. France's ''[[Oaths of Strasbourg|Serments de Strasburg]]''). Though initially hailed as the earliest document in Italian in the first years following Schiapparelli's discovery, today the record has been disputed by many scholars from [[Bruno Migliorini]] to [[Cesare Segre]] and [[Francesco Bruni (linguist)|Francesco Bruni]], who have placed it at the latest stage of [[Vulgar Latin]], though this very term is far from being clear-cut, and Migliorini himself considers it dilapidated. At present, however, the ''Placito Capuano'' (960 A.D.) (the first in a series of four documents dating 960-963 A.D. issued by a Capuan court) is considered to be the first document ever written in Italian, although Migliorini concedes that since the ''Placito'' was put on record as an official court proceeding (and signed by a notary), Italian must have been widely spoken for at least one century.

Some words stick indeed to the rules of Latin grammar (''boves'' with ''-es'' for the [[accusative]] plural masculine, ''alba'' with ''-a'' suffix for the plural neuter). Yet more are distinctly Italian, with no cases and producing the typical ending of Italian verbs: ''pareba'' (It. ''pareva''), ''araba'' (It. ''arava''), ''teneba'' (It. ''teneva''), ''seminaba'' (It. ''seminava'') instead of Latin pareba'''t''', araba'''t''', teneba'''t''', seminaba'''t'''. ''Albo versorio'' and ''negro semen'' have replaced Latin ''album uersorium'' and ''nigrum semen''. ''Versorio'' is still the word for "[[plow]]" in today's [[Veronese dialect]] (and the other varieties of [[Venetian language]]) as the verb ''parar'' is still the word for 'push on', 'drive', 'lead' (in Italian '' spingere'', ''guidare''). Michele A. Cortelazzo and Ivano Paccagnella say that the plural ''-es'' of ''boves'' may well be considered [[Ladin language|Ladin]] and therefore not Latin, but Romance too. ''Albo'' is early Italian, especially since Germanic ''blank'' entered Italian usage later, leading to current Italian ''bianco'' ("white").

'''Abraham Viktor Rydberg''' ({{IPA-sv|²ɑːbraˌham ˈvɪkːtɔr ²ryːdbærj}}; 18 December 1828 in [[Jönköping]]{{snd}}21 September 1895 in [[Djursholm]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer and a member of the [[Swedish Academy]], 1877–1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/akademien/ledamotsregisternew/abraham-viktor-rydberg|title=Rydberg, Abraham Viktor|publisher=Swedish Academy|accessdate=22 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222202951/http://www.svenskaakademien.se/akademien/ledamotsregisternew/abraham-viktor-rydberg|archivedate=22 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Primarily a classical idealist",&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wharton Stork, Anthology of Swedish Lyrics: From 1750 to 1915, New York, The Scandinavian-American Foundation, London, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Viktor Rydberg has been described as "Sweden's last [[Romanticism|Romantic]]" and by 1859 was "generally regarded in the first rank of Swedish novelists."&lt;ref&gt;Cyclopedia of World Authors, Revised 3rd edition, Vol. 4, Edited by Frank N. Magill, 1997, s.v. Viktor Rydberg&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Viktor Rydberg was of humble parentage. One biographer notes that: "He had a hard struggle to satisfy the thirst for learning which was a leading passion of his life, but he finally attained distinction in several fields of scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;''Anthology of Swedish Lyrics From 1750 to 1925'' by Charles Wharton Stork, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;  The son of a soldier turned prison guard, Johann Rydberg, and a midwife, Hedvig Düker. Viktor Rydberg had two brothers and three sisters. In 1834 his mother died during a [[cholera]] [[epidemic]]. Her death broke the spirit of his father, who yielded to hypochondria and [[alcoholism]], contributing towards his loss of employment and the family's apartment,&lt;ref name="Kunitz_Colby_809"&gt;{{harvp|Kunitz|Colby|1967|p=809}}&lt;/ref&gt; forcing authorities to board young Viktor out to a series of foster homes, one of which burnt down, further traumatizing the youth.

Despite his economic status, Rydberg was recognized for his talents. From 1838 to 1847, Rydberg attended grammar school, and studied law at the University in [[Lund]] from 1851 to 1852. Due to financial reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Micropædia, 1986, s.v. Viktor Rydberg, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; his university studies ended after one year, without a degree. Afterward, he took a job as a private tutor. In 1855, he was offered work at the ''Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning'', a newspaper in Göteborg, where he would remain employed for more than 20 years. It was during this time that his first novels saw print. He soon become a central figure of late Romanticism in Sweden, and Sweden's most famous living author.

Throughout his adult life, Rydberg was active in politics. In 1859, he wrote a pamphlet on national defense, which inspired the "Sharpshooter's movement", a voluntary militia of some political importance during the 1860s. In 1870, he took a controversial pro-German stance during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Representing the traditional economic system of Sweden, from 1870 to 1872, Rydberg was a member of the Swedish Parliament as a supporter of the Peasant's Party. Having been a supporter of the Jewish cause since his youth, it was MP Viktor Rydberg who gave the keynote speech in the parliamentary debate to enact a law granting all non-Lutherans full civil rights. He worked diligently for working-class people and in 1906 his works on the labor question in both prose and poetry were regarded as part of the "treasury of this class."&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;''The American Monthly Review of Reviews'' by Albert Shaw; "Viktor Rydberg: Reformer, The Dante of Sweden", p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  He also advocated language reform, purging foreign words from the Swedish language, particularly those of German origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bandle|Braunmüller|Jahr|Karker|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he advocated a more [[Germanic languages|Germanic spelling]] of his own name: Viktor, as opposed to Victor.

Throughout his life and career, Rydberg would coin several Swedish words, many, such as "gudasaga" for the foreign "mythologi",  still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bandle|Braunmüller|Jahr|Karker|2002|p=1544}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, he refused to support [[Anarchism|anarchist]] writer [[August Strindberg]], in [[Getting Married (Strindberg)|his blasphemy case]]. As a juror in an 1888 trial of [[socialist]] leader [[Hjalmar Branting]], Rydberg voted to send him to jail for [[blasphemy]]. They would never speak to one another again. His apprehension of unregulated capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age is most fully expressed in his acclaimed poem ''Den nya Grottesången'' (''The New Grotti Song'') in which he delivered a fierce attack on the miserable working conditions in factories of the era, using the mill of ''[[Grottasöngr]]'' as his literary backdrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kunitz|Colby|1967|p=810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his lifetime of literary achievement, Rydberg received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Uppsala]] in 1877 and was elected a member of the [[Swedish Academy]] the same year. He served from 1883 as teacher, from 1884 as professor, of the History of Culture at Stockholms högskola, now [[Stockholm University]], and from 1889 as the first holder of the J. A. Berg Chair of the History and Theory of Art there.&lt;ref&gt;Svante Nordin, "Rydberg, Abraham Viktor", ''Svenskt biografiskt lexikon'', 31 (2000–2002), p. 45. On the J. A. Berg professorship and its holders, see "Professorer i konsthistoria", [appendix] in Britt-Inger Johansson &amp; Hans Pettersson (eds.), ''8 kapitel om konsthistoriens historia i Sverige'', Stockholm: Rasters förlag, 2000, p. 248-251.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, he was also elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Rydberg died at the age of 66 on 21 September 1895 due to complications from [[diabetes]] and [[arteriosclerosis]]. Rydberg's passing was reported as far away as the United States of America, where the ''New York Times'' published an obituary titled: "Death of Prof. A.V. Rydberg, Career and Remarkable works of one of Sweden's Leading Men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/09/22/105983082.pdf|publisher=New York Times|date=22 August 1895|title=Death of Prof. A.V.Rydberg | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A national day of mourning would ensue all over Sweden. Today, his grave is a national monument. Many of his works have been translated and remain in print. His works are widely read in schools throughout Sweden, and his poem "[[Tomten (poem)|Tomten]]" ("Santa" or "The Gnome") is a Christmas favorite, as well as the lyrics for ''[[Gläns över sjö och strand]]''. A group of three charter high schools (Gymnasium) and one middle school in Stockholm, as well as a street in Götesborg, a student dormitory, and other buildings carry his name. He is still listed in many English language encyclopedias as an individual entry.

Since the late 1920s, scholars and critics have speculated about Rydberg's private life and sexual orientation. Referring to a failed engagement, Judith Moffett writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We can construct a story of backdoor illicit liaisons and front door respectability from these fragments and others— Rydberg would hardly be the first, if it were true— but he never spoke openly about his private life at any time, and our best guess would still be guesswork.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moffett|2001|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Svanberg (1928) and Stolpe (1978) suggested that Rydberg had a homosexual orientation, based on their interpretations of Rydberg's published works. Moffett (2001) endorsed Stolpe's theory, speculating that Rydberg's sexual orientation was the result of the early loss of his mother, concluding that Rydberg  was homosexual but celibate. In her opinion, Rydberg found all sexual expression "despicable, impossible, or, at best, delicious but lethal."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moffett|2001|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sven Delblanc]] (1983) argued that the novel ''Singoalla'' "reflected homosexual desires and impulses in Rydberg himself", and that the protagonist's slaying of his unacknowledged son Sorgborn ['child of sorrow'] was a "masked representation of homosexual intercourse."&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Stig Bäckman ''Viktor Rydberg som Erland Månesköld. Om Sven Delblancs läsning av Singoalla,'' Samlaren 125:78–91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bäckmann (2004) disputed this theory noting that there is "no textual evidence" to support this "empathetic reading" of Rydberg's biography.

In 1857, Rydberg's first novel, ''Fribytaren på Östersjön'' (''[[The Freebooter of the Baltic]]''; 1857), a historical romance set in the 17th century, incorporating themes of piracy, witchcraft and nautical excursions, was published.

This was soon followed by his first major success, and one of his most popular novels, ''Singoalla'' (1858), a "romantic story out of the Middle Ages, permeated with a poetic nature-mysticism, about the tragic love between a knight and a gypsy girl."&lt;ref name="Kunitz_Colby"&gt;{{harvp|Kunitz|Colby|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rydberg rewrote the book throughout his life. The fourth and final edition of 1894, concludes with Erland dying as a hermit monk. The story has been made into a film twice, and today, a popular brand of cookie takes its name from the book's main character: Singoalla. A review of the first English translation of the work in the Saga-Book of the Viking Club, Vol. 4, Part 1, 1904–5, noting that the book "has already been translated into most of the languages of continental Europe", remarks that "Singoalla is a novel occupying a pre-eminent place among Rydberg's prose writings."

In 1859, Rydberg's most ambitious novel, and his last one for thirty years, was published under the title ''Den siste Atenaren'' (''The Last Athenian''). This, his best-known novel, offers a contrast between "Rydberg's admiration for classical antiquity and his critical attitude to dogmatic Christianity."&lt;ref name="Kunitz_Colby"/&gt; This struggle is set in Athens, in the time of the last pagan emperor, [[Julian the Apostate]], during the transition from Platonic paganism to Christianity. The novel advocates a philosophy founded on the noblest elements of both ideologies. At "scarcely thirty years of age", [[William W. Thomas, Jr.|William Widgery Thomas, Jr.]] said that Rydberg was "already acknowledged to be the foremost living prose writer of Scandinavia."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Widgery Thomas, Jr.]] writing in the introduction to ''The Last Athenian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 he wrote and published ''Bibelns lära om Kristus'' (''The Bible's Doctrine concerning Christ''), a work of contemporary religious criticism, which was hugely successful. Introducing modern Biblical criticism to Scandinavia, he used the [[New Testament]] itself to deny the divinity of [[Christ]]. "At a conference of the Swedish church in 1865, Mr. Rydberg ...and he pleaded his cause with so much eloquence as to make a favorable impression upon his most eminent official opponents. The agitation which he called forth made his name known throughout Sweden, and in 1870 he was elected a member of parliament, where he boldly advocated democratic principles." &lt;ref&gt;''The Literary World'', Vol. XIII, Jan–Dec 1882, Boston. E. H. Hames &amp; Co, p. 282 (6 Aug.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The long-term effects of the book would be the weakening of the authority of the Church over the educated classes of Scandinavia. August Strindberg "acknowledged the liberating influence of Rydberg's Bibelns lära om Kristus (The Bible's Doctrine Concerning Christ, 1862) on his generation (like David Friedrich Strauss and Ernst Renan)." &lt;ref&gt;Michael Robinson, editor, Strindberg's Letters, Vol. II,  2001, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught freedom of individual conscience. It was this that inspired him in the fight against the state church.&lt;ref name="Shaw"/&gt; Predictably, this book attracted the ire of the orthodox religious establishment and is generally credited for Rydberg's exclusion from the [[Swedish Academy]] until as late as 1877. From 1865 to 1868, Rydberg suffered a severe bout of depression caused by the theological struggle and a broken engagement in 1865.

Rydberg's next work, ''Medeltidens Magi'' (''The Magic of the Middle Ages'') 1865 is an exposition of the magical practices and beliefs of the Medieval period. According to Rydberg, the contemporary Church was still driven by the ideology of the Dark Ages, and its dualistic notions of good and evil, represented by God and the Devil, Heaven and Hell, contributed towards the horror of the witch-hunts in Europe and America in the recent past. From this point forward, Rydberg was economically successful as a writer.

"Lille Viggs äventyr på julafton" ("Little Vigg's Adventures on Christmas Eve", 1871) is a short [[Christmas]] tale for all ages, originally written for a newspaper, but later widely printed. It has since become a Christmas classic in Sweden.

After a long journey in [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] in 1874, Rydberg published ''Romerska sägner om apostlarna Petrus och Paulus'' (''Roman Legends concerning the Apostles Peter and Paul'' 1874) and ''Romerska Dagar'' (''Roman Days'' 1877), a series of essays on Italian culture, history and archaeology; The journey is said to have strengthened Rydberg's creative power, as he now produced some of "the finest philosophical lyrics in Swedish literature".&lt;ref name="Kunitz_Colby_809"/&gt; "His poems are not numerous, but their masterly form and wealth of thought give them rank among the best poetry in Swedish literature."&lt;ref&gt;Frederik Winkel Horn, PhD., History of the Literature of the Scandinavian North from the Most Ancient Times to the Present. Chicago, South Carolina Griggs and Co., 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles Wharton Stork remarks: "In the originality and forcefulness of his imagery Rydberg marks an important advance in Swedish poetry;" "there is a manliness in Rydberg's voice which makes the notes carry. His ideas are not the shadows of others, they are his by strong conviction."&lt;ref&gt;Anthology of Swedish Lyrics: From 1750 to 1915, New York, The Scandinavian-American Foundation, London, 1930, pp. xxx &amp; xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important works include his translation of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1876) and the historical novel ''Vapensmeden'' (''The Armoror'', 1891), his first novel in three decades. Set during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the novel depicts the struggle between Lutheran Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. In it, Rydberg "still fought fanaticism and dogmatism, and his ideal was still humanity and liberty."&lt;ref name="Bédé_Edgerton"&gt;''Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature'', Second Edition, edited by Jean-Albert Bédé and William B. Edgerton, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1886 and 1889, his literary work was focused on [[Norse mythology|Norse]] and broader [[Germanic mythology]].&lt;ref name="Bédé_Edgerton"/&gt; "Rydberg had already begun, in the guise of fiction, to devote himself to cultural history, and this now continued in the form of a series of scientific investigations. These dealt first and foremost with religion and mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Jørgen Bukdahl, Scandinavia Past and Present: Five modern democracies, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; He published several works in the field including two articles on the origins of the [[Poetic Edda]] poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', in which he debated the authenticity of the poem with Norwegian scholar [[Sophus Bugge]], who held that the poem was based on Classical and Biblical sources. An article in The Antiquary 1881, p.&amp;nbsp;65, describes Rydberg's response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Against this last theory, the Swedish savant, Dr. Viktor Rydberg, of Gotenburg, has written a brilliant paper in the two first numbers of Nordisk Tidskrift for 1881. It is not too much to say, that a more crushing and masterly reply was never penned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A century later, Old Norse scholar [[Ursula Dronke]] characterizes this work similarly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... over one hundred pages (as against [[Anton Christian Bang|Bang]]'s twenty-three!) of marvellously intelligent, masterly criticism of the errors, imprecise thinking and failure of scholarly imagination that underlay Bang's claim."&lt;ref&gt;"Völuspá and the Sibylline Traditions", ''Latin Culture and Medieval Germanic Europe'', ed. Richard North and T. Hofstra, 1992 [Reprinted in her book ''Myth and Fiction in Early Norse Lands''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even Sophus Bugge acknowledged that Rydberg won the argument, ushering in the modern age of Eddic scholarship by firmly vanquishing the nature-school of mythology.&lt;ref name="de_Vries_250"&gt;Jan de Vries, ''Forschungsgeschichte der Mythologie'', Freiburg and Munich: Verlag Karl Alber, 1961, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of his own investigations in prose was titled ''Segerssvärdet'' 1882, (''The Sword of Victory''), followed by two volumes of mythic studies titled ''Undersökningar i germanisk mythologi, första delen'', 1886 (''Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume 1''); and ''Undersökningar i germanisk mythologi, andre delen'', (''Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume 2'') 1889  as well as a children's version of Norse mythology in 1887 titled ''Fädernas gudasaga'' (''Our Fathers' Godsaga''). In a letter to Rydberg, after receiving the first volume of his mythological research, Bugge stated: "As I have read my heart has warmed more and more. ...Forgive these words from a man who before such a magnificent and in many respects remarkable work is well aware that he is nothing but a philologist." &lt;ref&gt;Karl Warburg, Viktor Rydberg, En Lefnadsteckning II, p. 623, translated by Fredrik Gadde in "Viktor Rydberg and Some Beowulf Questions", p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henrik Schück wrote at the turn of the 20th century that he considered Rydberg the "last —and poetically most gifted —of the mythological school founded by Jacob Grimm and represented by such men as Adalbert Kuhn" which is "strongly synthetic" in its understanding of myth.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Schück, quoted by Karl Warburg in Viktor Rydberg, En Lefnadsteckning, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this work, [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At a time, when one was firmly convinced that the Old Norse myths were a late product, Rydberg's voice resounds. At that time, he swam against the stream, but he clearly expressed that which has become an ever stronger certainty today: a large part of the myths of the Germanic tradition —and that is to say basically the Old Norse tradition—must be set back in a time when the undivided Proto-Indo-European people themselves created the vessel of their worldview in myths."&lt;ref name="de_Vries_250"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 1880s, Rydberg also published two studies of runic inscriptions. His acceptance speech into the Swedish Academy, titled "Om Hjeltesagan å Rökstenen" (translated as "Concerning the Heroic-Saga on the [[Rök Runestone]]") was published in English translation, with an introduction by Swedish Scholar Ola Östin, in its entirety in ''The Runestone Journal'' 1, 2007, a publication of the [[Asatru Folk Assembly]].

Rydberg's final publication, an essay titled ''Den hvita rasens framtid'', "The Future of the White Race", was published posthumously as an introduction to the Swedish edition of Benjamin Kidd's ''Social Evolution.'' Noting that "Rydberg's conception of race is not equivalent with the modern term; the meaning he gives the word is in fact more cultural than biological, ...he includes Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists living in Asia, America and to some extent Africa in this expression." Swedish scholar Anna Lindén says "what he actually criticizes is a phenomenon within Europe, not on other continents", continuing, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The Swedish author is, unlike Kidd, not a Social Darwinist and far more pessimistic about the European future than the Irishman. A common feature is, however, that both of them view religion and ethics as most important for the survival of a "race".

"Evolution is rightly said to be one of the most typical theme in 19th century Europe, but parallel to this optimism in the second half of the century there was a widespread, nearly apocalyptic, anxiety for the degeneration of the population caused by exceptional fast development. Rydberg shared this anxiety: he was very critical to industrialism and unhealthy milieu of the big European metropolises, ...in combination with low nativity this was a dangerous threat to Europe, especially compared to the steadily growing, physically as well as morally sound population in China and the Far East. ...This lack of morals will in the long run ruin the ecological system as well as the poor people on our continent." &lt;ref&gt;Anna Linden, in En europeisk apokalyps? Om Viktor Rydbergs 'Den hvita rasens framtid' (Centrum för Europaforskning, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to Kidd's optimistic Darwinism (''all'ottimismo darwiniano di Kidd''), Rydberg foresaw the possibility of European culture being overcome by the more industrious and more prolific Chinese nation.{{#tag:ref|"In dissenso rispetto all'ottimismo darwiniano di Kidd, Rydberg tratteggiava il crollo della cultura europea per opera della nazione cinese."&lt;ref&gt;Dotti, Luca (2004). ''L’utopia eugenetica del welfare state svedese, 1934–1975'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}{{#tag:ref|"The racial focus originated in the nineteenth-century tradition with anthropologists such as Anders Retzius promoting superior Nordic virtues, while Victor Rydberg wrote about the potential downfall of the white race and the threat of the Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Anne, and Tom Shakespeare (2002). ''Genetic Politics: From Eugenics to Genome''. Cheltenham, Eng.: New Clarion, {{ISBN|1-873797-25-7}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} In this essay,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Rydberg's belief in a swift, negative transformation ... is not initially eugenic or biological; instead he advocates moral rearmament." "Rydberg envisioned European culture being overthrown by the Chinese. He predicted that the downfall would come in the very near future and would come about because of moral degeneration, demographic conditions, and the ensuing defects in the population." &lt;ref&gt;Broberg, Gunnar, and Mattias Tydén (1996).

===Mythological works===
{{main|Undersökningar i germanisk mythologi}}
There is no shortage of scholarly opinion and no consensus on Viktor Rydberg's works on Indo-European and Germanic mythology. Some scholars feel that his work is ingenious,{{#tag:ref|Commenting on specifics of Rydberg's comparative mythology, the Dutch scholar [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] calls him "sagacious." De Vries, writing in ''The Problem of Loki'', 1933, said:&lt;blockquote&gt;The resemblance between Loki and Prometheus, which indeed cannot be denied, was mostly considered to be a proof of his character as a fire-god, even going back to the Aryan period. The sagacious Swedish scholar V. Rydberg argued in the same way, considering him only more particularly to be connected with the heavenly fire, the lightning; this seems to be shown by the etymological meaning of the names Byleistr and Farbauti both parents of Loki."&lt;/blockquote&gt;|group=Note}} while others feel the work is too speculative. One scholar expressed the opinion that "Rydberg's views" concerning resemblances of Thor and Indra were carried to extremes, therefore receiving "less recognition than they deserved,"&lt;ref&gt;E.O.G. Turville-Petre, ''Myth and Religion of the North'', 1964, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; while another says "Rydberg correctly establishes, like many before and after him, the similarities with the myth of Thor and the Midgard serpent" with that of Indra and the dragon Vrtra.&lt;ref&gt;Helge Ljungeborg, "Tor, Undersökningar i Indoeuropisk och Nordisk Religionshistoria, 1947, p. 58 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Others contest individual points of the work.{{#tag:ref|Marlene Ciklamini observed in 1962, "Since Suttungr is unanimously declared to be the possessor of the poetic mead, it is difficult to agree with Rydberg that Hávamál 140 represents Bölþorn's son as the owner. His hypothesis is based on a misinterpretation of the stanza, since Háv. 140 represents the boast of a god who deprived his enemies of the exclusive right to magic and the ownership of the mead.... Rydberg's suggestion that Mímir is Bölþorn's son is not substantiated by any source."&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Ciklamini, "Óðinn and the Giants", Neophilologus 46:145-58 (1962), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} While some scholars have praised Rydberg's method,&lt;ref&gt;William Nicolson, M. A. “Myth and Religion; An Enquiry into their Nature and Relations”,  Press of the Finnish Literary Society, 1892, p. 13 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; still others have commented on what they see as fundamental flaws in his methodology, objecting to any systematization of the mythology including the one imposed by Snorri Sturlusson, believing it artificial. However, [[John Lindow]]&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Norse Mythology, p. 39-45&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Margaret Clunies Ross]]&lt;ref&gt;Prolonged Echoes, pp. 234–238&lt;/ref&gt; have recently supported a chronological systemization of the most important mythic episodes as inherent in the oral tradition underlying Eddic poetry. Rydberg believed that most of the Germanic myths were part of a chronological epic, an approach that [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] characterized as arising "from an assumption that the mythology was once complete and rational." &lt;ref&gt;''Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe'', page 197. Syracuse University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While Rydberg's ingenuity has been recognized by some,{{#tag:ref|Mary E. Litchfield wrote: "Rydberg's researches have made it possible, for the first time, for one to form a definite conception of the cosmology of the mythology, and also because it clears away many inconsistencies that have long clung to it."&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Litchfield ''The Nine Worlds, Stories from Norse Mythology'', 1890 (reprinted by Freedonia Books, Amsterdam in 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} his work has most often been criticized for being too subjective. Yet, within his work, many find points on which they can agree.{{#tag:ref|"Victor Rydberg suggested that Siritha is Freyja herself and that Ottar is identical with same as Svipdagr, who appears as Menglöd's beloved in Fjölsvinnsmál. Rydberg's intentions in his investigations of Germanic mythology were to co-ordinate the myths and mythical fragments into coherent short stories. Not for a moment did he hesitate to make subjective interpretations of the episodes, based more on his imagination and poetical skills than on facts. His explication of the Siritha-episode is an example of his approach, and yet he probably was right when he identified Siritha with Freyja."&lt;ref&gt;Britt-Mari Näsström (1995) ''Freyja: The Great Goddess of the North''. University of Lund, {{ISBN|91-22-01694-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} In the first comprehensive review of the work in English, Rydberg's  "brilliancy" and "great success" were recognized, alongside an acknowledgement that he sometimes "stumbles badly"  in his effort to "reduce chaos to order."{{#tag:ref|In the introduction to the first English translation of Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by Oliver Elton, Frederick York Powell wrote in 1894: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;No one has commented upon Saxo's mythology with such brilliancy, such minute consideration, and such success as the Swedish scholar, Victor Rydberg. More than occasionally he is over-ingenious and over-anxious to reduce chaos to order; sometimes he almost loses his faithful reader in the maze he treads so easily and confidently, and sometimes he stumbles badly. But he has placed the whole subject on a fresh footing, and much that is to follow will be drawn from his "Teutonic Mythology", adding "The skeleton-key of identification, used even as ably as Dr. Rydberg uses it, will not pick every mythologic lock, though it undoubtedly has opened many hitherto closed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;|group=Note}} In 1976, German-language scholar Peter-Hans Naumann published the first evaluation of the full range of Viktor Rydberg's mythological writings. In 2004, Swedish Doktorand (PhD student) Anna Lindén reviewed the full two-volume work on mythology, concluding in part that it was not more widely received because it was not fully available in one of the three international languages of scholarship: English, German or French.&lt;ref&gt;"Viktor Rydberg and the comparative study of the history of Indo-European religion", by Anna Lindén, Doktorand, Lund University; Himlens blå, Örjan Lindberger, Veritas 5 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its publication, the German school of Nature mythology dominated the field, and contemporary scholars took a dim view of comparative mythology, which would come to flourish in the 20th century.  Commenting on Rydberg's mythological  work in 1902, Dutch Professor, P.D. Chantepie de la Saussaye, remarks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The comparative school has, even at the present time, some firm adherents. Among these may be reckoned the Swede, V. Rydberg, who shows great learning in the combination of various aspects of mythical narratives and according to whom even the cosmogonic myths are to be classed among the original possessions of the primitive Indo-European period. Such attempts, however, —of which this single example will suffice—lie outside of the current of modern development."&lt;ref&gt;The Religion of the Teutons, Boston and London, Ginn and Co, 1902&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Fredrik Gadde has explained, it was in this context, that&lt;blockquote&gt;

 "the book was reviewed by several German scholars, who all took up a more or less disparaging attitude towards Rydberg's methods of investigation and his results. Although they speak with high praise of the author's learning, his thorough insight, his ability to occasionally throw light upon intricate problems by means of ingenious suggestions, they criticize severely his hazardous etymologies, his identification of different mythical figures without sufficient grounds, his mixing up of heroic saga and myth, and, above all, his bent for remodeling myths in order to make them fit into a system which (they say) never existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gadde|1942|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
"Rydberg's work was, then, stamped as a failure, and this verdict from certain points of view cannot be considered unjust, seems to have caused the book to fall into oblivion, a fate which surely it has not deserved."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gadde|1942|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among contemporary Swedish reviewers, Hildebrand and Bååth were appreciative, the latter unreservedly praising the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gadde|1942}}, citing Hildebrand, Nordisk Tidskrift, 1887, p. 251, and Bååth Nordisk Tidskrift, 1891, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, Irish scholar Stopford A. Brooke remarked: "When we have made every allowance for a certain fancifulness, and for the bias which a well-loved theory creates, this book is a real contribution to Northern mythology."&lt;ref&gt;History of Early English Literature, Vol. I, 1892, p. 111, fn.&lt;/ref&gt; While, in 1942, Fredrik Gadde concluded: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Even though the views set forth by Rydberg never stood a chance of being accepted, there are points in his exposition that deserve being once more brought to light."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gadde|1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since their publication, some of Rydberg's mythological theories have been cited in a number of other scholarly works including his theory regarding a [[World Mill]],&lt;ref&gt;Georgia de Santilliana and Hertha von Duchend, ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'', 1969.

'''Vincentian Creole''' is an [[English-based creole language]] spoken in [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. It contains elements of French and [[Antillean Creole]], and various [[Iberian Romance languages]]. It has also been influenced by the indigenous Kalinago/[[Garifuna language|Garifuna]] elements and by African language brought over the Atlantic Ocean by way of the slave trade. Over the years the creole has changed to be more English-based. It does not have the status of an official language

==Pronunciation==
*Hard sounds at the end of words are avoided. There are mainly two ways hard sounds are evaded: 
** by [[Metathesis_(linguistics)|changing the order of the sounds]]. Example: "ask" is rendered as "aks"
** by [[apocope|dropping the last sound]]. Example: "desk" pronounced as "dess" and "tourist" as "touriss"
* For words ending in "-er", the "-er" sound changes to an "ah" sound. Example: "never" is pronounced as "nevah" and clever as "clevah"
*For words ending in "-th", the soft "-th" sound is replaced by the hard "t" sound as if the "h" were dropped. Example: "with" is rendered as "wit" and "earth" as "eart"
*For words ending in "-own", the "-own" is rendered as "-ung". Examples: down is rendered "dung" and town is rendered "tung"
*Words beginning with "dr" change to " j". Examples: driver is rendered 'jiver' and "drop off" as "jop off"

==Grammar==
Generally, there is no need for concord. The verb in its plural form is simply placed after the subject of the sentence. The object of the sentence is then placed after the verb, as in English. If there are both a direct object and an indirect object, the indirect object is placed directly after the verb followed by the direct object.

The subject pronouns are as shown in the following table.

|you (plural, as both object and subject)
|-
|dem/demdey
|them/them there (English)
|they or them
|-
|}

With regards to tense, the present tense is indicated by the use of the modal "does" (for habitual actions) or by the use of the present participle ending in "-ing" (for actions one is currently doing). The past tense is indicated by the use of either what is in English the plural form of the present tense of the verb, the modal "did", "been"/"bin" or the past participle of the verb. The future tense is indicated by the use of the present participle of the verb "to go", which is "going" (gine or gwine in the creole), or the plural form of the verb, "go".
