'''Amihan''' is a genderless deity that is depicted as a bird in the [[Philippine mythology]]. According to the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] folklore, Amihan is the first creature to inhabit the universe, along with the gods called [[Bathala]] and Aman Sinaya. In the legend Amihan is described as a bird who saves the first human beings, Malakas and Maganda from a bamboo plant. Amihan is also a word used to describe [[monsoon]] weather which occurs early in the year in the [[Philippines]].

Dr '''Andrew John Lack''' (born 1953) is an English [[biologist]] and author, specializing in [[botany]] and based at [[Oxford Brookes University]].

Andrew Lack is the son of the ornithologist [[David Lack]] (1910–1973).&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite book| first=Ted R. | last=Anderson | title=The Life of David Lack: Father of Evolutionary Ecology | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-19-992264-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[Dragon School]], [[Oxford]] and [[Bryanston School]], [[Dorset]].&lt;ref&gt;Dust jacket of ''Redbreast: The Robin in Life and Literature'', SMH Books, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied for an undergraduate degree in botany at [[Aberdeen University]] and obtained his doctorate, also in botany, from the [[University of Cambridge]].

Lack was a lecturer at [[Swansea University]] for seven years. In 1987, he became a lecturer in [[biology]] at [[Oxford Brookes University]] where he contributed to modules taught on the Environmental Biology degree, along with contemporaries such as [[Denis Owen]].

Andrew Lack's research is in the area of [[plant reproduction|plant reproductive]] [[ecology]] and [[genetics]], especially [[pollination]], [[tropical rain forest]] ecology, and the history and philosophy of the interaction of humans with the environment.

In 2008, Lack published the book ''Redbreast: The Robin in Life and Literature'', a literary collection based on the [[European robin|robin]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Christopher Howse, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3670164/The-Robin-in-life-and-literature.html The Robin in life and literature].

In this illustration, the Arctic front separates Arctic from Polar air masses, while the Polar front separates Polar air from warm air masses. (cA is continental arctic; cP is continental polar; mP is maritime polar; cT is continental tropic; and mT is maritime tropic.)]]

The '''Arctic front''' is the semipermanent, semi-continuous [[weather front]] between the cold arctic [[air mass]] and the warmer air of the [[polar cells|polar cell]]. It can also be defined as the southern boundary of the Arctic air mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Zaitseva | first = Nina A. | title = Arctic front | work = Arctic Climatology and Meteorology: Glossary | publisher = National Snow and Ice Data Center | date = | url = http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/arctic_front.html | accessdate = 2010-11-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126091914/http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/arctic_front.html| archivedate= 26 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mesoscale cyclones known as [[polar low]]s can form along the arctic front in the wake of [[extratropical cyclone]]s.  Arctic air masses in their wake are shallow with a deep layer of stable air above the shallow cold cool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tBa1DWYoDIC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=arctic+front+formation+weather+book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Il_EQqptoo&amp;sig=xF2QczKHzcYwLCSD6rAq-0Le_Yw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EgRIT5GoFuf50gH38qSADw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=arctic%20front%20formation%20weather%20book&amp;f=false|pages=163–172|title=Polar lows: mesoscale weather systems in the polar regions|author=Erik A.

==Appearance in satellite images==

Arctic Fronts form in the Arctic region, and move southwards in southerly flows. When they reach Northern Europe, they have usually travelled over an open sea, and convective cloudiness has developed. The appearance of an Arctic Cold Fronts is then, essentially, that of a shallow Cold Front.

Arctic Cold Fronts are usually so far north that [[Meteosat]] images alone are inadequate to recognize them. Also, the following conceptual models may look like Arctic Cold Fronts: polar Cold Front, Polar Low and Comma. The final check is best made using a loop of AVHRR images with the help of numerical model parameter fields.

==Types of Arctic cold fronts==
Arctic Cold Fronts can be classified into two types:
*'''Baroclinic fronts''' &lt;br&gt;
These fronts resemble polar cold fronts, but are usually not so extensive. The	frontal cloudiness becomes more convective with time.
*'''Ice/sea boundary fronts''' &lt;br&gt;
These fronts form over the ice/sea boundary and move southwards with the basic flow. There is only an isolated Cold Front. Often this type is so shallow and weak that it can not be detected in Meteosat water vapour images.

'''Audra State Park''' is a [[West Virginia]] [[state park]] located on {{convert|355|acre|km2}}&lt;ref&gt;Carrol, S. and Miller, M., ''Hiking West Virginia'', p.92, Globe Pequot Press, Guilford, CT (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; in southwestern [[Barbour County, West Virginia|Barbour County]]. It was established around the remnants of an early 19th-century [[gristmill]]  and the tiny community of [[Audra, West Virginia|Audra]]. A gristmill spillway is still visible in the river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audrastatepark.com/recreation.html Audra State Park web page, accessed March 16, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{stack|[[File:AlumCave.jpg|thumb|Icicles drape Alum Cave on a winter afternoon]]}}
The park is a hilly, secondary forest area bisected by the [[Middle Fork River]]. The deep pools, large, flat rocks, and riverside beach have provided generations of campers, local teens and college students a place to swim or work on their tans.&lt;ref&gt;Crockett, M., "''Jewels in our Crown''", Pictoria Histories, Charleston, WV, 2004. {{ISBN|1-891852-35-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audra State Park is the site of [[Alum Cave]], which is accessible by a [[boardwalk]] built along this overhanging sandstone ledge.  

The park serves as the put-in point for a 6.6 mile [[kayak]] run along about 2.8 miles the Middle Fork River and about 3.8 miles of the [[Tygart Valley River]] to the confluence of the latter with the [[Buckhannon River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanwhitewater.org/rivers/id/2455/ American Whitewater web site, Middle Fork River page, accessed July 19, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
* 67 camp sites
* Swimming in the Middle Fork River
* Hiking trails
* Kayaking in the Middle Fork River
* Picnic area

==Accessibility==

[[Accessibility]] for the [[disable]]d was assessed by [[West Virginia University]]. The assessment found the campground, picnic area, and park offices to be accessible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedwvu.org/programs/realchoice/recreation/ ''Guide to Accessible Recreation and Travel in WV'', WVU Center for Excellence in Disabilities web site, accessed July 31, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720230618/http://www.cedwvu.org/programs/realchoice/recreation/ |date=July 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main swimming hole (just below the site of the former gristmill), with wet, slippery rocks and unpaved approaches is not considered accessible.

The '''Bahia interior forests''' is an [[ecoregion]] of eastern [[Brazil]]. It is part of the larger [[Atlantic forests]] [[biome]] complex, and lies between the [[Bahia coastal forests]] and the dry shrublands and savannas of Brazil's interior.

==Setting==
The Bahia interior forests cover an area of {{convert|230,000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, extending across portions of [[Bahia]], [[Espirito Santo]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Rio de Janeiro state|Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Sergipe]] states. The Bahia interior forests lie inland from the [[Bahia coastal forests]], which extend approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} inland from the coast. The Bahia interior forests extend north to the [[São Francisco River]], where they lie much closer to the coast, and are bounded on the west by the dry [[Caatinga]] shrublands. Moving south, the forests extend further inland to the [[Paraíba do Sul River|Rio Paraíba do Sul]], [[Rio Preto (Bahia)|Rio Preto]], and [[Rio Grande, Minas Gerais|Rio Grande]], which form the boundary with the [[Paraná-Paraíba interior forests]] to the southwest.

==Flora==
Atlantic forest in [[Minas Gerais]], interior [[Bahia]] and southern [[Espírito Santo]], according to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], consists of a semi-deciduous or deciduous forest.&lt;ref name="ibgemap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapa da área de Aplicação da Lei nº 11.428 de 2006 |url=ftp://geoftp.ibge.gov.br/mapas_tematicos/mapas_murais/lei11428_mata_atlantica.pdf |publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] |date=2012-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this ecoregion is found a highly threatened spicies, the "Brazilian rosewood" ''([[Dalbergia nigra]])''.&lt;ref name="wwf"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Bahia interior forests|id=nt0104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
[[File:Brachyteles hypoxanthus4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Northern muriqui]] is an endareged species of Bahia interior forests.]]
This ecoregion is poorly known. Recently, a new primate species was described, the [[Coimbra Filho's titi]], and other primate, the [[Northern muriqui]] is endemic of Bahia interior forests ecoregion.

==Conservation and threats==
[[File:Bahia interior forests WWF satelite.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite picture of Bahia interior forests ecoregion (black line). In this image, it's possible to observe the deforestation degree of the ecoregion.]]
Bahia interior forest is one of the most modified ecoregions in Atlantic forest region. Most forests remnants has less than 10&amp;nbsp;km², and even these are currently under strong pressure from anthropogenic activities, as fires, illegal deforestation and predatory hunting.&lt;ref name="wwf"/&gt; Less than 2 percent of Bahia interior forests are  protected as conservation units. The largest forest remnant of this ecoregion is the [[Rio Doce State Park]], with 359&amp;nbsp;km² of area.&lt;ref name="wwf"/&gt;

'''Frederick Benjamin''' "'''Ben'''" '''Carlin''' (27 July 1912 – 7 March 1981) was an Australian adventurer who was the first and only person to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the world in an [[amphibious vehicle]]. Born in [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]], [[Western Australia]], Carlin attended [[Guildford Grammar School]] in [[Perth]], and later studied [[mining engineering]] at the [[Western Australian School of Mines|Kalgoorlie School of Mines]]. After qualifying as an engineer, he worked on the [[Goldfields-Esperance|Goldfields]] before in 1939 emigrating to China to work in a British coal mine. In the [[World War II|Second World War]], Carlin was posted to the [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers]], serving in India, Italy, and throughout the Middle East. After his discharge from service in 1946, he emigrated to the United States with his American wife, Elinore (née Arone).

Sparked by an idea he had had whilst in the military, Carlin proposed that the couple honeymoon by crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in a modified [[Ford GPA]] (an amphibious version of the [[Ford GPW]] Jeep), which they named the ''Half-Safe''. Beginning their trip in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, the Carlins finally completed the [[transatlantic crossing]] in 1951, after unsuccessful attempts. From there, they travelled to Europe, temporarily settling in [[Birmingham]] to raise more money. They resumed their journey in 1954, travelling overland through the Middle East before arriving in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. After a short fundraising trip to Australia, Carlin's wife left to return to the United States. He resumed the journey with new partners, travelling through South-East Asia and the Far East to the northern tip of Japan, and then to [[Alaska]]. After an extended tour through the United States and Canada, he and ''Half-Safe'' finally returned to Montreal, having travelled over {{convert|17,000|km|mi}} by sea and {{convert|62,000|km|mi}} by land during a ten-year journey. Following Carlin's death in 1981, ''Half-Safe'' was acquired by Guildford Grammar, his old school, where it remains on display.

==Early life and military service==
Frederick Benjamin Carlin was born on 27 July 1912 in [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]], [[Western Australia]], a small town in the state's [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]].

Upon the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Carlin enlisted in the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]].

===''Half-Safe'' and early preparation===
[[File:BenAndElinoreCarlin01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Carlins during the early stages of preparation for their journey]]
Throughout the war, [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] had made use of a number of different varieties of [[amphibious vehicle]]. One of the more commonly used was the [[Ford GPA]], a modified version of the [[Ford GPW]] [[Jeep]] (also known as a "Seep").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4wdonline.com/Mil/Seep/Seep.html Amphibious Jeep] – 4wdonline.

This increased the total fuel capacity of ''Half-Safe'' to 735 gallons (3,337 L), with the vessel also carrying 30 gallons (136 L) of water, eight gallons (36 L) of oil, and six weeks' worth of provisions.&lt;ref name="amphibious vehicles"/&gt; The couple left Halifax on 19 July 1950, and, after a 32-day voyage, arrived on [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]], the most westerly island of the Azores.&lt;ref name="ambitious amphibious"/&gt; Their landing was well-received, with ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'' featuring the crossing in a multiple-page article later that year, which also featured many of the Carlins' photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Time Inc| title = LIFE| url = https://books.google.com/?id=AEwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA149| date = 20 November 1950| publisher = Time Inc| page = 149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the journey had not occurred without mishap – Carlin was forced to remove the cylinder head several times in order to clean the carbon from the valves and replace the head [[gasket]], and the couple lost radio contact halfway through the voyage, leading to fears they had been lost at sea.

From Cap Juby, the Carlins drove north through the coastal regions of Morocco to Europe. The hot daytime temperatures, which reportedly reached {{convert|170|F|C}} within the vehicle's cabin, necessitated that ''Half-Safe'' be driven exclusively at night.&lt;ref name="armymotors"/&gt; The vehicle reached [[Casablanca]], [[French Morocco]], on 16 March 1951, and the British territory of [[Gibraltar]] in mid April, after it was sailed across the [[Straits of Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18209630 Sea-going Jeep Turns Up At Gibraltar] – ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.

===Europe and the Middle East===
[[File:HalfSafe02 – Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Carlins and ''Half-Safe'' were greeted by a large crowd upon landing in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], in 1951.]]

Tired, weary, and lacking in money, the Carlins decided to remain in England to rest and recuperate. Throughout the journey from Nova Scotia to the Azores, both Carlin and his wife had suffered from severe [[hallucination]]s, including one instance where he had jerked awake to find himself 60° off course.&lt;ref name="buckingham"/&gt; Another important objective of their time in Britain was to repair ''Half-Safe'', which had sustained large amounts of damage during the crossing, not least from [[1950 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Charlie|Hurricane Charlie]], which battered the vessel whilst it was amongst the islands of [[Macaronesia]]. The repairs to the craft were accomplished with the help of [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] Group Captain Malcolm Bunting, who had served alongside Carlin in India. To raise money for the continuation of the journey, ''Half-Safe'' was exhibited in [[department stores]] throughout Europe. During this time, Carlin also completed ''Half Safe: Across the Atlantic by Jeep'', a book chronicling the first half of their journey, which sold 32,000 copies and was translated into five languages.&lt;ref name="ambitious amphibious"/&gt; The book was generally well received, with a reviewer in ''[[The Montreal Gazette]]'' describing Carlin as "an adventurer of the old school – full of the explorer's instinct, and with a dry wit that makes his story an odd mixture of high-adventure and real understatement".&lt;ref&gt;Timmins, Terry (1955).

The Carlins set out again in early 1955, arriving in France on 22 April 1955.&lt;ref name="the jeep"/&gt; The vehicle continued through [[Switzerland]], [[northern Italy]], and [[Yugoslavia]], where in May 1955, it was reported that ''Half-Safe'' had had its first [[flat tire]], whilst travelling through [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/2063165502.html?FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=May+07%2C+1955&amp;author=&amp;pub=Daily+Boston+Globe+%281928-1960%29&amp;desc=Round-World+Jeep+Gets+First+Flat+Tire&amp;pqatl=google Round-World Jeep Gets First Flat Tire] – ''[[Boston Globe]]''.

Published 2 November 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; At Calcutta, the Carlins decided to transport ''Half-Safe'' to [[Australia]] via steamer. At the start of his voyage, Carlin had said he would not travel to Australia or New Zealand, because petrol was "too dear" there.&lt;ref name="circle the world"/&gt; However, a lack of funding meant the side trip was necessary. The trip also allowed Carlin to meet with his family, who still lived in Perth – his brother, Tom Carlin, had become a [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in the [[Royal Australian Navy]], and was actively involved in [[nuclear weapons testing]] on the [[Montebello Islands]] in 1952, as part of [[Operation Hurricane]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49028697 R.A.N.

===Far East and return to North America===
''Half-Safe''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Australian tour began in late October 1955 in Perth, where Carlin grew up, and included a tour of his old school, Guildford Grammar. The Carlins then went to [[Adelaide]], and subsequently progressed to [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], and [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref name="age"/&gt; ''Half-Safe'' was returned to Calcutta on a steamship in January 1956. However, Elinore, Carlin's wife, left the trip in Australia, having finally tired of the long travel and the constant seasickness she was experiencing.&lt;ref name="amphibious vehicles"/&gt; Carlin continued his journey alone, with the first leg consisting of a sea voyage from Calcutta to [[Akyab]], [[Burma]], across the [[Bay of Bengal]]. At Akyab, he was joined by Barry Hanley, another Australian. The two met on Burma's coast in late February 1956, and from there crossed the [[Arakan Yoma]] mountain ranges to the [[Irrawaddy River]], where the vehicle was bogged down in mud for two days. After extricating ''Half-Safe'' from the mire, the pair progressed to [[Rangoon]], arriving on 11 March.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YjlVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hZUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3858,1810379&amp;dq=ben-carlin&amp;hl=en "Half Safe" in Rangoon After Adventurous Trip]" – ''[[The Age]]''.

After the conclusion of the trip, ''Half-Safe'' remained in the United States, where it was occasionally exhibited by Carlin's friend George Calimer, who was a co-owner of the vehicle. Carlin remained in the country for a period, appearing on the lecture circuit, before returning to Perth, where he took up residence in [[Cottesloe, Western Australia|Cottesloe]]. Having divorced his second wife Elinore by December 1955, Carlin wed for a third time on 1 June 1963 in the United States, marrying Cynthia Henderson. Although the couple's marriage was short-lived, the union produced one daughter, Deirdre Scott Carlin, who was born in March 1964.&lt;ref name="personal glimpse"/&gt; Carlin died in Perth in March 1981, of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and was [[Cremation|cremated]] at [[Karrakatta Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="personal glimpse"/&gt; His second wife, Elinore, who completed the first half of his journey alongside him, died in 1996 in New York City.&lt;ref name="armymotors"/&gt; Carlin left his share in ''Half-Safe'' to his old school, Guildford Grammar, as well as a sizeable endowment for the purposes of funding a scholarship.

'''C/2013 V5''' (Oukaimeden) is a [[Retrograde motion|retrograde]] [[Oort cloud]] [[comet]] discovered on 12 November 2013 by Oukaimeden Observatory at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 19.4 using a {{convert|0.5|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2013-V95"/&gt;

From 5 May 2014 until 18 July 2014 it had an [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] less than 30 degrees from the Sun.&lt;ref name="MPC"/&gt; By late August 2014 it had brighten to [[apparent magnitude]] 8&lt;ref name="Yoshida140823"/&gt; making it a small telescope and high-end [[binoculars]] target for experienced observers. It crossed the [[celestial equator]] on 30 August 2014 becoming a [[southern hemisphere]] object.&lt;ref name="MPC"/&gt; On 16 September 2014 the comet passed {{convert|0.480|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; The comet peaked around magnitude 6.2 in mid-September 2014&lt;ref name="Yoshida140920"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoshida"/&gt; but only had an [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] of about 35 degrees from the Sun.&lt;ref name="MPC"/&gt; On 20 September 2014 the comet was visible in [[STEREO|STEREO HI-1B]].&lt;ref name=STEREO/&gt; The comet came to [[Apsis|perihelion]] (closest approach to the Sun) on 28 September 2014 at a distance of {{convert|0.625|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the Sun.&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-J58"/&gt;

C/2013 V5 is dynamically new. It came from the [[Oort cloud]] with a loosely bound chaotic orbit that was easily perturbed by [[galactic tide]]s and [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passing stars]]. Before entering the planetary region ([[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] 1950), C/2013 V5 had an orbital period of several million years.&lt;ref name=barycenter/&gt; After leaving the planetary region (epoch 2050), it will have an orbital period of about 6000 years.&lt;ref name=barycenter/&gt;

'''Charles Clyde Bowden''' (July 20, 1945 – August 30, 2014) was an American non-fiction author, journalist and essayist based in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Diaz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lannan.org/bios/charles-bowden|title=Charles Bowden - Lannan Foundation|last=Diaz|first=Alex|website=www.lannan.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
He attended the [[University of Arizona]] and then the [[University of Wisconsin System|University of Wisconsin]], where he obtained his master's degree in American intellectual history; while there he walked out as he was defending his dissertation for his doctorate, annoyed by the questions asked him by the review committee.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/books/charles-bowden-lyrical-writer-dies-at-69.html|title=Charles Bowden, Author With Unblinking Eye on Southwest, Dies at 69|last=Yardley|first=William|date=2014-09-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He  was a writer for the ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'' and often wrote about the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. He was a contributing editor of ''[[GQ]]'' and ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/authors/charles-bowden|title=Charles Bowden|website=motherjones|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote for other periodicals including ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[High Country News]]'', and ''[[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]]''.

Bowden was the winner of the 1996 [[Lannan Literary Awards|Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction]],&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt; and a 2010 award from [[United States Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/Home/index.cfm United States Artists Official Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110032536/http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/Home/index.cfm |date=November 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-et-jc-charles-bowden-dies-20140831-story.html|title=Charles Bowden dies at 69; author known for writing on border issues|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He grew up in [[Chicago]] but lived most of his life in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Richard|title=A Sense of Chuck|url=http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/charles-bowden-and-the-refuge-of-the-senses/|website=[[Aeon (digital magazine)]]|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his writings on the situation at the [[Mexico–United States border|US–Mexico border]] and wrote often about the effects of the [[War on Drugs]] on the lives of the people in that region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He died in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on August 30, 2014, after a brief illness. He was survived by his son and two siblings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Dewbow on a spiderweb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dewbow on a spiderweb]]

A '''dewbow''' is an [[optical effect]], similar to a [[rainbow]], where [[dew]]drops instead of rain droplets reflect and disperse sunlight.&lt;ref name="Boyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/dewbow.htm|title=Dewbow|last=Boyle|first=Kevin |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summary of Dewbows"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlop|first=Storm|title=Weather|publisher=Collins|year=2009|pages=151|isbn=978-0-00-784141-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Dewbows can be seen on fields covered with dew, when the sun shines. Dew forms outdoors in the early morning after a clear night, when the surface temperature drops below the [[dew point]]. It forms most easily on surfaces that are isolated from conducted heat from deep ground, such as grass, leaves, and spider webs. Dew bows will be clearest on fields littered with cobwebs, as may occur in autumn. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=optics&amp;subcat=dew_bow|title=Dew bow |last=Edens|first=Harald  |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shape==
A ''rainbow'' is perceived as a circle in the sky; and its contributing light rays form a cone. In contrast, a ''dewbow'' is perceived as the intersection of that cone and the ground. If the ground is flat and horizontal, and the sun is low in the sky, the dew bow is a [[hyperbola]]. Theoretically, when the sun is high, the intersection might be another [[conic section]], like a [[parabola]] or an [[ellipse]].&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt; However, dew usually evaporates before the sun is high. Nonetheless, an elliptical dew bow was captured on camera, when at night the full moon, high in the sky, illuminated a field loaded with dew.&lt;ref name="Großmann"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atoptics.wordpress.com/author/atoptics/page/10/|title=Dew bow|last=Großmann|first=Michael |accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EnergyTransformation.gif|thumb|380px|right|Energy Transformation using [[Energy Systems Language]]]] 
'''Energy  transformation''', also termed as '''energy conversion''', is the process of changing [[energy]] from one of its [[forms of energy|form]]s into another.  In [[physics]], '''energy''' is a [[physical quantity|quantity]] that provides the capacity to perform many works—think of lifting or warming an object.  In addition to being convertible, energy is transferable to a different location or object, but it [[Conservation of energy|cannot]] be created or destroyed.

Energy in many of its forms may be used in natural processes, or to provide some service to society such  as heating, refrigeration, lighting  or performing mechanical work to operate machines. For example, in order to [[heat]] your home, your furnace can burn fuel, whose [[chemical energy|chemical potential energy]]  is thus converted into thermal energy, which is then transferred to your home's air in order to raise its temperature.

In another example, an [[internal combustion engine]] burns gasoline to create pressure that pushes the pistons, thus performing [[Work (physics)|work]] in order to accelerate your vehicle, ultimately converting the fuel's chemical energy to your vehicle's additional [[kinetic energy]] corresponding to its increase in speed.

== Entropy and limitations in conversion of thermal energy to other types ==
Conversions to thermal energy (thus raising the temperature) from other forms of energy, may occur with essentially 100% efficiency{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} (many types %, such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in vacuum, or when an object orbits nearer or farther from another object, in space.

Though, conversion of thermal energy to other forms, thus reducing the temperature of a system, has strict limitations, often keeping its efficiency much less than 100% (even when energy is not allowed to escape from the system). This is because thermal energy has already been partly spread out among many available states of a collection of microscopic particles constituting the system, which can have enormous numbers of possible combinations of momentum and position (these combinations are said to form a [[phase space]]). In such circumstances, a measure called [[entropy]], or evening-out of energy distributions, dictates that future states of an isolated system must be of at least equal evenness in energy distribution. In other words, there is no way to ''concentrate'' energy without spreading out energy somewhere else.

Thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states. Such energy is sometimes considered "degraded energy," because it is not entirely convertible a "useful" form, i.e. one that can do more than just affect temperature. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] is a way of stating that, for this reason, thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100%, only if the entropy (even-ness or disorder) of the universe is increased by other means, to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content. Otherwise, only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy (and thus, useful work), since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature, in such a way that the increase in [[Entropy]] for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy...... 
Examples

== Transformation of kinetic energy of charged particles to electric energy ==
In order to make energy transformation more efficient, it is desirable to avoid thermal conversion. For example, the efficiency of nuclear energy reactors, where the kinetic energy of the nuclei is first converted to thermal energy and then to electric energy, lies around 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunbar|first1=W.|last2=Mooby|first2=S.|last3=et.|first3=al.|title=Exergy analysis of an operating boiling-water-reactor nuclear power station|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|date=1995|volume=36|doi=10.1016/0196-8904(94)00054-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=P.D.|title=.The Nuclear Fuel Cycle: From Ore to Waste|date=1996|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; By direct conversion of kinetic energy to electric energy, i.e. by eliminating the intermediate thermal energy transformation, the efficiency of the energy transformation process can be dramatically improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shinn|first1=E.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Nuclear energy conversion with stacks of graphene nanocapacitors|journal=Complexity|date=2012|doi=10.1002/cplx.21427|bibcode=2013Cmplx..18c..24S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of energy transformation from the early universe==
Energy transformations in the universe over time are (generally) characterized by various kinds of energy which have been available since the [[Big Bang]], later being "released" (that is, transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is available to do it.

'''Release of energy from gravitational potential:''' A direct transformation of energy occurs when hydrogen produced in the Big Bang collects into structures such as planets, in a process during which part of the gravitational potential is to be converted directly into heat. In [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and [[Neptune]], for example, such heat from continued collapse of the planets' large gas atmospheres continues to drive most of the planets' weather systems, with atmospheric bands, winds, and powerful storms which are only partly powered by sunlight, however, on [[Uranus]], little of this process occurs.

On [[Earth]], a significant portion of the heat output from the interior of the planet, estimated at a third to half of the total, is caused by the slow collapse of planetary materials to a smaller size, with the output of gravitationally driven heat.

'''Release of energy from radioactive potential:''' Familiar examples of other such processes transforming energy from the Big Bang include nuclear decay, which releases energy that was originally "stored" in heavy isotopes, such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]. This energy was stored at the time of the [[nucleosynthesis]] of these elements, a process which ultimately uses the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of [[Type II supernova]]e, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the [[Solar System]] and the Earth. Such energy locked into uranium is triggered for sudden-release in [[nuclear fission]] bombs, and similar stored energies in atomic nuclei are released spontaneously, during most types of [[radioactive decay]]. In such processes, heat from decay of these atoms of [[radioisotope]] in the core of the Earth is transformed immediately to heat. This heat in turn may lift mountains, via [[plate tectonics]] and [[orogenesis]]. This slow lifting of terrain thus represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the heat energy. The stored potential energy may be released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored [[elastic potential energy]] in rocks, a kind of mechanical [[potential energy]] which has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources.

Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy which has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field, or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, the energy represented by these events had been stored in heavy atoms (or in the gravitational potential of the Earth). The energy stored in heat atoms had been stored as potential ever since the time that gravitational potentials transforming energy in the collapse of long-destroyed stars (supernovae) created these atoms, and in doing so, stored the energy within.

'''Release of energy from hydrogen fusion potential:''' In a similar chain of transformations beginning at the dawn of the universe, [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in the Sun releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This resulted in hydrogen representing a store of potential energy which can be released by [[nuclear fusion]]. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from the gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) snow-avalanches, or when water evaporates from oceans and is deposited high above sea level (where, after being released at a [[hydroelectric dam]], it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena on Earth. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a [[hurricane]], which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by green plants as ''chemical potential energy'', when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen. Release of this energy as heat and light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire; or it may be available more slowly for animal or human [[metabolism]], when these molecules are ingested, and [[catabolism]] is triggered by enzyme action.

Through all of these transformation chains, potential energy stored at the time of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being stored in a number of different ways for long periods of time between releases, as more active energy. All of these events involve the conversion of one kind of energy into others, including heat.

== Examples ==

===Examples of sets of energy conversions in machines===
For instance, a [[coal]]-fired power plant involves these energy transformations:
#[[Chemical energy]] in the coal converted to [[thermal energy]] in the exhaust gases of combustion.
#Thermal energy of the exhaust gases converted into thermal energy of steam through the heat exchanger.
#Thermal energy of steam converted to mechanical energy in the turbine.
#Mechanical energy of the turbine converted to electrical energy by the generator, which is the ultimate output
In such a system, the first and fourth step are highly efficient, but the second and third steps are less efficient.  The most efficient gas-fired electrical power stations can achieve 50% conversion efficiency.  Oil- and coal-fired stations achieve less.

In a conventional [[automobile]], these energy transformations are involved:
#Chemical energy in the fuel converted to kinetic energy of expanding gas via combustion
#Kinetic energy of expanding gas converted to linear piston movement
#Linear piston movement converted to rotary crankshaft movement
#Rotary crankshaft movement passed into transmission assembly
#Rotary movement passed out of transmission assembly
#Rotary movement passed through differential
#Rotary movement passed out of differential to drive wheels
#Rotary movement of drive wheels converted to linear motion of the vehicle.

===Other energy conversions===

There are many different machines and [[transducer]]s that convert one energy form into another. A short list of examples follows:
* [[Thermoelectric]] ([[Heat]] → [[Electric energy]])
* [[Geothermal power]] (Heat→ Electric energy)

}}

'''Green flashes''' and '''green rays''' are [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] that sometimes occur just after [[sunset]] or right before [[sunrise]]. When the conditions are right, a distinct green spot is briefly visible above the upper rim of the [[Sun]]'s disk; the green appearance usually lasts for no more than a second or two. Rarely, the green flash can resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset (or sunrise) point.

Green flashes occur because the [[Earth's atmosphere]] can cause the light from the sun to separate out into different colors. Green flashes are a group of similar phenomena which stem from slightly different causes, and therefore some types of green flashes are more common than others.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

==Observing==

Green flashes may be observed from any altitude. They usually are seen at an unobstructed [[horizon]], such as over the ocean, but are possible over cloud tops and mountain tops as well. They may occur at any latitude, although at the equator the flash rarely lasts longer than a second.&lt;ref name="lits"/&gt;

A green flash also may be observed in association with the [[Moon]] and bright planets at the horizon, including [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="lits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nave|first=C.R.|title=Red Sunset, Green Flash|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html|work=Georgia State University|publisher=HyperPhysics|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=D.J.K.|title=The green flash and other low sun phenomena|journal=Castel Gandolfo: Vatican Observatory, Ricerche Astronomiche|date=1958|volume=4|page=7|publisher=Harvard|bibcode=1958RA......4.....O}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an unrestricted view of the horizon, green flashes are regularly seen by airline [[pilot (aircraft)|pilot]]s, particularly when flying westwards as the sunset is slowed.&lt;ref name="lits"/&gt; If the atmosphere is layered the green flash may appear as a series of flashes.&lt;ref name="lits"/&gt;

While observing at the [[Vatican Observatory]] in 1960, D.K.J. O'Connell produced the first color photographs of a green flash at sunset.&lt;ref name="lits"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lights in the Sky: Identifying and Understanding Astronomical and Meteorological Phenomena |last=Maunder |first=Michael |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=1846287618 |pages=72–73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqv5G6O1rFUC |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==

Green flashes are enhanced by [[Mirage of astronomical objects]] mirage, which increases [[refraction]]. A green flash is more likely to be seen in stable, clear air, when more of the light from the setting sun reaches the observer without being scattered. One might expect to see a blue flash, since blue light is refracted most of all, and the blue component of the sun's light is therefore the very last to disappear below the horizon, but the blue is preferentially scattered out of the line of sight, and the remaining light ends up appearing green. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

With slight [[magnification]], a green rim on the top of the [[sun|solar disk]] may be seen on most clear-day sunsets, although the flash or ray effects require a stronger layering of the atmosphere and a mirage, which serves to magnify the green from a fraction of a second to a couple of seconds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Types==

The "green flash" description relates to a group of optical phenomena, some of which are listed below:&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news | author=Young, A. | url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html | title=Green flashes at a glance | date=2006 | work=San Diego State University page | accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type !! Characteristics !! Conditions !! Best seen from...
|- style="background:mintcream"
| Inferior-mirage flash || Joule's "last glimpse"; oval, flattened below; lasts 1 or 2 seconds || Surface warmer than the overlying air || Close to sea level
|-
| Mock-mirage flash || Indentations seem to "pinch off" a thin, pointy strip from the upper rim of the Sun; lasts 1 or 2 seconds || Atmospheric inversion layer below eye level; surface colder than air || The higher the eye, the more likely; flash is most obvious when the eye is just above the inversion.
|- style="background:mintcream"
| Sub-[[Atmospheric duct|duct]] flash || Large upper part of an [[hourglass]]-shaped Sun turns green for up to 15 seconds; || Observer below a strong [[Inversion (meteorology)|atmospheric inversion]] || In a narrow height interval just below a duct (can occur at any height)
|-
| Green ray || Green beam of light either shooting up or seen immediately after sundown; usually few degrees long, lasting several seconds || Hazy air and a bright green flash acting as a light source || Sea level
|}

The majority of flashes observed are inferior-mirage or mock-mirage effects, with the others constituting only 1% of reports. Some types not listed in the table above, such as the cloud-top flash (seen as the sun sinks into a coastal [[fog]], or at distant [[cumulus cloud]]s), are not understood.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

===Blue flashes===

{{Distinguish|Blue glow}}
Rarely, the amount of blue light is sufficient to be visible as a "blue flash".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/greenflash.shtml The Green Flash], BBC Weather online. Retrieved on 2009-05-07. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828102353/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/greenflash.shtml |date=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation for the blue flash has not yet been identified.

===Green rim===

[[Image:Green rim of the setting sun.jpg|thumb|The upper rim is green while the lower one is red, as the sun sets behind the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]]]
[[Image:Green rim and green flashes in SF.jpg|thumb|The green rim and flashes of a setting sun]]
As an [[astronomical object]] sets or rises in relation to the horizon, the light it emits travels through Earth's [[atmosphere]], which works as a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] separating the light into different colors. The color of the upper rim of an astronomical object could go from green to blue to violet depending on the decrease in concentration of [[Air pollution|pollutants]], as they spread throughout an increasing volume of atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Dispersive refraction"&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/13B.html Dispersive refraction] by webexhibits.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower rim of an astronomical object is always red.&lt;br&gt;A green rim is very thin and is difficult or impossible to see with the naked eye. In usual conditions, a green rim of an astronomical object gets fainter when an astronomical object is very low above the [[horizon]] because of atmospheric reddening,&lt;ref name="Green and red rims"/&gt; but sometimes the conditions are right to see a green rim just above the horizon. The following quote describes what was probably the longest observation of a green rim, which at times could have been a green flash. It was seen on and off for 35 minutes by members of the [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] party from the Antarctic [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America exploration base]] in 1934:

{{quote|There was a rush for the surface and as eyes turned southward, they saw a tiny but brilliant green spot where the last ray of the upper rim of the sun hung on the skyline. It lasted an appreciable length of time, several seconds at least, and no sooner disappeared than it flashed forth again. Altogether it remained on the horizon with short interruptions for thirty-five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;When it disappeared momentarily it seemed to have been shut off by a tiny spurt, an inequality in the skyline caused by the barrier surface.&lt;br /&gt;Even by moving the head up a few inches it would disappear and reappear again and after it had finally disappeared from view it could be recaptured by climbing up the first few steps of the {{sic|[[antenna (radio)|antanea]]}} post.&lt;ref name="byrd"&gt;{{cite news|first=Russell|last=Owen|
title=Explorers see phenomenon in Pole area: Byrd party watches `Green Flash' blaze in sky at Little America|
newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|page=5|date=23 October 1929}} as quoted in {{cite web|
url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/bibliog/bibliog.html|title=Annotated bibliography of mirages, green flashes, atmospheric refraction, etc.|
first=Andrew T.|last=Young  |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the explorers to have seen a green rim on and off for 35 minutes there must have been some mirage effect present.

A green rim is present at every sunset but it is too thin to be seen with the naked eye. Often a green rim changes to a green flash and back again during the same sunset. The best time to observe a green rim is about 10 minutes before sunset.&lt;ref name="Green and red rims"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/explain/simulations/std/rims.html Green and red rims] by Andrew T. Young.&lt;/ref&gt; That is too early to use any [[magnification]] like [[binoculars]] or a [[telescope]] to look directly at the Sun without potential harm to the eyes. (Of course, a magnified image might be projected onto a sheet of paper for safe viewing.) As the sun gets closer to the horizon, the green rim becomes fainter due to atmospheric reddening.&lt;ref name="Green and red rims"/&gt; According to the above, it is probably correct to conclude that although a green rim is present during every sunset, a green flash is rarer because of the required [[mirage of astronomical objects|mirage]].

==In popular culture==

[[Jules Verne]]'s 1882 novel ''[[The Green Ray]]'' helped to popularize the green flash phenomenon. A 1986 film also called [[The Green Ray (film)|''The Green Ray'']] uses the green flash and Verne's book as a plot device. Additionally, the green flash has inspired or been mentioned in:

*[[Victoria Holt]]'s 1976 novel ''Pride of the Peacock'', which uses both the green flash and an [[opal]] named for the phenomenon as plot devices
*[[William S. Burroughs]]' 1981 novel ''[[Cities of the Red Night]]''
*''The Green Ray'', a piece of orchestral music composed by [[Gavin Bryars]] and first performed in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Green Ray|url=http://www.gavinbryars.com/work/composition/green-ray|website=Gavin Bryars|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'', a 2007 film that features green flashes as a plot point.
*In the Tacita Dean's video "The green ray", a shoot of the phenomenon to an artproject in Tate Modern Gallery.

{{merge to|Geothermal heat pump|discuss=Geothermal heat pump#Heat Exchanger merger|date=December 2017}}

Ground heat exchangers (GHEs), which are also called geothermal heat exchangers, have emerged as a promising and globally accepted way of exploiting shallow [[geothermal energy]], for example ground-coupled heat pumps, ground heat storage. A GHE is essentially a pipe (e.g., U-, W-, or helical-shaped) in a vertical borehole or a foundation pile of a building, in which a circulating heat-carrying fluid absorbs (or discharges) heat from (or to) the ground.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;Li M, Lai ACK. Review of analytical models for heat transfer by vertical ground heat exchangers (GHEs): A perspective of time and space scales, Applied Energy 2015; 151: 178-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hellstrom G. Ground heat storage – thermal analysis of duct storage systems I. Theory. Lund: University of Lund; 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
GHEs can have various configurations. This article discusses two kinds of closed loop GHEs, i.e., borehole and foundation pile GHEs. The [[borehole]] type is the most common. It consists of one or two U-shaped pipes that are inserted into a vertical borehole and connected to a heat pump or a heating system to form a closed loop. A U-shaped channel usually comprises two small-diameter high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes thermally fused to form a U-shaped bend at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE. ASHRAE handbook: HVAC applications. Atlanta: ASHRAE, Inc; 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The space between the wall of the borehole and the U-shaped tubes is usually grouted completely with grouting material or, in some cases, partially filled with groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh SK, Rafferty K. Ground-source heat pumps: Design of geothermal systems for commercial and institutional buildings. Atlanta, GA: American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.; 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The depth of the hole (generally from 30 m to 200 m) depends strongly on local geological conditions and available drilling equipment.
In a foundation pile GHE (or energy pile), the heat transfer tubes are inside the steel frame of a foundation pile. There are various possible shapes. Foundation piles are usually much shallower than boreholes and have a greater radius. Since energy piles generally require less land area, this technology is evoking increasing interest in the ground-source heat pumps community.

== Analysis of heat transfer by GHEs ==
A huge challenge in predicting the thermal response of a GHE is the diversity of the time and space scales involved.Four space scales and eight time scales are involved in the heat transfer of GHEs. The first space scale having practical importance is the diameter of the borehole (~ 0.1 m) and the associated time is on the order of 1 hr, during which the effect of the heat capacity of the backfilling material is significant. The second important space dimension is the half distance between two adjacent boreholes, which is on the order of several meters. The corresponding time is on the order of a month, during which the thermal interaction between adjacent boreholes is important. The largest space scale can be tens of meters or more, such as the half length of a borehole and the horizontal scale of a GHE cluster. The time scale involved is as long as the lifetime of a GHE (decades).&lt;ref&gt;Li M, Li P, Chan V, Lai ACK. Full-scale temperature response function (G-function) for heat transfer by borehole ground heat exchangers (GHEs) from sub-hour to decades. Appl Energy 2014; 136: 197-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The short-term hourly temperature response of the ground is vital for analyzing the energy of ground-source heat pump systems and for their optimum control and operation. By contrast, the long-term response determines the overall feasibility of a system from the standpoint of life cycle. Addressing the complete spectrum of time scales require vast computational resources.

=== Formalization of the heat transfer problem ===
The main questions that engineers may ask in the early stages of designing a GHE are (a) what the heat transfer rate of a GHE as a function of time is, given a particular temperature difference between the circulating fluid and the ground, and (b) what the temperature difference as a function of time is, given a required heat exchange rate. In the language of heat transfer, the two questions can probably be expressed as
&lt;math&gt;q_l = [T_f(t) - T_0]/R(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the average temperature of the circulating fluid, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective, undisturbed temperature of the ground, ''q&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the heat transfer rate of the GHE per unit time per unit length (W/m), and ''R'' is the total thermal resistance (m'''&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;'''K/W).''R''(''t'') is often an unknown variable that needs to be determined by heat transfer analysis. Despite ''R''(''t'') being a function of time, analytical models exclusively decompose it into a time-independent part and a time-dependent part to simplify the analysis.

Various models for the time-independent and time-dependent R can be found in the references.&lt;ref name="Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H"/&gt;

Though not of particularly high elevation for the region, Hesperus Mountain is visually quite prominent, as it is near the southern edge of the [[San Juan Mountains]] and rises over {{convert|7000|ft|abbr=on}} above the area.

Hesperus is notable as the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] People's Sacred Mountain of the North, ''{{spell-nv|Dibé Ntsaa}}'', which marks the northern boundary of the [[Dinetah]], their traditional homeland. It is associated with the color black, and is said to be impregnated with [[jet (lignite)|jet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22251">{{short description|Low environmental oxygen levels}}
'''Hypoxia''' refers to low [[oxygen]] conditions. Normally, 20.9% of the gas in the atmosphere is oxygen. The [[partial pressure]] of oxygen in the atmosphere is 20.9% of the total barometric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brandon|first=John|title=The Atmosphere, Pressure and Forces|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/av_weather/meteo/atmos.htm|work=Meteorology|publisher=Pilot Friend|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In water however, oxygen levels are much lower, approximately 1%, and fluctuate locally depending on the presence of photosynthetic organisms and relative distance to the surface (if there is more oxygen in the air, it will diffuse across the [[pressure gradient|partial pressure gradient]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dissolved Oxygen |url=http://www.waterontheweb.org/under/waterquality/oxygen.html |work=Water Quality |publisher=Water on the Web |accessdate=21 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213101908/http://www.waterontheweb.org/under/waterquality/oxygen.html |archivedate=13 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atmospheric hypoxia==

Atmospheric hypoxia occurs naturally at high [[altitude]]s. Total [[atmospheric pressure]] decreases as altitude increases, causing a lower partial pressure of oxygen which is defined as [[hypobaric]] hypoxia. Oxygen remains at 20.9% of the total gas mixture, differing from [[hypoxic hypoxia]], where the percentage of oxygen in the air (or blood) is decreased. This is common, for example, in the sealed burrows of some subterranean animals, such as [[blesmol]]s.&lt;ref name=Roper2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roper, T.J.| year = 2001 | title = Environmental conditions in burrows of two species of African mole-rat, ''Georychus capensis'' and ''Cryptomys damarensis'' | journal = Journal of Zoology | volume = 254 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–107 | doi = 10.1017/S0952836901000590|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atmospheric hypoxia is also the basis of [[altitude training]] which is a standard part of training for elite athletes. Several companies mimic hypoxia using normobaric [[artificial atmosphere]].

==Aquatic hypoxia==
'''Oxygen depletion''' is a phenomenon that occurs in aquatic environments as [[oxygen|dissolved oxygen]] ('''DO'''; molecular oxygen dissolved in the water) becomes reduced in concentration to a point where it becomes detrimental to aquatic organisms living in the system. Dissolved oxygen is typically expressed as a percentage of the oxygen that would dissolve in the water at the prevailing temperature and salinity (both of which affect the solubility of oxygen in water; see [[oxygen saturation]] and [[underwater]]). An aquatic system lacking dissolved oxygen (0% saturation) is termed anaerobic, [[Reducing environment|reducing]], or '''[[Anoxic waters|anoxic]]'''; a system with low concentration&amp;mdash;in the range between 1 and 30% saturation&amp;mdash;is called '''hypoxic''' or '''dysoxic'''. Most fish cannot live below 30% saturation. Hypoxia leads to impaired reproduction of remaining fish via [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Wu, R. et al. 2003. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231277909_Aquatic_Hypoxia_Is_an_Endocrine_Disruptor_and_Impairs_Fish_Reproduction Aquatic Hypoxia Is an Endocrine Disruptor and Impairs Fish Reproduction]&lt;/ref&gt; A "healthy" aquatic environment should seldom experience less than 80%. The '''exaerobic''' zone is found at the boundary of anoxic and hypoxic zones.

Hypoxia can occur throughout the water column and also at high altitudes as well as near sediments on the bottom. It usually extends throughout 20-50% of the water column, but depending on the water depth and location of pycnoclines (rapid changes in water density with depth). It can occur in 10-80% of the water column. For example, in a 10-meter water column, it can reach up to 2 meters below the surface. In a 20-meter water column, it can extend up to 8 meters below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Rabalais, Nancy; Turner, R. Eugene; Justic´, Dubravko; Dortch, Quay; Wiseman, William J. Jr. Characterization of Hypoxia: Topic 1 Report for the Integrated Assessment on Hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Ch. 3. NOAA Coastal Ocean Program, Decision Analysis Series No. 15. May 1999. &lt; http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/products/hypox_t1final.pdf &gt;. Retrieved February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of hypoxia ===
[[File:Decline of oxygen saturation to anoxia at night Kiel Fjord Germany.png|thumb|250px|left|Decline of oxygen saturation to anoxia, measured during the night in [[Kiel Fjord]], Germany. Depth = 5 m]]
Oxygen depletion can result from a number of natural factors, but is most often a concern as a consequence of [[pollution]] and [[eutrophication]] in which [[Nutrients#Nutrients and the environment|plant nutrients]] enter a river, lake, or ocean, and [[phytoplankton]] blooms are encouraged. While phytoplankton, through [[photosynthesis]], will raise DO saturation during daylight hours, the dense population of a [[Algal bloom|bloom]] reduces DO saturation during the night by [[cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|respiration]]. When phytoplankton cells die, they sink towards the bottom and are decomposed by [[bacterium|bacteria]], a process that further reduces DO in the water column. If oxygen depletion progresses to hypoxia, [[fish kill]]s can occur and invertebrates like [[worm]]s and [[clam]]s on the bottom may be killed as well.
[[Image:Fishkillk.jpg|thumb|left|Still frame from an underwater video of the sea floor. The floor is covered with crabs, fish, and clams apparently dead or dying from oxygen depletion.]]

Hypoxia may also occur in the absence of pollutants. In estuaries, for example, because freshwater flowing from a river into the sea is less dense than salt water, stratification in the water column can result. Vertical mixing between the water bodies is therefore reduced, restricting the supply of oxygen from the surface waters to the more saline bottom waters. The oxygen concentration in the bottom layer may then become low enough for hypoxia to occur. Areas particularly prone to this include shallow waters of semi-enclosed water bodies such as the [[Waddenzee]] or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], where land run-off is substantial. In these areas a so-called "[[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]" can be created. Low dissolved oxygen conditions are often seasonal, as is the case in [[Hood Canal]] and areas of [[Puget Sound]], in Washington State.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Puget Sound: Hypoxia http://www.eopugetsound.org/science-review/section-4-dissolved-oxygen-hypoxia&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Resources Institute]] has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones around the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Jubilee-Mobile-Bay-Alabama-crabs-flounders.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Mobile Bay jubilee|Jubilee]] photo from [[Mobile Bay]]]] Hypoxia may also be the explanation for periodic phenomena such as the [[Mobile Bay jubilee]], where aquatic life suddenly rushes to the shallows, perhaps trying to escape oxygen-depleted water. Recent widespread shellfish kills near the coasts of Oregon and Washington are also blamed on cyclic [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]] ecology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2006/Aug06/dieoff.html oregonstate.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901192135/http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2006/Aug06/dieoff.html |date=2006-09-01 }} &amp;ndash; Dead Zone Causing a Wave of Death Off Oregon Coast (8/9/2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phytoplankton breakdown ====
Scientists have determined that high concentrations of minerals dumped into bodies of water causes significant growth of phytoplankton blooms. As these blooms are broken down by bacteria, such as ''Phanerochaete chrysosprium'', oxygen is depleted by the enzymes of these organisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gubernatorova|first=T.

===== Breakdown of lignin =====
[[File:Tetrapyrrol ring.png|left|thumb|234x234px|Tetrapyrrol ring, the active site of Ligninperoxidase enzyme]]
Phytoplankton are mostly made up of lignin and cellulose, which are broken down by enzymes present in organisms such as ''P. chrysosprium'', known as white-rot''.'' However, the breakdown of cellulose does not deplete oxygen concentration in water, whereas breakdown of lignin does. This breakdown of lignin includes an oxidative mechanism, and requires the presence of dissolved oxygen to take place by enzymes like ligninperoxidase. Other fungi such as brown-rot, soft-rot, and blue stain fungi also are necessary in lignin transformation. As this oxidation takes place, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is formed in its place&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Active site of tetrapyrrol ring binding oxygen.png|thumb|392x392px|Active site of tetrapyrrol ring binding oxygen]]
[[File:Oxyferroheme is converted to Ferri-LiP with the addition of veratric alcohol, and gives off diatomic oxygen radical..png|thumb|392x392px|Oxyferroheme is converted to Ferri-LiP with the addition of veratric alcohol, and gives off diatomic oxygen radical.]]
[[File:Breakdown of coniferyl alcohol.png|thumb|393x393px|This is the breakdown of a confieryl alcohol by a hydrogen ion to make propanol and ortho-methoxyphenol.]]
Ligninperoxidase (LiP) serves as the most import enzyme because it is best at breaking down lignin in these organisms. LiP disrupts C-C bonds and C-O bonds within Lignin’s three-dimensional structure, causing it to break down. LiP consists of ten alpha helices, two Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; structural ions, as well as a heme group called a tetrapyrrol ring. Oxygen serves an important role in the catalytic cycle of LiP to form a double bond on the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in the tetrapyrrol ring. Without the presence of diatomic oxygen in the water, this breakdown cannot take place because Ferrin-LiP will not be reduced into Oxyferroheme. Oxygen gas is used to reduce Ferrin-LiP into Oxyferroheme-LiP. Oxyferroheme and veratric alcohol combine to create oxygen radical and Ferri-LiP, which can now be used to degrade lignin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Oxygen radicals cannot be used in the environment, and are harmful in high presence in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betteridge|first=D. John|title=What is oxidative stress?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0026-0495(00)80077-3|journal=Metabolism|volume=49|issue=2|pages=3–8|doi=10.1016/s0026-0495(00)80077-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Ferri-LiP is present in the ligninperoxidase, it can be used to break down lignin molecules by removing one phenylpropane group at a time through either the LRET mechanism or the mediator mechanism. The LRET mechanism (long range electron transfer mechanism) transfers an electron from the tetrapyrrol ring onto a molecule of phenylpropane in a lignin. This electron moves onto a C-C or C-O bond to break one phenylpropane molecule from the lignin, breaking it down by removing one phenylpropane at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the mediator mechanism, LiP enzyme is activated by the addition of hydrogen peroxide to make LiP radical, and a mediator such as veratric alcohol is added and activated creating veratric alcohol radical. Veratric alcohol radical transfers one electron to activate the phenylpropane on lignin, and the electron dismantles a C-C or C-O bond to release one phenylpropane from the lignin. As the size of a lignin molecule increases, the more difficult it is to break these C-C or C-O bonds. Three types of phenyl propane rings include coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and-coumaryl alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

LiP has a very low MolDock score, meaning there is little energy required to form this enzyme and stabilize it to carry out reactions. LiP has a MolDock score of -156.03 kcal/mol. This is energetically favorable due to its negative free energy requirements, and therefore this reaction catalyzed by LiP is likely to take place spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Ming|last2=Zeng|first2=Guangming|last3=Tan|first3=Zhongyang|last4=Jiang|first4=Min|last5=Li|first5=Hui|last6=Liu|first6=Lifeng|last7=Zhu|first7=Yi|last8=Yu|first8=Zhen|last9=Wei|first9=Zhen|date=2011-09-29|title=Understanding Lignin-Degrading Reactions of Ligninolytic Enzymes: Binding Affinity and Interactional Profile|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025647|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=9|pages=e25647|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0025647|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breakdown of propanol and phenols occur naturally in the environment because they are both water soluble.

===== Environmental factors =====
The breakdown of phytoplankton in the environment depends on the presence of oxygen, and once oxygen is no longer in the bodies of water, ligninperoxidases cannot continue to break down the lignin. When oxygen is not present in the water, the breakdown of phytoplankton changes from 10.7 days to a total of 160 days for this to take place.

The rate of phytoplankton breakdown can be represented using this equation:

&lt;math&gt;G(t) = G(0)e^{-kt}&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, G(t) is the amount of particulate organic carbon (POC) overall at a given time, t. G(0) is the concentration of POC before breakdown takes place. k is a rate constant in year-1, and t is time in years. For most POC of phytoplankton, the k is around 12.8 years-1, or about 28 days for nearly 96% of carbon to be broken down in these systems. Whereas for anoxic systems, POC breakdown takes 125 days, over four times longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=H. Rodger|date=|title=Kinetics of phytoplankton decay during simulated sedimentation: Changes in biochemical composition and microbial activity under oxic and anoxic conditions|url=|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=59|pages=3367–3377|via=|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(95)00217-n}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes approximately 1&amp;nbsp;mg of Oxygen to break down 1&amp;nbsp;mg of POC in the environment, and therefore, hypoxia takes place quickly as oxygen is used up quickly to digest POC. About 9% of POC in phytoplankton can be broken down in a single day at 18&amp;nbsp;°C, therefore it takes about eleven days to completely break down a full phytoplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jewell|first=William J.|date=|title=Aquatic Weed Decay: Dissolved Oxygen Utilization and Nitrogen and Phosphorus Regeneration|url=|journal=ournal (Water Pollution Control Federation)|volume=43|pages=1457–1467|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After POC is broken down, this particulate matter can be turned into other dissolved organic carbon, such as carbon dioxide, bicarbonate ions, and carbonate. As much as 30% of phytoplankton can be broken down into dissolved organic carbon. When this particulate organic carbon interacts with 350&amp;nbsp;nm ultraviolet light, dissolved organic carbon is formed, removing even more oxygen from the environment in the forms of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate ions, and carbonate. Dissolved inorganic carbon is made at a rate of 2.3-6.5&amp;nbsp;mg/(m^3)day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johannessen|first=Sophia C.|last2=Peña|first2=M. Angelica|last3=Quenneville|first3=Melanie L.|title=Photochemical production of carbon dioxide during a coastal phytoplankton bloom|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2007.01.006|journal=Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science|volume=73|issue=1-2|pages=236–242|doi=10.1016/j.ecss.2007.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As phytoplankton breakdown, free phosphorus and nitrogen become available in the environment, which also fosters hypoxic conditions. As the breakdown of these phytoplankton takes place, the more phosphorus turns into phosphates, and nitrogens turn into nitrates. This depletes the oxygen even more so in the environment, further creating hypoxic zones in higher quantities. As more minerals such as phosphorus and nitrogen are displaced into these aquatic systems, the growth of phytoplankton greatly increases, and after their death, hypoxic zones are formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conley|first=Daniel J.|last2=Paerl|first2=Hans W.|last3=Howarth|first3=Robert W.|last4=Boesch|first4=Donald F.|last5=Seitzinger|first5=Sybil P.|last6=Havens|first6=Karl E.|last7=Lancelot|first7=Christiane|last8=Likens|first8=Gene E.|date=2009-02-20|title=Controlling Eutrophication: Nitrogen and Phosphorus|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5917/1014|journal=Science|language=en|volume=323|issue=5917|pages=1014–1015|doi=10.1126/science.1167755|issn=0036-8075|pmid=19229022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat hypoxia, it is essential to reduce the amount of land-derived nutrients reaching rivers in runoff. This can be done by improving sewage treatment and by reducing the amount of fertilizers leaching into the rivers. Alternately, this can be done by restoring natural environments along a river; marshes are particularly effective in reducing the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen (nutrients) in water. Other natural habitat-based solutions include restoration of shellfish populations, such as oysters. [[Oyster]] reefs remove [[nitrogen]] from the water column and filter out suspended solids, subsequently reducing the likelihood or extent of [[harmful algal blooms]] or anoxic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Timm (2012) [http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/oyster-restoration-study-kroeger.pdf Dollars and Sense: Economic Benefits and Impacts from two Oyster Reef Restoration Projects in the Northern Gulf of Mexico]. TNC Report.&lt;/ref&gt; Foundational work toward the idea of improving marine water quality through shellfish cultivation was conducted by Odd Lindahl et al., using mussels in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Technological solutions are also possible, such as that used in the redeveloped [[Salford Docks]] area of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in England, where years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters. In 2001 a compressed air injection system was introduced, which raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%. The resulting improvement in water quality led to an increase in the number of invertebrate species, such as freshwater [[shrimp]], to more than 30. [[spawn (biology)|Spawning]] and growth rates of fish species such as [[Rutilus|roach]] and [[perch]] also increased to such an extent that they are now amongst the highest in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mangeogsoc.org.uk/egm/5_1.pdf|accessdate=2007-12-11|date=2003-08-21|format=pdf|title= Exploring Greater Manchester&amp;nbsp;— a fieldwork guide: The fluvioglacial gravel ridges of Salford and flooding on the River Irwell|author= Hindle, P.(1998)|publisher=Manchester Geographical Society}} p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In a very short time the [[oxygen saturation]] can drop to zero when offshore blowing winds drive surface water out and anoxic depth water rises up. At the same time a decline in temperature and a rise in salinity is observed (from the longterm ecological observatory in the [[sea]]s at Kiel Fjord, Germany). New approaches of long-term monitoring of oxygen regime in the ocean observe online the [[behavior]] of [[fish]] and [[zooplankton]], which changes drastically under reduced [[oxygen saturation]]s ([[ecoSCOPE]]) and already at very low levels of [[water pollution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6595">'''John James Rowlands''' (19 June 1892 – 16 November 1972) was a journalist, writer, and outdoorsman noted for his works about nature and wood lore.

==Life and career==

He was born in [[Aberdeen, North Carolina]], the son of John Rowlands, and Catharine Stewart Stevenson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/FZR3-6HC ''North Carolina Births and Christenings, 1866-1964''] FamilySearch. Accessed 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Registres Photographiés au Greffe de Québec''. Québec Cathedrale Anglicane, Vital and Church Records (Drouin Collection), 1621-1967; 1891. AncestryLibrary.com. Accessed 12 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Staunton Military Academy]], [[Fishburne Military School]], and Meisterschaft College in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Killian"&gt;[[James Rhyne Killian|Killian, James Rhyne]]. (1985) ''The Education of a College President'', [[MIT Press]], pp. 322-3.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, manager of the Tarbell Lumber Company, moved the family to Canada to supervise a lumber camp. From 1910 until 1916 Rowlands worked as a prospector and surveyor in the [[Cobalt Silver Rush|Cobalt]] and [[Porcupine Gold Rush|Porcupine Mining]] regions in [[Northern Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Message"&gt;Rowlands, John J. (February 1944) "The Indian's Message" in ''The Atlantic'', pp. 107-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Train"&gt;Rowlands, John J. (August 1948) "Train to Moose Factory" in ''The Atlantic'', pp. 42-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Autumn 1911, Rowlands had finished a prospecting assignment and took a job testing the performance of a military [[Gig (carriage)|gig]] through 100 miles of rough country. He hired a guide named Chief Tibeash (c. 1841 – 9 September 1917), a [[Cree]] Indian trapper. After the completion of the journey, he stayed with Tibeash for a month at his cabin near Larger Lake, and they became close friends. Over the next five years he periodically visited Tibeash, who taught Rowlands the Cree way of living in the north country. The relationship culminated with Tibeash offering to adopt Rowlands, but he had already decided to return to the states to pursue a journalism career. The news of Tibeash's death came to Rowlands in a letter from a friend in Northern Ontario.&lt;ref name="Message"/&gt;

In 1916 he left Canada to join the staff of [[The Republican (Springfield)|''The Springfield Union'']].&lt;ref name="Message"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lobdell, H. E., ed. (2 December 1929) [http://www.technologyreview.com/magazine/magpdfdownload.aspx?s=T&amp;id=731 "The Tabular View"]. ''The Technology Review''. 32:2, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; From there he went to the [[United Press International|United Press]] in New York, eventually becoming the manager of the New England bureau in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;"Rowlands to Quit MIT Post". (1 July 1957). ''The Lowell Sun'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He gained some small notoriety as being the first person to bring the news of President [[Warren G. Harding]]'s death to Vice President [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="Killian"/&gt;

In 1923 he went to the ''National Sportsman'' magazine. In 1925 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] created the MIT News Service to provide "dignified publicity" about the school, naming Rowlands as its first director responsible for writing and distributing news releases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/mithistory/institute/offices/mit-news-office/ "MIT News Office"]. Institute Archives, MIT Libraries. Accessed 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;Obituary. (19 November 1972) ''[[New York Times]]'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 he was made an honorary member of the Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT.&lt;ref&gt;[https://alum.mit.edu/sites/default/files/IC_assets/volunteering/docs/2012_Honorary_Members.pdf Honorary Members of the Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT]. MIT Alumni Association. Accessed 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 1957 and built a house on the coast in [[Cohasset, Massachusetts]]. The life change instigated a period of reflection, resulting in a series of essays that were published in book form titled ''Spindrift'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Special to the ''NYTimes.'' (30 June 1957) "Two at M.I.T. Retire: Dr. Bunker and J.J. Rowlands, Press Chief, to Leave." ''New York Times'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borland, Hal, "Bay State Seascapes" (11 September 1960) ''New York Times'', p. B10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He died in Boston.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

==''Cache Lake Country''==

Throughout his life, Rowlands contributed articles and stories about outdoors woodcraft and his experiences to such magazines as the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' and ''[[Boys' Life]]''. He wrote two books, and he is most noted for his first book, ''Cache Lake Country: Life in the North Woods'', a fictionalized account of his experiences with Chief Tibeash in the lake country of the North Ontario woods, originally written between 1945 and 1947 as a series of letters available by subscription for $1 a month.&lt;ref name="Killian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burack, A.S. "Writing for Money" in ''How to Make Money at Home'', Polly Webster, ed. (1949). Whittlesey House, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Boys’ Life''. Boys Scouts of America. XXXV:11 (November 1945), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowlands and his friend and MIT colleague, the illustrator and photographer [[Henry B. Kane]], who illustrated both of Rowlands' books, would take periodic trips to Northern Canada, and Rowlands added Kane as a character in the book.&lt;ref name="Killian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Train"/&gt;

The book was published in 1947 by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] and in England by [[Adam and Charles Black]] the following year. Norton reissued in 1953 in a slightly smaller format as the Wilderness Edition, with a two-page foreword by Rowlands, and in paperback in 1978. Lyons &amp; Burford reissued the book in 1990 with an introduction by [[Verlyn Klinkenborg]], and in 1998 it was again reissued by Countryman Press, an imprint of Norton, with subsequent printings.&lt;ref&gt;Schwert.

The '''Kabaw Valley''' is a highland valley in northern [[Burma]] (Myanmar), western [[Sagaing]] division. The valley is the home of a number of ethnic minorities including the [[Meitei people|Meitei]] (Kathe and Paona), the [[Zo (people)|Zo]], the [[Mizo people|Mizo]], the Kadu and the Kanan.

==History==
Kabaw valley, historically, was the border region between Awa ( in present Burma ) and the [[Manipur Kingdom]] ( Earlier known as Kangleipak or Meitrabak). King Khomba (1432–1467) of Kangleipak was the conqueror of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Tamu, Myanmar|Tamu]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, a border town in kabow valley, now in Myanmar. King Kiyamba (1467–1508), son of King Khomba, was known as the "Conqueror of Kabaw Valley", as he along with his friend, Chaopha Khe Khomba, the king of Pong (Shan Kingdom) of present Myanmar, conquered Kyang, a Shan kingdom in the Kabow Valley of present Myanmar. 

It first came under the Burmese rule in 1560 when [[Toungoo Dynasty]] invaded the border valley. Many Shan people fled into Manipur, unable to defend themselves from the Burmese and the Chinese invaders. King Khagemba (1597–1652) of Kangleipak, known as the "Conqueror of the Chinese" (''khagi'': China, ''Ngamba'': conqueror), consolidated and expanded his father's kingdom of Meitrabak, later successfully defending it from foreign invaders such as the Muslims, the Kachari and the Awas. 

Everything was recorded in the meitei sacred book "The Puyas" known as the Cheitharol Kumbaba, or the royal chronicle of Manipur, started recording from 33 AD. But after the reign of King Khagemba, the Cheitharol Kumbaba was reformed by adding months in the events recorded, making the dates more accurate. 

The reign of King Charairongba (1697–1709) became the transition period from traditional Meitei culture to a Hinduised Meitei society. There were continual trade contacts and social relationships between Manipur and Burma. In 1702, the Toongoo dynasty of Awa (Burma) sent emissaries asking for the hand of a Meitei Princess. Charirongba gave his daughter, Chakpa Makhao Ngambi, in marriage to the then Burmese King who constructed several laishangs/ temples for Meitei deities such as [[Panthoibi]], [[Sanamahi]], today converted into Buddhist temples. 

King Pamheiba (1709-1748), the successor of Charairongba, rose to prominence as a fierce military conqueror. His reign can be divided into three phases. The first phase (1710–17) focused on internal consolidation of the hill tribes. Phase two (1728–33) involved war against the Burmese kingdom of Awa. And, the third and final phase (1745–48) saw a war against [[Tripura]], now in northeast India. As a result, Pamheiba extended his kingdom from the [[Kabow Valley]] in the east as far as Nongnang ([[Cachar]]) and Takhel (Tripura) in the west. Starting in 1724, he began frequent raids of Upper Burma until 1749.

The [[Konbaung Dynasty]] recovered the Kabaw valley from Manipur in 1756. In 1758, the Burmese king [[Alaungpaya]] invaded Manipur. In 1759, King Maramba aka Gourashyam (1953-1958), gave up the throne in favour of his brother Chingthang Khomba aka Bhagayachandra who restored normalcy in the kingdom and tried to regain the lost glory of Manipur. In 1764, the new Burmese king [[Hsinbyushin]] invaded Manipur again through the Kabaw Valley. The Meitei forces were defeated at Tamu and the king fled to the Ahom kingdom in Assam. He regained the throne of Kangleipak in 1768 with help of the then Ahom king Rajeshwar and went on to rule for more than 30 years, signing a treaty with the British East India Company in 1762. Manipur remained a rebellion-prone tributary, prompting the Burmese to send expeditions in 1764–1765, 1768–1770, and 1775–1782. Manipur became a Burmese territory again in 1814, and was taken back in 1819 after a rebellion.&lt;ref name="mmb"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Making of Modern Burma | author=Thant Myint-U | year=2001 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=9780521799140 | pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="app-233"&gt;{{cite book | title=History of Burma | author=Lt. Gen. Sir Arthur P. Phayre | year=1967 | pages=233–234 | edition=2 | publisher=Susil Gupta | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were a number of wars during this era between the Manipuris, the Burmese and the British. 

With the help from the Burmese kingdom of Awa, Marjit invaded Manipur in 1813 and defeated his brother King Chaurajit (1803-1813). He then ascended the throne in 1813 and ruled for six years (1813–1819). The new king of Awa, [[Bagyidaw]], invited King Marjit of Manipur to attend his coronation ceremony and to pay homage to him. King Marjit refused to attend the coronation, which offended the Burmese king, who then sent a large force under the command of General Maha Bandula to humble Marjit. Marjit was defeated and fled to Cachar. Meitrabak was then brought under the brutal rule of Awa for the seven years between 1819 and 1826, which is known as Chahi Taret Kuntakpa (7 years devastation )in the history of Meitrabak. The flight of King Marjit from Meitrabak and the conquest by Awa in 1819 marks the end of the mediaeval period in the history of Manipur. 

In the early nineteenth century, after being dislodged from Meitrabak, Manipur princes made Cachar a springboard for the reconquest of the territory. In 1819, three Manipuri princes occupied Cachar Kingdom and drove King Govinda Chandra out to [[Sylhet]] in present Bangladesh. The kingdom of Cachar, divided between Govinda Chandra and Chaurajit in 1818, was repartitioned after the flight of Govind Chandra among the three Meitrabak princes. King Chaurajit ruled the eastern portion of Cachar bordering Meitrabak from [[Sonai]]. King Gambhir Singh was given the land west of [[Tillain]] hill and his headquarters was at Gumrah. King Marjit Singh ruled Hailakandi from [[Jhapirbond]]. King Gambhir Singh (1826–1834) with the 500 strong Meetei [[Conscription|Levy]] and with the help from the British East India Company, succeeded in expelling the Burmese of Awa from Meitrabak beyond the Ningthi Turel ([[Chindwin River]]). He ruled the country from Langthabal and died on 9 January 1834, to be succeeded by his infant son Chandrakirti / Ningthem Pishak (1834–1844).

After the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–1826), Burma ceded Manipur to the British but the exact border remained in dispute.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, D. G. E. (1950) "Chapter XIII: The First Residency and the Annexation of Pegu (1826-1855)" [http://mission.itu.ch/MISSIONS/Myanmar/Burma/bur_history.pdf ''Burma''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050519230755/http://mission.itu.ch/MISSIONS/Myanmar/Burma/bur_history.pdf |date=2005-05-19 }} Hutchinson University Library, London, p. 108, {{OCLC|513262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British claimed the entire Kabaw valley. However, in 1830, the British, with the assistance of [[Henry Burney]], agreed that Kabaw valley was not part of historical Manipur, and redrew the border in favor of the Burmese.&lt;ref&gt;Bečka, Jan (1995) ''Historical Dictionary of Myanmar'' Scarecrow Press, Metuchen, New Jersey, p. 56, {{ISBN|0-8108-2840-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, some in Manipur still claim that the Kabaw Valley belongs in Manipur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=10..080311.mar11 "Kabaw Valley was an Integral Part of Manipur: BJP State Unit"] ''The Sangai Express'' 7 March 2011, the Newmai News Network, Imphal, Manipur, India&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty of yadanbo made sure that the Burmese King must pay Kabaw valley compensation tax to the Manipuri King.

Manipur was merged in the Indian union in 1949, during the reign of the last king, Bodhachandra, just two year after getting independence from the British rule for 57 years (1891-1947). In 1952, India first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru completely gifted the Kabaw valley to the Burmese government as a token of peace. In 1950, a social leader of Manipur, Hijam Irabot visited Burma and negotiated with the Burmese army political fraction, coming with an agreement to stop the Burmese tax to Manipur government and let Manipur have Kabaw valley. But, the compensation tax is no longer paid and the valley is under Myanmar territory now.

==Communities==
At the north end of the valley, lies the Manipuri town of [[Humine]], with the first Burmese town being Zedi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/burma/txu-oclc-6924198-ng46-16.jpg "Burma 1:250,000 topographic map, Series U542, Paungbyin, NG 46-16"] U.S. Army Map Service, November 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tarapot lists the towns of Kahambat, Woktong, Tammu, Mungsa and Samjok at Tarapot, Phanjoubam (2003) ''Bleeding Manipur'' Har-Anand Publications, New Delhi, India, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FsUJ0E3BXkMC&amp;pg=PA222 page 222], {{ISBN|81-241-0902-8}}, but aside from Tammu being [[Tamu, Burma|Tamu]], identification of them is difficult.&lt;/ref&gt; The region is mixedly inhabited by the Meeteis, Nepalis, kukis/ chins, kados, kanans,etc.

[[Moreh]] is the border town in the Manipuri / Indian side while [[Tamu, Myanmar|Tamu]] is in Myanmar.Both are being referred to as the twin border towns of trade in the region.

'''Keystone''' is a type of [[limestone]], or [[coral rag]], quarried in the [[Florida Keys]], in particular from [[Windley Key]] [[fossil]] quarry, which is now a [[Windley Key Fossil Reef Geological State Park|State Park]] of [[Florida]].  The limestone is [[Pleistocene]] in age, and the rock primarily consists of [[Scleractinia|scleractinian]] coral, such as [[Elkhorn coral]] and [[Brain coral]].

The Hurricane Monument, commemorating victims of the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]], and located at mile marker 82 on [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. Route 1]] near [[Islamorada, Florida|Islamorada]], is constructed of keystone, as is the [[David W.

'''Kitsat-3''' was a [[South Korea]]n [[remote sensing]] [[Miniaturized satellite#Microsatellites|minisatellite]] which carried MEIS (Multispectral Earth Imaging System) and SENSE (Space ENvironment Scientific Experiment) instruments to [[Low Earth orbit]]. Launched on 26 May 1999 by [[India]]n space agency [[ISRO]], on [[orbit]] the satellite was renamed to '''Uribyol 3'''. Manufactured by [[KAIST Satellite Technology Research Center]] (SaTReC), Kitsat-3 was developed with experience from [[Kitsat-1]] and [[Kitsat-2]] (no heritage to the Kitsat-1 and Kitsat-2 bus) and was the first independently designed South Korean [[satellite]].&lt;ref name="KITSAT series – KITSAT-3"&gt;{{cite news|title=KITSAT series – KITSAT-3|publisher=[[KAIST Satellite Technology Research Center]]|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://satrec.kaist.ac.kr/e_02_01_02.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KITSAT-3"&gt;{{cite news|title=KITSAT-3|publisher=eoportal.org|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/k/kitsat-3#foot15%29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitsat 3 (Uribyol 3)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kitsat 3 (Uribyol 3)|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/kitsat-3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitsat 3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kitsat 3|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1999-029B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
Kitsat-3 was launched in the [[PSLV-C2]] mission by 26 May 1999 by [[India]]n space agency [[ISRO]] at 06:22 [[UTC]] from [[Sriharikota Launching Range]] in India. The launch was the first commercial launch by ISRO of its [[expendable launch system]] ([[PSLV-C2|PSLV]]) and $1.0 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1|1999|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) was charged by the Indian agency for launching and injecting the satellite in the [[Low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name="The science and commerce of PSLV "&gt;{{cite news|title=The science and commerce of PSLV |publisher=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1612/16120370.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission highlights==
*First independently designed [[South Korea]]n [[satellite]].
*First commercial flight of the [[expendable launch system]], [[PSLV]].
*Spacecraft attitude was first captured and 3-axis stabilized on 30 May 1999.
*First image obtained on 31 May 1999.

'''La Niña''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɑː|ˈ|n|iː|n|j|ə|}}, {{IPA-es|la ˈniɲa}}) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that is the counterpart of [[El Niño]] as part of the broader [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] [[climate pattern]]. The name La Niña originates from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], meaning "the little girl", analogous to El Niño meaning "the little boy". It has also in the past been called ''anti-El Niño'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html|title=What are El Nino and La Nina?|date=|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and El Viejo (meaning "the old man").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/elnino/la-nina-story.html|title=What is La Niña?|author=Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project|date=2008-03-24|accessdate=2009-07-17|publisher=Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a period of La Niña, the [[sea surface temperature]] across the equatorial Eastern Central [[Pacific Ocean]] will be lower than normal by 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;°C.  In the United States, an ''appearance'' of La Niña persists for at least five months.

La Niña is the positive phase of the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] and is associated with cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Climate Influences: La Niña|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each country and island nation has a different threshold for what constitutes a La Niña event, which is tailored to their specific interests.&lt;ref name="December 2014 EU"&gt;{{cite web|date=4 December 2014|title=December's ENSO Update: Close, but no cigar|archivedate=3 April 2016|author1=Becker, Emily|url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/decembers-enso-update-close-no-cigar|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gVGgNf0S?url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/decembers-enso-update-close-no-cigar|website=ENSO Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] looks at the trade winds, SOI, weather models and sea surface temperatures in the Niño 3 and 3.4 regions before declaring that a La Niña event has started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENSO Tracker: About ENSO and the Tracker|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/tracker/#tabs=About-ENSO-and-the-Tracker|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] declares that a La Niña event has started when the average five-month sea surface temperature deviation for the NINO.3 region is more than {{convert|0.5|C-change}} cooler for 6 consecutive months or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical El Niño and La Niña Events|accessdate=April 4, 2016|url=http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/elnino/ensoevents.html|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A timeline of all La Niña episodes between 1900 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensoyears.shtml |title= Cold and warm episodes by season |accessdate=12 January 2011 |publisher=Climate Prediction Center NOAA |cite= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/lnlist/index.shtml |title= La Niña – Detailed Australian Analysis |accessdate=3 April 2016 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

There was a relatively strong La Niña episode during 1988–1989. La Niña also formed in late 1983,&lt;ref name="La Niña and Winter Weather"/&gt; in 1995, and a protracted La Niña event that lasted from mid-1998 through early 2001. This was followed by a neutral period between 2001 and 2002. The La Niña which developed in mid-2007, and lasted until almost 2009, was a moderate one. The strength of La Niña made the [[2008 Atlantic hurricane season]] one of the five most active since 1944; sixteen named storms had winds of at least {{convert|39|mi/h|km/h}}, eight of which became {{convert|74|mi/h|km/h|adj=mid}} or greater hurricanes.&lt;ref name="Sullivan10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-06/el-nino-warming-will-fade-out-by-june-u-s-says-update1-.html|title=El Niño Warning Will Fade Out by June, U.S. Says (Update 1)|date=2010-05-06|accessdate=2010-05-31|author=Brian K. Sullivan|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new La Niña episode developed quite quickly in the eastern and central tropical Pacific in mid-2010,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and lasted until early 2011.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.html | title=ENSO Diagnostic Discussion | work=NOAA's Climate Prediction Center | accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It intensified again in mid-2011 and lasted until early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110908_lanina.html | title=La Niña is back | work=NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center | date=8 September 2011 | accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This La Niña, combined with record-high ocean temperatures in the north-eastern [[Indian Ocean]], was a large factor in the [[2010–2011 Queensland floods]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/hi/news/newsid_9340000/9340513.stm | work=BBC News | title=Why is Queensland flooded? | date=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the quartet of recent heavy snowstorms in North America starting with the [[December 2010 North American blizzard]]. The same La Niña event was also a likely cause of a series of tornadoes of above-average severity that struck the Midwestern and Southern United States in the spring of 2011, and drought conditions in the South Central states including Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-04-tornadoes-climate.html | title=Tornadoes whipped up by wind, not climate: officials | publisher=www.physorg.com | accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a series of major storms caused extensive flooding in California in December 2010, with seven consecutive days of non-stop rainfall, leading to one of the wettest Decembers in over 120 years of records. This is in contrast to the drier-than-normal conditions typically associated with La Niña in California, especially in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnrfc.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/dec2010storms.php |title= Heavy Precipitation Event California and Nevada December 16 – 23, 2010 |accessdate=8 November 2014 |publisher=California Nevada River Forecast Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, on a global scale, La Niña events helped keep the average global temperature below recent trends. As a result, 2011 tied with 1997 for the eleventh-warmest year on record. It was the second-coolest year of the 21st century to date, and tied with the second-warmest year of the 20th century. A relatively strong phase of La Niña opened the year, dissipated in the spring before re-emerging in October and lasted through the end of the year. When compared to previous La Niña years, the 2011 global surface temperature was the warmest observed. The 2011 globally-averaged precipitation over land was the second-wettest year on record, behind 2010. Precipitation varied greatly across the globe. This La Niña contributed to severe drought in [[East Africa]] and to Australia's third-wettest year in its 112-year period of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2012/20120119_global_stats.html |title= NOAA: 2011 a year of climate extremes in the United States |accessdate=22 January 2012 |publisher=Climate Prediction Center NOAA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts on the global climate==
La Niña impacts the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns, which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others.&lt;ref name="NIWA El Niño/La Niña"&gt;{{cite web|title=El Niño and La Niña|url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/climate/information-and-resources/elnino|publisher=New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gg0KMM8L?url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/climate/information-and-resources/elnino|archivedate=11 April 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional impacts==
Observations of La Niña events since 1950, show that impacts associated with La Niña events depend on what season it is.&lt;ref name="Cascade"&gt;{{cite web|deadurl=no|date=19 May 2014|title=How ENSO leads to a cascade of global impacts|author1=Barnston, Anthony|website=ENSO Blog|url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/united-states-el-ni%C3%B1o-impacts-0|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hHtGSj2e?url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/united-states-el-ni%C3%B1o-impacts-0|archivedate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events, it is not certain or guaranteed that they will occur.&lt;ref name="Cascade"/&gt;

During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, along with the subtropical ridge position, shifts westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to [[China]].&lt;ref name="China"&gt;M.

===North America===
[[File:La Nina regional impacts.gif|thumb|256px|Regional impacts of La Niña.]]
La Niña causes mostly the opposite effects of El Niño, above-average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] across the northern Midwest, the northern Rockies, Northern California, and the Pacific Northwest's southern and eastern regions. Meanwhile, precipitation in the southwestern and southeastern states, as well as Southern California, is below average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.html |title=ENSO Diagnostic Discussion |work=Climate Prediction Center |date=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also allows for the development of many stronger-than-average hurricanes in the Atlantic and fewer in the Pacific.

The [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] condition for [[Tehuantepecer]] winds is associated with [[high-pressure system]] forming in [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca|Sierra Madre]] of Mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front, which causes winds to accelerate through the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts, between October and February, with a summer maximum in July caused by the westward extension of the Azores-Bermuda high pressure system. Wind magnitude is weaker during La Niña years than [[El Niño]] years, due to the less frequent cold frontal incursions during La Niña winters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rosario Romero-Centeno |author2=Jorge Zavala-Hidalgo |author3=Artemio Gallegos |author4=James J.

However, in the last two decades, nontraditional La Niña were observed, in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly (Niño 1 and 2) is not affected, but an anomaly arises in the central Pacific (Niño 3.4).&lt;ref name="Larkin2007"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2005GL022738| title = On the definition of El Niño and associated seasonal average U.S. Weather anomalies| year = 2005| last1 = Larkin | first1 = N.

The effects of the CP La Niña are different from those of the traditional EP La Niña—e.g., the recently discovered La Niña leads to a rainfall increase over [[North West Australia|northwestern Australia]] and northern [[Murray-Darling basin]], rather than over the east as in a conventional La Niña.&lt;ref name="LNModoki"/&gt; Also, La Niña Modoki increases the frequency of cyclonic storms over [[Bay of Bengal]], but decreases the occurrence of severe storms in the [[Indian Ocean]] overall, with the [[Arabian Sea]] becoming severely non-conductive to tropical cyclone formation.&lt;ref name="CPC ENSO"&gt;{{cite web | author = M R Ramesh Kumar | publisher = Society for Environmental Communications | title = El Nino, La Nina and the Indian sub-continent  | url = http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/el-nino-la-nina-and-indian-sub-continent | date = 2014-04-23 | accessdate = 2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian LMN"&gt;{{cite journal | author1 =  K G Sumesh | author2 = M R Ramesh Kumar | publisher = Indian Journal of Geo-Marine Sciences | title = Tropical cyclones over NIO during La-Niña Modoki years  | url = http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/34843/1/IJMS%2044%287%29%20977-983.pdf | format = pdf | date = 2014-03-10 | accessdate = 2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On June 19, a [[Sunoco]] pipeline leaked more than 33,000 gallons of gasoline into a creek, near [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. PHMSA said it first learned of the spill on the evening of June 19 from a “private citizen” who reported a petroleum odor at Darby Creek. About two-thirds of the spill was recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/09/04/sunocos-12-inch-pipeline-leaked-33000-gallons-of-gasoline-into-creek-phmsa-says/|title=Sunoco’s 12-inch pipeline leaked 33,000 gallons of gasoline into creek, PHMSA says - StateImpact Pennsylvania|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[waterways]]''', defined as navigable [[river]]s, [[canal]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]], [[lake]]s, or [[firth]]s. In practice, and depending on the language, the term "waterway" covers maritime or inland transport routes, as suggested by "way". Wherever a free-flowing river cannot bear load-carrying vessels, the correct term is "watercourse", with no connotation of use for transportation of cargo. To be of practical use, the list distinguishes international maritime waterways (including ship canals), international inland waterways, then inland waterways, including canals and large lakes.

{{Update|date=January 2010}}
}}
As of 2005, [[Azerbaijan]] produced a range of metals and industrial minerals, including [[aluminum]], [[lead]], [[iron]], and [[zinc]].

Azerbaijan's importance as a world mineral producer, however, was based on its [[petroleum]] extracting industry. The country has been a significant oil producer for more than a century, but recent focus has been on developing offshore resources in the [[Caspian Sea]]. Production from the country’s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era fields are in decline, but since independence, foreign direct investment in offshore fields had revitalized the oil sector through the development of large-scale new projects and the refurbishment of older ones. In 2005, Azerbaijan had signed more than 20 major agreements to develop oilfields with approximately 30 companies from 15 countries.&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;Richard M. Levine and Glenn J. Wallace. [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2006/myb3-2006-af.pdf "The Mineral Industries of the Commonwealth of Independent States"]. ''2005 Minerals Yearbook''. [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (December 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oil extraction]] and refining accounted for more than 75% of the value of industrial production. The oil extraction and refining sectors and the [[metallurgy]] and metal fabrication sectors employed more than 60,000 people in 2005. The country was becoming a major producer of oil, producing far more than it consumed, but its [[natural gas]] production in 2005 was still significantly below its consumption. The country was increasing its steel products production at the [[Baku]] Steel company, a privately owned company that produced steel products from steel scrap.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

==Production==
In 2005, production increased for practically all mineral commodities. Crude petroleum production increased by more than 43% compared with that of 2004. The country was developing its steel industry, although it is still on a small scale.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

==Trade==
Fuels accounted for 76% of the value of exports in 2005. The country’s major export was crude petroleum, almost all of which was sold on world markets rather than supplied to other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries. Other mineral exports included petroleum refinery products and alumina. The country imported a variety of mineral commodities, including natural gas.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

==Mineral resources==
Azerbaijan’s major mineral wealth is its oil and gas reserves. Offshore [[hydrocarbon]] structures in the Caspian Sea accounted for most of the country’s oil and gas production. Azerbaijan’s proven [[crude oil]] reserves were estimated to range from 7 billion to 13 billion barrels (Gbbl) [or from about 950 million metric tons (Mt) to 1.8 billion metric tons (Gt)] based on various industry journals and Government sources. The State Oil Company of the [[Azerbaijan]] Republic (SOCAR) has estimated that proven reserves are 17.5 Gbbl (about 2.4 Gt) using the Soviet reserve classification system. This evaluation was not based on market economy criteria and may include resources that are not economically viable. Estimates of natural gas reserves also vary. According to the Oil &amp; Gas Journal, Azerbaijan has proven natural gas reserves of roughly 30 trillion cubic feet (about 850 billion cubic meters, and BP p.l.c. estimates that the country has 48 trillion cubic feet (about 1.4 trillion cubic meters) of proven gas reserves.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

==Outlook==
Although some effort has been made to promote balanced mineral development of all the country’s mineral resources, the country’s economic development has depended primarily on the development of its large offshore oil and gas resources. These resources are expected to be the country’s chief source of revenue for the coming decades.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

In 2004, Azerbaijan exported approximately {{convert|211000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of oil. Exports are expected to more than double to {{convert|478000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in 2006 and to reach as high as {{convert|1.1|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} by 2008.

Azerbaijan was a net natural gas importer in 2005. The country is expected to become a significant gas exporter following the development of the Shah Deniz natural gas deposit, which is considered to be one of the world’s largest natural gas field discoveries of the past 20 years. According to [[BP]] (the project operator), Shah Deniz has potential recoverable reserves of about 15 trillion cubic feet (about 424 billion cubic meters) of natural gas and {{convert|600|Moilbbl|m3}}—about 82 Mt] of condensate. Other industry and trade sources have estimated that the field contains as much as {{convert|35|Tcuft|km3}} of gas. The field is being developed by the Shah Deniz consortium, whose members include BP, LukAgip, [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NICO) International, SOCAR, Statoil ASA of Norway, TotalFinaElf, and Türkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortaklig (TPAO) of Turkey.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

In the first phase of the Shah Deniz field’s development, production of natural gas for export was expected to begin in late 2006. In the second phase, according to BP, the Shah Deniz project could produce an additional {{convert|1|Tcuft|km3}} per year of natural gas by as early as 2015.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

Although Azerbaijan lacks any infrastructure for the export of natural gas, efforts were underway to secure export routes and customers for gas deliveries beginning in 2006. The main conduit for Azerbaijan’s natural gas exports would be the [[South Caucasus Pipeline]], also known as [[Baku]]-[[Tbilisi]]-Erzurum, which would run parallel to the Baku-T’bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline for most of its route before connecting to the Turkish gas pipeline network near the town of [[Horasan]] in [[Turkey]]. Pipeline construction began in late 2004 and was scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of 2007. The pipeline was expected to carry {{convert|233|Gcuft|m3}} per year initially; this volume could be increased later to up to {{convert|700|Gcuft|m3}} per year with the future addition of compression stations.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

With the new pipeline infrastructure in place, [[Shah Deniz]] would be capable of producing approximately {{convert|350|Gcuft|m3}} per year of natural gas by 2009. Supplies of natural gas from Shah Deniz and associated gas from the Azeri Chirag Gunashli (AGC) and the Bakhar-2 projects are expected to make Azerbaijan self-sufficient in natural gas and to result in significant export revenues.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

A '''mixedwood stand''' is a [[forest]] type in which 26% to 75% of the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] is made up of [[softwood]] trees.&lt;ref name="nat"&gt;Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service. 1995. Silviculture terms in Canada (Terminologie de la sylviculture au Canada). NRCan, CFS, Ottawa, Ontario, 2nd edition. 109 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncertainties of the definition, extent, and potential of mixedwood types necessitate the placement of some mensurational bounds on the subject of mixedwood management, especially the distribution and component sub-types, age classes, advance growth, productivity, and rotation ages. A major ecological factor in mixedwood management is the [[Spruce Budworm|spruce budworm]]; another is the problem of providing for sufficient white spruce [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]].&lt;ref name="scar"&gt;Project 07-24-0 analysis, Artificial regeneration of spruce in the spruce–fir forest type of Ontario. J.B. Scarratt, Canadian Forest Service, Ontario Region, Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. E3933&lt;/ref&gt;

The white spruce–aspen mixedwood associations of the Prairie Provinces have a variety of compositions ranging from pure [[aspen]] to pure [[Picea engelmannii|white spruce]], to mixtures of both. [[Populus balsamifera|Balsam poplar]], [[Betula papyrifera|white birch]], [[Picea mariana|black spruce]], [[Abies balsamea|balsam fir]], and [[pine]]s may also occur.&lt;ref name="rowe"&gt;Rowe, J.S 1972. Forest regions of Canada. Can. Dep. Environ., Can. For. Serv., Ottawa ON, Publ. 1300. 172 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Silvicultural treatments have generally been aimed at promoting white spruce, primarily through plantation establishment and management. The type of stand of a given association is as much a product of successional stage and stand history &lt;ref name="mcc"&gt;McCune, B.; Allen, T.F..H.  1985. Will similar forests develop on similar sites? Can. J. Bot. 63:367–376.&lt;/ref&gt; as it is of site type.&lt;ref name="lie1"&gt;Lieffers, V.J.; Beck, J.A. 1994. A semi-natural approach to mixedwood management in the prairie provinces. For. Chron. 70(3):260–264.&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on seed source and seedbed conditions, recruitment of white spruce may begin relatively soon after disturbance or may be spread over many decades.&lt;ref name="del"&gt;DeLong, C. 1991. Dynamics of boreal mixedwood ecosystems. p.30–31'' in'' Northern Mixedwood ‘89: Proceedings of a symposium held at Fort St. John, B.C., Sept. 1989. A. Shortreid (Ed.), For. Can., Pacific For. Centre, Victoria BC, FRDA Report 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Management of mixedwoods in the Prairie Provinces in the 1990s usually used [[clearcutting]]. When [[aspen]] is the main species to be regenerated, little treatment is applied to the site, but slash piles, compaction of soil, and damage to aspen root systems are minimized as much as is feasible in order to encourage suckering. In the [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] harvest, aspen that is not harvested is usually left standing to reduce suckering, as well as for the benefit of wildlife. Regeneration of white spruce is more difficult.&lt;ref name="lie1" /&gt; In general, plantation techniques are used, with mechanical site preparation following clearcutting. Depending on site conditions and availability of equipment, disk trenching, double disking, blading, ripper, or Marttiini plowing, Bracke spot scarification, high-speed mixing, or spot mounding are used. Plantings of white spruce have come to favour the use of large container or transplant stock. In the early years after clearcutting, site preparation and planting, [[List of tree species by shade tolerance|shade-intolerant]] vegetation, such as aspen, ''Calamagrostis canadensis'', and [[Alnus viridis|green alder]] compete strongly with the young outplants, frequently causing death.&lt;ref name="lie1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lie2"&gt;Lieffers, V.J.; MacDonald, S.E.; Hogg, E.H. 1993. Ecology of and control strategies for ''Calamagrostis canadensis'' in boreal forest sites. Can. J. For. Res. 23(10):2070–2077.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Odisha semi-evergreen forests''' are a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of eastern [[India]]. The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|22,300|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} on the coastal plain of [[Odisha]] state, bounded on the north and west by the [[Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests]] and on the south and west by the [[Bay of Bengal]].

The ecoregion has been extensively cleared for agriculture use and urbanization. Several of Odisha's largest cities, including [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Cuttack]], [[Puri]], [[Chhatrapur]], [[Kendrapara]], and [[Bhadrak]], lie within the ecoregion. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], 96% of the ecoregion's area has been cleared, and only 4% remains in the original semi-evergreen rain forest. Much of the remaining forest has been degraded by grazing and fuelwood harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002).

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Philyra''' or '''Phillyra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|ə|r|ə}}: {{lang-el|Φιλύρα}}, "[[Tilia|linden-tree]]") was one of the [[Oceanid|Oceanids]], daughters of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html#138 138].

[[Chiron]] was her son by [[Cronus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 1200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 7. 197&lt;/ref&gt; who chased her and consorted with her in the shape of a stallion, hence the half-human, half-equine shape of their offspring;&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 2. 1231 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 1. 554&lt;/ref&gt; this was said to have taken place on Mount [[Pelion]].&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, Hymn 4 to [[Delos]] 104 ff&lt;/ref&gt; When she gave birth to her son, she was so disgusted by how he looked that she abandoned him at birth, and implored the gods to transform her into anything other than anthropomorphic as she could not bear the shame of having had such a monstrous child; the gods changed her into a [[linden tree]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html#138 138]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1483">In [[geology]], '''point counting''' is a method to determine the proportion of an area  that is covered by some objects of interest. In most cases the area is a [[thin section]] or a polished slab. The objects of interest vary between subdisciplines and can for example be [[quartz]] or [[feldspar]] grains in [[sedimentology]], any type of [[mineral]] in [[petrology]] or different [[taxonomic group]]s in [[paleontology]].

== Method ==
The basic method is to cover the area by a grid of points. Then for each of these points, the underlying object is identified. Then the estimate for the proportion of the area covered by the type of object is given as
:&lt;math&gt; p_i\approx \frac{h_i}{N} &lt;/math&gt;,

where
*&lt;math&gt; p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the true proportion of objects of type &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; h_i &lt;/math&gt; is the number of points hitting an object of type &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the total number of points counted.

There exist many variations of this procedure that can for example vary in grid geometry.

[[File:Le Baptême des Reformés.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Engraving of a [[baptism]] in a [[Reformed]] church by [[Bernard Picart]]]]
In [[Reformed theology]], [[baptism]] is a [[sacrament]] signifying the baptized person's [[union with Christ]], or becoming part of Christ and being treated as if they had done everything Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are [[means of grace]] through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments are believed to have their effect through the [[Holy Spirit]], but these effects are only believed to be beneficial to those who have [[faith in Christianity|faith]] in Christ.

In Reformed theology, baptism is the sacrament of initiation into the [[visible church]], or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies [[regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and remission of [[sin]]. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism is believed to be beneficial only to those who have faith in Christ, infants are baptized on the basis of the promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.

== History ==

===Background===
Christian baptismal theology prior to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] taught that [[sacraments]], including [[baptism]], are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people.{{sfn|Sykes|1994|p=283}} The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it.{{sfn|Sykes|1994|p=278}} Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of [[mortal sin]] which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament in order to receive any benefit.{{sfn|Wawrykow|2015|p=223}} Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, [[regeneration (theology)|regeneration]], and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.{{sfn|Sykes|1994|p=278}} The sacrament of [[penance]] was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.{{sfn|Sykes|1994|p=179}}

During the Reformation, [[Martin Luther]] rejected many of the [[Catholic Church]]'s [[seven sacraments]], but retained baptism and the [[Lord's Supper]]. He saw many practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism, and taught that life after baptism should be spent in recollection of it and the dying to sin it signified.{{sfn|Sykes|1994|p=286}}

===Reformation and Reformed orthodoxy===
[[Huldrych Zwingli]], the earliest theologian considered part of the [[Reformed tradition]], was vigorously opposed to worship practices he believed to be based on tradition rather than the Bible.{{sfn|Benedict|2002|p=22}} Nevertheless, he disagreed with [[Anabaptists]], who refused to baptize their children on scriptural grounds.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|p=23}} Through his arguments with Anabaptists, Zwingli arrived at the position that baptism was a sign of the covenant between God and his people, but that it did not convey grace to the baptized. He saw baptism as essentially identical to the [[Circumcision in Judaism|circumcision of Israelites]] in the [[Old Testament]] in this respect, and used this idea in polemics against Anabaptists.{{sfnm|Riggs|2002|1p=25|Fesko|2013|pp=64–65}} Zwingli's emphasis on baptism as a pledge or oath was to prove unique in the Reformed tradition.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|p=76}} [[Heinrich Bullinger]], Zwingli's successor, continued the teaching of the continuity of God's covenants and circumcision with baptism. Bullinger also emphasized that baptism indicates duties to the baptized in response to God's grace.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|pp=36–37}}

[[John Calvin]] was influenced by Martin Luther's idea of baptism as God's promises to the baptized person attached to the outward sign of washing with water. Calvin maintained Zwingli's idea of baptism as a public pledge, but insisted that it was secondary to baptism's meaning as a sign of God's promise to forgive sin.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|pp=50–51}} He maintained that sacraments were effective instruments in bringing about the promises they represent, however he also maintained that the promises could be refused by the baptized, and would have no effect in that case.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|p=60–62}} Calvin carefully distinguished between the outward sign of the washing of water with the promises that baptism signifies while maintaining that they were inseparable.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|pp=88–89}} Calvin's baptismal theology is very similar to that of Luther. It differs in the way Calvin subordinated sacraments to the preaching of the word of God. While Luther placed preaching and sacraments on the same level, Calvin saw sacraments as confirmation which is added to the preaching of the word of God.{{sfn|Trigg|2001|p=218}}

[[File:Temple de Lyon, Nommé paradis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In this painting of the [[Huguenot]] Temple de Lyon, a woman stands next to the pulpit with a pitcher and a man with a towel in preparation for a baptism.]]
From the end of the sixteenth century through the eighteenth century, a period known as [[Reformed orthodoxy]], Reformed baptismal theology further developed the covenantal meaning of baptism.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|p=90}} Theologians more carefully defined the [[sacramental union]] of baptism, or the relationship between the outward washing with that which it signifies.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|p=128}} In the high orthodox period (middle to late seventeenth century), theologians such as [[Hermann Witsius]] expanded the covenantal meaning of baptism using analogies such as [[Noah's Ark]] and the [[crossing of the Red Sea]], which carried the theological themes of the [[resurrection]] and [[eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]]. This period also saw the emergence of [[Reformed Baptists]]. Reformed Baptist theologians had much in common with the Reformed, but saw baptism as a sign of the baptized's fellowship with Christ rather than a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, and as a result did not baptize their children.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|pp=154–155}}

===Modern===

[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], an influential nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism as the way the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, teaching that it was not an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|pp=92–93}} Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|p=159}}

Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian [[William Cunningham (theologian)|William Cunningham]] also sought to articulate a distinctively Reformed theology of baptism in the modern world. Cunningham preferred the writings of Zwingli on the sacraments, writing that Calvin and later Reformed orthodox theologians overly elevated the value of the sacraments. He argued that the efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith in the act of baptism.{{sfn|Swain|2015|pp=336–337}}

In the twentieth century, [[Karl Barth]], an influential Swiss Reformed theologian, argued that baptism should not be administered to infants because it represented a completed association with Christ which could only be accepted or rejected by adults. Further, Barth in his later years rejected the idea that baptism was actually used by God to accomplish anything, or could even properly be called a sacrament. Instead, he taught that water baptism is a human act of obedience.{{sfnm|Riggs|2002|1pp=94–95|Fesko|2013|2p=165}} His views have been called "neo-Zwinglian" for this reason, and he himself identified Zwingli's views on sacraments as the believer's oath as his own.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|p=167}} He continued to accept the validity of infant baptisms, and did not believe those baptized as infants should be rebaptized.{{sfn|McMaken|2013|p=44}} 

Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth's views on baptism by appealing to Calvin, the idea that baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished reality, and the idea of baptism as a replacement of circumcision.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|p=96}} Scottish Reformed theologian [[T.F. Torrance]] emphasized the idea that baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German Reformed [[liberation theologian]] [[Jürgen Moltmann]], on the other hand, saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a free response God's call to discipleship.{{sfn|Hunsinger|Moore-Keish|2015|p=404}} Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=138}}

==Sacramental theology==
[[File:Baptism in Scotland.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Baptism in Scotland'' by [[John Phillip]]]]
In Reformed theology, sacraments are held to be, along with the word of God [[preach]]ed, the [[means of grace]].{{sfn|Rohls|1998|p=189}} In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common material objects to communicate divine promises to people.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=122}} The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|p=273}} Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace.{{sfn|Horton|2008|pp=106–107}} The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments.{{sfn|Allen|2010|pp=123–124}} This efficacy is only beneficial, however, for those who have faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.{{sfn|Allen|2010|p=125}}

Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in the context of [[covenant theology|covenants]] between God and people. They believe that when God makes covenants, he provides physical signs associated with the covenant. Old Testament covenant signs include the [[rainbow]] which appeared following a covenant made with [[Noah]]. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's covenant with [[Abraham]] and his descendants. Such signs entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|pp=293–294}} In the New Testament period there are two such signs or sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.{{sfn|Rohls|1998|p=189}}

In Reformed sacramental theology, the sign (in the case of baptism the external washing with water) may be described in terms of the thing signified (regeneration, remission of sin, etc.), because of the close connection between them. For example, baptism may be said to save, and baptism is often called the "laver of regeneration". However, there is also a distinction between the sign and thing signified.{{sfn|Letham|2009|pp=338–339}} The sign is seen as a pledge and seal of the inward washing of regeneration and purification.{{sfn|Rohls|1998|p=210}} The sacramental union between the sign and thing signified means that the use or purpose of the visible action of the sacrament is changed even as its substance remains the same.{{sfn|Rohls|1998|p=190}}

==Meaning==
The Reformed tradition holds that baptism is primarily God's promise or offer of grace to the baptized.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|p=119}} Baptism is said to signify [[union with Christ]] in [[Death of Jesus|his death]], [[Burial of Jesus|burial]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfnm|Murray|1980|pp=3, 5}} The baptized is made one with Christ's person, meaning [[God the Father]] treats them the same as he treats Christ. Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ's history, meaning that the person can be said to have died, been buried, and raised again just as Christ was.{{sfn|Brownson|2007|p=48}} The baptized person's identity in Christ is based on Christ's action in baptism rather than the person's action.{{sfn|Brownson|2007|p=49}} This union also unites Christians to one another.{{sfn|Murray|1980|pp=3, 5}} Through the words of institution used in baptism, Christians are also united to each of the members of the [[trinity]].{{sfn|Murray|1980|p=4}}

[[File:Jordaens - Circumcision.jpg|thumb|left|''The Circumcision'' by [[Jacob Jordaens]]. Reformed theologians see baptism as the replacement or perfection of circumcision.]]
In the Reformed tradition, baptism's function as a rite of initiation into the church is secondary to its function as a sign of God's promise of grace.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|p=120}} Reformed theologians distinguish between the [[visible church]], which consists of those who publicly claim to have faith in Christ as well as their children; and the [[invisible church]], which consists of those who actually have faith and have been regenerated. Baptism is believed to make one a member of the visible, rather than the invisible church. It is believed to be impossible to know who is a member of the invisible church.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|pp=315–316}} As members of the visible church, baptized Christians are believed to have obligations to live in love and service to Christ and his people. The fulfillment of these obligations is referred to as the "improvement" of one's baptism.{{sfn|Venema|2000|pp=79–80}}

Reformed Christians see baptism as a replacement of [[circumcision]] in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Fesko|2013|p=259}} Baptism does everything for New Testament Christians that circumcision did for Jews in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Horton|2008|p=117}} Circumcision is seen as a ritual where God's judgement passes over the person circumcised, only to cut off a part of the flesh, sparing the rest of the person. The "cutting off" of Christ in death is seen as a perfection of circumcision, and in baptism similarly the entire body is subjected to judgement and death in order to be raised again in new life.{{sfn|Horton|2008|p=114}}

Reformed Christians believe baptism to be a sign of [[regeneration (theology)|regeneration]], or the making of one into a new creature, based on the connection found in the [[New Testament]] between regeneration and washing with water.{{sfnm|Murray|1980|1p=4|Rohls|1998|2p=207}} Baptism also represents [[forgiveness]] or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals.{{sfn|Murray|1980|p=4}} Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|p=121}} However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins.{{sfn|Vissers|2011|p=107}} Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to have had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.{{sfn|Venema|2000|p=59}}

==Infant baptism==
[[File:Christ Receiving the Children.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|{{citation|last=Bourdon |first=Sébastien |title=Christ Receiving the Children |location=[[Art Institute of Chicago]] |date=c. 1655 |author-link=Sébastien Bourdon |ref=no}}. Protestant reformers emphasized the place of children in the believing community, leading to their increased presence in religious art.{{sfn|Dyrness|2004|p=56}}]]

With some notable exceptions, Reformed Christians baptize infants who are born to believing parents.{{sfn|Rohls|1998|p=214}} Reformed Christians do so on the basis of the continuity from the old covenant between God and Israel and the new covenant with the church, since infants were circumcised under the old covenant.{{sfn|Brownson|2007|p=115}} They also see God's saving purpose in the new covenant as having to do with families as well as individuals.{{sfn|Brownson|2007|p=128}} Because Reformed Christians believe baptism must be embraced by faith to have any benefit, they recognize that faith may come later in life rather than preceding baptism. Infants may also be said to possess a seed of faith which will come to fruition later, or baptism may be administered based on a promise of faith offered by their sponsors (usually their parents) which will be kept at a later age.{{sfn|Rohls|1998|pp=213–214}}

==Mode and administration==
Reformed Christians believe that [[immersion baptism|immersion]] is not necessary for baptism to be properly performed, but that [[affusion|pouring]] or [[aspersion|sprinkling]] are acceptable.{{sfn|Rohls|1998|p=207}} Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ for the removal of the guilt of sin.{{sfn|Murray|1980|p=21}} Only [[ordained]] ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for [[emergency baptism]] by [[midwives]] in [[Roman Catholic]] churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid.{{sfn|Rohls|1998|pp=207–208}} Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of [[chrism]], [[Blessed salt in Christianity|salt]], and [[insufflation]]), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not [[rebaptize]] someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.{{sfn|Rohls|1998|p=209}}

Over the last five decades there have been various plans for the '''relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma''', a [[United States Marine Corps]] base located within the urban area of [[Ginowan, Okinawa|Ginowan City]] (pop. 93,661) in [[Okinawa, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.city.ginowan.okinawa.jp/2556/2568/2569/2614/13910/41908.html | script-title = ja:平成23年版　宜野湾市統計書 | year = 2012 | author = City of Ginowan | location = Ginowan, Okinawa Prefecture | language = Japanese | trans-title = Statistics of Ginowan City, 2011 ed. | accessdate = 2012-05-25 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120729152222/http://www.city.ginowan.okinawa.jp/2556/2568/2569/2614/13910/41908.html | archivedate = 2012-07-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="okinawa-usmc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.okinawa.usmc.mil/Installations/futenma.html | script-title=ja:海兵隊普天間航空基地 | year = 2012 | author = United States Marine Corps | language = Japanese | trans-title = Marine Corps Air Station Futenma | accessdate = 2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local opposition within Okinawa regarding the facility has so far hindered efforts to begin construction. {{as of|2015|08}}, the Japanese government had agreed to halt construction activities temporarily while talks with Okinawan officials continued.&lt;ref name="bbc-halt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33876269 | title=US military helicopter crashes off Okinawa in Japan | work=BBC | date=12 August 2015 | accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, US sources insisted nothing about their approach had changed.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2015/07/244957.htm#JAPAN2 July 15, 2015 - JAPAN], Daily Press Briefing&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, despite strong opposition in Okinawa, the Japanese central government began work to build the base in the Henoko Bay, in [[Nago]]. The issue has been taken to court by both parties in November 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Policy-Politics/Tokyo-Okinawa-battle-moving-to-court|title = Tokyo-Okinawa battle moving to court|date = November 2015|accessdate = |website =The Asian Nikkei |publisher = |last = |first = |authorlink = The Asian Nikkei}}&lt;/ref&gt; and December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Okinawa Sues State to Block Futenma Base Relocation|url = http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0002647558|website = The Japan News|accessdate = 2015-12-26|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a tentative court-mediated settlement in March 2016, the national government sued Okinawa governor [[Takeshi Onaga]] in July, and obtained a High Court ruling in September determining that it was illegal for Onaga to revoke his predecessor's permission for landfill work at the new site. The [[Supreme Court of Japan]] indicated in December that it would let this judgment stand, opening a door for the relocation work to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/japans-top-court-to-let-stand-ruling-in-favor-of-u-s-base-relocation|title=Top court to let stand ruling in favor of U.S. base relocation|newspaper=Japan Today|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The protesting crowd in Ginowan on 2009-11-08.jpg|thumb|Protest meeting against the base, in Ginowan, November 2009]]

There is local opposition in Okinawa to the construction of a new base; more than 76 per cent of the population having expressed their opposition to a relocation in Henoko.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Poll finds overwhelming opposition in Okinawa to Futenma relocation plan|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/04/07/national/politics-diplomacy/poll-finds-overwhelming-opposition-in-okinawa-to-futenma-relocation-plan/|newspaper = The Japan Times Online|date = 2015-04-07|access-date = 2015-11-16|issn = 0447-5763|language = en-US|first = Reiji|last = Yoshida}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Futenma Base and the U.S.-Japan Controversy: an Okinawan perspective|url = http://www.japanfocus.org/-Yoshio-SHIMOJI|website = www.japanfocus.org|accessdate = 2015-11-24|date = 2011|last = Shimoji|first = Yoshio|authorlink = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent political developments==
In November 2014 [[Takeshi Onaga]], who had run for election on an anti-base platform, was elected [[List of Governors of Okinawa Prefecture|Governor of Okinawa]].&lt;ref name="bbc-onaga" /&gt;&lt;ref name="japantoday-onaga" /&gt; His predecessor and main opponent in the gubernatorial race, [[Hirokazu Nakaima]], had previously opposed the relocation plans himself too; but 11 months before the 2014 election, Nakaima approved a landfill permit allowing the relocation plans to progress, two days after Tokyo earmarked 348 billion yen for Okinawa's economic development.&lt;ref name="CNN 20131227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters201327" /&gt;

One of Japan's most popular filmmakers, [[Hayao Miyazaki]], publicly spoke out in July 2015 against the facility when he argued that most Okinawans are against it.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

In July 15, 2015's daily press briefing at the [[White House]], [[US Navy]] [[Admiral]] [[John Kirby (admiral)|John Kirby]] said in regards to opposition: "Construction of the facility is the meaningful result of many years of sustained work between the [[United States]] and Japan, and our understanding is that construction’s going to continue. This is something we’ve talked at length about with the [[Government of Japan]]. Certainly I’ve seen the reports and understand some of the angst by people in Okinawa, but nothing’s changed about our approach or our policies with respect to that facility. We have, through many different fora, consistently talked about the importance of this relocation and the degrees to which it helps strengthen our alliance with Japan."&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

=== Henoko Bay plan ===
[[File:JP Okinawa Nago City Location.png|thumb|110x110px|Nago, Okinawa Island]]

====Plan secretly formulated in 1960s====

Declassified reports indicate the plan to build new runways at Heonko Bay was secretly formulated in the 1960s during the U.S. Military Occupation and Administration of the Islands.  Building an expanded base at Henoko has been called the "only solution" to resolving the issues at Futenma.  The U.S. Military had originally proposed constructing "an offshore landfill facility with two 3,000-meter runways, a large military port and an integrated ammunition bunker capable of storing [[nuclear weapons]]."&lt;ref name=JT01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/06/04/national/u-s-eyed-okinawa-for-huge-offshore-base-in-mid-1960s/ |title=U.S eyed Okinawa for huge offshore base in mid-1960s|uthor=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=June 4, 2001 |website=japantimes.com |publisher=''The Japan Times'' |access-date= |quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222235607/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/06/04/national/u-s-eyed-okinawa-for-huge-offshore-base-in-mid-1960s/#.WM1NhqK1uUk|archive-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JT2016&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/04/04/national/politics-diplomacy/plan-build-base-off-nago-1960s-given-ok-u-s-top-brass-document-reveals Plan to build base off Nago in 1960s got OK by U.S. top brass, document reveals] ''The Japan Times'' (April 4, 2016); retrieved: December 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|"The newly obtained 40-page document contains a memorandum approving the plan sent by [[Earle Wheeler]], chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] on July 20, 1967, before the reversion of Okinawa to Japan from U.S. control.}}

==== 1996–1997 ====
In December 1996, as part of the Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI), the Japanese and U.S. governments decided that the Futenma base should be relocated to an off-shore location in the Oura Bay of Henoko (''Ourawan'' in Japanese; often called ''Henoko Bay''), in [[Nago]], a relatively less populated area of the northern part of the island, 'in order to reduce military impact to the populated communities of southern Okinawa'.&lt;ref name="gendai-futenmamondai"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Gendai yōgo no kiso chishiki [現代用語の基礎知識] | title = Futenma mondai [普天間問題] | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-05-25 | year = 2012 | publisher = Jiyū Kokuminsha | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | archivedate = 2007-08-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next mayor too, Susumu Inamine, was opposed to it and he was elected twice with a high margin on an anti-base agenda.&lt;ref name=constancy/&gt;

==== 2013–current ====
The Henoko Bay plan was reactivated in 2013 by the U.S. and Japanese governments after other projects were abandoned (''see below'') despite the continued research on the detrimental environmental effects of the base construction.
[[File:Henoko, Nago, Okinawa 02.jpg|thumb|Posters opposing the base relocation in Henoko (Henoko, Nago, 2013)]]
The Japanese central government began work on October 29, 2015 to build the base in the Henoko coastal area of [[Nago]], to replace the Futenma Air Station, despite strong opposition among Okinawans and political and legal action initiated by Governor [[Takeshi Onaga]], who insisted the relocation was 'extremely unjust'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Okinawa rebuffs state order on landfill work, court battle looms|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/11/national/politics-diplomacy/okinawa-rebuffs-state-order-landfill-work-court-battle-looms/|newspaper = The Japan Times Online|date = 2015-11-11|access-date = 2015-11-13|issn = 0447-5763|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposition to the relocation has received notable support outside of Okinawa, including those of animation film maker [[Hayao Miyazaki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Fund set up to fight Futenma plan adds director Miyazaki to leadership|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/05/08/national/fund-set-fight-futenma-plan-adds-director-miyazaki-leadership/|newspaper = The Japan Times Online|date = 2015-05-08|access-date = 2015-11-14|issn = 0447-5763|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; who will help 'a fund set up to oppose the relocation', of Nobel Prize winner [[Kenzaburō Ōe|Kenzaburo Oe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kenzaburo Oe and 23 other artists and intellectuals release statement supporting governor’s revocation of Henoko land reclamation permit|url = http://english.ryukyushimpo.jp/2015/11/02/23916/|website = Ryukyu Shimpo - Okinawa, Japanese newspaper, local news|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of musician [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]].

[[Greenpeace]] too gathered signatures of people from 164 countries, in a call for the relocation to be stopped and the coral reef and dugong habitat preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Greenpeace calls for Oura Bay to be made an ocean sanctuary|url = http://english.ryukyushimpo.jp/2015/11/15/23991/|website = Ryukyu Shimpo - Okinawa, Japanese newspaper, local news|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' called Japanese Government  agenda on the matter an 'obsession'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EDITORIAL: Despite Tokyo’s obsession, Henoko is not the only option for U.S. air base - AJW by The Asahi Shimbun|url = http://ajw.asahi.com/article/views/editorial/AJ201511180041|website = AJW by The Asahi Shimbun|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, a group of 70 American personalities, including  the filmmaker [[Oliver Stone]], criticized the U.S. Ambassador  to Japan, [[Caroline Kennedy]], for the support she expressed to the contentious U.S.-Japan relocation plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.S. envoy to Japan faces criticism over Okinawa base remarks|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/12/23/national/politics-diplomacy/u-s-envoy-to-japan-faces-criticism-over-okinawa-base-remarks/|newspaper = The Japan Times Online|date = 2015-12-23|access-date = 2015-12-26|issn = 0447-5763|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, massive protests took place after the rape and murder of an Okinawan woman by an American base staff member: 'The incidents seem certain to complicate efforts to relocate a Marine air base at Okinawa, to a less densely populated part of the island.

===Camp Schwab plan (2005–2006)===
On 26 October 2005, the governments of the United States and Japan agreed to move the relocation site for Futenma from the [[reef]] area off Henoko to the interior and coastal portions of the existing Marine base at [[Camp Schwab]], just a few hundred meters away from the previously-planned offshore facility.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 26 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 26 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the cited reasons for the change was to reduce the engineering challenge associated with building a runway on reefs in deep water: experts estimate that rather than the 15-plus years required to construct a new airbase at the previous reef location, the Camp Schwab plan will enable Futenma to be relocated sooner.&lt;ref name="ssnov09"&gt;Allen, David and Chiyomi Sumida, "[http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=66319 Futenma questions and answers]", ''Stars and Stripes'', 27 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These plans were also accelerated when a [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion|CH-53D Sea Stallion]] transport helicopter experienced mechanical issues and {{Interlanguage link multi|Sea Stallion crash at Okinawa International University|ja|3=沖国大米軍ヘリ墜落事件|lt=crashed on the campus}} of [[Okinawa International University]] in August 2004: all three crew members were injured but there were not civilian injuries.&lt;ref name="oiucrash"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stripes.com/news/helo-crashes-on-okinawa-campus-1.23241 | title=Helo crashes on Okinawa campus | work=Stars and Stripes | date=15 August 2004 | accessdate=17 November 2014 | author=Allen, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Camp Schwab Henokozaki Okinawa Aug2013.JPG|thumb|Camp Schwab and the Henoko Cape, 2013]]

Although some all-Okinawa public opinion polls indicated that majority of Okinawans wish the based moved out of the prefecture entirely,&lt;ref name="reuters200908"&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5A70IG20091108 Thousands of Japanese protest U.S. base plan]", Reuters, 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; all 12 elected mayors of northern Okinawa publicly accepted the new relocation plan, exposing a range of conflicting opinions among Okinawans: those who maintain that military facilities and associated public works infrastructure benefit the island's economy, environmentalists, and those who either object or are critical to the U.S. military presence on ideological grounds or on rooted sentiments.&lt;ref name="gendai-futenmamondai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ssnov09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters200908"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sief, Linda, ([[Reuters]]) "[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2009/10/25/afx7041841.html Q+A-Japan-U.S. base feud hits nerve ahead of Obama visit]", ''[[Forbes]]'', 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relocation plans again gained national attention in 2009 when the [[Democratic Party of Japan]] included a promise to move Futenma off the island in its manifesto. After winning the election, Prime Minister [[Yukio Hatoyama]] found the promise hard to honor and resigned after only eight months in office when it was confirmed that the base would not move off Okinawa.&lt;ref name="bbc10211314"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10211314 | title=Japanese PM Yukio Hatoyama resigns amid Okinawa row | work=BBC | date=2 June 2010 | accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point in 2009, [[Osaka Prefecture]] governor [[Toru Hashimoto]] even publicly proposed moving the base's functions to Osaka's [[Kansai International Airport]] (which is on an [[artificial island]]), remarking that "the burden [of bases on Okinawa] should be spread more evenly throughout Japan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/kuchikomi/view/will-the-us-marines-charge-ashore-at-kansai-airport Will the U.S. Marines charge ashore at Kansai airport?], Japan Today&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guam and Okinawa plan (2011–2012)===
In 2011, the chairman and ranking member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]] called for an alternative plan where Futenma aircraft would move to [[Kadena Air Base]] while the current aircraft at Kadena would move to [[Andersen Air Force Base]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guampdn.com/article/20110527/NEWS01/110527006 "Accountability report cites higher buildup cost; U.S. senators push alternative plan."] ''Pacific Daily News'', 26 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, US and Japan governments remained with the relocation plan as previously agreed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gavan McCormack, "Deception and Diplomacy: The US, Japan, and Okinawa  欺瞞と外交−−アメリカ、日本、沖縄 •Japanese text available"|url = http://www.japanfocus.org/-Gavan-McCormack/3532/article.html|website = www.japanfocus.org|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fate of Futenma remained unresolved through early 2012, with the U.S. insisting that the Marine Corps' aviation elements be kept on the island while the Okinawa Prefectural government and Nago City government would like the base moved off the island.&lt;ref name="time-2012move9000"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2113304,00.html |title=U.S. to Remove 9,000 Marines from Okinawa |work=Time |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429225547/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2113304,00.html |archivedate=April 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US alleged that the aviation elements should be in close proximity to the ground and logistics elements of the [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force|Marine Air Ground Task Force]], and the Japanese government of the time maintained the plan to keep the replacement airbase within Okinawa.

During this period, the US began to deploy [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]] [[tilt rotor]] aircraft to Futenma in 2012, allowing the Marines (and the MV-22B Osprey aircraft) from Okinawa to train all along the length of Japan and around the entire Asia-Pacific region, with the Osprey's greatly increased speed, lift capabilities and range.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, Kosuke.

==="Okinawa Consolidation Plan" (2013–2015)===

(''Recent updates about this plan are detailed in the ''Henoko Bay Plan'' section above'')

In April 2013, the United States and Japan released an "Okinawa Consolidation Plan," which detailed more general positions of the 1996 DPRI and 2006 SACO plans, specifying 2,500 acres of land to be returned Japan. This included returning the entirety of MCAS Futenma by "Japanese Fiscal Year 2022 or later" once the "replacement facilities in Okinawa are provided." As part of the original DPRI plan, Futenma's KC-130J 'Super Hercules' refueling transport squadron moved to [[MCAS Iwakuni]] on mainland Japan in July 2014.&lt;ref name="dvids201427"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dvidshub.net/news/136112/vmgr-152-sumos-begin-transfer-mcas-iwakuni#.U93JcDamqpo | title=VMGR-152 SUMOs begin transfer to MCAS Iwakuni | work=DVIDS | date=15 July 2014 | accessdate=20 July 2014 | author=Natalie Rostran}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan also included, as in previous plans, moving Marine Corps airfield facilities to [[Camp Schwab]] at Henoko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consolidation Plan for Facilities and Areas in Okinawa|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/Okinawa%20Consolidation%20Plan.pdf|publisher=Department of Defense|accessdate=9 January 2014|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed location within Camp Schwab is insulated from potential protesters, unlike the previous proposed location in Henoko Bay where local civilians were able to enter the survey area.&lt;ref name="yomiuri1228"&gt;{{cite news|title=Henoko prep work to start in Jan. |url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000903251 |accessdate=9 January 2014 |newspaper=Yomiuri Shimbun |date=28 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109035113/http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000903251 |archivedate=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Okinawa Governor [[Hirokazu Nakaima]] approved a landfill proposal by the Japanese government to permit construction of new military facilities in Henoko, a move praised by the US.&lt;ref name="CNN 20131227"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wakatsuki|first=Yoko|title=U.S. Okinawa base will be allowed to move after 17-year deadlock|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/27/world/asia/japan-controversial-u-s-airbase/index.html?hpt=ias_c1|accessdate=27 December 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision came two days after Tokyo earmarked 348 billion yen for Okinawa's economic development and despite earlier campaign promises by Nakaima to move the base outside of the prefecture all together.&lt;ref name="reuters201327"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKBRE9BQ0AE20131227?i=1 | title=Japan gets Okinawa approval for U.S. Marine base move | work=Reuters | date=27 December 2013 | accessdate=28 December 2013 | author=Kiyoshi Takenaka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2,000 citizens responded immediately with a protest in front of the prefectural administration building, with around 1,000 forcing their way into the building to stage a sit-in.&lt;ref name="reuters201327" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jt 2013-12-27"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/12/27/national/okinawa-base-foes-protest-governors-ok-of-offshore-fill-work-for-futenma-replacement/#.UsUGEN8Q_Sx | title=Okinawa base foes protest governor’s OK of offshore fill work for Futenma replacement | work=Japan Times | date=27 December 2013 | agency=Kyodo | accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the Nago municipal assembly responded that "what the governor has done is unforgivable. Residents who are opposed will surely resort to the use of force, such as blocking roads to stop this from happening."&lt;ref name="dw 201327"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dw.de/p/1AhRL | title=Controversial US airbase in Okinawa gets green light | work=DW | date=27 December 2013 | accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Okinawa prefectural assembly adopted a resolution by a 24–21 vote calling for Nakaima's resignation, stating that he broke an election promise by agreeing to the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Okinawan governor faces revolt in assembly|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/okinawan-governor-faces-revolt-in-assembly|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=AP|date=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susumu Inamine, Mayor of Nago, where the new facility is to be built, opposed the plan, while Mayor Atsushi Sakima, of Ginowan where the current facility is located, supported the plan. Nago held a mayoral election in January 2014, in which Inamine's main rival, former Vice Mayor Bunshin Suematsu, supported the plan as "a significant step toward reducing the dangers posed by Futenma."&lt;ref name="yomiuri1228" /&gt; Inamine won the election and subsequently vowed to block any landfill plans in the city, but the national government said it would continue with the plan and that the authority to approve the plan rested at the time with the governor of Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Obe|first=Mitsuru|title=Tokyo Insists It Will Plow Ahead With Okinawa Base Relocation|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/01/20/tokyo-insists-it-will-plow-ahead-with-okinawa-base-relocation/|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal Japan Real Time|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent alternative proposals==
In November 2015, [[George Washington University]] professor Mike Mochizuki explained that "an option of setting up a helicopter base at [[Camp Schwab|Marine Corps Camp Schwab]] in Nago could be considered instead of the current plan to build runways in the camp that would extend offshore"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.S. professor proposes Nago chopper base without runways and Ospreys kept outside Okinawa|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/19/national/politics-diplomacy/u-s-professor-proposes-nago-chopper-base-without-runways-ospreys-kept-outside-okinawa/|newspaper = The Japan Times Online|date = 2015-11-19|access-date = 2015-11-24|issn = 0447-5763|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The option was included in a 1996 report by the Special Action Committee on Okinawa between the two countries.", noted the ''Japan Times''.

"Japanese officials in the ruling and opposition parties had in the past suggested [[Kyushu]] and [[Hokkaido]] as alternatives to [[Henoko Bay|Henoko]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In November 2015 a group of 'traditionally anti-base activist' citizens from [[Kansai region|Kansai]] called for Futenma’s replacement airstrip to be built in [[Osaka]], in "hope to lighten Okinawa’s base-hosting burden and prevent an escalation of violence."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Osaka group preps Kansai solution to Futenma base row|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/22/national/osaka-group-preps-kansai-solution-futenma-base-row/|newspaper = The Japan Times Online|date = 2015-11-22|access-date = 2015-11-24|issn = 0447-5763|language = en-US|first = Eric|last = Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solana Valley''' ([[Spanish language]] ''Valle de la Solana''; [[Aragonese language]] ''Val d'a Solana'') is a valley in the [[Pyrenees]]. It is located in [[Aragon]], [[Spain]]. [[River Ara (Spain)|River Ara]] cuts across the valley from east to west and its average altitude is 850 m.

==History==
There were many villages in Solana Valley. The inhabitants left the place between 1960 and 1970 owing to the pressure induced by [[ICONA]], the Spanish National Institute for Forestal recovery that had bought the land surrounding the villages.&lt;ref&gt;Menjón Ruiz, Marisancho, ''Jánovas, víctimas de un pantano de papel.'' Pirineum Editorial, Jaca, 2006. {{ISBN|84-935061-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were other factors as well, such as the abandonment of traditional agricultural practices like [[sheep]] and [[goat]] rearing, as well as the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain after [[General Franco]]'s ''[[Plan de Estabilización]]'' that pulled the local youth towards the cities and the coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://despoblacion.blogia.com/temas/la-despoblacion-en-aragon.php Despoblación en Aragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823033158/http://despoblacion.blogia.com/temas/la-despoblacion-en-aragon.php |date=2012-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Solana Valley's territory depends administratively from [[Fiscal, Aragon|Fiscal]], [[Sobrarbe]] [[comarca]], [[Huesca Province]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariodelaltoaragon.es/Fotos/20090806171228782.pdf Diario del AltoAragón (10 d'agost del 2009) - El valle de La Solana]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghost towns==
In Solana Valley there are numerous village churches and smaller religious buildings worth visiting, such as the ''Iglesia de la Asunción'' and the [[exconjuratory]] in Burgasé, the ''Iglesia de Santa María'' in Muro de Solana, Santiago Church in Villamana and Saint Peter's Church in Gere. Many of the churches are in ruins.

The villages in the valley lie abandoned and the houses have fallen into disrepair and ruin:

This article provides information on the following six methods of producing electricity.
# '''[[Friction]]:''' Energy produced by rubbing two material together. 
# '''[[Heat]]:''' Energy produced by heating the junction where two unlike metals are joined. 
# '''[[Light]]:''' Energy produced by light being absorbed by photoelectric cells. 
# '''[[Chemical]]:''' Energy produced by chemical reaction in a voltaic cell. 
# '''[[Pressure]]:''' Energy produced by compressing or decompressing specific crystals.
# '''[[Magnetism]]:''' Energy produced in a conductor that cuts or is cut by magnetic lines of force.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electrical trade principles : a practical approach / Jeffery Hampson, Steven Hanssen.|last=Hampson|first=Jeffery|publisher=Frenchs Forest, N.S.W. : Pearson Education Australia.|year=2008|isbn=9780733993947|location=Frenchs Forest NSW, 2086|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Friction ==
Friction is the least methods which you provide of the six methods of producing energy. If a cloth rubs against an object, the object will display an effect called friction electricity. The object becomes charged due to the rubbing process, and now possesses an [[Electric charge|electrical charge]]. There are two main types of electrical charge: positive and negative. Each type of charge attracts the opposite type and repels the same type. This can be stated in the following way: Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. [[Static electricity]] has several applications. Its main application is in [[Van de Graaff generator|Van de Graaff generators]], used to produce high voltages in order to test the [[Dielectric|dialectric]] strength of insulating materials. Other uses are in electrostatic painting and sandpaper manufacturing. The course grains acquire a negative charge as they move across the negative plate. As unlike charges attract, the positive plate attracts the course grains and their impact velocity enables them to be embedded into the adhesive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Heat ==
In 1821 [[Thomas Johann Seebeck|Thomas Seebeck]] discovered that the junction between two metals generates a voltage that is a function of temperature. If a closed circuit consists of conductors of two different metals, and if one junction of the two metals is at a higher temperature than the other, an [[electromotive force]] is created in a specific polarity. An example of this is in the case of copper and iron, the electrons first flow along the iron from the hot junction to the cold one. The electrons cross from the iron to the copper at the hot junction, and from the copper to the iron at the cold junction. This property of electromotive force production is known as the [[Seebeck effect]]. This effect is utilized in the most widely employed method of [[thermometry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Light ==
The sun's rays can be used to produce electrical energy. The direct user of sunlight is the solar cell or [[photovoltaic cell]], which converts sunlight directly into electrical energy without the incorporation of a mechanical device. This technology is simpler than the fossil-fuel-driven systems of producing electrical energy. A solar cell is formed by a light-sensitive p-n junction semiconductor, which when exposed to sunlight is excited to conduction by the photons in light. When light, in the form of photons, hits the cell and strikes an atom, [[Photoionization|photo-ionisation]] creates electron-hole pairs. The electrostatic field causes separation of these pairs, establishing an electromotive force in the process. The electric field sends the electron to the p-type material, and the hole to the n-type material. If an external current path is provided, electrical energy will be available to do work. The electron flow provides the current, and the cell's electric field creates the voltage. With both current and voltage the silicon cell has power. The greater the amount of light falling on the cell's surface, the greater is the probability of photons releasing electrons, and hence more electric energy is produced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Chemical ==
[[File:Galvanic_Cell.svg|thumb|Galvanic Cell]]
When a zinc electrode and copper electrode are placed in a dilute solution of sulfuric acid, the two metals react to each other's presence within the [[electrolyte]] and develop a potential difference of about 1 volt between them. When a conducting path joins the electrodes externally, the zinc [[electrode]] dissolves slowly into the acid electrolyte, The zinc molecule goes into the electrolyte in the form of positive ions while its electrons are left on the electrode. The copper electrode on the other hand does not dissolve in the electrolyte. Instead it gives up its electrons to the positively charged ions of hydrogen in the electrolyte, turning them into molecules of hydrogen gas that bubble up around the electrode. The zinc ion combines with the sulfate ion to form zinc sulfate, and this salt falls to the bottom of the cell. The effect of all this is that the dissolving zinc electrode becomes negatively charged, the copper electrode is left with a positive charge and electrons from the zinc pass through the external circuit to the copper electrode.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Pressure ==
The molecules of some crystals and ceramics are permanently polarised: some parts of the molecule are positively charged, while other parts are negatively charged. These materials produce an electric charge when the material changes dimension as a result of an imposed external force. The charge produced is referred to as [[piezoelectricity]]. Many crystalline materials such as the natural crystals of quartz and rochelle salted together with manufactured polycrystalline ceramics such as lead titanate zirconate and barium titanate exhibit piezoelectric effects. [[Piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] materials are used as buzzers inside pagers, ultrasonic cleaners and mobile phones, and in gas igniters. In addition, these piezoelectric sensors are able to convert pressure, force, vibration or shock into electrical energy. Being capable only of measuring active events, they are also used in flow meters, [[accelerometer]]s and level detectors, as well as motor vehicles to sense changes in the transmission, fuel injection and coolant pressure. When a voltage or an applied electric field stresses a piezo element electrically, its dimensions change. This phenomenon is known as [[electrostriction]], or the reverse piezoelectric effect. This effect enables the element to act as a translating device called an actuator. Piezoelectric materials are used in power actuators, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, and in acoustic transducers, converting electric fields into sound waves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Magnetism ==
The most useful and widely employed application of [[magnetism]] is in the production of electrical energy. The mechanical power needed to assist in this production is provided by a number of different sources. These sources are called [[Prime mover (engine)|prime movers]], and include diesel, petrol and natural gas engines. Coal, oil, natural gas, biomass and nuclear energy are energy sources that are used to heat water to produce super-heated steam. Non-mechanical prime movers include water, steam, wind, wave motion and tidal current. These non-mechanical prime movers engage a turbine that is coupled to a generator. Generators that employ the principle of [[Electromagnetic induction|electro-magnetic induction]] carry out the final conversion of these energy sources. In order to do this, three necessary conditions must exist before a voltage is created by magnetism: movement, conductors and a magnetic field.

In accordance with these conditions, when a conductor or conductors move through a magnetic field to cut the lines of force, electrons are enabled to enter the [[Valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] thereby inducing an electric pressure for the production of [[alternating current]] in an external circuit. This may be referred to as an elementary alternator, consisting of a single wire loop called an [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] with each end being attached to slip-rings and arranged so as to revolve midway between the magnetic poles. Two copper-graphite brushes connect with the external circuit on the slip-rings in order to collect the [[alternating current]], generated in the conductor when the alternator is in operation. Another machine used for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of [[electromagnetic induction]] is called a [[dynamo]] or direct current generator.

The key difference between an alternator and a generator is that the alternator delivers AC ([[alternating current]]) to the external circuit, while the generator delivers DC ([[direct current]]). In both machines alternating current is induced in the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]], but the type of current delivered to the external circuit depends on the way in  which the induced current is collected. In an [[alternator]], the current is collected brushes bearing against slip-rings; in a generator, a form of rotating switch called the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] is placed between the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] and the external circuit. The commutator is designed to reverse the connections with the external circuit at the instant of each reversal of induced current in the armature, producing rectified current or direct current. This rectified current is not pure like the current of a [[voltaic cell]] but is instead a pulsating current that is constant in direction   and varying in intensity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Debris-GEO1280.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Earth from space, surrounded by small white dots|A computer-generated image representing space debris as could be seen from [[high Earth orbit]]. The two main debris fields are the ring of objects in [[geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous Earth orbit]] (GEO) and the cloud of objects in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).]]

Initially, the term '''space debris''' referred to the natural debris found in the solar system: [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteoroid]]s. However, with the 1979 beginning of the NASA Orbital Debris Program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/ NASA Orbital Debris Program]&lt;/ref&gt; the term also refers to the debris (alt. '''space waste''' or '''space garbage''') from the mass of defunct, artificially created objects in space, especially [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]]. These include old [[satellite]]s and spent [[rocket stage]]s, as well as the fragments from their disintegration and [[collision]]s. 

As of December 2016, five [[satellite collision]]s have generated space debris.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Space debris is also known as ''orbital debris'', ''space junk'', ''space waste'', ''space trash'', ''space litter'' or ''space garbage''.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/debris.htm GUIDE TO SPACE DEBRIS from the spaceacademy.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt;
   
{{as of|2016|7|5}}, the [[United States Strategic Command]] tracked a total of 17,852 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth,&lt;ref name=ODQN-201607&gt;{{cite newsletter |url=https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/quarterly-news/pdfs/odqnv20i3.pdf |title=Orbital Debris Quarterly News |volume=20 |issue=3 |page=8 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=July 2016 |access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 1,419 operational satellites.&lt;ref name=ucs&gt;{{cite web |title=UCS Satellite Database |date=11 August 2016 |work=Nuclear Weapons &amp; Global Security |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these are just objects large enough to be tracked. {{as of|July 2013}}, more than 170 million bits of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, about 670,000 pieces of debris 1–10 cm, and around 29,000 larger pieces were estimated to be in orbit around the earth.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Clean_Space/How_many_space_debris_objects_are_currently_in_orbit "How many space debris objects are currently in orbit?"] ''ESA'', July 2013. Retrieved 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft; they cause damage akin to [[sandblasting]], especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or [[star tracker]]s that cannot be covered with a [[hypervelocity ballistic shield|ballistic]] [[Whipple shield]] (unless it is transparent).&lt;ref name=nasa20090428&gt;

Below {{convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} Earth-[[orbital altitude|altitude]], pieces of debris are denser than [[meteoroid]]s; most are dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from [[RORSAT]] (nuclear-powered satellites). 
For comparison, the [[International Space Station]] orbits in the {{convert|300|–|400|km}} range, and the [[2009 satellite collision]] and [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|2007 antisat test]] occurred at {{convert|800|to|900|km}} altitude.&lt;ref name=nasa9&gt;

The [[Kessler syndrome]], a runaway [[chain reaction]] of collisions exponentially increasing the amount of debris, has been hypothesized to ensue beyond a critical density. This could affect useful polar-orbiting bands, increases the cost of protection for spacecraft missions and could destroy live satellites. Whether Kessler syndrome is already underway has been debated.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Grossman, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/kessler-syndrome/ "NASA Considers Shooting Space Junk with Lasers"], ''wired'', 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the [[space industry]].

== Characterization ==

=== {{anchor|Large vs. small}}Size ===
There are estimated to be over 51 million pieces of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on}} as of July 2013. There are approximately 670,000 pieces from one to ten cm. The current count of large debris (defined as 10&amp;nbsp;cm across or larger&lt;ref name="technasa"&gt;[http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/UN_Report_on_Space_Debris99.pdf "Technical report on space debris"], p. 15, United Nations, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;) is 29,000.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"/&gt; The technical measurement cutoff is c. {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="nasadebris2012"&gt;[http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/faqs.html#3 "Orbital Debris FAQ: How much orbital debris is currently in Earth orbit?"] ''NASA'', March 2012. Retrieved 31 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Over 98 percent of the 1,900 tons of debris in low Earth orbit (as of 2002) was accounted for by about 1,500 objects, each over {{convert|100|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Carroll, [http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/800Carroll.pdf "Space Transport Development Using Orbital Debris"], NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, 2 December 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Total mass is mostly constant despite addition of many smaller objects, since they reenter the atmosphere sooner. Using a 2008 figure of 8,500 known items, it is estimated at {{convert|5500|t|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Robin McKie and Michael Day, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/24/spaceexplorationspacejunk "Warning of catastrophe from mass of 'space junk'"] ''The Observer'', 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris in LEO}}Low Earth orbit (LEO) ===
[[File:Space Junk.jpg|thumb|alt=Earth from space, with space debris enhanced|Space debris in LEO, with sizes exaggerated]]

In LEO there are few "universal orbits" which keep spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single widely used orbit). The closest are [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]; they are [[Polar orbit|polar]], meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects (the density of objects is much higher in LEO).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Ford, [https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/orbiting-space-junk-heightens-risk-of-satellite-catastrophes.ars "Orbiting space junk heightens risk of satellite catastrophes."] ''Ars Technica'', 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbits are further changed by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field), and collisions can occur from any direction. For these reasons, the Kessler syndrome applies mostly to the LEO region; impacts occur at up to 16&amp;nbsp;km/s (twice the [[orbital speed]]) if head-on – the [[2009 satellite collision]] occurred at 11.7&amp;nbsp;km/s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Debris/1112600510257_0.html "What are hypervelocity impacts?"] ''ESA'', 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; creating much [[spall]] in the critical size range. These can cross other orbits and lead to a cascade effect. A large-enough collision (e.g. between a space station and a defunct satellite) could make [[low Earth orbit]] impassable.&lt;ref name="k09"&gt;{{cite web |  url = http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  title = The Kessler Syndrome |  date = 8 March 2009 |  author = Donald J. Kessler |  access-date = 22 September 2009 |  archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527195029/http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  archive-date = 27 May 2010 |  dead-url = yes |  df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manned missions are mostly at {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. Atmospheric expansion as a result of [[space weather]] raises the critical altitude by increasing drag; in the 90s, it was a factor in reduced debris density.&lt;ref name=k9165 /&gt; Another was fewer launches by Russia; the USSR made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=k7&gt;Klinkrad, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris at higher altitudes}}Higher altitudes ===
At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]], [[Lunar theory|lunar perturbations]], Earth's gravity perturbations, [[solar wind]] and solar [[radiation pressure]] can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.&lt;ref name=kam68&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.{{contradict-inline|date=December 2015}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| bibcode=2005ESASP.587..113S | title=Optical observation of space debris in high-altitude orbits | journal=Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Space Debris (ESA SP-587). 18–20 April 2005 | volume=587 | page=113 | author1=Schildknecht | first1=T. | last2=Musci | first2=R. | last3=Flury | first3=W. | last4=Kuusela | first4=J. | last5=De Leon | first5=J. | last6=Dominguez Palmero | first6=L. De Fatima | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many communications satellites are in [[geostationary orbit]]s (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as [[Telstar 401]]) it assumes a [[geosynchronous orbit]]; its [[orbital inclination]] increases about .8° and its speed increases about {{convert|100|mph}} per year. Impact velocity peaks at about {{convert|1.5|km/s|abbr=on}}. [[Perturbation (astronomy)|Orbital perturbations]] cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and [[precession]] of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231404/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/ISSFD_89085.pdf "Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West."] ''CNES Symposium on Space Dynamics'', 6–10 November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as [[Space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], are especially vulnerable to collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ha | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Hechler | first2 = M. | year = 1981| title = The Collision Probability of Geostationary Satellites | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981rome.iafcR....V | journal = 32nd International Astronautical Congress | volume = 1981 | issue = | page = 23 | bibcode=1981rome.iafcR....V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient.&lt;ref name= Anselmo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anselmo | first1 = L. | last2 = Pardini | first2 = C. | year = 2000 | title = Collision Risk Mitigation in Geostationary Orbit | url = | journal = Space Debris | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 67–82 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021255523174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}, the nature of the problem is not well known.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvring and making it easier to predict future motion.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in [[geostationary transfer orbit]], are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The [[European Space Agency]] telecom satellite [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a [[graveyard orbit]].&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure"&gt;[http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html "The Olympus failure"] ''ESA press release'', 26 August 1993.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911181644/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html |date=11 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 March 2006, the Russian [[Express (satellite)|Express-AM11]] communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=20320 "Notification for Express-AM11 satellite users in connection with the spacecraft failure"] ''Russian Satellite Communications Company'', 19 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.

In 1958, the United States launched [[Vanguard I]] into a [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO). {{As of|2009|10}}, it, and the upper stage of its launch rocket, are the oldest surviving man-made space objects still in orbit.&lt;ref name="usaweekend"&gt;Julian Smith, [http://www.usaweekend.com/07_issues/070826/070826space.html#junk "Space Junk"]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''USA Weekend'', 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-03/nrl-vic031308.php Vanguard 50 years]&lt;/ref&gt; In a catalog of known launches until July 2009, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] listed 902 operational satellites&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html "UCS Satellite Database"] ''Union of Concerned Scientists'', 16 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; from a known population of 19,000 large objects and about 30,000 objects launched.

An example of additional dead satellite debris are the remains of the 1970s/80s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RORSAT]] naval surveillance satellite program. The satellite's BES-5 [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] were cooled with a coolant loop of [[NaK|sodium-potassium alloy]], creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude [[graveyard orbit]]s, not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy,&lt;ref name=wiedemann2009&gt;C. Wiedemann et al, "Size distribution of NaK droplets for MASTER-2009", ''Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Space Debris'', 30 March-2 April 2009, (ESA SP-672, July 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; forming additional debris.&lt;ref name=rossi1997&gt;A.

These events continue to occur.  For example, in February 2015, the [[USAF]] [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]] Flight 13 (DMSP-F13) exploded on orbit, creating at least 149 debris objects, which were expected to remain in orbit for decades.&lt;ref name=sn20150506&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gruss|first1=Mike |title=DMSP-F13 Debris To Stay On Orbit for Decades |url=http://spacenews.com/dmsp-f13-debris-to-stay-on-orbit-for-decades/ |accessdate=7 May 2015 |work=Space News |date=2015-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A past debris source was the testing of [[anti-satellite weapon]]s (ASATs) by the U.S. and Soviet Union during the 1960s and 1970s. [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) files only contained data for Soviet tests, and debris from U.S. tests were only identified later.&lt;ref name=s48-note&gt;Note that the list Schefter was presented only identified USSR ASAT tests.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the debris problem was understood, widespread ASAT testing had ended; the U.S. [[Program 437]] was shut down in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton Chun, "Shooting Down a Star: America's Thor Program 437, Nuclear ASAT, and Copycat Killers", Maxwell AFB Base, AL: Air University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|1-58566-071-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although spacecraft are protected by [[Whipple shield]]s, solar panels, which are exposed to the Sun, wear from low-mass impacts. These produce a cloud of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] which is an electrical risk to the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akahoshi | first1 = Y. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Influence of space debris impact on solar array under power generation | url = | journal = International Journal of Impact Engineering | volume = 35 | issue = 12| pages = 1678–1682 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2008.07.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects.

Many impacts have been confirmed since. [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993, and left adrift.&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure" /&gt; On 24 July 1996, the French [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]] [[Cerise (satellite)|Cerise]] was hit by fragments of an Ariane-1 H-10 upper-stage booster which exploded in November 1986.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2" /&gt; On 29 March 2006, the Russian Ekspress AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419 /&gt; its engineers had sufficient time in contact with the spacecraft to send it to a [[parking orbit]] out of GEO.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} On October 13, 2009, [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] suffered a single battery cell failure anomaly and a battery heater control anomaly which were likely the result of an MMOD strike.&lt;ref name="Mission Report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Angelita|title=Terra mission operations: Launch to the present (and beyond)|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160008917.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2010, [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] lost power from one-half of one of its 11 solar panels and this was also attributed to an MMOD strike.&lt;ref name="2017Status"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Dominic|title=Mission Status at Aura Science Team MOWG Meeting|date=13 June 2017|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170005606.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, 2013 GOES-13 was hit by an MMOD which caused it to lose track of the stars that it uses to maintain attitude.

From the early [[Space Shuttle]] missions, NASA used NORAD to monitor the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this used much of its capacity.&lt;ref name=s50 /&gt; The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during [[STS-48]] in September 1991,&lt;ref name=encounters&gt;Rob Matson, [http://www.satobs.org/satclose.html "Satellite Encounters"] ''Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page''.&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-second [[reaction control system|thruster burn]] to avoid debris from [[Kosmos 955]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/52642978/STS-48-Space-Shuttle-Mission-Report "STS-48 Space Shuttle Mission Report"], NASA, NASA-CR-193060, October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar maneuvers followed on missions 53, 72 and 82.&lt;ref name=encounters /&gt;

One of the first events to publicize the debris problem occurred on [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]'s second flight, [[STS-7]]. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over {{Convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} wide. On [[STS-59]] in 1994, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']]'s front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Hyden | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Bernhard | first3 = R.

Window chipping and minor damage to [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system tiles]] (TPS) was already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take the debris load mostly on the engines and rear cargo bay (not used in orbit or during descent, and less critical for post-launch operation). When flying to the [[International Space Station|ISS]], the two connected spacecraft were flipped around so the better-armored station shielded the orbiter.&lt;ref name=threat /&gt;

On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk was c. 1 in 300, but [[STS-125]] (the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] repair mission) at {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on}} was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 risk (due to the [[2009 satellite collision]]). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;William Harwood, [http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090416debris/ "Improved odds ease NASA's concerns about space debris"], ''CBS News'', 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gabbard diagrams ===
A debris cloud resulting from a single event is studied with [[scatter plot]]s known as Gabbard diagrams, where the [[perigee]] and [[apogee]] of fragments are plotted with respect to their [[orbital period]]. Gabbard diagrams of the early debris cloud prior to the effects of perturbations, if the data were available, are reconstructed.

Another approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to always leave the rocket second-stage in an [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] [[geocentric orbit]] with a low-[[perigee]], thus ensuring rapid [[orbital decay]] and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies.  Such missions require the use of a small [[Apogee kick motor|kick stage]] to circularize the orbit, but the kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/ https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A consensus of speakers at a meeting in Brussels on 30 October 2012 organized by the Secure World Foundation (a U.S. think tank) and the French International Relations Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/experts-active-removal-key-countering-space-junk-threat#.Ub3dSuce2Zc "Experts: Active Removal Key To Countering Space Junk Threat"] Peter B. de Selding, Space.com 31 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future (without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in LEO). Removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action. Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions.

{{as of|2006}} the cost of any of these solutions is about the same as launching a spacecraft{{failed verification|date=December 2015}} and, according to NASA's Nicholas Johnson, not cost-effective.&lt;ref name=natgeo /&gt;{{outdated inline|date=December 2015}} Since then Space Sweeper with Sling-Sat (4S), a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris, has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jan |first=McHarg |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-08-aims-space-debris.html |title=Project aims to remove space debris |publisher=Phys.org |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris, [[Spacecraft capture|capture]] it temporarily to attach a [[smallsat|smaller de-orbit satellite]] and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location.  The "mothership" would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for [[atmospheric entry]] or move it to a graveyard orbit.

==== Laser methods ====
The [[laser broom]] uses a ground-based [[laser]] to [[Ablation|ablate]] the front of the debris, producing a rocket-like thrust which slows the object. With continued application, the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Campbell, [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat20.pdf "Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection"], Occasional Paper No. 20, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired20111026&gt;{{cite news |last=Mann|first=Adam |title=Space Junk Crisis: Time to Bring in the Lasers |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/10/space-junk-laser/ |accessdate=1 November 2011 |newspaper=Wired Science |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, the U.S. Air Force's Project Orion was a laser-broom design.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Bekey, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ESASP.393..699B Project Orion: Orbital Debris Removal Using Ground-Based Sensors and Lasers].", ''Second European Conference on Space Debris'', 1997, ESA-SP 393, p. 699.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a Space Shuttle in 2003, international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements.&lt;ref name=srdc20000816&gt;Justin Mullins [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=2426 "A clean sweep: NASA plans to carry out a spot of housework."], ''New Scientist'', 16 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] postponed the project and according to Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program manager for NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, "There are lots of little gotchas in the Orion final report.

The momentum of the laser-beam [[photon]]s could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=UKmail20110316&gt;James Mason et al, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1690 "Orbital Debris-Debris Collision Avoidance"], arXiv:1103.1690v2, 9 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in [[Sun-synchronous orbit]], using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry.&lt;ref name=sn20141125 /&gt; A proposal to replace the laser with an [[Ion Beam Shepherd]] has been made,&lt;ref&gt;C.

=== Micrometeoroids ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}
{{Main|Micrometeoroid}}
In 1946 during the [[Giacobinids|Giacobinid meteor shower]], [[Helmut Landsberg]] collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.pnas.org/content/36/12/687.full.pdf?ck=nck "The Theory of Micro-Meteorites, Part I: In an Isothermal Atmosphere"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Volume 36 Number 12 (15 December 1950), pp. 667 – 695.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Whipple]] was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the [[upper atmosphere]]. Instead, they quickly decelerated and then fell to Earth unmelted. In order to classify these sorts of objects, he coined the term "[[micrometeorite|micro-meteorite]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1949PA.....57..517W "The Theory of Micrometeorites."], ''Popular Astronomy'', Volume 57, 1949, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipple, in collaboration with Fletcher Watson of the [[Harvard Observatory]], led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen. At the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known. Direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors, demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from [[comet]] tails, and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin.&lt;ref name=whipple1951&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = Fred | year = 1951 | title = A Comet Model. II. Physical Relations for Comets and Meteors | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 464–474 | bibcode=1951ApJ...113..464W | doi=10.1086/145416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the Solar System, consisting of particles from the [[interplanetary dust cloud]] or other objects made up from this material, like comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownlee | first1 = D. E. | last2 = Tomandl | first2 = D. A. | last3 = Olszewski | first3 = E. | year = 1977| title = 1977LPI.....8..145B Interplanetary dust: A new source of extraterrestrial material for laboratory studies | journal = Proceedings of the 8th Lunar Scientific Conference | volume = 1977 | issue = | pages = 149–160 | bibcode=1977LPI.....8..145B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early studies were based on optical measurements only. In 1957, Hans Pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the Earth, estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Pettersson, "Cosmic Spherules and Meteoritic Dust." ''Scientific American'', Volume 202 Issue 2 (February 1960), pp. 123–132.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations. Such a high flux presented a very serious risk to missions deeper in space, specifically the high-orbiting [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] capsules. To determine whether the direct measurement was accurate, a number of additional studies followed, including the [[Pegasus satellite program]]. These showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere, or flux, was in line with the optical measurements, at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Snelling and David Rush, [http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf "Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174406/http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf |date=12 May 2011 }} ''Creation Ex-Nihilo Technical Journal'', Volume 7 Number 1 (1993), p. 2–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micrometeoroid shielding ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}&lt;!-- I don't think so; it needs a copyedit but the material is about shielding spacecraft from space debris of the small size.  Probably a mistake to name it "micrometeoroid", since none of the small orbital stuff, natural or manmade, is a micrometeoroid until in reenters the atmosphere. --&gt;
[[File:Hypervelocity Impact Demonstration.jpg|left|thumb|The "energy flash" of a [[hypervelocity]] impact during a simulation of what happens when a piece of orbital debris hits a spacecraft in orbit.]]

Whipple's work pre-dated the [[space race]] and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later. His studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote. However, a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites, about the size of dust grains.&lt;ref name=whipple1951 /&gt;

Whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946. Originally known as a "meteor bumper" and now termed the [[Whipple shield]], this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft's body. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil, it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads. By the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft, it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;Brian Marsden, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-fred-whipple-533019.html "Professor Fred Whipple: Astronomer who developed the idea that comets are 'dirty snowballs'."] ''The Independent'', 13 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity, while the foil adds little additional weight. Such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly.

For spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit, some variety of the Whipple shield has been almost universal for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/289/5480/728 "Of Comets and Meteors"] ''Science'', Volume 289 Number 5480 (4 August 2000), p. 728.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Reustle (curator), [http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm "Shield Development: Basic Concepts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927133616/http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm |date=27 September 2011 }}, NASA HVIT.

=== NORAD, Gabbard and Kessler ===
To avoid artificial space debris, many—but not all—research satellites are launched on [[elliptical orbit]]s with perigees inside Earth's atmosphere so they will destroy themselves. [[Willy Ley]] predicted in 1960 that "In time, a number of such accidentally too-lucky shots will accumulate in space and will have to be removed when the era of manned space flight arrives".&lt;ref name="ley196008"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |date=August 1960 |title=How to Slay Dragons |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v18n06_1960-08#page/n55/mode/2up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=57–72 |department=For Your Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957, the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) began compiling a database (the [[Space Object Catalog]]) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper- and lower-stage booster rockets. [[NASA]] published modified versions of the database in [[two-line element set]],&lt;ref name="Hoots"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix Hoots | first1 = Paul Schumacher Jr. | last2 = Glover | first2 = Robert | year = | title = History of Analytical Orbit Modeling in the U.S. Space Surveillance System | url = | journal = Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 174–185 | doi=10.2514/1.9161| bibcode = 2004JGCD...27..174H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the early 1980s the CelesTrak [[bulletin board system]] re-published them.&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Kelso, [http://celestrak.com/NORAD/archives/ CelesTrak BBS: Historical Archives], 2-line elements dating to 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.&lt;ref name=s48&gt;Schefter, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were deliberately caused during 1960s [[anti-satellite weapon]] (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modelling of orbital evolution and decay.&lt;ref name=portree /&gt;

When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, NASA scientist [[Donald J. Kessler]] applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects. In 1978 Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais co-authored "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt",&lt;ref name=Kessler78&gt;Kessler 1978&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in LEO in decades rather than billions of years. They concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

At the time, it was widely thought that drag from the [[Atmosphere of Earth|upper atmosphere]] would de-orbit debris faster than it was created. However, Gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the NORAD data and was familiar with its behaviour. In an interview shortly after the publication of Kessler's paper, Gabbard coined the term "[[Kessler syndrome]]" to refer to the accumulation of debris;&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 ''[[Popular Science]]'' article,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Schefter&lt;/ref&gt; which won the Aviation-Space Writers Association 1982 National Journalism Award.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

[[File:Baker-Nunn camera.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Large camera, with a man standing next to it for scale|[[Schmidt camera#Baker-Nunn|Baker-Nunn cameras]] were widely used to study space debris.]]
The lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the LEO environment. In October 1979, [[NASA]] provided Kessler with funding for further studies.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; Several approaches were used by these studies.

Optical telescopes or short-wavelength radar was used to measure the number and size of space objects, and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50% too low.&lt;ref name=k9165&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, it was believed that the NORAD database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit. Some objects (typically, U.S. military spacecraft) were found to be omitted from the NORAD list, and others were not included because they were considered unimportant. The list could not easily account for objects under {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} in size—in particular, debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

Returned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts, and sections of [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] which were recovered were found to be pitted. Each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of collisions in space. LEO already demonstrated the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1978 Kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events, primarily explosions of spent rocket stages (especially U.S. [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rockets]]).&lt;ref name=kessler81&gt;Kessler 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered this by first identifying those launches that were described having a large number of objects associated with a payload, then researching the literature to determine the rockets used in the launch.  In 1979, this finding resulted in establishment of the NASA Orbital Debris Program after a briefing to NASA senior management, overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old ASAT tests, but from US upper stage rocket explosions and could be easily managed by depleting the unused fuel following the payload injection the upper stage Delta rocket.  Beginning in 1986, when it was discovered that other international agencies were possibly experiencing the same type of problem, NASA expanded its program to include international agencies, the first being the European Space Agency.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2"&gt;Klinkrad, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other Delta components in orbit (Delta was a workhorse of the U.S. space program) had not yet exploded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== {{anchor|A new Kessler Syndrome}}A new Kessler syndrome ===
During the 1980s, the U.S. Air Force conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris. The study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions, with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1991, Kessler published "Collisional cascading: The limits of population growth in low Earth orbit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://meteor.uwo.ca/kessler/Critical%20Density%201991.pdf pdf of article]&lt;/ref&gt; with the best data then available. Citing the USAF conclusions about creation of debris, he wrote that although almost all debris objects (such as paint flecks) were lightweight, most of its mass was in debris about {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} or heavier. This mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact, creating more debris in the critical-mass area.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; According to the National Academy of Sciences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A 1-kg object impacting at 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, for example, is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000-kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft. In such a breakup, numerous fragments larger than 1&amp;nbsp;kg would be created.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kessler's analysis divided the problem into three parts. With a low-enough density, the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant. Beyond that is a critical density, where additional debris leads to additional collisions. At densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay, leading to a cascading [[chain reaction]] reducing the orbiting population to small objects (several cm in size) and increasing the hazard of space activity.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; This chain reaction is known as the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In an early 2009 historical overview, Kessler summed up the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft. Some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the Strategic Defense Initiative in the mid-1980s, large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in Earth orbit, and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the USSR, the U.S., and China over the past 30 years. Such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debris growth ===
During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One effective&lt;!-- see Kessler's estimate above about debris from exploding boosters --&gt; solution was implemented by [[McDonnell Douglas]] on the Delta booster,{{when|date=December 2014}} by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated the pressure buildup in the tanks which caused them to explode in the past.&lt;ref name=s50&gt;Schefter, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the [[Soviet Union]], the problem grew throughout the decade.&lt;ref name=h7&gt;See charts, Hoffman p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new battery of studies followed{{when|date=December 2014}} as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000,&lt;ref name=s48 /&gt; new detectors in the [[Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance]] system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;See chart, Hoffman p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;In the time between writing Chapter 1 (earlier) and the Prolog (later) of ''Space Debris'', Klinkrad changed the number from 8,500 to 13,000 – compare p. 6 and ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an [[Anti-satellite weapon|ASAT]] test and a satellite collision.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hoffman, [http://defensenews.com/blogs/space-symposium/ "It's getting crowded up there."] ''Space News'', 3 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/04/06/space-junk-threat-grow-astronauts-satellites/ "Space Junk Threat Will Grow for Astronauts and Satellites"], Fox News, 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,&lt;ref&gt;Kessler 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the LEO environment in the {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major incident has occurred: the [[2009 satellite collision]] between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Technical&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to Kessler a cascade would not be obvious until it was well advanced, which might take years.&lt;ref name=graph&gt;Jan Stupl et al, [http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf "Debris-debris collision avoidance using medium power ground-based lasers"], 2010 Beijing Orbital Debris Mitigation Workshop, 18–19 October 2010, see graph p. 4  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309055302/http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf |date=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;Stefan Lovgren, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0119_060119_space_junk.html "Space Junk Cleanup Needed, NASA Experts Warn."] ''National Geographic News'', 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.-C Liou and N. L. Johnson, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/311/5759/340 "Risks in Space from Orbiting Debris"], ''Science'', Volume 311 Number 5759 (20 January 2006), pp. 340 – 341&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Crowther of Britain's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Milne, ''Sky Static: The Space Debris Crisis'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-275-97749-8}}, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space—900 to {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}}—were already past  critical density.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, [[University of Southampton]] researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. {{asof|2009}}, more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marks, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18050-space-debris-threat-to-future-launches.html "Space debris threat to future launches"], 27 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[National Research Council (United States)|U.S. National Research Council]] warned [[NASA]] that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris "has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures". The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14757926 Space junk at tipping point, says report], BBC News, 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The plot of episode 4 ("Conflict") of Gerry Anderson's 1970 TV series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' includes routine missions for the disposal of spent satellites by bombing.

''[[Salvage 1]]'' (1979 TV series) deals humorously with a scrap dealer who establish a space junk salvage company.

''[[Planetes]]'' is a manga (1999-2004) and anime series (2003-2004) that gives focus on a team which is responsible for the collection and disposal of space debris. The DVDs for the TV series include interviews with NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office.

In 2009, [[Rhett and Link|Rhett &amp; Link]] wrote a song called "Space Junk" and made an accompanying music video for the TV series ''[[Brink (TV series)|Brink]]''.  The lyrics refer to two men tasked to clean up debris such as satellites and expended rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fy7psIuJjc |author=Rhett &amp; Link |author-link=Rhett and Link |title=Space Junk Song |website=YouTube |type=video |accessdate=18 August 2018 |date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' is a 2013 survival film, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, about a disaster on a space mission caused by [[Kessler syndrome]].

A '''''State Environmental Quality Review Act''''' (SEQRA) is a stipulation enacted by the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] that all local and state government agencies must uniformly reflect the [[environmental impacts]] when considering taking social and/or economic factors into action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libraryguides.law.pace.edu/c.php?g=319391&amp;p=2133260|title=LibGuides: New York Environmental Legal Research Guide: State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA)|last=Rosen|first=Alyssa|website=libraryguides.law.pace.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1975, the state of New York passed the State Environmental Quality Review Act to better establish a process when looking to add new developments on a site.  From 1976 to 2005 there have been alterations to the Changes or Applications and Amendments categories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6208.html|title=Introduction to SEQR - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who Must Apply==
This applies to any group that is deciding to approve a funded sponsored action through private or public financials. These groups include the following;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Authorities
* Special Boards
* Districts
* Local Government 
* State Government 
Any project or action classified under Type I has to follow SEQRA requirements. A '''''Type I''''' action is any class of actions that unavoidably is going to have significant impacts on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/43711.html|title=A. SEQR Handbook: Type I Actions - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
There is no one agency that has the power to enforce SEQRA. The formation of the legislation enables it to be self-enforcing. The agencies responsible for an action that falls under SEQRA requirements must under its own power meet these regulations. The regulations that are issued are provided through the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation|Department of Environmental Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/357.html|title=SEQR - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Do Not Apply==
If the project is listed under the statewide and agency SEQRA regulations is listen under the Type II list then it is determined not to have a large impact on the surrounding environment. '''''Type II''''' actions are classified as the project not having any significant impacts on the surrounding environment, or actions that have been exempted from SEQRA reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/39800.html|title=B. SEQR Handbook: Type II Actions - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Satisfying Requirements ==
When going forward to satisfying the SEQRA requirements there is an 11 step process that you need to follow.

'''Step 1''' Is the action being taken subject to SEQRA. If yes then it needs to be classified as a type II Action or Type I Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/32521.html|title=Follow the SEQR Path - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Step 2''' The correct environmental assessment form needs to be completed and reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6433.html|title=Step 2. Complete the Correct Environmental Assessment Form - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Step 3''' A coordinated review is set up by all agencies involved in Type 1 Actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6431.html|title=Step 3: Coordinate Review|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dec.ny.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Step 4''' This is the step where the agency that is taking the lead will make its determination on the significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6428.html|title=Step 4: Determine Significance - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Step 10''' This is where the lead agency is held accountable for checking the precision on the final EIS statement. This should be finalized 45 days after the final hearings or 60 days after the filing of the draft EIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6416.html|title=Step 10 Preparation of the Final EIS - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Step 11''' The final step is involves each agency writing their own SEQRA findings statement for that project. This has to be completed after the final EIS statement and before the final decision the agency makes. Findings certify that the project has met requirements of Part 617.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6414.html|title=Step 11 SEQR Findings - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are specific geographical areas that local agencies can deem Critical Environmental Areas (CEA). To designate an area to this stand it mus have one of more of the following characteristics ;
# a threat or benefit to human well being 
# a natural setting that includes things such as areas of important aesthetic or scenic quality, wildlife habitat, and vegetation. 
# values that include agricultural, cultural, archaeological, historic, or educational
# Essential geological, ecological, or hydrological sensitivity that can be altered by any change around it.

In [[astronomy]], a '''syzygy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|z|ᵻ|dʒ|i}}; from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang-grc|σύζυγος|suzugos|yoked together|label=none}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of syzygy |website = Collins English Dictionary |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/syzygy |accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a (roughly) straight-line configuration of three or more [[celestial bodies]] in a gravitational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Overview ==
The word is often used in reference to the [[Sun]], [[Earth]], and either the [[Moon]] or a [[planet]], where the latter is in [[astronomical conjunction|conjunction]] or [[astronomical opposition|opposition]]. [[solar eclipse|Solar]] and [[lunar eclipse|lunar]] [[eclipse]]s occur at times of syzygy, as do [[Astronomical transit|transits]] and [[occultation]]s. The term is
often applied when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction ([[new moon]]) or opposition ([[full moon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coyle |first=Harold P. |title=Syzygy |url=http://accessscience.com/content/Syzygy/757218 |work=AccessScience |publisher=©McGraw-Hill Companies |year=2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''syzygy'' is often used to describe interesting configurations of astronomical objects in general. For example, one such case occurred on March 21, 1894, around 23:00 [[GMT]], when [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] transited the Sun as would have been seen from Venus, and Mercury and [[Venus]] both simultaneously transited the Sun as seen from [[Saturn]]. It is also used to describe situations when all the planets are on the same side of the Sun although they are ''not necessarily in a straight line'', such as on March 10, 1982.&lt;ref name="nyt-1982"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/14/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-it-s-all-right-to-come-out-now.html |title=Ideas &amp; Trends in Summary; It's All Right To Come Out Now |work=New York Times| date=March 14, 1982 |accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2014, the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] on Mars observed the planet [[transit of Mercury from Mars|Mercury transiting the Sun]], marking the first time a [[planetary transit]] has been observed from a celestial body besides [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140610" /&gt;

== Occultations, transits, and eclipses ==

Syzygy sometimes results in an [[occultation]], transit, or [[eclipse]].

* An [[occultation]] occurs when an apparently larger body passes in front of an apparently smaller one. 
* A [[transit (astronomy)|transit]] occurs when a smaller body passes in front of a larger one.
** In the combined case where the smaller body regularly transits the larger, an occultation is also termed a secondary eclipse.
* An [[eclipse]] occurs when a body totally or partially disappears from view, either by an occultation, as with a [[solar eclipse]], or by passing into the shadow of another body, as with a [[lunar eclipse]] (thus both are listed on [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html NASA's eclipse page]).

Transits and occultations of the Sun by Earth's Moon are called [[solar eclipse]]s regardless of whether the Sun is completely or partially covered. By extension, transits of the Sun by a [[satellite]] of a planet may also be called eclipses, as with the transits of Phobos and Deimos shown on [http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/target/phobos NASA's JPL photojournal], as may the passage of a satellite into the planet's shadow, as with this [http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA03612 eclipse of Phobos]. The term ''eclipse'' is also used more generally for bodies passing in front of one another. For example, [http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070316.html a NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day] refers to the Moon eclipsing and occulting Saturn interchangeably.

== Einstein ring ==

As electromagnetic rays are somewhat bent by gravitation, when they pass by a heavy mass they are bent. One says the mass acts as a gravitational lens. If the light source, the diffracting mass and the observer stand in a line, one sees an [[Einstein ring]].

== Tidal variation ==

{{further|Tidal range}}

Syzygy causes the bimonthly phenomena of [[spring tide|spring]] and [[neap tide|neap]] tides. At the new and full moon, the Sun and Moon are in syzygy. Their [[tidal force]]s act to reinforce each other, and the ocean both rises higher and falls lower than the average. Conversely, at the first and third quarter, the Sun and Moon are at right angles, their tidal forces counteract each other, and the tidal range is smaller than average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tides: The Sun and Moon Affect the Oceans |author=Matt Rosenberg |url=http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/tides.htm |accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tidal variation can also be measured in the [[earth tide|earth's crust]], and this [[tidal triggering of earthquakes|may affect the frequency of earthquakes]].

[[File:Cricau Festival 2013 - Sanziene - 24.jpg|thumbnail|''Sânzienele'' at [[Cricău Festival]] 2013]]

'''''Sânziană''''' is the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name for gentle [[Fairy|fairies]] who play an important part in [[Romanian folklore|local folklore]], also used to designate the ''[[Galium verum]]'' or ''[[Cruciata laevipes]]'' flowers.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=September 2018}} Under the plural form '''''Sânziene''''', the word designates an annual [[festival]] in the fairies' honor. Etymologically, the name comes from the [[Latin]] ''Sancta [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'', the [[Roman goddess]] of the [[hunting|hunt]] and [[moon]], also celebrated in [[Roman Dacia]] (ancient Romania).{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=September 2018}} Diana was known to be the virgin goddess and looked after virgins and women. She was one of the three maiden goddesses, Diana, Minerva and Vesta, who swore never to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgnpress.ro/categorii/cultura--culte/2315-invitatie-srbtorii-sanzienele-la-muzeul-naional-de-istorie-a-romaniei.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626124047/http://www.rgnpress.ro/categorii/cultura--culte/2315-invitatie-srbtorii-sanzienele-la-muzeul-naional-de-istorie-a-romaniei.html |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in the western [[Carpathian Mountains]] celebrate the ''Sânziene'' holiday annually, on June 24. This is similar to the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Midsummer]] holiday, and is believed to be a [[Paganism|pagan]] celebration of the summer [[solstice]] in June. According to the official position of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], the customs actually relate to the celebration of [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]]'s [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|Nativity]], which also happens on June 24.

==''Sânziene'' rituals==
The folk practices of ''Sânziene'' imply that the most beautiful maidens in the village dress in white and spend all day searching for and picking flowers, of which one MUST be ''Galium verum'' (Lady's bedstraw or Yellow bedstraw) which in Romanian is also named "Sânziànă". Using the flowers they picked during the day, the girls braid floral crowns which they wear upon returning to the village at nightfall. There they meet with their beloved and they dance around a bonfire. The crowns are thrown over the houses, and whenever the crown falls, it is said that someone will die in that house; if the crown stays on the roof of the house, then good harvest and wealth will be bestowed upon the owners. As with other bonfire celebrations, jumping over the embers after the bonfire is not raging anymore is done to purify the person and also to bring health.

Another folk belief is that during the ''Sânziene'' Eve night, the heavens open up, making it the strongest night for magic spells, especially for the love spells. Also it is said that the plants harvested during this night will have tremendous magical powers.

It is not a good thing though to be a male and walk at night during Sanziene Eve night, as that is the time when the fairies dance in the air, blessing the crops and bestowing health on people - they do not like to be seen by males, and whomever sees them will be maimed, or the fairies will take their hearing/speech or make them mad.

In some areas of the Carpathians, the villagers then light a big wheel of [[hay]] from the ceremonial bonfire and push it down a hill. This has been interpreted as a symbol for the setting sun (from the solstice to come and until the [[Winter solstice|midwinter solstice]], the days will be getting shorter).

==In cultural reference==
The consequences of heavens opening on ''Sânziene'' are connected by some to [[paranormal]] events reported during that period of each year. According to popular beliefs, strange things, both positive and negative, may happen to a person wandering alone on ''Sânziene'' night. Strange ethereal activities are believed to happen especially in places such as the [[Băneasa]] forest (near the capital of [[Bucharest]]) or the Baciu forest (near the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]]).

[[Mircea Eliade]]'s novel, ''[[Noaptea de Sânziene]]'' (translated as ''The Forbidden Forest''), includes references to the folk belief about skies opening at night, as well as to paranormal events happening in the [[Băneasa Forest]].

In the form ''Sânziana'' ("the sânziană"), the word has also come to be used as a female name. It is notably used as such in [[Vasile Alecsandri]]'s comedy ''[[Sânziana şi Pepelea]]'' (later an [[opera]] by [[George Stephănescu]]).

In [[Māori mythology]], '''Tāwhaki''' is a semi-supernatural being associated with [[lightning]] and [[thunder]].

==Genealogy==
The genealogy of Tāwhaki varies somewhat in different accounts. In general, Tāwhaki is a grandson of [[Whaitiri]], a cannibalistic goddess who marries the mortal [[Kaitangata (mythology)|Kaitangata]] (man-eater), thinking that he shares her taste for human flesh. Disappointed at finding that this is not so, she leaves him after their sons [[Hemā (mythology)|Hemā]] and [[Punga (mythology)|Punga]] are born and returns to heaven. Hemā is the father of Tāwhaki and Karihi.&lt;ref&gt;In some versions, Tāwhaki's mother is [[Urutonga]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tāwhaki grows up to be handsome, the envy of his cousins, who beat him up and leave him for dead. He is nursed back to health by his wife, who feeds the fire that warms him with a whole log of wood. In memory of this incident, their child is named [[Wahieroa]] (Long-piece-of-firewood) (Biggs 1966:450). In some versions Tawhaki is the father of Arahuta. She was the cause of a quarrel between her parents, and her mother Tangotango took her to heaven, where they were afterwards joined by Tāwhaki.&lt;ref name="Grey1885p41"&gt;{{cite book |title=Polynesian Mythology and Ancient Traditional History of the New Zealand Race |last=Grey |first=Sir George |authorlink=George Grey |coauthors= |year=1885 |publisher=H. Brett |location=Auckland |isbn= |page=41 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-GrePoly-c1-3.html |accessdate=29 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avenges his father==
Hemā, while looking for a gift for his son, trespasses into the land of the [[Ponaturi]], who are evil beings. They capture him and Urutonga, blinding Hemā in the process. While journeying to rescue his parents, Tāwhaki meets and marries [[Hinepiripiri]], to whom is born their son, Wahieroa. Tāwhaki and his brother [[Karihi]] rescue their enslaved mother, who tells them that light is fatal to the Ponaturi. Eventually, with the help of their mother, they trick the Ponaturi, who have returned to their house to sleep. Tāwhaki and his brother hide, after having blocked up all the chinks of the house so that no light can enter. When the Ponaturi begin to think that the night is very long, Urutonga reassures them that there is still a long time until dawn comes. They then set fire to the house, and open the door. The Ponaturi are killed by the fire and the exposure to the sunlight. The only survivors are [[Tonga-Hiti]] and [[Kanae]].

==Climbs into the heavens==
Tāwhaki and his young brother set off to climb up to the sky. At the foot of the ascent they find their grandmother, Whaitiri, now blind, who sits continually counting the tubers of [[sweet potato]] or [[taro]] that are her only food.&lt;ref&gt;In other stories, the blind woman guarding the vines is Tāwhaki's ancestress [[Matakerepō]].&lt;/ref&gt; Whaitiri is the guardian of the vines that form the pathway into the sky. The brothers tease her by snatching them away, one by one, and upsetting her count. Eventually, they reveal themselves to her and restore her sight. In return, she gives them advice about how best to make the climb into the sky. Karihi tries first, but makes the error of climbing up the ''aka taepa'', or hanging vine. He is blown violently around by the winds of heaven, and falls to his death. Tāwhaki climbs by the ''aka matua'', or parent vine, recites the right incantations, and reaches the highest of the 10 heavens. There he learns many spells from Tama-i-waho, and marries a woman named Hāpai, or as others say, [[Tangotango]] or Maikuku-makaka. They have a son, and according to some versions of the story it is this child who is named Wahieroa (Biggs 1966:450).&lt;ref&gt;In other versions, when Tāwhaki reaches the sky-world he disguises himself. When at last he reveals himself, he is reconciled with Tangotango, and their daughter Arahuta. Some versions say that he decided to stay in the sixth heaven, [[Nga-atua|Ngā Atua]], where he displays his power with lightning and thunder. In others stories, Tāwhaki's wife is named Hinepiripiri; they are the parents of [[Matuku-tangotango|Matuku]] and Wahroa.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribal versions==
In a country like New Zealand, each tribe has a different version (or series of related versions) of a story like Tāwhaki; actually, the stories told by each storyteller within a tribe would be different, and the same storyteller would tell a slightly different tale each time it was told. To illustrate this variation in a small way, and to demonstrate that there is no one correct way to tell the story of Tāwhaki, two versions from different tribal groups are presented below.

===Arawa version===
In an 1850 version of Tāwhaki by Hohepa Paraone of the [[Te Arawa|Arawa]] tribe of [[Rotorua]] (Paraone 1850:345-352, White 1887:115-119 (English), 100-105 (Māori),&lt;ref&gt;White unaccountably attributes this Te Arawa story to the Ngāi Tahu tribe of the South Island; he also has 'Pihanga' instead of 'Puanga' for the name of Tāwhaki's daughter.&lt;/ref&gt; Tāwhaki is a mortal man who is visited each night by [[Hāpai]], a woman from the heavens. When Hāpai becomes pregnant, she tells Tāwhaki that if their child is female, he is to wash her. After their daughter [[Puanga]] is born, Tāwhaki washes her, but expresses disgust at the smell. Offended, Hāpai takes the child, climbs onto the roof of the house, and disappears into the sky.

After some months, Tāwhaki decides to go and find Hāpai and Puanga. He sets off with his two slaves. He warns the slaves not to look at the fortress of [[Tongameha]] as they pass by. One of the slaves looks, and Tongameha gouges out his eyes. Tāwhaki and the remaining slave go on, and meet Matakerepō, an old blind woman, guarding the vines (or ropes) that lead up into the heavens. Matakerepō is an ancestress of Tāwhaki's. As Matakerepō counts out her ten taro tubers, Tāwhaki removes them one by one.

Matakerepō, aware that someone is deceiving her, begins to sniff the air, and her stomach distends, ready to swallow the stranger. She sniffs towards the south, and towards all the winds. When she sniffs towards the west she catches Tāwhaki's scent and calls out 'Are you come with the wind that blows on my skin?' Tāwhaki grunts, and Matakerepō says, 'Oh, it is my grandson Tāwhaki.' Her stomach begins to shrink. Had he not been from the west wind, she would have swallowed him.

Matakerepō asks Tāwhaki where he is going. He replies that he is searching for his wife and daughter; his wife is a daughter of Whatitiri-matakamataka (or Whaitiri) and has returned to the heavens. Matakerepō shows him the pathway, advising him to set off in the morning. Tāwhaki's slave prepares a meal. Tāwhaki takes some cooked food and rubs it on the eyes of the old woman. Matakerepō is instantly cured of her blindness. In the morning, Tāwhaki presents his slave to Matakerepō, who chants a spell to help him as climbs. When he reaches the heavens, Tāwhaki disguises himself as an old slave and assists his brothers-in-law to build a canoe. Each night, the brothers-in-law return to their village, where Tāwhaki's wife and daughter are living. Pretending to be unable to keep up, Tāwhaki lets the brothers-in-law go on ahead, and returns to work on the canoe, arriving at the village much later. The next morning, Tāwhaki and the brothers-in-law return; seeing the canoe, the brothers-in-law are surprised by all the work that has been done. Each evening, Tāwhaki sits in the special seat of Hāpai, despite the protests of the villagers. These deeds of Tāwhaki bring him to Hāpai's attention, and she asks him who he is. Tāwhaki resumes his true appearance and is recognised by his wife. He performs rituals of dedication over their daughter.

===Ngāti Porou version===
In a legend committed to manuscript by Mohi Ruatapu of [[Ngāti Porou]] in 1971 (Reedy 1993:25-33, 126-134), Tāwhaki is a descendant of [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]]. Whaitiri, a granddaughter of Māui, marries Kaitangata and has Hemā. Hemā marries [[Rawhita-i-te-rangi]], and has Tāwhaki and his younger brother Karihi. Tāwhaki and Karihi set off to find their grandmother Whaitiri. They come to a village where a ''kawa'' (open ceremony) is being performed for Hine-te-kawa's house. They hide in the walls of the house and listen to the incantations. As the ceremony ends, Tāwhaki and Karihi leap out and kill all the people except Hine-te-kawa, who sleeps with Tāwhaki that night. She shows them the pathway they must take into the sky; it has pegs as footholds. Karihi makes several attempts at the climb, but falls to his death on the second attempt. Tāwhaki takes Karihi's eyes and makes the climb. He comes upon Whaitiri, his blind grandmother, counting out twelve taro for her grandchildren, who are away at the village of Tama-i-waho. Tāwhaki removes the taro tubers one by one, until Whaitiri realises that it must be her grandson who she had foretold would come to find her. Tāwhaki places Karihi's eyes into her eyes, and her sight is restored. Tāwhaki busies himself tidying his grandmother's village, and washes and cares for her. Tāwhaki catches marries Maikuku, one of Whaitiri's granddaughters; the other granddaughters escape to Tama-i-waho's village, up in the second sky. When they look down and see Tāwhaki and Maikuku making love outdoors, they are offended and come down and take Maikuku away into the sky. Tāwhaki, desperate to find his wife, who is pregnant, tries to ascend on a kite, but the evil [[Tama-i-waho]] sends a hākuai, a mythical bird,  to attack the kite, causing Tāwhaki to fall. Tāwhaki then turns himself into a harrier hawk, and takes off. Using his adze Te Rakuraku-o-te-rangi, Tama-i-waho cuts off one of the wings of the hawk, and Tāwhaki falls to his death. After Tāwhaki's death, Maikuku bears him a son, named Wahiroa.

==Flood myth==

Some versions of the Māori story of Tāwhaki contain episodes where the hero causes a flood to destroy the village of his two jealous brothers-in-law. He directs his own people to relocate their village to the top of the mountain Hikurangi.
A comment in Grey's ''Polynesian Mythology'' may have given the Māori something they did not have before&amp;nbsp;— as A.W Reed put it, "In ''Polynesian Mythology'' Grey said that when Tāwhaki's ancestors released the floods of heaven, the earth was overwhelmed and all human beings perished&amp;nbsp;— thus providing the Māori with his own version of the universal flood" (Reed 1963:165, in a footnote). Christian influence has led to the appearance of genealogies where Tawhaki's grandfather Hema is reinterpreted as Shem, son of Noah of the biblical deluge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9633">The '''World Development Report''' (WDR) is an annual report published since 1978 by the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) or [[World Bank]]. Each WDR provides in-depth analysis of a specific aspect of [[economic development]]. Past reports have considered such topics as agriculture, youth, equity, [[public services]] delivery, the role of the state, [[Transition economy|transition economies]], labour, infrastructure, [[global health|health]], the environment, risk management, and poverty. The reports are the Bank's best-known contribution to thinking about development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/LOTTGBE9I0 World Bank: ''World Development Reports''], accessed 21 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The World Development Report 2019==
[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf The World Development Report 2019] studies the impact of technology on the nature of work. It is the most-downloaded World Development Report, with more than a million downloads, half of which before its official publication. The study was led by [[Simeon Djankov]] and Federica Saliola.

==The World Development Report 2014==
''The World Development Report 2014 Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development'' looked at risk management from a development perspective. It argued that managing risks such as job loss, crime, disease, disaster, social unrest, and financial and macroeconomic turbulence responsibly can save lives, avert damages, prevent development setbacks, and unleash opportunities. The report proposed a conceptual framework for thinking about risk and resilience, identified obstacles to better risk management, and recommended numerous avenues for better risk management that can be pursued by individuals, families, communities, enterprises, governments, and the international community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/OSAT4FHFP0 World Bank: ''World Development Reports''], accessed 29 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The World Development Report 2011==
''[[The World Development Report 2011|The World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development]]'' looked at conflict as a challenge to economic development. It analyzed the nature, causes and development consequences of modern violence and highlight lessons learned from efforts to prevent or recover from violence.
The goal of this WDR was considered to promote new ways of preventing or addressing violent conflict. By drawing on insight and experiences from a host of past and present situations, the report identified promising national and regional initiatives as well as directions for change in international responses, and discuss how lessons can be applied in situations of vulnerability to violent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/ World Bank: ''The World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development''], accessed 21 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The World Development Report is published by the World Bank.

==Previous reports 2008-2010==
The '''WDR 2010''', on the theme "Development and Climate Change", explored how public policy can change to better help people cope with new or worsened risks, how land and water management must adapt to better protect a threatened natural environment while feeding an expanding and more prosperous population, and how energy systems will need to be transformed. The report was seen as a call for action, both for developing countries who are striving to ensure policies are adapted to the realities and dangers of a hotter planet, and for high-income countries who need to undertake ambitious mitigation while supporting developing countries’ efforts.

The '''WDR 2009''' focused on the theme "Reshaping Economic Geography".&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/product?item_id=8672028 World Bank: ''World Development Report 2009'']&lt;/ref&gt; Rising densities of human settlements, migration and transport to reduce distances to market, and specialization and trade facilitated by fewer international divisions are central to [[economic development]]. The transformations along these three dimensions—density, distance, and division—are most noticeable in North America, [[Western Europe]], and Japan, but countries in Asia and [[Eastern Europe]] are changing in ways similar in scope and speed.

The report concludes that these spatial transformations are essential, and should be encouraged. The conclusion is not without controversy. Slum-dwellers now number a billion, but the rush to cities continues. Globalization is believed to benefit many, but not the billion people living in lagging areas of [[Developing country|developing nations]]. High poverty and mortality persist among the world's "bottom billion", while others grow wealthier and live longer lives. Concern for these three billion often comes with the prescription that growth must be made spatially balanced. The WDR has a different message: [[economic growth]] is seldom balanced, and efforts to spread it out prematurely will jeopardize progress.

The '''WDR 2008''' addressed "Agriculture for Development", calling for greater investment in agriculture in developing countries. The report warned that the sector must be placed at the center of the development agenda if the goals of halving [[extreme poverty]] and hunger by 2015 are to be realized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/product-detail?product_id=6966252 World Bank: ''World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development'']&lt;/ref&gt;

While 75 percent of the world's poor live in rural areas in developing countries, a mere 4 percent of [[official development assistance]] goes to agriculture. In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], a region heavily reliant on agriculture for overall growth, [[Public finance|public spending]] for farming is also only 4 percent of total [[government spending]] and the sector is still taxed at relatively high levels. For the poorest people, GDP growth originating in agriculture is about four times more effective in raising incomes of extremely poor people than GDP growth originating outside the sector.

“A dynamic ‘agriculture for development’ agenda can benefit the estimated 900 million rural people in the [[Developing world]] who live on less than $1 a day, most of whom are engaged in agriculture,” said [[Robert Zoellick|Robert B. Zoellick]], [[World Bank Group]] President. “We need to give agriculture more prominence across the board. At the global level, countries must deliver on vital reforms such as cutting distorting subsidies and opening markets, while [[civil society]] groups, especially farmer organizations, need more say in setting the agricultural agenda.”

According to the report, agriculture can offer pathways out of poverty if efforts are made to increase productivity in the staple foods sector; connect smallholders to rapidly expanding high-value horticulture, poultry, aquaculture, as well as dairy markets; and generate jobs in the rural nonfarm economy.

'''İnicrliin Cave''' ({{lang-tr|İncirliin Mağarası}}) is a [[show cave]] located in [[Muğla Province]], southwestern Turkey.

İncirliin Cave is situated in [[Gökçeler Canyon]] in [[Milas]] district of Muğla Province, Turkey. It is the most significant one and the only show cave in a group of nearly 30 caves in the canyon area. It is on the northern hillside of Mount Manastır overlooking the canyon. The cave is {{convert|345|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, however only about {{convert|155|m|ft|abbr=on}} of it is open to tourism. It is a horizontal lying spring cave. Its forming was affected by a distinctive [[fault (geology)|fault]] in a [[karst]] formation. The cave has a wide entrance. It is {{convert|3|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and has a clearance of {{convert|2|-|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; It features  ponds, giant [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s. There are many rooms separated from the main gallery by stalactites. The rooms are mostly connected with each other by {{convert|6|-|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} high passages. The "Gösteri Salonu" (literally "Show Room") in the middle of the cave is elevated {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the entrance level. The "Damlataş Galerisi" ("Dripstone Gallery") at the end of the show cave, which was formed on the fault, is situated {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} higher than the entrance level. &lt;ref name="mkt"/&gt;

In terms of [[hydrogeology]], the cave is in a [[vadose zone]]. It remains totally dry but becomes wet by dripping water from the cave ceiling during the rainy period.&lt;ref name="mkt"/&gt; Generally, the stalactites and stalagmites in the entrance, the "Yarasa Galerisi" ("Bat Gallery"), the "Havuzlu Salon" ("Pond's Room") and the "Gösteri Salonu" are partially fossilized, while the formation of the stalactites, stalagmites, columns and draperies in the "Damlataş Galerisi" ("Dripstone Gallery") are still continueing.&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mkt"/&gt;

A great number of earthenware pieces, which are dated back to the prehistoric era and antiquity,  were found in the ground at the entrance and inside the cave.&lt;ref name="mkt"/&gt; By December 2016, archaeological excavations were started by the [[Muğla University]] in the section of the cave, which is not open to the pıblic, Human and animal bones, [[stone tool]]s and [[terracotta]] pieces were discovered.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; These finds show that the cave was inhabited in the ancient times already 8,000 years ago in 6000 BC.&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;  İncirliin Cave was registered as a first-grade [[archaeological site]] and first-grade [[nature reserve]] on February 27, 2008.&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mkt"/&gt; A walking path was established on a length of nearly {{convert|155|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the cave.&lt;ref name="mkt"/&gt; The cave was fitted in 2013 with lighting that does not harm geological formations.&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mkt"/&gt; In April 2016, a {{convert|155|m|ft|abbr=on}}-long part of the cave was opened to the public as a show cave.&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;
