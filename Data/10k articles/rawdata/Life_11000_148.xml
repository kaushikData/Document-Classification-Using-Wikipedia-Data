'''''Aaahh!!! Real Monsters''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] developed by [[Klasky Csupo]] for [[Nickelodeon]].&lt;ref name="BLOOMBERG"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1995-10-15/the-rugrats-real-mom-and-dad | title=The Rugrats' Real Mom and Dad|last=Byrnes|first=Nanette|date=16 October 1995|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show focuses on three young monsters—Ickis, Oblina and Krumm—who attend a school for monsters under a city dump and learn to frighten humans. Many of the episodes revolve around them making it to the surface in order to perform "scares" as class assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Shows for Youngsters and their Parents Too: Monster wanna-bes make their debut on cable's Nickelodeon ...

The series premiered October 29, 1994, at 11&amp;nbsp;am on Nickelodeon.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-30/news/tv-56313_1_monster-shows-aaahh|title=SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO: Monster wanna-bes make their debut on cable's Nickelodeon ...

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Aaahh!!! Real Monsters episodes}}
The episodes follow the adventures of Ickis, Oblina and Krumm, three young monsters attending a monster school whose headmaster is The Gromble.

The show is set in [[New York City]], demonstrated throughout the series by the presences of the [[Empire State Building]] and an [[Independent Subway System]]. The dump the monsters inhabit is implied to be [[Fresh Kills Landfill]], but never explicitly named in the series. The monster community includes a working economic system using toe nails as currency.

==Characters==
{{cleanup section|reason=disorganized|date=January 2016}}

===Main===
* Ickis (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) – Ickis is a small red monster who, due to his large ears, is often confused with a rabbit. He is the son of Slickis, a famous scarer. He seems the most skittish of the monsters, but is also a capable leader. Ickis looms (grows in size) to scare, and comes from a long line of loomers. Ickis's constant goofing off and blatant disregard for rules are usually the focal point and source of his group's troubles in most episodes. Another running gag recurrent in the series is that Ickis nearly exposes the monster world to humans accidentally, which spells certain doom for monsterkind.

* Oblina (voiced by [[Christine Cavanaugh]]) – Oblina comes from a wealthy monster family, and is considered by The Gromble to be his best student. She is the daughter of an overbearing mother named Sublima who she refers to as "mumsy dearest". She is shaped like a black and white, upside-down candy cane, resembling a [[Laticauda colubrina|banded sea krait]]. One of her favorite methods of scaring humans is reaching within herself and pulling out her internal organs, and she has considerable talent for shape-shifting into various terrifying forms. She also has a talent for inducing nightmares in humans, by sticking her finger in their ears and tickling their brains while they sleep. She also has big red lips and temporarily lost them to a coy young human girl who wanted to be a model. When voicing Oblina, Christine Cavanaugh attempted to make the voice sound like a British version of the actress [[Agnes Moorehead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Scott |title=Out of the mouth of Babe |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 21, 1996 |page=Y6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Krumm (voiced by David Eccles) – Like the rest of his family, his eyeballs are not attached to his body, and are usually carried in his hands; if he requires the use of both hands, he can carry them in his mouth. His most valuable tool in scaring is his overwhelming armpit stench, as well as using his eyeballs. A running gag in the series is that Krumm sometimes loses his eyeballs and has to get them back, once going so far as to make a fake head to keep from losing them. His dad is a mold farmer.

* The Gromble (voiced by [[Gregg Berger]]) – The Gromble is a teal monster with two blue-green tufts of hair, a beard and a tail. He wears a belt around his waist and a red [[court shoe|pump]] on each of his four feet. He is known for his quick temper, harsh punishments and keen awareness of the misbehavior of his students, in particular the main characters. He speaks with a seemingly calm, falsetto voice until whomever he is speaking with feels safe only to yell at the top of his lungs when angered. While serving as the leader and principal of the dump, The Gromble teaches young monsters and evaluates them using the Viewfinder, a chair like projection device used to replay the scaring activities of students. Along with Ickis, he is one of the few monsters who can hear the Pool of Elders—the source of monster existence that is made of the very substance of fears.

* The Snorch (voiced by David Eccles) – The disciplinarian of the Monster Academy who works for The Gromble and is often seen with Zimbo. Though the Snorch just makes vocal effects, he once wore a voicebox translator (with the voice of it being provided by [[Brock Peters]]) in one episode. He operates three chambers labeled "Something Bad" (a hissing boiler like room), "Something Really Bad" (a mechanical cyclops with sharp teeth) and "You don't want to know" (a cheerful pink house with colorful flora) which is a running gag in the series where anything "nice" or "cute" is terrifying or disgusting to monsters. His main form of torture, aside from the chambers, is to sing opera, which he is quite bad at (hence the punishment).

* Zimbo (voiced by [[Tim Curry]]) – Zimbo is a monster who resembles a bee with one mammal-like leg and a humanoid face with green hair. He is the Gromble's assistant in his class and is always seen on the head of The Snorch. Zimbo appears to be petty and jealous of anyone becoming friends with The Snorch, although he too has been punished by him for misbehavior.

* Simon the Monster Hunter (voiced by [[Jim Belushi]]) – The main and recurring antagonist of the series. Simon is a human who is determined to prove that monsters exist and wants to exterminate them. He wears a thick-collared jacket and glasses. Before becoming a monster hunter, he tried to capture [[Bigfoot]] and built a giant robot. Simon once had to save Ickis from three other hunters when attempted to take sole credit for exposing monsters to the human world, though he warned Ickis that he would go right back to trying to expose them. Belushi ad-libbed much of Simon's dialogue.

* Expert Phil (voiced by Landon J. Powell) – The protagonist-trio's former school teacher. He visually resembles a rainbow sock-monkey. Frequent non-canon episodes include a recurring gag in which Expert Phil calls the trio to ask them a nonsensical math-problem and responds to their guesses with angry screaming.

* Bradley (voiced by Brett Alexander) – A human friend of the monsters. He first appears in the second episode where he encounters Ickis and befriends him, appearing again in an episode with Simon the Monster Hunter. He goes on TV with Simon and two other monster victims and everybody laughs at him, not believing that monsters exist. Later, Bradley frees Ickis and the rest of the monsters when Ickis gains his sympathy, undermining Simon and protecting the secret that monsters are real. In a later episode, Bradley is worried about being picked on while camping in the woods until he agrees to help Ickis with a scare. After this he becomes very popular with his peers.

===Recurring===
* Slickis (voiced by [[Billy Vera]]) – Ickis' father and one of The Gromble's favorite former students. It's because of this that Ickis has a rough relationship with his father Slickis in one episode.

* Horvak (voiced by David Eccles) – Krumm's father. He lost one of his eyes at the [[Battle of Concord]] and wears a black glove over that respective hand, similar to wearing an eyepatch. He was considered to be one of The Gromble's worst students and now works as a mold farmer because he lost his stench as a kid.

* Sal (voiced by [[Peter Bonerz]]) – A parasite who makes monsters hungry.

* Mama Gromble (voiced by [[Andrea Martin]]) – The Gromble's mother.

* Sublima (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) – Oblina's mother. Sublima comes from a rich family and strongly disapproves of Oblina scaring. She almost made her daughter quit school and come back home. Sublima even made fun of mold farmers (A hobby that Horvak now has.).

* Skeetch (voiced by [[Marvin Kaplan]])&amp;nbsp;– Oblina's father. Unlike her mother, Skeetch loves the fact that Oblina wants to be a scarer and supports her all the way. Skeetch refers to Oblina as "Stripes". Eventually Skeetch gets rid of his and Sublima's toenail fortune.

* Nicky (voiced by Steven Hartman) – one of the monster's human friends. He is a 10-year-old boy who befriended Ickis.

==Production==
''Aaahh!!! Real Monsters'' was created by [[Gábor Csupó]] and [[Peter Gaffney]],&lt;ref name="Beck2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |author2=Nickelodeon Brand Group |title=Not Just Cartoons: Nicktoons! |year=2007 |publisher=Melcher Media |location=New York |isbn=978-1-59591-043-1 |oclc=154685607}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was produced by Csupó's company [[Klasky Csupo]], which also created the animated shows ''[[The Simpsons]]'',  ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[Duckman]]'' on USA Network.&lt;ref name="Prescott1028"&gt;{{cite news |last=Prescott |first=Jean |title=Check in on celebs on 'Naked Cafe' |work=[[Sun Herald]] |date=October 28, 1994 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendoza0902"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mendoza |first=N.F. |title=Kids' TV heavy on super-heroes keep&amp;nbsp;– Keep an eye out this fall for 'Little Lulu,' 'Felix the Cat' and 'Alex Mack' |work=[[Portland Press Herald]] |date=September 2, 1994 |page=4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the final title was chosen, which took over 5 years, the series had the working titles ''Monsters'' and ''Real Monsters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warner |first=Fara |date=January 31, 1995 |title=Nick Rock(o)s licensing boat |journal=[[Brandweek]] |volume=35 |issue=5 |page=3 |publisher=[[Adweek]] |issn=1064-4318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=News &amp; Notes&amp;nbsp;– MTV Networks Plan Animation Sensation |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=January 31, 1994 |page=L20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NBC special examines Menedez trials |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=February 1, 1994 |page=6B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was conceived after Csupó and his wife and creative partner [[Arlene Klasky]] were approached by the network Nickelodeon to create a follow-up series to ''Rugrats''. Csupó was inspired to write a show about monsters because his own young children loved them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Graham |first=Jefferson |title=Animators' own little angels inspire 'Monsters' |work=[[USA Today]] |date=February 7, 1995 |page=3D}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said he knew Nickelodeon would not want a series about human characters because everybody else was pitching shows about animals. Csupó drew some sketches of possible monsters on a piece of paper and successfully pitched the idea to the network: "I wanted them silly and not too skillful&amp;nbsp;– and the idea worked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sokolsky |first=Bob |title=Davies gets into flow of vampire role |work=[[The Press-Enterprise]] |date=November 21, 1994 |page=A09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickelodeon programming director [[Herb Scannell]] said the character design in ''Aaahh!!! Real Monsters'' was partially inspired by ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', a 1968 animated film inspired by [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref name="Mendoza1030"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendoza |first=N.R. |title=Nickelodeon offers monsters in training |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 30, 1994 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-30/news/tv-56313_1_monster-shows-aaahh |accessdate=August 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61AWE1JSE?url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-30/news/tv-56313_1_monster-shows-aaahh |archivedate=August 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feran1029"&gt;{{cite news |last=Feran |first=Tom |title=Fake meteor barrage is in 'War of Worlds' style |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=October 29, 1994 |page=8E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character Gromble, in particular, bears a close resemblance to the [[Blue Meanies (Yellow Submarine)|Blue Meanie]] characters from that film.&lt;ref name="Roush1028"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roush |first=Matt |title=PBS' 'Dead' is a goner; 'Monsters' makes a splash&amp;nbsp;– Anne Rice bio 'Vampire' goes right for the jugular |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 28, 1994 |page=3D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of the series [[Igor Kovalyov]] said the style was inspired by his earlier [[Soviet]] film ''[[Investigation Held by Kolobki]]'' which he and Gábor Csupó showed to the producers who then gave Kovalyov's team a lot of creative freedom with the art direction and storyboarding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZAc4mjykWM Igor Kovalyov] documentary by [[Eduard Nazarov]], 2002 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Csupó said some elements of the show have a look similar to the [[film noir]] genre, and called the city dump where the monster characters reside reminiscent of the visual style from the films ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985).&lt;ref name="Mendoza1030" /&gt;
The characters guest-starred in the 1999 ''Rugrats'' episode #106 "[[Ghost Story (Rugrats)|Ghost Story]]". Before that, David Eccles, the voice of Krumm, provided the monster voice coming from under Chuckie's bed.

==Reception==

===Reviews===
Josef Adalian of ''[[The Washington Times]]'' praised the show's animation and sense of humor, although it was not as "hip and witty" as ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'' or ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Although he felt the show would appeal to children over nine as well as adults, he said it may not appeal to those who "react negatively to semi-scary sights and gags about body odor, physical punishment or abusive older siblings".&lt;ref name="Adalian1028"&gt;{{cite news |last=Adalian |first=Josef |title=C Metropolitan times&amp;nbsp;– Arts &amp; entertainment&amp;nbsp;– Channel surfer |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=October 28, 1994 |page=C18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'', writer Matt Roush called it "garish and blissfully silly" and praised the show's "outrageous characters have just enough ''Ren &amp; Stimpy'' grodiness, but tempered with exceptional sweetness".&lt;ref name="Roush1028" /&gt; Ginny Holbert of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it a "cute and clever" series with "wit and inventive creatures", and compared the animation to the work of artist [[Peter Max]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holbert |first=Ginny |title=Big news for little viewers&amp;nbsp;– Nick Jr. improves kids' TV picture |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=October 24, 1994 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gannett Company|Gannett News Service]] writer Mike Hughes called it a "terrific cartoon series",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hughes |first=Mike |title=For a change, good viewing on Sunday |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 28, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said the show's "wildly perverse humor" had a "distinctly European style" that reflected Gábor Csupó's Hungarian background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hughes |first=Mike |title=To some jaded souls, this is the Ghost of Glories Past |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 27, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' writer Tom Feran called the show "good fun" and favorably compared the series' premise to that of the animated film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''.&lt;ref name="Feran1029" /&gt; ''[[Boston Herald]]'' writer Frances Katz wrote, "If there was ever a great title for a cartoon, it has to be Nickelodeon's ''Aaahh!!! Real Monsters'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Frances |title=Just for kids&amp;nbsp;– Monster mania |work=[[Boston Herald]] |date=October 30, 1994 |page=011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all reviews were positive. The November 1994 issue of ''[[Parenting (magazine)|Parenting]]'' magazine listed ''Aaahh!!! Real Monsters'' as #1 in its top ten list of the worst new shows of the television season, describing it as "Graphic and scatological; it's just plain gross."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On television&amp;nbsp;– Parenting picks 10 best and worst |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=November 1, 1994 |page=E10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some media outlets pointed out similarities between ''Aaahh!!! Real Monsters'' and ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'', an [[MTV]] animated television series about a group of grotesque humanoid characters. Gábor Csupó rejected these comparisons and claims his show was more story- and character-driven with a different visual style.&lt;ref name="Mendoza1030" /&gt;

===Awards===
The pilot episode of ''Aaahh!!! Real Monsters'' won first prize for film animation producer for television at both the Houston Film Festival and Ottawa Film Festival.&lt;ref name="Mendoza1030" /&gt; The series was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in Animation in 1995 alongside ''Rugrats'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'' and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CBS leads Daytime Emmy nods with 59 |work=[[Daily Breeze]] |date=March 30, 1995 |page=E3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award ultimately went to ''Rugrats''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dad, daughter give out day Emmys at night&amp;nbsp;– The Anistons, John and Jennifer, appear together on TV for first time in 1995 Daytime Emmy Awards |work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |date=May 20, 1995 |page=D4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other products based on the cartoon include [[Fleer]] [[trading card]]s, books, plush toys, pens, hats, backpacks, notepads, cups, gum, and videos. At one point, [[General Mills]] also included small promotional [[flip book]]s of Ickis, Krumm, Oblina, and the Gromble in its [[Cinnamon Toast Crunch]] breakfast cereal.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''Abba Hilkiah''' (or '''Abba Hilkiahu'''; {{lang-he|'''אבא חלקיה'''}}, ''Abba helkia'') was a ''[[tannaic]]'' sage, and a grandson of [[Honi ha-M'agel]]. The [[Talmud]] cites him as exceptionally scrupulous in his work and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylon]]ian [[Talmud]], [[Makkot|Tractate Makkot]], 24a&lt;/ref&gt;

Just like his well-known grandfather, who was known for his abilities to induce rain by means of prayers and other supernatural means, so was Hilkiah known for his abilities to induce rain by his prayers. For this reason, during one of the periods of the drought, as the [[Talmud]] records the occasion, the sages sent him a delegation of two disciples, to ask him to pray for rain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylon]]ian [[Talmud]], [[Ta'anit|Tractate Ta'anit]], 23&lt;/ref&gt; The disciples found him working in the field as a salaried employee, and so he failed to address even their courtesy when they greeted him, until he was done with his work at the field, and only then did they make their way to his home together, while they observe some strange behaviors of Hilkiah. Abba Hilkiah, who already understood by himself the reason for the disciples' visit, failed, in his humbleness nature, to even listen to their appeals, and immediately upon arrival at his house, he and his wife ascended to the attic, where they made a prayer plea for rain to come, a plea that was immediately answered by heaven. Rain clouds started appearing in the direction where his wife prayed, and the rain started tapping. Abba Hilkiah then returned to his visitors, and while pretending to be naive, he asked them for their wishes. The disciples did not fall into the trap, and were immediately able to comprehend that Hilkiah induced the rain, and had asked him on his strange behaviors that they previously observed on their way to his home, as well as for the reason that the rain came from the direction his wife prayed and not his. Hilkiah explained everything to them, that the reason his wife's plea was answered first was because she helps the needy who knock on her door, by handing them cooked food, while he only hands them money, so they have to bother to go buy it. But his alternative reason is perhaps more fundamental: "There had been robbers in my street, and I prayed to G‑d to get rid of them, but my wife prayed that they should mend their ways!"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7318">'''Abortion doping''' refers to the rumoured practice of purposely inducing [[pregnancy]] for athletic performance-enhancing benefits, then [[abortion|aborting]] the pregnancy. While allegations have been made regarding the practice, there is no proof that it has ever been done.

==Potential physical benefits==
Hormonal and other changes in pregnancy affect physical performance. In the first three months it is known that a woman’s body produces a natural surplus of red blood cells, which are well supplied with oxygen-carrying [[hemoglobin]], in order to support the growing [[fetus]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Other potential advantages are obtained from the surge in hormones that pregnancy induces, predominantly [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]], but also [[testosterone]], which could increase muscle strength. Increases in hormones like [[relaxin]], which loosens the hip joints to prepare for childbirth, may have a performance-enhancing effect on joint mobility.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article6831281.ece |title=Sportswomen benefit from pregnancy |author=Bee, Peta |date=September 14, 2009 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=April 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528195357/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article6831281.ece | archivedate=May 28, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is also argued that the advantages would be outweighed by the drawbacks of [[morning sickness]] and fatigue, both of which are common in early pregnancy.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;

Western media outlets began accusing [[Soviet Union|Soviet countries]] of abortion doping as early as the [[1956 Summer Olympics]], and allegations were raised again at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; Rumours of abortion doping continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, predominately aimed at [[East Germany|East German]] athletes.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; In 1988, [[Alexandre de Merode|Prince Alexandre de Merode]], then vice-president of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), supported stories that Eastern European athletes were getting [[artificially inseminated]] in an attempt to boost athletic performance and then aborting two to three months later. Merode said he knew a Swiss doctor who was performing the procedure; however, it was never proven.&lt;ref name=greer&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/06/features.sport7 |title=It's time for the pregnant Olympics |author=[[Germaine Greer|Greer, Germaine]] |date=May 6, 2007 |work=[[Guardian.com]] |archivedate=2018-04-02 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180402141450/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/06/features.sport7 |deadurl=no |access-date=2016-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Finnish doctor Risto Erkola told the [[Sunday Mirror]] "Now that drug testing is routine, pregnancy is becoming the favourite way of getting an edge on competition". Erkola's comment is frequently cited in discussions on abortion doping.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; According to the [[fact-checking]] website [[Snopes.com]], media reports following this claim were skeptical of it, and there was no evidence that Erkola had any first-hand knowledge of the practice. Dr Peter Larkins, then an official of the [[Sports Medicine Australia|Australian Sports Medicine Association]], also challenged the claim,&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/abortion-doping-real-practice/ |title=Is 'Abortion Doping' a Real Practice? |last=Kasprak |first=Alex |date=December 5, 2017 |work=[[Snopes.com]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180402141716/https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/abortion-doping-real-practice/ |archivedate=2018-04-02 |deadurl=no |access-date=2018-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though Greg Whyte, Professor of applied sport and exercise science at [[Liverpool John Moores University]], has said the East German allegations are plausible.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

In 1994, [[Olga Karasyova]], who won a Gold medal in gymnastics at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], was reported to have given an interview with German television station [[RTL Television]] as well as a Russian newspaper. The interviews quoted her as stating that abortion doping was widespread among Soviet athletes in the 1970s, and that girls as young as 14 were being forced to have sex with their coaches. Karasyova, however, later said the person who had given the interviews was an imposter, and she successfully sued the Russian newspaper for defamation.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://viperson.ru/articles/olimpiyskaya-chempionka-razoblachaet-dvoynika |title=Олимпийская чемпионка разоблачает двойника |last=Golubev |first=Vladimir |date=March 7, 2001 |work=Viperson |language=Russian |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180403015907/http://viperson.ru/articles/olimpiyskaya-chempionka-razoblachaet-dvoynika |archivedate=2018-04-03 |deadurl=no |access-date=2018-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ka/olga-karasyova-1.html |title=Olga Karasyova |work=Sports Reference LLC |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130203190918/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ka/olga-karasyova-1.html |archivedate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=no |access-date=2018-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her legal victory, the original interviews attributed to her continue to be reported as facts by some third parties.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;

A 2017 article by Snopes.com categorises abortion doping as "unproven", concluding that the practice is confirmed only by the dubious interview with Karasyova, is "buttressed by speculative science, and are largely amplified in recent years by [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion groups]]". Snopes accuse anti-abortion groups of [[Reporting bias|selective reporting]] and using poorly sourced arguments when writing articles about the subject.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; Multiple sources have concluded there is no proof that abortion doping has ever actually been done.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name=greer/&gt;

==Legality==
While abortion doping is officially banned under United States Olympic rules, there is no ban on getting pregnant.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=webb/040728 |title=Fahrenheit 755: Baseball Gets Hammered, or The Thrill of Victory, and the Agony of Da Fetus |last=Webb |first=Royce |work=[[ESPN]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180402141752/http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=webb/040728 |archivedate=2018-04-02 |deadurl=no |access-date=2018-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If an athlete was accused of abortion doping, she could simply argue that the pregnancy was not induced for the temporary physiological benefits. The procedure was determined not to be illegal by the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/sexuality/doping.asp |title=Abortion Doping |last=Mikkleson |first=Barbara |date=September 8, 2007 |work=[[Snopes.com]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130202095417/http://www.snopes.com/politics/sexuality/doping.asp |archivedate=2013-02-02 |deadurl=yes |access-date=2009-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abukar Hassan Mohamoud''', also known as '''Kadaf''' (1969? &amp;ndash; 28 February 2012), was a [[Somali people|Somali]] activist and the manager/director for the independent Somaliweyn Radio in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]]. At the time of his murder, he had been working on a re-launch of Radio Somaliweyn, which had been attacked and looted by [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=greenslade&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenslade |first=Roy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/mar/01/journalist-safety-somalia |title=Somali radio journalist murdered &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/somalia/2012/02/28/media_director_murdered/ |title=Radio station director murdered in Mogadishu |publisher=IFEX |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Context ===
This was the second murder of a journalist in Mogadishu that year and the 29th since 2007, in a country that is considered one of the most dangerous places for journalists to work.&lt;ref name=globalpost /&gt; Following his death, the NUSOJ repeated its call for an Independent Commission of Enquiry into the murder of Somali journalists to address the widespread culture of impunity surrounding the death of journalists.&lt;ref name=greenslade /&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "I am deeply concerned to see that so many Somali journalists and media workers are dying for exercising the fundamental human right of freedom of expression and their professional obligation to inform the public. Letting such murders go unpunished only encourages their perpetrators to continue using violence to repress debate."&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/all-news/news/director_general_condemns_killings_of_somali_radio_director_abukar_hassan_mohamoud_and_journalist_ali_ahmed_abdi/ |title=Director-General condemns killings of Somali radio director Abukar Hassan Mohamoud and journalist Ali Ahmed Abdi &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omar Faruk Osman, who represents the [[International Federation of Journalists]] said, "This murder of Abukar Hassan Mohamoud is another tragedy and continues to further undermine freedom of expression and freedom of the press in Somalia. Those who continue to murder journalists must be brought to justice, lest fear cripple both the media community and the people of Somalia who rely on journalists for the news and information."&lt;ref name=ifex /&gt;

Mohamed Ibrahim, who is secretary general of the National Union of Somali Journalists, said, "(Mohamoud) was planning to bring the radio on air again. The reason is yet unclear, though he was very involved in civil society activism, such as youth in Banadir region in recent days. This is a really worrying trend for the journalists working in Mogadishu and the government has not done enough to investigate and bring suspects for prosecution."&lt;ref name=voa /&gt; He further said, "This murder is the latest example of the extraordinary violence to which journalists are exposed in Somalia. Indifference to the fate of Somali journalists must stop. We reiterate our call for an independent international commission of enquiry into crimes against journalists in this country."&lt;ref name=ifex /&gt;

Henry Bellingham, UK Minister for Africa, said, "Sadly this shocking murder is yet another example of the ongoing intimidation of journalists in Somalia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=736888082 |title=Minister for Africa condemns the murder of Somali journalist |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-ʿAbbas ibn al-Walīd''' was an [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] prince and general, the son of Caliph [[al-Walid I]]. A distinguished military leader in the [[Byzantine–Arab Wars]] of the early 8th century, especially in partnership with his uncle [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]], he became involved in the [[Third Fitna|civil wars]] of the mid-740s and was imprisoned. He died in [[prison]] of an [[epidemic]] in 750.

== Biography ==
Abbas was the son of Caliph [[al-Walid I]] (r. 705–715). Little is known about his early life, and Arab and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources are often at odds concerning details of his career.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{harvnb|Zetterstéen|Gabrieli|1960|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first appears in the 707 campaign against the important Byzantine fortress of [[Tyana]] in [[Cappadocia]], where he led the Arab army alongside his uncle [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]]. The town withstood a [[Siege of Tyana|long siege]] over the winter of 707–708, and surrendered only after a Byzantine relief army was defeated in spring. During the latter battle, Abbas is said by Arab chroniclers to have distinguished himself for the crucial role he played in stopping the wavering Arabs from fleeing and driving them on to victory.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PmbZ"&gt;{{harvnb|PmbZ|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Khalifa ibn Khayyat]], he was appointed by his father as governor of the [[Jund Hims|district of Homs]].{{sfn|Crone|1980|p=126}}

Abbas participated regularly in the almost annual expeditions launched into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] during these years. His most notable campaigns were the capture of [[Elaiussa Sebaste|Sebaste]] in [[Cilicia]] in 712 and of [[Antioch in Pisidia]] in 713,&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt; the raid into [[Paphlagonia]] in 721 where he is reported to have captured 20,000 prisoners, and a raid, placed in 722/723 but possibly reflecting an earlier campaign, that captured a fortress called Siza.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blankinship|1994|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in 720, along with his uncle Maslama, he led the suppression of the revolt of the governor of [[Iraq]], [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]].&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;

During the reign of the unpopular [[al-Walid II]] (r. 743–744), Abbas was initially reluctant to oppose the caliph and counselled against provoking a civil war. In the end, however, he participated in the conspiracy and [[Coup d'état|coup]] that deposed Walid and brought Abbas' brother [[Yazid III]] on the throne.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; Neither Yazid nor his successor [[Ibrahim ibn al-Walid|Ibrahim I]] lasted long on the throne, which fell to the general [[Marwan II|Marwan ibn Muhammad]] (r. 744–750) during the ensuing civil war of the [[Third Fitna]]. Marwan had Abbas thrown into prison in [[Harran]], where he died of a disease in 750.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt;

==Founding of Anjar==
[[File:Anjar vu du palais.jpg|thumb|250px|Ruins of the Umayyad palace of Anjar]]
While the establishment of the ''madina'' ("city") of [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]] (originally "Ayn al-Jarr") in the [[Beqaa Valley]] is normally attributed to al-Walid I, other sources, including the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] and contemporary historian [[Jere L. Bacharach]], credit Abbas for the city's founding in the fall of 714. Greek labourers from [[Asia Minor]], who were likely captured by Abbas during his previous campaigns against the Byzantines, were utilized, in addition to [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] quarry workers and [[Copts|Coptic]] artisans. Bacharach states that construction halted during the winter and resumed in the spring of 715. A [[Friday mosque]] and an official residence (''dar al-'imara'') were built in Anjar. Its proximity to the ancient city of [[Baalbek]] made Anjar suitable to become an alternative administrative centre for the strategic Beqaa area, but following the death of al-Walid I in late 715 and Abbas' consequent falling out of favour with the new caliphs, Abbas' patronage of the city ended and further construction came to a permanent halt thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bacharach|1996|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antis''' (1939–1953), also known as '''Ant''', was a dog who received the [[Dickin Medal]] in 1949 from the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] for bravery in service in England and North Africa during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="PDSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/dickin-medal-dogs |title=Dickin Medal dogs |publisher=People's Dispensary for Sick Animals |accessdate=13 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212182318/http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/dickin-medal-dogs |archivedate=12 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daily-mail&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Damien|title=So loyal, so brave, the dog who flew against the Luftwaffe|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2482520/So-loyal-brave-dog-flew-Luftwaffe-awarded-animal-version-Victoria-Cross.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=6 November 2013|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=praha&gt;{{cite web|last=Velinger|first=Jan|title=The story of a Czech WW II airman and his remarkable dog|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czechs/the-story-of-a-czech-ww-ii-airman-and-his-remarkable-dog|publisher=Radio Praha|accessdate=6 November 2013|date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
During the winter of the [[Phoney War]] at the start of the [[Second World War]], [[Václav Robert Bozděch]] and Pierre Duval were sent on a reconnaissance mission over the German front in their twin-seater [[Potez 630]] aircraft from the French airbase at [[Saint-Dizier – Robinson Air Base|Saint-Dizier]]. It was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed in [[no-mans land]] between the French and German lines.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Bozděch helped the injured Duval to an abandoned farm house nearby, wherein the Czech airman discovered a [[German Shepherd]] puppy on the floor in the kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 8–11&lt;/ref&gt; While the dog was not initially fond of Duval, it accepted Bozděch.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned that the puppy was emaciated, he began to feed it chocolate, but it would not eat it until the rations were partially melted. Bozděch also found an old frying pan, filled it with snow and melted it so that the dog could drink it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The two airmen realised that they had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by [[flare]]s fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, and went back to the house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name=lewis33&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==

===French Air Force===
[[File:Essai-Potez.svg|thumb|right|A diagram of a [[Potez 630]], the type of plane in which Antis took his first flight]]
Ant saw little action during the remainder of the Phoney War, but adopted Bozděch as his master, sleeping at the foot of his bed in barracks.&lt;ref name=lewis33/&gt; With the end of the Phoney War on 10 May 1940,&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; the airfield at Saint-Dizier was bombed by a wing of German [[Dornier Do 17]]s, while Bozděch and Ant were huddled in a bunker. The attack destroyed all but fourteen of the planes at the base, and following this the local forces began their retreat. After moving to their third base, Bozděch took the decision to take Ant with him in the Potez 630 for the dog's first combat mission. Ant barely stirred, even when Bozděch was firing the guns at German fighters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 36–39&lt;/ref&gt; The duo were reunited with a recovered Duval, who became Bozděch's pilot once again, while Ant continued to fly with them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

During the latter part of the [[Battle of France]] on 14 June, a flight of [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]s destroyed the remaining planes of Bozděch's squadron while they were on the ground. Three days later, the squadron was informed by their adjutant that they were disbanding. Ant and the Czech airmen made for Tours, some {{convert|25|mi|km}} to the south, where the nearest railway station was located to travel south to Spain and then Gibraltar, from where they could fight on from the United Kingdom. They were concerned how they might make their way at speed to Tours, but on leaving the village they discovered a party underway at a nearby house, celebrating the German invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; The group proceeded to steal a [[Trap (carriage)|trap]] from the house after subduing a guard using Ant as a distraction. They stacked their possessions on the trap, with Ant sat on top. The men took turns pulling the trap, heading instead to [[Blois]], with the remainder pushing from behind. They joined the columns of refugees on the roads heading south. However, Ant kept getting unbalanced and falling off the cart, delaying their journey and causing one of the party to suggest that they should kill the dog.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Bozděch elected instead to carry the dog and, after a while, they began to take turns carrying Ant over their shoulders. They reached Blois and were directed to a train to [[Montpellier]] further down the track where they found it overwhelmed with people trying to board.&lt;ref name=lewis51/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis55/&gt; Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.&lt;ref name=lewis51&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 51–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The overloaded train made slow progress, moving only {{convert|60|mi|km}} in three days. They found feeding the dog difficult with a lack of food in the carriage. The Czechs jumped off at one stop to attempt to milk a cow in a nearby pasture to fill a baby's bottle for the dog, but they led some locals to believe they were seeking food for a baby, and so they were supplied with milk. This was repeated a further few times on the journey, each time they produced the bottle they would be given milk for the non-existent baby.&lt;ref name=lewis55&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; From Montpellier, they changed trains to travel to [[Marseille]] where they boarded a boat to Gibraltar, where they arrived on 30 June.&lt;ref name=lewis57&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight from Gibraltar===
The trip to Gibraltar was uneventful, and once they arrived they sought to board MV ''Northmoor'' which was due to join a convoy for England. The ferry to the cargo vessel refused to allow any dogs on board,&lt;ref name=lewis57/&gt; with one of the guards claiming that they had refused a Colonel's dog earlier that day. Bozděch instead elected to trust Ant's recall ability; the airman boarded the ferry and left Antis on the shore. He went on board ''Northmoor'' before taking a ladder down the outside of the hull to a swimming platform where he called out for Ant. The dog swam across the {{convert|100|yd|m}} to the ship, where Bozděch wrapped Ant in his [[greatcoat]] before being smuggled into ''Northmoor'''s hold.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The duo spent most of the journey on ''Northmoor'' in the hold, where their Czech compatriots had created a sleeping area for them. The rest of the refugees spent their time on deck. However, Bozděch was concerned about their likelihood of survival in the event of a [[U-boat]] attack. The first attack came two days after the convoy left Gibraltar, resulting in the companying destroyers spreading out and dropping depth charges. The attack seemed to subside after a few hours, with man and dog staying below decks the whole time because of the risk of Ant's discovery if they went above decks. The submarine attack was followed up by a group of [[Junkers Ju 88]]s, when instead of remaining below decks, Bozděch took Ant up onto the upper deck; they were not discovered in the chaos. ''Northmoor'' was indirectly damaged by the action, as it developed an engine fault after steaming too fast and too long.&lt;ref name=lewis67&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

The refugees were transferred to the cruise ship ''Neuralia'', which had been taken into war service.&lt;ref name=lewis67/&gt; The Czechs looked to smuggle Ant between the two ships by hiding him in a kit bag. This failed as the dog pushed his head out of the bag just as they were boarding – fortunately for Ant the new crew seemed happy to have a dog on-board and welcomed him. The facilities on ''Neuralia'' were much better than ''Northmoor'', as the cabins remained fitted out as a cruise ship and Ant could stay in the cabin with the men.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the voyage went smoothly, until Bozděch was informed about the [[Quarantine#United_Kingdom|quarantine]] rules for dogs upon entering the United Kingdom. Having no money with which to pay for the quarantine fees, the Czechs sought once again to smuggle him – this time into the UK. They elected to hide Ant once again in a bag, this time mixed up in those being transferred as cargo by crane.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; They arrived at the docks in Liverpool on 12 July, where they successfully took Ant ashore. They were nearly found out by a pair of [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] as they were at the train station nearby as they were on their way to [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
When [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|France surrendered to Germany]], Bozděch and Antis moved to England to join [[No. 311 Squadron RAF|No. 311 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF]], based first at [[Speke]], Liverpool, where Antis assisted in searching for survivors after an [[The Blitz|air raid]], despite being wounded himself.&lt;ref name=daily-mail /&gt; A few months later, 311 Squadron was posted to [[RAF East Wretham]] in Norfolk and, despite regulations prohibiting Antis flying with Bozděch, he took part in around 30 missions.&lt;ref name=daily-mail /&gt;&lt;ref name=praha /&gt; He became a mascot for the squadron as well as a personal pet, but stayed with Bozděch when he returned to his native [[Czechoslovakia]] after the war. When Bozděch had to flee Czechoslovakia again in 1948 from the growing persecution of army personnel who served on the side of western allies by the communists who recently gained power after the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état]], Antis helped him escape, guiding him and several others around searchlights and the field of fire of a fixed machine gun position, and allowing them to cross safely into [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=praha /&gt;

Antis was formally recognised for his heroics in 1949, when he was awarded the [[Dickin Medal]], which is frequently referred to as "the animal's [[Victoria Cross]]".&lt;ref name=daily-mail /&gt;&lt;ref name=praha /&gt;&lt;ref name="pdsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/pdsa-dickin-medal |title=PDSA Dickin Medal |publisher=PDSA |accessdate=6 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924092934/http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/pdsa-dickin-medal |archivedate=24 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=modtreo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/MilitarySearchDogToReceiveAnimalsVictoriaCross.htm |publisher=Ministry of Defence |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |title=Military search dog to receive animals' Victoria Cross |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315194420/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/MilitarySearchDogToReceiveAnimalsVictoriaCross.htm |archivedate=15 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/animals_vc.shtml |publisher = BBC Radio 4 | title = The Animals' VC | accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Václav Bozděch became a British national two years later, in 1951, and Antis lived with him until he died around the age of 13–14.&lt;ref name=daily-mail /&gt;&lt;ref name=praha /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=David|title=The animals' VC: for gallantry and devotion: the PDSA Dickin Medal – inspiring stories of bravery and courage|date=2012|publisher=Preface|location=London|isbn=978-1848093768|ref=long2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{see also|Dogs in warfare#Popular culture}}

The first book to be written about Antis was [[Anthony Richardson]]'s ''One Man and His Dog'' (1961), although several changes were made to his story such as Bozděch's first name becoming Jan. The airman had worked on the book with Richardson, and was dissatisfied with the result. There was talk at the time of the book being picked up as a film by [[20th Century Fox]], but it was never made.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lewis2013|Lewis (2013)]]: p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Der_junge_Richard_Strauss.JPG|thumb|Richard Strauss in 1888]]
'''''Death and Transfiguration''''' ('''''{{Lang|de|Tod und Verklärung}}'''''), [[Opus number|Op.]] 24, is a [[tone poem]] for large orchestra by [[Richard Strauss]]. Strauss began composition in the late summer of 1888 and completed the work on 18 November 1889. The work is dedicated to the composer's friend Friedrich Rosch.

The music depicts the death of an artist. At Strauss's request, this was described in a poem by the composer's friend [[Alexander Ritter]] as an interpretation of Death and Transfiguration, after it was composed.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliam, ''Grove''&lt;/ref&gt; As the man lies dying, thoughts of his life pass through his head: his childhood innocence, the struggles of his manhood, the attainment of his worldly goals; and at the end, he receives the longed-for transfiguration "from the infinite reaches of heaven".

==Performance history==
Strauss conducted the premiere on 21 June 1890 at the [[Eisenach]] Festival (on the same program with the premiere of his ''[[Burleske|Burleske in D minor]]'' for piano and orchestra). He also conducted this work for his first appearance in England, at the Wagner Concert with the Philharmonic Society on 15 June 1897 at the [[Queen's Hall]] in London.

==Critical reaction==
English music critic [[Ernest Newman]] described this as music to which one would not want to die or awaken. "It is too spectacular, too brilliantly lit, too full of pageantry of a crowd; whereas this is a journey one must make very quietly, and alone".

French critic [[Romain Rolland]] in his ''Musiciens d'aujourd'hui'' (1908) called the piece "one of the most moving works of Strauss, and that which is constructed with the noblest utility".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mason, Daniel Gregory (1918), ''Contemporary Composers'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
There are four parts (with Ritter's poetic thoughts condensed):

{{ordered list|type=upper-roman
| Largo (The sick man, near death)
| Allegro molto agitato (The battle between life and death offers no respite to the man)
| Meno mosso (The dying man's life passes before him)
| Moderato (The sought-after transfiguration)
}}
A typical performance lasts about 25 minutes.

&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key ees \major \time 4/4 r4^"Transfiguration theme" f,-. bes( c | d d' c2) } &lt;/score&gt;

== Instrumentation ==
The work is scored for a large orchestra: 3 [[western concert flute|flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B-flat]], [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horn]]s in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in F and C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[tam-tam]], and [[string section|strings]]: 2 [[harp]]s, [[violin]]s i, ii, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[double bass]]es.

==Quoted==
In one of Strauss's last compositions, "Im Abendrot" from the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'', Strauss poignantly quotes the "transfiguration theme" from his tone poem of 60 years earlier, during and after the soprano's final line, "Ist dies etwa der Tod?" (Is this perhaps death?).
&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; { \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt; \new Staff \relative c { \clef bass \key ees \major \time 4/4 \partial 2*1 s2 | r4 a( d2~ | d4 e fis fis') | s1 | s1 | s1 | s1 } \new Staff \relative c' { \clef treble \key ees \major \time 4/4 fis2 | fis r | r a | a r | r bes | ces1~ | ces2 } \addlyrics { ist dies et- wa der Tod? } &gt;&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;
Just before his own death, he remarked that his music was absolutely correct; his feelings mirrored those of the artist depicted within; Strauss said to his daughter-in-law as he lay on his deathbed in 1949: "It's a funny thing, Alice, dying is just the way I composed it in ''Tod und Verklärung''."&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Puffett's comments on DG disc 447 762-2&lt;/ref&gt;

They possess negligible hemolytic toxicity and higher [[transfection]] efficiency, and they are better tolerated [[in vivo]] than are dendrimers. The word " Dendrosome" came from the Greek word  "Dendron" meaning tree and " some" means [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s. Thus dendrosomes are vesicular structures composed of dendrimers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutta | first1 = Tathagata | last2 = Hrushikesh | first2 = Vijayarajkumar | last3 = Agashe | first3 = B. | last4 = Joshi | first4 = Mahendra | last5 = Jain | first5 = N.

==Applications==
Dendrosomes have been explored as vectors in [[gene delivery]] &lt;ref&gt;Movassaghian S, Moghimi HR, Shirazi FH, Koshkaryev A, Trivedi MS, [[Torchilin]] VP, Efficient down-regulation of PKC-α gene expression in A549 lung cancer cells mediated by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in dendrosomes. Int J Pharm. 2013 Jan 30;441(1-2):82-91&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Genetic immunity|genetic immunization]].

Poly (propyleneimine) dendrosome based genetic immunization against [[Hepatitis B]] was found to be highly effective as compared to Dendrimer-[[Plasmid]] [[DNA]] complex. It has been postulated that in dendrosomes, the poly (propyleneimine) dendrimer–DNA complex is largely protected by multilamelarity of the vesicles. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that the lipoidal layers of the dendrosomes modifies the release pattern of the poly (propyleneimine) dendrimer –DNA complex, while some of the larger vesicles remain at the site of [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] following their [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] by tissue [[phospholipase]]s, the smaller ones delivering and transfecting efficiently the [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APC) in the draining [[lymph node]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutta | first1 = Tathagata | last2 = Garg | first2 = Minakshi | year = 2008 | title = Poly(propyleneimine) dendrimer and dendrosome based genetic immunization against Hepatitis B. | url = | journal = Vaccine | volume = 26 | issue = 27-28| pages = 3389–3394 | doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.04.058 | pmid=18511160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrosomes have also been explored for the delivery of s10siRNA targeting E6/E7 [[oncogene]]s in [[cervical cancer]].

'''Dipyridamole''' (trademarked as '''Persantine''' and others) is a [[medication]] that inhibits [[thrombus|blood clot]] formation&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000030395|Dipyridamole}}&lt;/ref&gt; when given chronically and causes [[vasodilation|blood vessel dilation]] when given at high doses over a short time.

==Mechanisms of action==
Dipyridamole has two known effects, acting via different mechanisms of action:
* Dipyridamole inhibits the [[phosphodiesterase]] enzymes that normally break down [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] (increasing cellular cAMP levels and blocking the [[platelet aggregation]] response&lt;ref name=Brown2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brown DG, Wilkerson EC, Love WE | title=A review of traditional and novel oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy for dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|volume=72|issue=3|pages=524–34|date=March 2015|pmid=25486915|doi= 10.1016/j.jaad.2014.10.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]) and/or [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]].
* Dipyridamole inhibits the cellular reuptake of [[adenosine]] into [[platelets]], [[red blood cell]]s, and [[endothelial cell]]s, leading to increased extracellular concentrations of adenosine.

==Medical uses==
* Dipyridamole is used to dilate blood vessels in people with [[peripheral arterial disease]] and [[coronary artery disease]]&lt;ref name=Brown2015/&gt;
* Dipyridamole has been shown to lower [[pulmonary hypertension]] without significant drop of systemic [[blood pressure]]
* It inhibits formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines ([[MCP-1]], [[MMP-9]]) in vitro and results in reduction of hsCRP in patients.
* It inhibits proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vivo and modestly increases unassisted patency of synthetic arteriovenous hemodialysis grafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dixon BS, Beck GJ, Vazquez MA | year = 2009 | title = Effect of dipyridamole plus aspirin on hemodialysis graft patency | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 360 | issue = 21| pages = 2191–2201 | doi=10.1056/nejmoa0805840|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It increases the release of [[Tissue plasminogen activator|t-PA]] from brain microvascular endothelial cells
* It results in an increase of [[13-HODE]] and decrease of [[12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid|12-HETE]] in the subendothelial matrix (SEM) and reduced thrombogenicity of the SEM.
* Pretreatment it reduced reperfusion injury in volunteers.
* It has been shown to increase myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
* It results in a reduction of the number of [[Thrombin receptor|thrombin]] and [[CD31|PECAM-1]] receptors on platelets in stroke patients.
* [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] impairs platelet aggregation and also causes [[arteriole|arteriolar]] [[smooth muscle]] relaxation. Chronic therapy did not show significant drop of systemic blood pressure.
* It inhibits the replication of [[mengovirus]] RNA.&lt;ref&gt;Dipyridamole in the laboratory: {{cite web  | last = Fata-Hartley   | first = Cori L.   |author2=Ann C. Palmenberg   | title = Dipyridamole reversibly inhibits mengovirus RNA replication
| url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/79/17/11062?view=long&amp;pmid=16103157  | accessdate=2007-02-13  | doi=10.1128/JVI.79.17.11062-11070.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It can be used for myocardial stress testing as an alternative to exercise-induced stress methods such as treadmills.

===Use in individuals with a history of stroke===
A combination of dipyridamole and [[aspirin]] ([[acetylsalicylic acid/dipyridamole]]) is [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved for the secondary prevention of [[stroke]] and has a bleeding risk equal to that of aspirin use alone.&lt;ref name=Brown2015/&gt; Dipyridamole absorption is [[pH]]-dependent and concomitant treatment with gastric acid suppressors (such as a [[proton pump inhibitor]]) will inhibit the absorption of liquid and plain tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Russell TL, Berardi RR, Barnett JL, O’Sullivan TL, Wagner JG, Dressman JB. pH-related changes in the absorption of "dipyridamole"  in the elderly. Pharm Res (1994) 11 136–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derendorf H, VanderMaelen CP, Brickl R-S, MacGregor TR, Eisert W. "Dipyridamole" bioavailability in subjects with reduced gastric acidity. J Clin Pharmacol (2005) 45, 845–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Modified release preparations are buffered and absorption is not affected.&lt;ref&gt;http://emc.medicines.org.uk/medicine/304/SPC/Persantin+Retard+200mg/#EXCIPIENTS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stockley |first=Ivan |year=2009 |title='''Stockley’s Drug Interactions''' |publisher = The Pharmaceutical Press|isbn=0-85369-424-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is not licensed as monotherapy for stroke prophylaxis, although a [[Cochrane Review]] suggested that dipyridamole may reduce the risk of further vascular events in patients presenting after cerebral [[ischemia]].&lt;ref name="Dipyridamole for preventing stroke and other vascular events in patients with vascular disease"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Schryver EL, Algra A, van Gijn J |editor1-last=Algra |editor1-first=Ale |title=Dipyridamole for preventing stroke and other vascular events in patients with vascular disease. |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=CD001820 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001820.pub3 |url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001820.html |pmid=17636684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A triple therapy of [[aspirin]], [[clopidogrel]], and dipyridamole has been investigated, but this combination led to an increase in adverse bleeding events.&lt;ref name="pmid18682741"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sprigg N, Gray LJ, England T |display-authors=etal |editor1-last=Berger |editor1-first=Jeffrey S. |title=A randomised controlled trial of triple antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole) in the secondary prevention of stroke: safety, tolerability and feasibility |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=e2852 |year=2008 |pmid=18682741 |pmc=2481397 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002852 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0002852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vasodilation occurs in healthy arteries, whereas [[stenosis|stenosed]] arteries remain narrowed.  This creates a "steal" phenomenon where the coronary blood supply will increase to the dilated healthy vessels compared to the stenosed arteries which can then be detected by clinical symptoms of chest pain, [[electrocardiogram]] and [[echocardiography]] when it causes ischemia.
* Flow heterogeneity (a necessary precursor to ischemia) can be detected with [[gamma camera]]s and [[SPECT]] using nuclear imaging agents such as [[Thallium]]-201, [[Technetium-99m|Tc99m]]-[[Tetrofosmin]] and [[Technetium-99m|Tc99m]]-[[Sestamibi]]. However, relative differences in perfusion do not necessarily imply any absolute decrease in blood supply in the tissue supplied by a stenosed artery.

===Other uses===
Dipyridamole also has non-medicinal uses in a laboratory context, such as the inhibition of [[cardiovirus]] growth in [[cell culture]].


=== Drug Interactions ===
Due to its action as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor Dipyridamole is likely to potentiate the effects of [[adenosine]]. This occurs by blocking the nucleoside transporter through which adenosine enters [[erythrocyte]] and [[endothelial]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;Gamboa A, Abraham R, Diedrich A, Shibao C, Paranjape SY, Farley G, et al. Role of adenosine and nitric oxide on the mechanisms of action of dipyridamole. Stroke. 2005;36(10):2170-2175.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UK 2016 [[AAGBI]] guidelines, Dipyridamole is considered to not cause risk of bleeding when receiving neuroaxial anaesthesia and deep nerve blocks. It does not therefore require cessation prior to anaesthesia with these techniques, and can continue to be taken with nerve block catheters in place &lt;ref&gt;AAGBI Guidelines Neuraxial and Coagulation june 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Dipyridamole [[overdose]] can be treated with [[aminophylline]]&lt;ref name="Aggrenox PI" /&gt;{{rp|6}} which reverses its [[hemodynamics|dilating effect on the blood vessels]].  Symptomatic treatment is recommended, possibly including a vasopressor drug. Gastric lavage should be considered. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole overdose. Since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, [[hemodialysis|dialysis]] is not likely to be of benefit.

[[File:White-Rabbit-making-elixir-of-immortality.jpg|thumb|The mythological [[Moon rabbit|White Hare]] making the elixir of life on the Moon, from Chinese mythology.]]
The '''elixir of life''', also known as  '''elixir of immortality''' and sometimes equated with the [[philosopher's stone]], is a [[potion]] that supposedly grants the drinker [[Immortality|eternal life]] and/or [[eternal youth]]. This [[elixir]] was also said to cure all diseases. [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir.

== History ==

=== China ===
[[File:Xu Fu expedition's for the elixir of life.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Xu Fu]]'s first expedition to the [[Mount Penglai|Mount of the immortals]]. By [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]
In ancient China, various [[emperor]]s sought the fabled elixir with varying results. In the [[Qin Dynasty]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] sent [[Taoist]] alchemist [[Xu Fu]] with 500 young men and 500 young women to the eastern seas to find the elixir, but he never came back (legend has it that he found [[Japan]] instead). When Shi Huang Di visited, he brought 3000 young girls and boys, but none of them ever returned.

The ancient Chinese believed that ingesting long-lasting precious substances such as [[jade]], [[cinnabar]] or [[hematite]] would confer some of that longevity on the person who consumed them.  [[Gold]] was considered particularly potent, as it was a non-tarnishing precious metal; the idea of potable or drinkable gold is found in China by the end of the third century BC.  The most famous Chinese alchemical book, the Danjing yaojue (Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics) attributed to [[Sun Simiao]] (c. 581 – c. 682 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Science, Technology And Medicine: An Encyclopedia, A Glick, T.F., A Livesey, S.J., Wallis, F., Routledge, p. 20 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/582108/Tan-chin-yao-chueh|title=Tan chin yao chueh – occultism|work=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a famous medical specialist respectfully called "King of Medicine" by later generations, discusses in detail the creation of elixirs for immortality (mercury, sulfur, and the salts of mercury and arsenic are prominent, and most are poisonous) as well as those for curing certain diseases and the fabrication of precious stones.

Many of these substances, far from contributing to longevity, were actively toxic and resulted in [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning]]. The [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming Dynasty]] died from ingesting a lethal dosage of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the supposed "Elixir of Life" conjured by alchemists. British historian [[Joseph Needham]] compiled a list of Chinese emperors whose deaths were likely due to elixir poisoning{{cn|date=November 2015}}.

=== India ===
[[Amrita]], the elixir of life has been described in the Hindu scriptures (not to be confused with Amrit related to Sikh religion (see [[Amrit Sanskar]])). Anybody who consumes even a tiniest portion of Amrit has been described to gain immortality. Legend has it that at early times when the inception of the world had just taken place, evil demons (Ashur) had gained strength. This was seen as a threat to the gods (Devas) who feared them. So these gods (including [[Indra]], the god of sky, Vayu, the god of wind, and [[Agni]], the god of fire) went to seek advice and help from the three primary gods according to the Hindus: [[Vishnu]] (the preserver), [[Brahma]] (the creator), and [[Shiva]] (the destroyer). They suggested that Amrit could only be gained from the [[samudra manthan]] (or churning of the ocean) for the ocean in its depths hid mysterious and secret objects. Vishnu agreed to take the form of a turtle on whose shell a huge mountain was placed. This mountain was used as a churning pole.

With the help of a [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (mighty and long serpent, king of Nagloka) the churning process began at the surface. From one side the gods pulled the serpent, which had coiled itself around the mountain, and the demons pulled it from the other side. As the churning process required immense strength, hence the demons were persuaded to do the job—they agreed in return for a portion of Amrit. Finally with their combined efforts (of the gods and demons), Amrit emerged from the ocean depths. All the gods were offered the drink but the gods managed to trick the demons who did not get the holy drink.

The oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life. Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century BC [[Arthashastra]], about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West. Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.

It is also possible that the alchemy of medicine and immortality came to China from India, or vice versa; in any case, for both cultures, gold-making appears to have been a minor concern, and medicine the major concern. But the elixir of immortality was of little importance in India (which had other avenues to immortality). The Indian elixirs were mineral remedies for specific diseases or, at the most, to promote long life.

=== Europe ===
{{Main|Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Dell' elixir vitae 1624 Donato d'Eremita Plate 1 AQ14 (1).jpg|thumb|''Dell' elixir vitae'', 1624]]
In European [[alchemical]] tradition, the Elixir of Life is closely related to the creation of the philosopher's stone. According to legend, certain alchemists have gained a reputation as creators of the elixir. These include [[Nicolas Flamel]] and [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].

== Names ==
The Elixir has had hundreds of names (one scholar of Chinese history reportedly found over 1,000 names for it), among them Amrit Ras or [[Amrita]], Aab-i-Hayat, Maha Ras, Aab-Haiwan, Dancing Water, Chasma-i-Kausar, Mansarover or the Pool of Nectar, [[Philosopher's stone]], and Soma Ras.  The word ''[[wikt:elixir|elixir]]'' was not used until the 7th century A.D. and derives from the Arabic name for miracle substances, "al iksir".  Some view it as a metaphor for the spirit of God (''e.g.'', Jesus's reference to "the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]" or "the [[Fountain of Life]]").  "But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.  Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."  (John 4:14)  The [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]] adopted the name for their "liquid gold": the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for [[whiskey]] is [[uisce beatha]], or water of life.

''Aab-i-Hayat'' is Persian and means "water of life".&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Poonawala. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-ii-water-in-muslim-iranian-culture "ĀB ii. Water in Muslim Iranian culture"].  ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''. Retrieved 12 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Chashma-i-Kausar" (not "hasma") is the "Fountain of Bounty", which Muslims believe to be located in Paradise.  As for the Indian names, "Amrit Ras" means "immortality juice", "Maha Ras" means "great juice", and "Soma Ras" means "juice of Soma".  Soma was a psychoactive drug, by which the poets of the [[Vedas]] received their visions, but the plant is no longer known.  Later, Soma came to mean the moon.  "Ras" later came to mean "sacred mood experienced listening to poetry or music"; there are altogether nine of them.  [[Mansarovar]], the "mind lake" is  the  holy  lake at the foot  of [[Mt. Kailash]] in Tibet, close to the source of the Ganges.

== In popular culture ==
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}

The elixir of life has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of artistic works including [[animation]], [[comics]], [[film|films]], musical compositions, [[novel|novels]], and [[video games]]. Examples include [[L. Frank Baum|L. Frank Baum's]] fantasy novel ''[[John Dough and the Cherub]]'', the science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[House of Anubis]]'', the popular manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', the light novel ''[[Baccano!]]'', and the movie [[Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva]] of the popular [[Professor Layton]] franchise.

He was best known for his time with [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]] (FMW), where he primarily wrestled throughout his career and was the [[franchise player]] of the company between 1995 and 2001.

Ezaki initially competed for FMW as a low-carder between 1991 and 1993 before travelling to Mexico where he developed the "Hayabusa" [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|character]] and his signature wrestling style during his time with [[lucha libre]] organizations. He returned to FMW in 1995 and received a significant [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Push|push]] as the face of the company, winning his first [[FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship|Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship]] later that year. He spent much of 1996 on the sidelines due to injury and lost the majority of his high-profile matches upon his return. He started gaining popularity and championship success in 1997 and won the Double Championship in 1998 and held the title for most of the year. He developed alter egos such as "The Darkside of Hayabusa" in 1996 and the unmasked "H" in 1999. His career ended in late 2001 after a botched [[moonsault]] left him paralysed.

He was a five-time [[professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] in FMW as he won the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship [[FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship#Title History|three times]],&lt;ref name="fmwtitle"/&gt; [[FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship|Independent Heavyweight Championship]] [[FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship#Title History|one time]]&lt;ref name="fmwindytitle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/Independent.html|title=FMW Independent Championship official title history|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[WEW Heavyweight Championship]] [[WEW Heavyweight Championship#Title history|one time]].&lt;ref name="wewtitle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/wewworld.html|title=WEW World Independent Championship official title history|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a [[FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship#Title History|two time]] [[FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship|Brass Knuckles Tag Team Champion]], a [[WEW World Tag Team Championship#Title history|two time]] [[WEW World Tag Team Championship|WEW World Tag Team Champion]],&lt;ref name="fmwtagtitle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/FMWTag.html|title=FMW/WEW World Tag Team Championship official title history|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship#Title history|two time]] [[FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship|World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Champion]] and a [[WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship#Title history|two time]] [[WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship|WEW 6-Man Tag Team Champion]].&lt;ref name="fmw6mantitle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/wew6man.html|title=FMW/WEW Six-Man Tag Team Championship official title history|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s [[All Asia Tag Team Championship]] [[All Asia Tag Team Championship#Title history|once]].&lt;ref name="ajpwallasia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-japan.co.jp/champ/アジアタッグ王座|title=All Asia Tag Team Championship official title history|publisher=[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his post-retirement years, Ezaki promoted the Wrestling Marvelous Future (WMF) promotion, which spun off from FMW, but the promotion was a failure and ended in 2008. He headlined many [[List of FMW supercards and pay-per-view events|pay-per-view events]] for FMW including the company's premier show [[FMW Anniversary Show|Anniversary Show]] a record six times, consecutively for four years between [[FMW 9th Anniversary Show|9th]] and [[FMW 12th Anniversary Show|12th]] editions of the event.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early years (1987–1991)===
Trained by former [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] star and sumo wrestler [[Takashi Ishikawa]], Eiji Ezaki made his professional wrestling debut at an independent show on November 2, 1987, teaming with [[Mr. Gannosuke|Masashi Honda]] against three upper classmen. He and Honda would struggle in the very small indy circuit for four years before joining [[Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling]]'s dojo, headed by another former AJPW alumnus [[Tarzan Goto]].

===Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling===
====Early years (1991&amp;ndash;1993)====
Ezaki made his FMW debut on May 5, 1991, where he teamed up with [[Damian 666|Amigo Ultra]] to defeat El Pandita and Yukihide Ueno in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=165275|title=FMW results - May 5, 1991|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is customary for rookies to lose matches in professional wrestling, especially [[puroresu]], Ezaki lost the majority of his matches throughout the year. Ezaki got his first win in FMW against fellow rookie [[Mr. Gannosuke|Masashi Honda]] on June 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=165298|title=FMW results - June 29, 1991|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two competed in many matches including the opening match of FMW's [[FMW 2nd Anniversary Show|2nd Anniversary Show]] on September 23, which Ezaki won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/miscfmw.html#fall91|title=Fall Spectacular 1991 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next major show appearance was at a FMW and [[World Wrestling Association]] co-promoted interpromotional event on May 16, 1992, where Ezaki represented FMW with [[Mr. Gannosuke]] and [[Psicosis II|Ultra Taro]] against WWA's Los Mercenarios Americanos (Mercenario I, Mercenario II and [[Louie Spicolli|Mercenario III]]) in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|six-man tag team match]], which Ezaki lost after being pinned by Spicolli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/miscfmw.html#fmwla|title=FMW/WWA in Los Angeles results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At September's [[FMW 3rd Anniversary Show|3rd Anniversary Show]], Ezaki and Gannosuke lost to [[Chris Jericho]] and Kevin Faule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/miscfmw.html#fall92|title=Fall Spectacular 1992 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezaki participated in the company's [[FMW 4th Anniversary Show|4th Anniversary Show]] on May 5, 1993, where he defeated [[Koji Nakagawa]] in the opening match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puroresucentral.com/FMWReview-5.5.93.html|title=FMW Kawasaki Stadium, 5/5/93|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=2017-10-24|author=Ryan Mancuso}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1993, Ezaki participated in a tournament for the inaugural [[Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship]], where he lost both matches in his block against Koji Nakagawa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=25859|title=FMW results - September 17, 1993|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Battle Ranger Z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=62387|title=FMW results - September 25, 1993|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last match in FMW during this tenure was a win against [[Masato Tanaka]] on September 27,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=62547|title=FMW results - September 27, 1993|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; before [[Atsushi Onita]] sent Ezaki overseas to learn the [[lucha libre]] style in Mexico.

====North American excursion and return (1993&amp;ndash;1995)====
{{Quote box|quote="A really good first impression for Hayabusa, but it was clear that he was still pretty green.

Ezaki adopted the '''Hayabusa''' [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|character]] in December 1993 while in Mexico. While there, he learned the [[lucha libre]] style from wrestling instructor [[Rey Misterio, Sr.]]&lt;ref name="fmwbio"/&gt; Ezaki wrestled for the [[World Wrestling Association]], [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|Asistencia Asesoria y Administration]] (AAA) and [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) during his time in Mexico. He then returned to Japan to participate in the [[Super J-Cup#1994|1994 Super J-Cup]] tournament for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW), where he competed as Hayabusa in Japan for the first time to test how the crowd reacted to his character in Japan.

He appeared as Hayabusa in FMW for the first time at [[Summer Spectacular (1994)|Summer Spectacular]] on August 28, 1994 by defeating [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/miscfmw.html#summer94|title=Summer Spectacular 1994 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to CMLL to team with fellow Japanese wrestler [[Último Dragón]] in the [[CMLL tag team tournaments#Copa de Oro 1994|1994 Copa de Oro]] on October 25 in a loss to eventual winners [[Apolo Dantés]] and El Dandy in the quarter-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/index.php?id=26&amp;nr=2316|title=Copa de Oro 1994 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Hayabusa and Dragon participated in the number two contender's tournament for the World Tag Team Championship, where they defeated [[El Felino]] and [[Mano Negra (wrestler)|Mano Negra]] in the first round&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=70183|title=CMLL results - November 11, 1994|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; before losing to [[El Satánico]] and [[Emilio Charles Jr.]] in the quarter-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=70187|title=CMLL results - November 18, 1994|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would remain in Mexico until December 1994.

Between January 1995 and April 1995, Ezaki wrestled in the United States, mainly in the [[Florida]] area. During this time, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) was interested in Ezaki and offered a tryout, but he declined and remained with FMW.

====Initial push and injuries (1995&amp;ndash;1996)====
Ezaki was scheduled to make his full-time return to FMW as Hayabusa at the company's [[FMW 6th Anniversary Show|6th Anniversary Show]] against [[Mike Awesome|The Gladiator]] on May 5, 1995. However, he was chosen by FMW's new owner [[Shoichi Arai]] to fill the spot as Atsushi Onita's opponent in Onita's retirement match at the event as Onita wanted his final opponent to succeed him as the promotion's [[franchise player|ace]] after Onita's originally supposed opponent [[Tarzan Goto]] left FMW and there was no main event star left to be Onita's opponent.&lt;ref name="fmwbio"/&gt; Hayabusa returned to FMW at the 6th Anniversary Show, where he unsuccessfully challenged Onita for the [[FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship|Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship]] in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel cage match|exploding cage]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Barbed Wire Massacre|barbed wire]] [[Hardcore wrestling#Rules|deathmatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/fmwanniv.html#6th|title=6th Anniversary Show results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the match, Ezaki managed to kick out of Onita's ''[[Powerbomb#Thunder Fire Powerbomb|Thunder Fire Powerbomb]]'' and gave a huge fight. He was rushed to the hospital on a stretcher due to suffering severe burns but became Onita's successor as the ace of FMW.&lt;ref name="fmwbio"/&gt; Hayabusa returned to the company on May 17 by teaming with Katsutoshi Niiyama against [[Lethal Weapon (professional wrestling)|Lethal Weapon]] members The Gladiator and [[Horace Hogan|Horace Boulder]] in a losing effort to begin his first [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] in the company with Lethal Weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45067|title=FMW results - May 17, 1995|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the leader of the new generation of FMW wrestlers including Niiyama, Masato Tanaka and [[Tetsuhiro Kuroda]] and Koji Nakagawa. He wrestled the group's members in several tag matches for the next one month after Lethal Weapon questioned his ability to become the ace of FMW and vowed to take over the company. He initially struggled to gain a fanbase after Onita's loyal fans refused to accept him but Hayabusa got to impress the Japanese fans by debuting the ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Corkscrew 450° splash|Phoenix Splash]]'' against Lethal Weapon member [[Ricky Fuji]] during a match on May 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45076|title=FMW results - May 28, 1995|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayabusa's team lost but the ''Phoenix Splash'' was heavily promoted by the Japanese media, which helped FMW in regaining the fanbase and Ezaki started becoming popular due to his high-flying skills.&lt;ref name="fmwbio"/&gt;

Just one month after his re-debut, Ezaki was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] to win the promotion's top title, the vacant Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship by defeating Lethal Weapon member [[Hisakatsu Oya]] on June 27 by debuting his new finishing move, ''[[Suplex#Sitout suplex slam|Falcon Arrow]]''.&lt;ref name="fmwbio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45075|title=FMW results - June 27, 1995|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he immediately vacated the title due to injury but a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storyline]] was created that he vacated it because he wanted to beat Gladiator and all the members of the [[W*ING Alliance]].&lt;ref name="fmwtitle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/brassknux.html|title=FMW Brass Knuckles Championship official title history|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was put up for grabs in the [[FMW tournaments#Grand Slam Tournament|Grand Slam Tournament]], an eight-man tournament in the [[round-robin tournament|round-robin format]] and Ezaki was put in the tournament. However, before the tournament started, Ezaki was severely injured by The Gladiator in a match on July 30 but he insisted that he would compete in the tournament.&lt;ref name="fmwbio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45095|title=FMW results - July 30, 1995|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezaki started the tournament on August 22 by defeating Masato Tanaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45096|title=FMW Grand Slam - Tag 1 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his next match against [[Kintaro Kanemura|W*ING Kanemura]] on August 25 to gain four points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45098|title=FMW Grand Slam - Tag 3 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He competed against Hisakatsu Oya to a thirty minute time limit draw&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45103|title=FMW Grand Slam - Tag 8 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defeated The Gladiator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45106|title=FMW Grand Slam - Tag 11 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Katsutoshi Niiyama to gain nine points in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45107|title=FMW Grand Slam - Tag 12 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered his first loss in the tournament against [[Corporal Kirchner|Super Leather]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45110|title=FMW Grand Slam - Tag 15 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then defeated Mitsuhiro Matsunaga to qualify for the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45115|title=FMW Grand Slam - Tag 20 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost to Gladiator in the final round of the Grand Slam on September 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45116|title=FMW Grand Slam - Tag 21 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezaki competed against W*ING and Lethal Weapon members in various tag team matches, [[Hardcore wrestling#Rules|street fights and deathmatches]] throughout the rest of the year and early 1996 before taking time off due to multiple injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/FMWNewGen.html|title=FMW official results (5/17/95 - 5/5/96)|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the injury, Hayabusa returned to FMW on March 30 to rescue Jason the Terrible from an assault by [[Mr. Pogo]] and [[The Headhunters (professional wrestling)|The Headhunters]] to set up the [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] for the company's [[FMW 7th Anniversary Show|7th Anniversary Show]] on May 5, where he teamed with Masato Tanaka to take on Pogo and [[Terry Funk]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|no rope explosive barbed wire time bomb land mine double hell death match]] and the winner would receive one million [[yen]]s.&lt;ref name="fmwbio"/&gt; Hayabusa was [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pin]]ned by Funk after a brutal match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quebrada.net/reviews/fmw19960505.html|title=FMW 7th Anniversary Show Review|publisher=Quebrada|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Napolitano|title=Hot Spots and High Spots|date=2011|isbn=1770900640|pages=282–294|language=English|chapter=Mat Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the one-off return, Ezaki continued to heal his injuries and did not compete in FMW for the next three months. On August 1, he made his return to full-time competition by defeating Koji Nagakawa at the [[Summer Spectacular (1996)|Summer Spectacular]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/miscfmw.html#summer96|title=Summer Spectacular 1996 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, Ezaki debuted an [[alter ego]] called '''Darkside Hayabusa''' during a street fight against [[Hido (wrestler)|Hido]] at a W*ING show, which Ezaki won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45388|title=WING results - September 11, 1996|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] of [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]] challenged Hayabusa to a match, who Hayabusa lost to in the main event of Michinoku Pro Wrestling's ''These Days'' event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://411mania.com/wrestling/the-puro-review-michinoku-pro-wrestling-these-days/|title=The Puro Review: Michinoku Pro Wrestling: These Days|work=411Mania|author=Jake Metcalfe|date=May 16, 2002|accessdate=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the beginning of a future friendship between the two. Following the match, [[The Great Sasuke]] challenged Hayabusa to a match at FMW's [[Year End Spectacular (1996)|Year End Spectacular]] on December 11, which Ezaki won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/miscfmw.html#end96|title=Year End Spectacular 1996 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Ace of FMW (1997&amp;ndash;1998)====
In the meanwhile, Terry Funk formed the Funk Masters of Wrestling group, which replaced Lethal Weapon as the new antagonist group and Hayabusa wrestled the group's members throughout the rest of 1996 and much of 1997. Ezaki's former friend Mr. Gannosuke returned to FMW and attacked Hayabusa after Hayabusa and Katsutoshi Niiyama lost to The Headhunters in a tag team match on January 5, 1997.&lt;ref name="fmwbio2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/Hayabusa2.html|title=Hayabusa's Biography: Part Two|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=20908|title=FMW New Generation Year - Tag 1 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the attack, Hayabusa began a lengthy and emotional rivalry with Gannosuke that would continue for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="fmwbio2"/&gt; During this time, Ricky Fuji sided with FMW after the demise of Lethal Weapon and became an ally of Hayabusa. On March 19, Hayabusa got his first title shot in nearly two years as he and Fuji challenged The Headhunters for the [[FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship|Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship]] in a losing effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=34438|title=FMW Winning Road 1997 - Tag 6 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Ezaki served as the centerpiece of FMW during a meeting with [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] owner [[Giant Baba]] to begin a partnership between AJPW and FMW and subsequently made his AJPW debut at the [[Champion Carnival|1997 Champion Carnival]] by teaming with [[Yoshinobu Kanemaru]] against [[Kentaro Shiga]] and [[Yoshinari Ogawa]] in a losing effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puroresucentral.com/AJReview-ChampionCarnival97.html|title=Champions Carnival 1997 review
|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for wrestlers of AJPW and FMW to sporadically appear in both companies and began Hayabusa's occasional appearances in AJPW. Hayabusa defeated Gannosuke in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|hair vs. hair match]] at FMW's [[FMW 8th Anniversary Show|8th Anniversary Show]]. After the match, Hayabusa said that Gannosuke's hair would not be cut off if he left Funk Masters of Wrestling and side with FMW and Gannosuke apparently shook his hands and then attacked Hayabusa, thus removed his mask and attempted to blow fire on him until Jinsei Shinzaki made the save.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/FMWReview-KudoRetirement.html|title=Megumi Kudo Retirement Show, 4/29/97

As a result, Hayabusa formed a [[tag team]] with Shinzaki. They teamed with each other for the first time by teaming with Koji Nakagawa against Funk Masters of Wrestling members Hisakatsu Oya, Mr. Gannosuke and The Gladiator in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|six-man tag team match]] on July 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45552|title=FMW King Of Fight II 1997 - Tag 1 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, Hayabusa teamed with Nakagawa and Ricky Fuji in a tournament for the vacant [[FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship|World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship]]. They lost to eventual winners Oya, Gannosuke and Gladiator in the semi-final round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=159482|title=Fuyuki Army results - August 5, 1997|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, the trio of Hayabusa, Nakagawa and Masato Tanaka defeated Oya, Gannosuke and Gladiator to win the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name="fmw6mantitle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45569|title=FMW Super Dynamism 1997 - Tag 9 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, Hayabusa wrestled two matches on the same day. He first appeared in a tag team match for AJPW at [[Korakuen Hall]] in [[Tokyo]] by teaming with [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] to defeat [[Jun Akiyama]] and Saturo Asako.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=93616|title=AJPW October Giant Series 1997 - Tag 2 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then travelled to [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa]] to compete at FMW's [[Fall Spectacular (1997)|Fall Spectacular]] at the [[Kawasaki Stadium]], where he and Shinzaki lost to AJPW's [[Kenta Kobashi]] and [[Taiyo Kea|Maunakea Mossman]] in a highly acclaimed tag team match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/miscfmw.html#fall97|title=Fall Spectacular 1997 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, Hayabusa, Nakagawa and Tanaka [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|drop]]ped the six-man tag team title to [[ZEN (professional wrestling)|ZEN]] members Atsushi Onita, Hido and Tetsuhiro Kuroda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45614|title=FMW Power Splash 1997 - Tag 2 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the beginning of a feud between Hayabusa and Onita as Onita wanted to stay on the top of FMW while Ezaki wanted to remain the ace of the company.&lt;ref name="fmwbio2"/&gt;

Hayabusa and Shinzaki participated in AJPW's [[World's Strongest Tag Determination League#1997|1997 Real World Tag League]] and kicked off the tournament on November 19 by defeating Giant Kimala and [[Jun Izumida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=40922|title=AJPW Real World Tag League 1997 - Tag 1 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They finished the tournament with four points&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/alljapan/tag90.html#97|title=Real World Tag League 1997 Tournament Brackets|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they would win only one more match against [[John Hindley|Johnny Smith]] and [[Jim Steele (wrestler)|Wolf Hawkfield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=88192|title=AJPW Real World Tag League 1997 - Tag 13 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while losing the rest of their matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=40923|title=AJPW Real World Tag League 1997 - Tag 2 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=88185|title=AJPW Real World Tag League 1997 - Tag 4 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=40924|title=AJPW Real World Tag League 1997 - Tag 5 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=88186|title=AJPW Real World Tag League 1997 - Tag 7 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=88189|title=AJPW Real World Tag League 1997 - Tag 10 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=88191|title=AJPW Real World Tag League 1997 - Tag 12 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=88193|title=AJPW Real World Tag League 1997 - Tag 14 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayabusa and Masato Tanaka faced Mr. Gannosuke and [[Kouhiro Kanemura|Yukihiro Kanemura]] in a losing effort for the vacant [[FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship|Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship]] on November 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45637|title=FMW Scramble Survivor 1997 - Tag 9 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki unsuccessfully challenged Gannosuke and Kanemura for the tag team title on December 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45688|title=FMW Super Extreme Wrestling War 1997 - Tag 1 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, Hayabusa, Hisakatsu Oya and Masato Tanaka won the World Street Fight Six-Man Tag Team Championship by beating Atsushi Onita, Hido and Tetsuhiro Kuroda during the [[Super Extreme Wrestling War]] tour.&lt;ref name="fmw6mantitle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45689|title=FMW Super Extreme Wrestling War 1997 - Tag 2 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, Hayabusa, Jinsei Shinzaki and Masato Tanaka defeated ZEN members Atsushi Onita, Mr. Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura in a [[WarGames match]] after Hayabusa pinned Onita after a [[Moonsault]] from the top of the cage as a payback for his loss to Onita at 6th Anniversary Show in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=45693|title=FMW Super Extreme Wrestling War 1997 - Tag 4 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayabusa started getting [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|over]] with the audience and he was finally being heavily [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Push|push]]ed.

====Character change (1999&amp;ndash;2000)====

Ezaki had suffered multiple injuries during the past few years of his career which forced him to change his wrestling style from high flying to mat wrestling. This was incorporated into a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storyline]] that Kodo Fuyuki would not allow Ezaki to wear the falcon mask and compete as Hayabusa anymore. This led Ezaki to go through a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|character]] change.&lt;ref name="fmwbio2"/&gt; On June 15, Hayabusa teamed with Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda to defeat Mr. Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido in a [[ladder match]] which stipulated that Fuyuki had to eat [[dog food]] if his team lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/1999fmwppv.html#699|title=FMW PPV results - June 15, 1999|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; FMW held a series of events titled ''Goodbye Hayabusa'' as a farewell to Ezaki's Hayabusa character.

Hayabusa had a successful double elbow surgery on November 22. He returned to FMW at a pay-per-view on December 20 as a color commentator, along with Mr. Gannosuke, who had retired from wrestling after losing to Tetsuhiro Kuroda. During the match, Kuroda mocked Hayabusa to anger him and Hayabusa headed to the ring but Gannosuke held him back. On February 6, 2001, Hayabusa made another non-wrestling appearance to confront Kuroda along with The Masked Sumo. Sumo turned on Gannosuke and Kuroda injured Hayabusa's arms with a folding chair until [[The Great Sasuke]] made the save. On April 1, Hayabusa appeared during Kuroda and Kodo Fuyuki's WEW Heavyweight Championship match, where he attacked Mr. Gannosuke after Gannosuke attacked Fuyuki during the match and then Kuroda and his allies attacked Hayabusa until Sasuke came to his rescue again.&lt;ref name="fmwbio2"/&gt; Hayabusa made his in-ring return at the [[FMW 12th Anniversary Show|12th Anniversary Show]] on May 5 by teaming with Sasuke to defeat Kuroda and Gannosuke in an [[Hardcore wrestling|octagon cage electric bomb death match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/2001fmwppv.html#501-1|title=Kawasaki Legend 2001 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This match also commemorated the tenth anniversary of his FMW debut.&lt;ref name="fmwbio3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/Hayabusa3.html|title=Hayabusa's Biography: Part 3|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, Hayabusa pinned Kuroda in a six-man tag team match to earn a title shot at Kuroda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=46362|title=FMW Neo 2001 - Tag 1 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, Hayabusa defeated Kuroda in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Barbed Wire Massacre|double hell barbed wire]] [[Hardcore wrestling#Rules|deathmatch]] to win the WEW Heavyweight Championship, with Kodo Fuyuki as the special guest referee.&lt;ref name="wewtitle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=46364|title=FMW Neo 2001 - Tag 2 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, Fuyuki bought FMW from [[Shoichi Arai]] [[kayfabe|in storyline]] and gave the wrestlers option to either side with Arai or Fuyuki. Hayabusa sided with Arai by revealing that he had purchased 5% stock of the company. Tetsuhiro Kuroda also refused to side with Fuyuki and this resulted in Hayabusa and Kuroda being paired to take on Mr. Gannosuke and [[Kouhiro Kanemura|Kintaro Kanemura]] in a tag team match, which they lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/2001fmwppv.html#601|title=FMW PPV results - June 8, 2001|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayabusa made his first title defense of the WEW Heavyweight Championship against [[Mammoth Sasaki]] on July 30, where he retained the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=46401|title=FMW Super Dynamism 2001 - Tag 1 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, Hayabusa offered to put his 5% stock if he, GOEMON and Onryo lost the six-man tag team match to Mr. Gannosuke, Kintaro Kanemura and Mammoth Sasaki. Hayabusa was pinned by Kanemura and he agreed to put his 5% stock in a two out of three match series on August 11.&lt;ref name="fmwbio3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/2001fmwppv.html#801-1|title=FMW PPV results - August 3, 2001|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FMW team and Fuyuki's team were even with 1-1 score until Hayabusa lost the WEW Heavyweight Championship to Kanemura in the main event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/2001fmwppv.html#801-2|title=FMW PPV results - August 11, 2001|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of losing the series, Hayabusa lost his 5% stock to Fuyuki and Fuyuki sold the stock to Stuart Levy.&lt;ref name="fmwbio3"/&gt; On September 5, Hayabusa defeated Kanemura to regain the title but the win was reversed by new FMW Vice President Senmu Yoshida, who returned the title to Kanemura.&lt;ref name="wewtitle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmwbio3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=46401|title=FMW Super Dynamism 2001 - Tag 13 results|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, Hayabusa teamed with Tetsuhiro Kuroda and GOEMON to defeat Kintaro Kanemura, Kodo Fuyuki and Mr. Gannosuke to win the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name="fmw6mantitle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/2001fmwppv.html#901-1|title=FMW PPV results - September 9, 2001|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, on October 9, Hayabusa and Kuroda defeated Gannosuke and Mammoth Sasaki to win the [[WEW Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name="fmwtagtitle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/2001fmwppv.html#1001-1|title=FMW PPV results - October 9, 2001|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Sasaki challenged Hayabusa to a match which stipulated that if Hayabusa won then Shoichi Arai would be reinstated as FMW President. The match took place on October 22, during which Hayabusa suffered a career-ending injury when he attempted a [[Moonsault#Springboard moonsault|springboard moonsault]] off the middle rope and lost footing, landing on his head, cracking two of his vertebrae and leaving him paralyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/garbage/fmw/2001fmwppv.html#1001-2|title=FMW PPV results - October 22, 2001|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wrestler's Paralysis May Raise Some Doubts In Jericho|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-10-26/entertainment/0110241266_1_most-dangerous-performer-wwf-chris-jericho|accessdate=2018-01-01|date=October 26, 2001|author=Alex Marvez}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury provoked a high fever and required surgery. This injury ended his wrestling career. As he was considered the heart and soul of FMW, the company slowly folded after his departure.&lt;ref name="fmwbio3"/&gt;

==Post-retirement==
Ezaki later pursued a career as a singer. He promoted a new wrestling company called WMF (Wrestlings Marvelous Future) that contained up-and-coming wrestlers. The name was chosen since, spelled backwards, the initials are FMW in honor of the late company. He traveled to a few [[WWE]] events where he met old friends such as Sabu, [[Rob Van Dam]], and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]] backstage. He also took photographs with [[Vince McMahon]], [[Shane McMahon]], and [[Triple H]], and spoke with [[Jeff Hardy]].&lt;ref name="fmwbio3"/&gt;

Ezaki attended the PWU (Pro Wrestling Unplugged) FAHRENHEIT: 3RD DEGREE event on August 19, 2006, at the New Alhambra (formerly known as ECW Arena). This was his first appearance in the USA since 2000, the last time being at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] in Los Angeles, helping promote [[TOKYOPOP]]'s FMW DVDs by having a 6-man tag match. He also participated in a shoot interview with RF Video.

Ezaki was active in working with the [[Dragon Gate]] promotion. He recorded a debut album with [[Dragon Kid]] titled ''Trust!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spora.jp/hayabusa_dragonkid/ |title=ドラゴン・キッドオフィシャルブログ「Trust!」powered by SPORA |publisher=Spora.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came out in November 2007. He partook in the company's first US tour, joining them in their appearance in Los Angeles on September 5 and Hawaii on September 8, 2008.&lt;ref name="myspacecdn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a319.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/67/l_49758bcc5ce0b5d4b21ec1d0e1637556.jpg|title=Image: l_49758bcc5ce0b5d4b21ec1d0e1637556.jpg|publisher=a319.ac-images.myspacecdn.com|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezaki also designed the tour's T-shirt.&lt;ref name="myspacecdn2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a269.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/12/l_1ad541f6b70f22747442fdde63f3fb74.jpg|title=Image: l_1ad541f6b70f22747442fdde63f3fb74.jpg|publisher=a269.ac-images.myspacecdn.com|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his career in an interview, Ezaki said that one never knows what the chances are of a return to the ring.

On 3 April 2015, Hayabusa was part of a press conference announcing the return of FMW. He served as the executive producer of the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daily.co.jp/newsflash/ring/2015/04/03/0007881138.shtml|title=ＦＭＷ復活　ハヤブサ復帰リングを用意|date=2015-04-03|accessdate=2015-04-03|work=Daily Sports Online|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ezaki was considered to be one of the greatest professional wrestlers in the history of professional wrestling and one of the pioneers of high-flying and [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|junior heavyweight wrestling]] in Japan. He was the innovator of ''[[Suplex#Sitout suplex slam|Falcon Arrow]]'' and ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Corkscrew 450° splash|Phoenix Splash]]'' and also popularized the ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#450° splash|Firebird Splash]]'', which would become famous in North America as the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#450° splash|450° splash]]. He was the most popular and greatest star in the history of [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]], where he spent the entirety of his career. Due to his impressive talent, Ezaki received offers with better salaries from [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] and [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], which could have driven him to success but he rejected all those offers out of loyalty to FMW.&lt;ref name="fmwbio"/&gt; He worked hard as the company's [[Franchise player|ace]], even putting his body on the line and worked in some of the greatest matches in the company's history.

His match with [[Masato Tanaka]] on May 19, 1998, was considered by many to be the greatest match of his career and considered to be the second best FMW match only behind [[Noriyo Toyoda|Combat Toyoda]] vs. [[Megumi Kudo]] at [[FMW 7th Anniversary Show|7th Anniversary Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/FMW100.html|title=Top 100 FMW Matches|publisher=[[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW Wrestling]]|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had memorable rivalries and clashes with [[Mr. Gannosuke]], [[Hiromichi Fuyuki|Kodo Fuyuki]] and [[Mike Awesome|The Gladiator]]. His feud with Gannosuke would feature both men in many epic encounters and major matches between 1997 and 2001 and was considered the biggest feud in FMW history. They headlined many shows including [[FMW 8th Anniversary Show|8th Anniversary Show]], [[FMW 9th Anniversary Show|9th Anniversary Show]] and [[FMW 10th Anniversary Show|10th Anniversary Show]] as well as the [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] of [[Goodbye Hayabusa II: Last Match]] pay-per-view which was the last match of the Hayabusa character in 1999.

Kevin Wilson reviewed on the 9th Anniversary Show encounter between the two that "both wrestlers played their roles well and they hit their major moves without any problems. I still think the Phoenix Splash is one of the top five most beautiful moves in wrestling (let's see... Phoenix Splash, Shooting Star Press, Space Flying Tiger Drop, Ultimo Dragon's Asai Moonsault, and a Dragonrana), and Hayabusa hit it perfectly. It was the perfect ending, as the two other times he had gone for the move in the match he had failed... he knew that to win the titles he had to hit his ultimate finisher. Overall a really fun match, it wasn't perfectly executed, but the good far outweighed the bad."&lt;ref name="9th Anniversary Show-1"/&gt; Stuart of Puroresu Central stated that "Hayabusa's highspots were dazzling as always and Gannosuke's craftsmanship made them look better and very important. They fought almost one year exactly before this and Hayabusa smoked Gannosuke as a worker" and considered it "a worthy main event between two excellent wrestlers and undoubtedly the best match on the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puroresucentral.com/FMWReview-8.30.98Stu.html|author=Stuart|title=FMW DirecTV PPV, 4/30/98|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ezaki was the oldest of two sons. His grandparents on his mother's side of the family were owners of a hotel, before his parents took over.

Ezaki married his wife Harumi on April 7, 1997. Together, they had two daughters, Ayane (born October 19, 1997) and Shie (born May 10, 1999). He and Harumi amicably divorced in 2004, but remained friends, while sharing custody of their daughters.

Ezaki was close friends with [[Jyushin Thunder Liger]] since 1994. The two had a falling out in 1996 after Ezaki turned down a deal with [[NJPW]], but they mended their friendship in 2005.

In May 2005, he performed a play called The Shinichi Amano Story at the Tokyo Shinjuku Theater. He portrayed the main character's best friend Fuyuki Hayato, an injured air pilot soldier in World War II, who is wheelchair-bound. His performance was given positive reviews and the play was a huge success.

On April 25, 2010, his father died.

By 2015, Ezaki had regained the use of his legs and could stand on his own and walk with a cane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_84265.shtml|title=Japan news: 1990s FMW promotion looking to make a comeback|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2015-04-03|accessdate=2015-04-03|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Does not need -'s after proper name. The sign does not belong to Dr. Hegar, but rather is named after him.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">'''Hegar sign''' is a non-sensitive indication of [[pregnancy]] in women — its absence does not exclude pregnancy. It pertains to the features of the [[cervix]] and the [[uterine isthmus]]. It is demonstrated as a softening in the consistency of the uterus, and the uterus and [[cervix]] seem to be two separate regions.&lt;ref name="ChongW.M.2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chong|author2=W.M.|title=Cardiology A Socratic Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iipd0GIpw4cC&amp;pg=PA36|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-1887-2|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign is usually present from 4–6 weeks&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Gary|title=Williams obstetrics: Chapter 8, Prenatal Care|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0071497015|url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=6052072|edition=23rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the 12th week of pregnancy. Hegar's sign is more difficult to recognize in [[multiparous]] women.
 
Interpretation : On bimanual examination, (two fingers in the anterior fornix and two fingers below the uterus per abdomen) the abdominal and vaginal fingers seem to oppose below the body of uterus (examination must be gentle to avoid abortion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=D.C.DUTTA'S Textbook of Obstetrics|publisher=New central book Agency Ltd|author=D.C.Dutta|location=India|page=65|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sign was repeatedly demonstrated and described by [[Ernst Ludwig Alfred Hegar]], a [[Germany|German]] [[gynecologist]], in 1895. Hegar credited Reinl, one of his assistants, who originally described this sign in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notable names in Medicine &amp; Surgery|publisher=H. K. Lewis &amp; Co. Ltd|author=Hamilton Bailey &amp; W. J. Bishop|location=London|page=101|year=1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Private (rank)|Private]] ''[[Aung San Thuriya]]'' Hla Thaung''' ({{lang-my|လှသောင်း}} {{IPA-my|l̥a̰ θáʊɴ|}}; died 28 April 1949) of [[3rd Burma Rifles]] Battalion (Bama Thenatkaing Tatyin - Tha Na Ka) (Serial 88865) was a recipient of [[Aung San Thuriya]] Award, the highest and most prestigious award in [[Myanmar]] (Burma) for gallantry and bravery in the face of the enemy. He won the award at the [[Battle of Daik-U]] during the fight against of Karen insurgency in Myanmar.

On the early hours on 28 April 1949 at the Daik-U battlefront, HQ company of 3rd Burma Rifles [[Battalion]] was encircled by the attacking [[KNDO]] forces with much greater strength supported by artillery. Private Hla Thaung gallantly fought back the insurgents to defend the HQ company. He fought with bravery and risk his life while killing large numbers of enemy troops and halting the enemy advances towards the position of HQ Company. Holding a Bren GPMG Gun in his hand, firing non-stop to hold off the enemy until his last dying breath, Private Hla Thaung provided covering fire for the troops of 3rd Burma Rifles Battalion to retreat safely from the encircled position. He fell during this battle and when his comrades found his body after the battle, his fingers were still tightly gripped to the trigger of his Bren Gun. He was awarded Aung San Thuriya medal (Order No. 10/A Htoo/50) for his selfless valour, sacrificing his life in order to save the lives of his comrades and bravery in face of superior number of enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;Defence Museum, Yangon&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the battle of Daik-U, Private Hla Thaung fought bravely against the insurgents in the battles of Rakhine Yoma, Irrawaddy Delta Region, Zeegon, Wetkaw and Insein.

{{Christian Democracy sidebar |expanded=all}}
[[Jacques Maritain]], the French Catholic philosopher and author of over 60 books, advocated what he called "Integral Christian Humanism". He argued that [[secular]] forms of [[humanism]] were inevitably anti-human in that they refused to recognize the whole person.

Once the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] dimension of [[human]] nature is rejected, Maritain has argued that we no longer have an integral, but merely partial, humanism, one which rejects a fundamental aspect of the human person. Accordingly, in Integral Humanism he explores the prospects for a new [[Christendom]], rooted in his philosophical pluralism, in order to find ways [[Christianity]] could inform political discourse and policy in a pluralistic age. In this account he develops a theory of cooperation, to show how people of different intellectual positions can nevertheless cooperate to achieve common practical aims. [[Maritain]]'s political theory was extremely influential, and was a primary source behind the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] movement.

The '''Ipperwash Crisis''' was a dispute over [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] land that took place in [[Ipperwash Provincial Park]], [[Ontario]], in 1995. Several members of the Stoney Point [[Ojibway]] band occupied the park to assert their [[aboriginal land claims|claim to nearby land]] which had been expropriated from them during [[World War II]].  During a violent confrontation, the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] (OPP) killed protester Dudley George. George was unarmed when an OPP officer fired and killed him, believing the stick he held in his hand was a weapon.

The shooting of Dudley George came a day after newly elected [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario premier]] [[Mike Harris]] told the [[Ontario Provincial Police|OPP]] "I want the fucking Indians out of the park", according to a former attorney general.&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harries|first1=Kate|title=Harris uttered slur, Ipperwash inquiry told|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/harris-uttered-slur-ipperwash-inquiry-told/article985817/|accessdate=13 February 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|date=29 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing controversy was a major event in [[Canada|Canadian politics]].  In 2003 a provincial inquiry was started after a change in government.  Former Ontario Chief Justice [[Sidney B. Linden]] led the investigation of events, which was completed in the fall of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/inquiries/ipperwash/report/index.html Ipperwash Inquiry Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1936, the [[Provinces of Canada|Province]] of Ontario created Ipperwash Provincial Park.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pages 4–48&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1942 during [[World War II]], the [[Government of Canada]] wanted reserve land from the [[Stoney Point Band]] to use as a base for military training and offered to buy it for $15 per acre.  They also promised to return the land after the war ended.  The Natives rejected the offer.  Under the [[War Measures Act]], the federal government expropriated the lands from the Stoney Point Reserve and established [[Camp Ipperwash|Military Camp Ipperwash]]. The [[First Nations]] claim that the grounds contain a [[burial]] site.  As of 2010, archaeological surveys have established that such a site does indeed exist.  As early as 1993, while Camp Ipperwash was still being used as a summer training centre for the [[Royal Canadian Army Cadets]], a few natives had occupied portions of the camp and the adjacent piece of land. After the summer of 1993, the government moved the cadet camp to [[CFB Borden]].  There was growing tension about the base at Camp Ipperwash.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

== Occupation of the park ==
On [[Labour Day]] Monday, September 4, 1995, a group of natives started a protest in Ipperwash Provincial Park to draw attention to the decades-old land claims.  After the park closed at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., protestors cut back a fence and by 7:30 had moved vehicles into the park. About thirty-five protestors occupied the park.  The protestors had been threatening occupation since the spring.  The original OPP (Ontario Provincial Police) strategy was to co-occupy the Park peacefully with the First Nations.  But, when a protester from the group smashed the window of a police cruiser, the OPP pulled back from the Park.

In anticipation of the move on the park by the Stoney Point First Nations, the OPP had prepared a contingency plan named Project Maple. The plan stressed "a peaceful resolution" and called for a team of two negotiators to be on call around the clock.

[[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Ontario PC]] [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|M.P.P.]] [[Marcel Beaubien]] was in contact with the police the following day,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.tscript.com/trans/ipperwash/jan_19_06/text.htm Ipperwash Inquiry transcript for January 19, 2006]. Beaubien says that although he couldn't confirm that he'd spoken to Staff Sergeant Lacroix on the morning of the 5th, he had a good relationship with Lacroix and spoke to him frequently. Also, Beaubien's constituency day planner, entered as an inquiry exhibit, confirms the meeting.&lt;/ref&gt; and Beaubien also contacted the office of the [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]], [[Mike Harris]]&lt;ref&gt;Ipperwash Inquiry transcript for January 19, 2006. Beaubien's fax to Bill King in the Premier's office was also entered as an exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to put pressure on the government to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Ipperwash Inquiry transcript for January 19, 2006. Beaubien testified that "Well, basically I'm giving him a heads up that here's a press release that's going to go out. And, you know, when you &amp;ndash; you give somewhat of a quote/unquote, I guess, 'ultimatum', to somebody in the Premier's office, they may not like it. But I felt that, hey, I got to get some attention here".&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 1995, Premier Harris and several government officials met to discuss the Ipperwash protest. The meeting notes concluded that "the province will take steps to remove the occupiers as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacNevin|first=Suzanne|url=http://canada.lilithezine.com/Ipperwash-Returned.html|title=Ipperwash Returned to Native Hands|publisher=The Lilith Gallery Network|website=lilith-ezine.com|date=December 2007|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death of Dudley George ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
On Wednesday, the OPP became concerned about a group of protesters who had wandered outside the Park and into the Sandy Park lot area adjacent to the cottages. The group were allegedly carrying bats and sticks in their hands. The number of protesters has been debated, although police reports indicate a group of up to 8.

There was also misinformation about damage that had been done to a Band Councillor's car by this group of protesters. The damage to the Councillor's car was by a rock thrown by one of the protesters who took exception to an article the Councillor had written disapproving of the occupation. A rumour started that the protesters smashed up the vehicle of a female driver with baseball bats, a report that was later found by Justice Sidney Linden to be false and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipperwashinquiry.ca/report/ Justice Sidney Linden, ''The Ipperwash Inquiry Final Report''], September 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of public safety concerns, the OPP decided to deploy the crowd management unit (CMU) to force the protesters back into the park. The CMU was a riot squad armed with steel batons, shields and helmets. The CMU was backed up by a [[Tactics and Rescue Unit|tactical response unit]] (TRU). The OPP intended a show of force to move the protesters back inside the park.

On Wednesday evening, police riot squads marched down to the Sandy Parking Lot to confront the protesters. As the CMU advanced, the protesters initially retreated and the CMU responded by also retreating. One protester, Cecil Bernard George, approached the police (peacefully according to the protesters, violently according to police reports). George was taken down and surrounded by police and arrested. Protesters attempted to rescue George from the arrest by the police units. This resulted in a riot.

A car and a school bus driven by protesters started out of the park to assist the protesters in their fight against police. According to police officers, there was gunfire from these vehicles, but First Nations protesters have insisted they had no weapons in the park that night. The OPP TRU teams opened fire on the vehicles, resulting in the wounding of two Native protesters and the death of Dudley George, an [[Ojibwa]] protestor. Among the TRU members was Acting Sergeant Ken "Tex" Deane, a senior officer in charge of a four-man sniper team with the job of escorting the force's crowd management unit. Deane was near the park entrance and fired three shots at Dudley George, who was about fifteen feet from the park entrance,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and was hit and badly injured. 

George's sister Carolyn and brother Pierre attempted to take him to the local hospital for treatment but were arrested and delayed by the OPP for over an hour. George was declared dead at 12:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. on September 7, 1995, at nearby Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital, in [[Strathroy, Ontario]]. Anthony O'Brien George (March 17, 1957 – September 7, 1995), nicknamed "Dudley", was the eighth of ten children born to Geneviève ("Jenny") Pauline Rogers George and Reg "Nug" (Reginald Ransford) George.

== Consequences ==

===Criminal investigation===
Acting Sergeant Ken Deane (October 1961 &amp;ndash; February 25, 2006) was convicted of [[criminal negligence]] causing death.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pages 158–198&lt;/ref&gt; Deane's defence was that he had believed that Dudley George was carrying a rifle. The judge rejected Deane's claim, stating that he had invented it "in an ill-fated attempt to disguise the fact that an unarmed man had been shot".&lt;ref name=crash&gt;{{cite news |author=Kate Harries |url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/key-ipperwash-witness-killed-in-highway-crash/article20409136/ |title=Key Ipperwash witness killed in highway crash |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=February 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; He sentenced Deane to a conditional sentence of two years less a day to be served in the community (not in custody) plus 180 days' [[community service]].&lt;ref name=crash/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was to testify at the Ipperwash inquiry in a few weeks.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt;

=== Inquiry ===
The George family repeatedly called on the Ontario and federal governments to launch an inquiry into the events at Ipperwash. A public inquiry was launched on November 12, 2003, after the Ontario Conservatives lost power to the Dalton McGuinty's [[Ontario Liberal Party]] in the [[Ontario general election, 2003|2003 election]].

The public inquiry was funded by the Government of Ontario but conducted by a neutral third party, [[Sidney B. Linden]], pursuant to his powers as commissioner established under the Ontario Public Inquiries Act. The inquiry's mandate was to inquire and report on events surrounding the death of Dudley George. The inquiry was also asked to make recommendations that would avoid violence in similar circumstances in the future. The inquiry was neither a civil nor criminal trial.

During the inquiry, a 17-minute tape recording surfaced that cast new light on the events at Ipperwash. The tape records a conversation between OPP Inspector Ron Fox and Inspector John Carson, the OPP commander overseeing the standoff at Ipperwash, prior to George's death. They discussed Premier Mike Harris's view that the government has "tried to pacify and pander to these people far too long" and to use "swift affirmative action" to remove them from the park.

Other testimony has further put the [[Mike Harris Government|Harris government]] in a bad light. In particular, former Harris aide Deb Hutton repeatedly testified in November, 2005 that she couldn't remember any specific conversations. This led [[Julian Falconer]], acting as counsel for Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto, to pointedly remark on cross-examination that Hutton had used phrases to the effect of "I don't recall" on 134 separate occasions in her in-chief testimony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.tscript.com/trans/ipperwash/nov_23_05/text.htm Ipperwash Inquiry transcript for November 23, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Former Ontario Provincial Attorney General [[Charles Harnick]] also testified that Harris shouted, "I want the fucking Indians out of the park."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.tscript.com/trans/ipperwash/nov_28_05/text.htm Ipperwash Inquiry transcript for November 28, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Later witnesses denied Harnick's evidence, but the Ipperwash Inquiry concluded that Harnick's testimony was credible and that Premier Harris did in fact make the remarks (see Report of the Ipperwash Inquiry, Vol.1, p.&amp;nbsp;363).

Former Premier Mike Harris appeared before the inquiry on February 14, 2006. He testified that he had never said the statement attributed to him by Harnick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/02/14/newipperwash-060214.html | work=CBC News | title=Harris denies using profanity over native protest | date=February 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice Linden "found the statements were made and they were racist, whether intended or not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipperwashinquiry.ca/report/vol_1/pdf/E_Vol_1_Conclusion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229172020/http://www.ipperwashinquiry.ca/report/vol_1/pdf/E_Vol_1_Conclusion.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-29 |df= }} Report of the Ipperwash Inquiry, Volume I, p. 677&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidentiary hearings of the inquiry ended on June 28, 2006. Justice Linden's final report and findings of the inquiry were released on May 31, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/05/30/ipperwash-advancer.html|title=George family braces for Ipperwash inquiry report|date=31 May 2007|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return of land===

On December 20, 2007, the Ontario Provincial government announced its intention to return the 56-hectare Ipperwash Provincial Park to its original owners, the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation.&lt;ref name = "return"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/287702 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Kerry | last=Gillespie | title=Ipperwash land returned to Indians | date=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision did not take immediate effect, as the land will be "co-managed" by the Province and the Chippewas, with consultation from the surrounding community, for the time being. According to [[Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs (Ontario)|Aboriginal Affairs]] Minister [[Michael Bryant (politician)|Michael Bryant]], the land will be fully returned over an unspecified period of time, until the Chippewas have full control.

On Thursday May 28, 2009, Ontario Aboriginal Affairs Minister [[Brad Duguid]] formally signed over control of Ipperwash Park&lt;ref name = "duguidsign"&gt;[http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/Local/2009/05/28/9601951.html "Ipperwash park to re-open in 2010"], ''London Free Press''&lt;/ref&gt; to the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation.

The settlement was finalized on April 14, 2016. Along with a $95&amp;nbsp;million payment, the land was signed over to the Kettle and Stony Point First Nation by Minister of National Defence [[Harjit Sajjan]] and Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs [[Carolyn Bennett]]. Chief Thomas Bressette signed the agreement on behalf of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bridge|first1=Terry|title=Feds’ 1942 land expropriation dispute resolved with land’s return and $95-million payment to Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation|url=http://www.theobserver.ca/2016/04/14/feds-1942-land-expropriation-dispute-resolved-with-lands-return-and-95-million-payment-to-chippewas-of-kettle-and-stony-point-first-nation|website=Sarnia Observer|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irreligion''' (adjective form: ''non-religious'' or ''irreligious'') is the absence, indifference, rejection of, or hostility towards [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite web|url=http://onelook.com/?w=irreligion&amp;ls=a|title=''Irreligion'' as presented in 26 reference works}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

Irreligion may include some forms of [[theism]], depending on the religious context it is defined against; for example, in 18th-century Europe, the [[epitome]] of irreligion was [[deism]],&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Colin. 1971. ''Towards a Sociology of Irreligion''. London:McMillan p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; while in contemporary [[East Asia]] the shared term meaning "irreligion" or "no religion" (無宗教, Chinese pron. ''wú zōngjiào'', Japanese pron. ''mu shūkyō''), with which the majority of East Asian populations identify themselves, implies non-membership in one of the institutional religions (such as Buddhism and Christianity), and not necessarily non-belief in traditional folk religions collectively represented by Chinese ''[[Shendao]]'' and Japanese ''[[Shinto]]'' (both meaning "ways of gods").&lt;ref name="Handbook Japanese"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bestor|editor1-first=Theodore C.|editor2-last=Bestor|editor2-first=Victoria|editor3-last=Yamagata|editor3-first=Akiko|title=Handbook of Japanese Culture and Society|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415436494|pages=66–67|quote=無宗教 ''mushūkyō'', "no religion", in Japanese language and mindset identifies those people who do not belong to organised religion. To the Japanese, the term "religion" or "faith" means organised religions on the model of Christianity, that is a religion with specific doctrines and requirement for church membership. So, when asked "what is their religion", most of the Japanese answer that they "do not belong to any religion". According to [[NHK]] studies, those Japanese who identify with ''mushūkyō'' and therefore do not belong to any organised religion, actually take part in the folk ritual dimension of ''Shinto''. Ama Toshimaru in ''Nihonjin wa naze mushukyo na no ka'' ("Why are the Japanese non-religious?") of 1996, explains that people who do not belong to organised religions but regularly pray and make offerings to ancestors and protective deities at private altars or Shinto shrines will identify themselves as ''mushukyo''. Ama designates "natural religion" what NHK studies define as "folk religion", and other scholars have named "Nipponism" (''Nipponkyō'') or "common religion".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories, 16% of the world's population is not affiliated with a religion, while 84% are affiliated.&lt;ref name="Pew Global"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/ |title=The Global Religious Landscape |author=Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=
December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2060, according to their projections, the number of unaffiliated will increase by over 35 million, but the percentage will decrease to 13% because the total population will grow faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why People With No Religion Are Projected To Decline As A Share Of The World’s Population|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/03/why-people-with-no-religion-are-projected-to-decline-as-a-share-of-the-worlds-population/|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Changing Global Religious Landscape: Babies Born to Muslims will Begin to Outnumber Christian Births by 2035; People with No Religion Face a Birth Dearth |website=Pew Research Center|date=April 5, 2017|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2017/04/05/the-changing-global-religious-landscape/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to cross-cultural studies, secularism is expected to decline throughout the 21st century since religion and fertility are positively related, while secularism and fertility are negatively related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Lee |last2=Hoskin |first2=Anthony W. |last3=Dutton |first3=Edward |last4=Nyborg |first4=Helmuth |title=The Future of Secularism: a Biologically Informed Theory Supplemented with Cross-Cultural Evidence |journal=Evolutionary Psychological Science |date=8 March 2017 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=224–42 |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0090-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinds of irreligion==
* [[Secular humanism]] embraces human reason, ethics, social justice, and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]] while specifically rejecting religious dogma, supernaturalism, pseudoscience, and superstition as the bases of morality and decision making. Secular humanism posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or a god.
* [[Freethought]] holds that positions regarding truth should be formed on the basis of logic, reason, and empiricism, rather than authority, tradition, revelation, or other dogma. In particular, freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional religious belief.
* "[[Spiritual but not religious]]" rejects organized religion as the sole or most valuable means of furthering spiritual growth. In contrast to religion, spirituality has often been associated with the interior life of the individual.
* [[Theological noncognitivism]] is the argument that religious language – specifically, words such as "God" – are not cognitively meaningful. It is sometimes considered as synonymous with [[ignosticism]].
* [[Antireligion]] is opposition to religion of any kind. It can describe opposition to organized religion, religious practices, religious institutions, or specific forms of supernatural worship or practice, whether organized or not.

==Human rights==
In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html |title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18 |work=Minorityrights.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116043952/http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html |archivedate=2015-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views." Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert.&lt;ref name="fdih1"&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|accessdate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right |accessdate=3 March 2009 |last=Davis |first=Derek H. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Western democracies protect the [[freedom of religion]], and it is largely implied in respective legal systems that those who do not believe or observe any religion are allowed [[freedom of thought]].

A noted exception to ambiguity, explicitly allowing non-religion, is Article 36 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] (as adopted in 1982), which states that "No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkhrm.org.hk/english/law/const03.html]
&lt;/ref&gt; Article 46 of China’s [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1978 Constitution]] was even more explicit, stating that "Citizens enjoy freedom to believe in religion and freedom not to believe in religion and to propagate atheism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:People%27s_Republic_of_China_1978_Constitution.pdf?page=41|title=People's Republic of China 1978 Constitution|page=41|year=1978|accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-denominational==
A non-denominational person or organization is not restricted to any particular or specific [[religious denomination]]. The term has been used in the context of various faiths including [[Jainism]],&lt;ref&gt;Jainism in a global perspective. p. 115, Sāgaramala Jaina, Shriprakash Pandey, Pārśvanātha Vidyāpīṭha – 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref&gt;Earth Versus the Science-fiction Filmmakers. p. 70, Tom Weaver – 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoroastrianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Zoroastrianism: An Introduction. p. 227, Jenny Rose – 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unitarian Universalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Resourcewomen|title=Religious Funding Resource Guide|date=2000|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paganism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mammone|first1=Andrea|title=Varieties of Right-Wing Extremism in Europe|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;Models for Christian Higher Education, Richard Thomas Hughes, William B.

==Demographics==
{{main|List of countries by irreligion}}

Although 11 countries listed below have non-religious majorities, it does not mean that the majority of the populations of these countries don′t belong to any religious group. For example, 68% of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] population belongs to the Lutheran Christian Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/statistik |title=Kyrkan i siffror, Swedish Lutheran Christian Church in numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 59% of [[Albanians]] declare themselves as Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Also, though Scandinavian countries have among the highest measures of nonreligiosity and even atheism in Europe, 47% of atheists who live in those countries are still members of the national churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Zuckerman|editor1-first=Phil|title=Atheism and Secularity Vol.2|date=2010|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0313351813|chapter=Ch. 9 Atheism And Secularity: The Scandinavian Paradox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pew 2015 global projection study for religion and nonreligion, projects that between 2010 and 2050, there will be some initial increases of the unaffiliated followed by a decline by 2050 due to lower global fertility rates among this demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010–2050|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Phil Zuckerman]]'s global studies on atheism have indicated that global atheism may be in decline due to irreligious countries having the lowest birth rates in the world and religious countries having higher birth rates in general.&lt;ref name=zucker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Phil|editor1-last=Martin|editor1-first=Michael|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

According to Pew Research Center's 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories, 16% of the world's population is not affiliated with a religion, while 84% are affiliated.&lt;ref name="Pew Global"/&gt; A 2012 [[WIN/GIA|Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association]] report on a poll from 57 countries reported that 59% of the world's population identified as religious person, 23% as not religious person, 13% as "convinced [[atheism|atheists]]", and also a 9% decrease in identification as "religious" when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries.&lt;ref name="GallupInt2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |title=Global Index of Religion and Atheism |publisher=WIN/Gallup International |accessdate=13 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016062403/http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their follow-up report, based on a poll in 2015, found that 63% of the globe identified as religious person, 22% as not religious person, and 11% as "convinced atheists".&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

A World of Atheism: Global Demographics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being non-religious is not necessarily equivalent to being an atheist or agnostic. Pew Research Center's global study from 2012 noted that many of the nonreligious actually have some religious beliefs. For example, they observed that "belief in God or a higher power is shared by 7% of Chinese unaffiliated adults, 30% of French unaffiliated adults and 68% of unaffiliated U.S. adults."&lt;ref name="Pew Global Unaffiliated 12/2012" /&gt; Out of the global nonreligious population, 76% reside in Asia and the Pacific, while the remainder reside in Europe (12%), North America (5%), Latin America and the Caribbean (4%), sub-Saharan Africa (2%) and the Middle East and North Africa (less than 1%).&lt;ref name="Pew Global Unaffiliated 12/2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx |title=Religiously Unaffiliated |last= |first= |work=The Global Religious Landscape |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |date=December 18, 2012 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''nones''' is sometimes used in the U.S. to refer to those who are unaffiliated with any organized religion. This use derives from surveys of religious affiliation, in which "None" (or "None of the above") is typically the last choice. Since this status refers to lack of organizational affiliation rather than lack of personal belief, it is a more specific concept than irreligion. A 2015 [[Gallup poll]] concluded that in the U.S. "nones" were the only "religious" group that was growing as a percentage of the population.&lt;ref name="gallup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/187955/percentage-christians-drifting-down-high.aspx?g_source=Religion&amp;g_medium=lead&amp;g_campaign=tiles|title=Percentage of Christians in U.S. Drifting Down, but Still High}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Itty Achudan Vaidyan''' (forename also spelt as ''Itty Achuden'' in English, and ''Itti Achudem'' in [[Latin]]), who is known to have lived during the second half of the 17th century, was a distinguished [[Ayurvedic]] physician, from the ancient Kollatt family of traditional [[Ezhava]] Ayurvedic ''Vaidyans'' (doctors) of Kerala. The Kollatt family are natives of Kadakkarapally, a coastal village, north-west of [[Cherthala]] town, in [[Kerala]], [[South India]].

==Contributions to Hortus Malabaricus==

Itty Achudan Vaidyan was author while with the three [[Konkani people|Konkani]] [[Brahmanas]], Appu Bhat, Vinayaka Pandit and Ranga Bhat, (contribution is insignificant for their incapacity to connect with nature)of ethno-medical information for the compilation of [[Hortus Malabaricus]], the botanical treatise on the medicinal properties of  flora of 17th century [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] (present day Kerala). The book was compiled by the Dutch Governor of Malabar, [[Hendrik van Rheede]], and published posthumously in Amsterdam between 1678 and 1693.

The ethno-medical information presented in ''Hortus Malabaricus'' was extracted from palm-leaf manuscripts maintained by Itty Achudan Vaidyan, who was introduced to Henrik van Rheede by Veera Kerala Varma the then ruler of the erstwhile state of [[Kochi, India|Kochi]].

Volume 1 of the ''Hortus Malabaricus'' contains an original note by Itty Achudan, dated 20 April 1675, in which he describes his contribution to the work.

Itty Achudan Vaidyan is credited with having dictated the material, in his native [[Malayalam]] language, which was then translated into Latin.  Part of the botanical information was scrutinized by three , Appu Bhat, Vinayaka Pandit and Ranga Bhat, and compared to a Konkani textbook ''“Mahanikhandu”'' (i.e., Sanskrit ''महानिखण्डु'', meaning "the great lexicon") followed by a process of thorough verification, discussion with other scholars and general agreement certified and signed in Konkani language with [[Devanagari]] Sript .

==Kollatt family tradition==

Historically the head medical practitioner of the Kollatt family was known as ''Kollatt Vaidyan''. When a Kollatt Vaidyan died, his practice and title was inherited by his eldest son. The Kollatt Vaidyans maintained a family medical chronicle consisting of several volumes of palm-leaf manuscripts in [[Malayalam]] ''Kolezhuthu'' script. In these manuscripts were recorded names of medicinal plants, methods of preparation and application of drugs and the illnesses for which they were used. The Kollat family chronicle is said to have served as a compendium of ethno-medical knowledge, updated and enriched from time to time by recording the experiences of the individual incumbent Kollat Vaidyan.

==Research on Itty Achudan’s life==
[[File:Itty Achudan 1716 Reference.jpg|300px|right|thumb|'''Listing of the name of Itty Achudan, Doctor, of Chego origin, under the Asia Section of the AD 1716 Historical Directory of Natural History Studies of Swiss Prodomus - Bibliotheca Scriptorum Historiae Naturali omnium Terrae Regionum inservientum Historiae naturalis Helvetiae Prodomus.''']]

[[Calicut University]] [[Emeritus]] and [[botany]] [[taxonomist]] Professor [[K. S. Manilal]], of [[Kozhikode]], devoted over 35 years of focused research, translation and annotation work of the [[Latin]] [[Hortus Malabaricus]] ''(original title of  the book is Hortus Malabaricus, continens Regni Malabarici apud Indos celeberrimi omnis generis Plantas rariores);'' an epic effort, which primarily brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had remained largely inaccessible to English speaking scholars, because the entire text was in  the Latin language. Professor Manilal’s work is also of historic and socio-cultural importance, as it brought insights into the life and times of Itty Achudan and [[Ezhavas]] of 17th century Malabar (broadly [[Kerala]]) society.

The life of Itty Achudan Vaidyan and the Kollat family tradition was largely unknown to the world outside the Kollat family, elders and ancestors, until Professor K. S. Manilal translated with high precision the entire text of Hortus Malabaricus, including the accreditations in the book to Itty Achudan Vaidyan; and Itty Achudan Vaidyan’s own hand written testimonial included in the book in old Malayalam graphic print.

In 1996 Professor K. S. Manilal also authored a separate book in the [[Malayalam]] language; the title which translates as ''A Study on the Role of Itty Achuden in the Compilation of Hortus Malabaricus''.This book was the result of specific additional research undertaken by Professor K. S. Manilal with the objective of collecting factual evidence and clarifying various misconceptions, about the original Hortus Malabaricus, that had crept in through the news media. This book focuses on clarifying matters, such as, the number of pages per volume, the number of pictures, the publication date of the first volume, the publication date of the twelfth volume, and most importantly about the roles played by Itty Achudan and others associated with assisting Hendrik van Rheede with the compilation of Hortus Malabaricus.

==Remnants of Itty Achudan's life==

[[File:Itty Achudan's Vilakku Maadam.jpg|300px|right|thumb|'''Three centuries old''' - '''Itty Achudan Vaidyan's ''Vilakku Maadam'' (lamp house) at the Kollatt house.''']]
Although none of the Kollatt family members today continue the profession of ayurvedic medicine, the Kollatt family house at Kadakkarapally still has an ancient ''vilakku-maadam'' (lamp house) maintained, over the centuries, in honour of Itty Achudan Vaidyan. The family home also has remains of a grove (''kaavu'') including ancient trees and medicinal plants.

The Kollatt family's and Itty Achudan Vaidyan's ethno-medical knowledge legacy remains mostly within the contents of Hortus Malabaricus, which is now translated into the English and Malayalam languages by Professor K. S. Manilal (although the Malayalam version remains to be published).

==Historical honours==

During the 19th century, as a mark of respect [[Carl Ludwig Blume]] immortalized Itty Achudan Vaidyan by naming a genus of plants [[Achudemia]], which has now been included under ''Pilea'' ([[Urticaceae]]).

==Recent honours==

Over the last two decades, the Kollat family members have set up a socio-charitable trust in honour of Itty Achudan Vaidyan. The [[Government of Kerala]] authorities announced that, in honour of Itty Achudan Vaidyan, a portion of Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute in [[Thiruvananthapuram]]  would be set aside to introduce plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5790">'''John Minor Maury''' (1795 &amp;ndash; 23 June 1824) was a lieutenant in the [[United States Navy]]. What has been described as "a very interesting sketch" of his career was given by James Edmonds Saunders in his late 19th-century work ''Early Settlers of Alabama''.&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=James Edmonds|title=Early Settlers of Alabama|year=1899|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com (reprint)|isbn=9780806303086|pages=316–318|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3CX7eQ1qwgC&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;ots=8kxF9MoaBO&amp;dq=%22John%20Minor%20Maury%22&amp;pg=PA318#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Minor%20Maury%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

John's life was saved by David Porter, USN, of the ship, ''Essex''. John and other sailors (five killed by cannibals and two survived) had been marooned on the island of [[Nuku Hiva]] (also spelled "Nukahiva" or "Nookahevah") for two years surviving [[Cannibalism]] between the wars of the Typees against the Happhas. They had been left on the island to gather sandalwood to sell in China when the war with England broke out and blockaded their ship that was to come back for them.

A grandson of [[James Maury]], John was the older brother of oceanographer and naval officer Commodore [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], and entered the United States army as a midshipman when thirteen years old.&lt;ref name=Saunders /&gt; It is reported that "He then had thrilling adventures in the South Seas, was with David Porter in the Essex during the bloody battle with the English at Valparaiso, and afterwards fought with Macdonough in the Battle of Lake Champlain".&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Charles Lee|title=Matthew Fontaine Maury|year=1980|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=9780405130458|pages=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xveu35zy7AkC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;ots=bH1ZmXi0rB&amp;dq=%22John%20Minor%20Maury%22&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Minor%20Maury%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Minor Maury's letters of his adventures in the navy that were sent home are considered to be a major reason why Matthew Maury decided on a naval career.&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;

John Minor Maury was also the father of USA and later CSA Major General [[Dabney Herndon Maury]], who founded (1868-9) the [[Southern Historical Society]], worked on it for 20 years, and was appointed to serve as U.S. Minister to [[Colombia]], [[South America]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]].

Born very near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], to Richard Maury (son of Rev. James Maury) and Diana (Minor) Maury (daughter of General John Minor). John Minor Maury was appointed [[midshipman]] on 16 January 1809 and commissioned Lieutenant 28 June 1811. He married Eliza Herndon Maury, daughter of Elizabeth Brooke and Fontaine Maury. Sons: William Maury (d.y.) and Dabney Herndon Maury. John Minor Maury was named after his ancestor, General John Minor. It is a name that continues through several generations. [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] also had a nephew named (Lieutenant) John Minor Maury who was on the 1854 U S Navy Darien Expedition.

John served on the [[USS Essex (1799)|''Essex'']] and ''Essex Junior'' (captured, ex-''HMS Atlantic.)'' He served on the "Essex Jr." in the Pacific, which brought home the survivors including Captain David Porter of the Essex which was destroyed in battle. John Minor Maury was promoted to first lieutenant, 1811; made flag captain to Commodore David Porter's fleet engaged in suppressing West Indian pirates, 1824.

During the [[War of 1812]], he participated in the [[Battle of Lake Champlain]] under Commander [[Thomas Macdonough]] in the complete victory over the British flotilla, which was captured or sunk. John Minor Maury wrote to a friend in Fredericksburg, '''''"We have gained a glorious victory. I hope the most important result of it will be to confirm the wavering allegiance of New York and Vermont to the Union. They have been threatening to secede unless peace be made with England on any terms!"'''''

Soon after the close of the American war with England, the pirates of the [[West Indies]] had become a terror to all who sailed those seas. Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)]], then the most energetic and successful of our sailors, was ordered to fit out a squadron for their destruction. He was authorized to select his officers for a service so dangerous. His first choice was Lieut. John Minor Maury to be [[flag captain]] of the [[Naval fleet|fleet]]. This officer, like the adjutant general of the army, gave orders for all the movements. The service was active and severe; the combats were desperate; no quarter was asked or given. The pirates were all destroyed or broken up and scattered.
 
As a mark of special approbation of his services, Lieutenant John Minor Maury was sent by Commander David Porter to bear to the [[United States Government]] his report of the complete success of his operations. John sailed in the store ship [[Decoy]], but died of yellow fever in June 1824,&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt; just outside the Capes of Norfolk, and was buried at sea, at the age of twenty eight. John Minor Maury had been [[first lieutenant]] of a frigate; and at twenty-six he was the flag captain of the fleet, and was considered by Tatnall, Buchanan and other compeers to have been the youngest and smartest young sailor in the American navy.

'''Juan Pujol García''' {{postnom|MBE}} (14 February 1912&amp;nbsp;– 10 October 1988) was a Spanish [[double agent]] against [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], when he relocated to Britain to carry out fictitious spying activities for the Germans. He was given the codename '''Garbo''' by the British; their German counterparts codenamed him '''Alaric''' and referred to his non-existent spy network as "Arabal."{{sfn|Talty|2012|p=83}}

After developing a loathing of both the [[Communism|communist]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes in Europe during the [[Spanish Civil War]], Pujol decided to become a spy for the Allies as a way to do something "for the good of humanity".&lt;ref name=MI5/&gt; Pujol and his wife&lt;ref name="Seaman15"&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. p. 56 "Pujol's wife called upon the US Embassy without informing her husband"&lt;/ref&gt; contacted the British and American intelligence agencies, but each rejected his offer.

Undeterred, he created a false identity as a fanatically pro-Nazi Spanish government official and successfully became a German agent. He was instructed to travel to Britain and recruit additional agents; instead he moved to [[Lisbon]] and created bogus reports from a variety of public sources, including a tourist guide to Britain, train timetables, cinema newsreels, and magazine advertisements.&lt;ref name="Seaman56"&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. p. 56 "This imaginary espionage material he constructed with the aid of the following reference documents..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the information would not have withstood close examination, Pujol soon established himself as a trustworthy agent. He began inventing fictitious sub-agents who could be blamed for false information and mistakes.

The Allies finally accepted Pujol when the Germans spent considerable resources attempting to hunt down a fictitious convoy.&lt;ref name=elespia/&gt; Following interviews by Desmond Bristow of Section V MI6 Iberian Section, Juan Pujol was taken on. The family was moved to Britain and Pujol was given the code name "Garbo". Pujol and his handler [[Tomás Harris]] spent the rest of the war expanding the fictitious network, communicating at first by letter to the German handlers and later by radio. Eventually the Germans were funding a network of 27 fictitious agents.

Pujol had a key role in the success of [[Operation Fortitude]], the deception operation intended to mislead the Germans about the timing and location of the [[invasion of Normandy]] in 1944. The false information Pujol supplied helped persuade the Germans that the main attack would be in the {{lang|fr|[[Pas de Calais]]|italic=no}}, so that they kept large forces there before and even after the invasion.

Pujol had the distinction of receiving military decorations from both sides of the war—being awarded the [[Iron Cross]] and becoming a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]].

Pujol was born in [[Barcelona]] on 14 February 1914&lt;ref name=Pujol01&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; (or possibly 28 February 1912)&lt;ref name=Javier/&gt; to Joan Pujol, a Catalan who owned a dye factory, and Mercedes Guijarro García, from the [[Andalusia]]n town of [[Motril]] in the [[Province of Granada]].&lt;ref name=Javier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pujol05&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The third of four children, Pujol was sent at age seven to the [[Maristes Valldemia|Valldemia boarding school]]&lt;ref name=Pujol02&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. pp. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt; run by the [[Marist Brothers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cusachs I Corredor |first=Manuel |title=Col·legi de Valldemia 1855–1888: Dels inicis al seu traspàs als Germans Maristes |journal=Fulls del Museu Arxiu de Santa Maria |volume=85 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=32–47 |issn=0212-9248 |language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Mataró]], twenty miles from Barcelona; he remained there for the next four years. The students were only allowed out of the school on Sundays if they had a visitor, so his father made the trip every week.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

His mother came from a strict Roman Catholic family and took communion every day,&lt;ref name=PujolPage10&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 10 "Her parents were strict Catholics who received Holy Communion every day".&lt;/ref&gt; but his father was much more secular and had liberal political beliefs.&lt;ref name="Seaman42"&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6CAPU9Ln3RYC&amp;pg=PA42 p. 42].&lt;/ref&gt; At age thirteen, he was transferred to a school in Barcelona run by his father's card-playing friend&lt;ref name="Pujol03" /&gt; Father Mossen Josep, where he remained for three years.&lt;ref name=Pujol03&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After an argument with a teacher, he decided that he no longer wished to remain at the school, and became an apprentice at a hardware store.

Pujol engaged in a variety of occupations prior to and after the [[Spanish Civil War]], such as studying animal husbandry at the Royal Poultry School in [[Arenys de Mar]] and managing various businesses, including a cinema.&lt;ref name="Seaman42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pujol03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman30&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman0&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA8 p. 8].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman /&gt;

His father died a few months after the [[Second Republic (Spain)|Second Republic]]'s establishment in 1931, while Pujol was completing his education as a poultry farmer.&lt;ref name=Pujol04&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Pujol's father left his family well-provided for, until his father's factory was taken over by the workers in the run-up to the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name="Seaman42" /&gt;

== Spanish Civil War ==
[[Image:Joan Pujol 7th Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Pujol as a conscript, 1931]]
In 1931, Pujol did his six months of compulsory military service in a cavalry unit, the 7th Regiment of Light Artillery. He knew he was unsuited for a military career, hating horse-riding and claiming to lack the "essential qualities of loyalty, generosity, and honor".&lt;ref name=Pujol19&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Pujol was managing a poultry farm north of Barcelona in 1936 when the [[Spanish Civil War]] began. His sister Elana's fiancé was taken by Republican forces, and later she and his mother were arrested and accused of being [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]. A relative in a trade union was able to rescue them from captivity.&lt;ref name=Pujol24&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

He was called up for service on the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican side]] but opposed the Republican government due to their treatment of his family. He hid at his girlfriend's home until he was captured in a police raid and imprisoned for a week, before being freed via the [[Carlism|Traditionalist]] resistance group ''Socorro Blanco''. They hid him until they could produce fake identity papers that showed him to be too old for military service.&lt;ref name=Pujol25&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 25 "Meanwhile my girlfriend got in touch with one of the units of Socorro Blanco, a secret organization which endeavored to assist those who are being persecuted for idealistic or religious reasons. One of their girl helpers posed as a revolutionary and arranged for me to be let out of prison at dead of night. Free, I join the ever-growing number of those leading a clandestine existence. I went into hiding again."&lt;/ref&gt;

He started managing a poultry farm that had been requisitioned by the local Republican government, but it was not economically viable. The experience with rule by committee intensified his antipathy towards Communism.&lt;ref name=Pujol29&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 29 "I was not prepared to keep being told off while they did nothing to put the business on a sounder economic footing."&lt;/ref&gt;

He re-joined the Republican side using the false papers with the intention to desert as soon as possible, volunteering to lay telegraph cables near the front lines. He managed to desert to the Nationalist side during the [[Battle of the Ebro]] in September 1938.&lt;ref name="Seaman42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA9 p. 9]. "He was a reluctant participant in the Spanish Civil War, being persecuted by the Republicans in his native Catalonia and feeling little sympathy with the Fascist ideology of the Nationalists."&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was equally ill-treated by the Nationalist side, disliking their fascist influences and being struck and imprisoned by his colonel upon Pujol's expressing sympathy with the monarchy.&lt;ref name="Seaman43"&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6CAPU9Ln3RYC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43].&lt;/ref&gt;

His experience with both sides left him with a deep loathing of both fascism and Communism,&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman /&gt; and by extension Nazi Germany and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Historynet&gt;{{cite web|last=Isby|first=David|title=World War II: Double Agent's D-Day Victory|url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-double-agents-d-day-victory.htm|publisher=Historynet.com|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was proud that he had managed to serve both sides without firing a single bullet for either.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman /&gt; After his discharge from the Nationalist army, he met his future first wife, Araceli Gonzalez, in [[Burgos]] and married her in [[Madrid]]; they had one child, Joan Fernando.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garbo93&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7tIDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA93 p. 93].&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==

=== Independent spying ===
In 1938, during the early days of World War ll, Pujol decided that he must make a contribution "for the good of humanity"&lt;ref name=MI5&gt;{{cite web|title=Agent Garbo|url=https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/about-us/who-we-are/mi5-history/world-war-ii/agent-garbo.html|publisher=MI5 Security Service|work=MI5 History|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and to oppose the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime) by helping Britain&amp;nbsp;– which, with its empire, was Germany's only adversary at the time.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seaman43" /&gt;

He initially approached the British three different times,&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt; including through his wife (though Pujol edited her participation out of his memoirs),&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman /&gt; but they showed no interest in employing him as a spy. Therefore, he resolved to establish himself as a German agent before approaching the British again to offer his services as a double-agent.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman /&gt;

Pujol created an identity as a fanatically pro-Nazi Spanish government official who could travel to London on official business;&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt; he also obtained a fake Spanish [[diplomatic passport]] by fooling a printer into thinking Pujol worked for the Spanish embassy in Lisbon.&lt;ref name=Seaman46&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6CAPU9Ln3RYC&amp;pg=PA46 p. 46].&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted Friedrich Knappe-Ratey, an {{lang|de|[[Abwehr]]}} agent in Madrid, codenamed "Frederico".{{sfn|Haufler|2014|p=90}} The {{lang|de|Abwehr}} accepted Pujol and gave him a crash course in espionage (including secret writing), a bottle of [[invisible ink]], a codebook, and £600 for expenses. His instructions were to move to Britain and recruit a network of British agents.&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt;

He moved instead to Lisbon, and&amp;nbsp;– using a tourist's guide to Britain, reference books, and magazines from the Lisbon Public Library, and newsreel reports he saw in cinemas&amp;nbsp;– created seemingly credible reports that appeared to come from London.&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt; He claimed to be travelling around Britain and submitted his travel expenses based on fares listed in a British railway guide. A slight difficulty was that he did not understand the [[British coinage#Pre-decimal coinage|pre-decimal system of currency]] used in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine| first=Joshua|title=Operation Fortitude |publisher=HarperCollins UK|year=2011 |isbn=978-0-00-741324-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBhrEFWA0MgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in pounds, shillings and pence, and was unable to total his expenses. Instead, he simply itemised them, and said that he would send the total later.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman59&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA59 p. 59].&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time he created an extensive network of fictitious sub-agents living in different parts of Britain. Because he had never actually visited the UK, he made several mistakes, such as claiming that his alleged contact in [[Glasgow]] "would do anything for a litre of wine", unaware of Scottish drinking habits or that the UK had not converted to the metric system.&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt; His reports were intercepted via the [[Ultra]] programme, and seemed so credible that the British counter-intelligence service [[MI5]] launched a full-scale spy hunt.&lt;ref name=Historynet /&gt;

In February 1942, either he or his wife (accounts differ)&lt;ref name=Lisbon_Route&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lisbon Route: Entry and Escape in Nazi Europe|page=331|first=Ronald|last=Weber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXOoHJJVdoMC&amp;pg=PA331 |year=2011|publisher=Government Institutes|isbn=978-1-56663-876-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; approached the United States after it had entered the war, contacting U.S. Navy Lieutenant Patrick Demorest in the [[naval attache]]'s office in Lisbon, who recognised Pujol's potential.&lt;ref name=Historynet /&gt; Demorest contacted his British counterparts.&lt;ref name=elespia/&gt;

=== Work with MI5 ===
The British had become aware that someone had been misinforming the Germans, and realised the value of this after the {{lang|de|[[Kriegsmarine]]}} wasted resources attempting to hunt down a non-existent convoy reported to them by Pujol.&lt;ref name=elespia/&gt;

He was moved to Britain on 24 April 1942 and given the code name "Bovril", after [[Bovril|the drink concentrate]]. However, after he passed the security check conducted by [[MI6]] Officer Desmond Bristow, Bristow suggested that he be accompanied by MI5 officer [[Tomás Harris]] (a fluent Spanish speaker) to brief Pujol on how he and Harris should work together. Pujol's wife and child were later moved to Britain.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman30 /&gt;

Pujol operated as a [[double agent]] under the [[Double Cross System|XX Committee]]'s aegis; Cyril Mills was initially Bovril's case officer; but he spoke no Spanish and quickly dropped out of the picture. His main contribution was to suggest, after the truly extraordinary dimensions of Pujol's imagination and accomplishments had become apparent, that his code name should be changed as befitted 'the best actor in the world'; and Bovril became "Garbo", after [[Greta Garbo]].&lt;ref name=TheDeceiversHolt&gt;[[#Holt|Holt (2010)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E569Q7s1CnsC&amp;lpg=PA846 p. 210]. "Mills was initially BOVRIL's case officer; but he spoke no Spanish and quickly dropped out of the picture. His main contribution was to suggest, after the truly extraordinary dimensions of Pujol's imagination and accomplishments had become apparent, that his code name should be changed as befitted 'the best actor in the world'; and BOVRIL became GARBO."&lt;/ref&gt; Mills passed his case over to the Spanish-speaking officer Harris.&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt;

Together, Harris and Pujol wrote 315 letters, averaging 2,000 words, addressed to a post-office box in Lisbon supplied by the Germans. His fictitious spy network was so efficient and verbose that his German [[Handler (spying)|handlers]] were overwhelmed and made no further attempts to recruit any additional spies in the UK, according to the ''Official History of British Intelligence in World War II''.&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt;

[[Image:MI5 Case Officer Tomás (Tommy) Harris 1942.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pujol's case officer at MI5, [[Tomás Harris]]]]
Garbo was unique among Britain's double-agents, having deliberately set out to become one.&lt;ref name=Pujol60&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]] p. 60 "Garbo's case was to be unique because he had specifically set out to become a double-agent."&lt;/ref&gt; The rest were enemy agents who had been discovered and turned, which required that they work under guard.

The information supplied to German intelligence was a mixture of complete fiction, genuine information of little military value, and valuable military intelligence artificially delayed. In November 1942, just before the [[Operation Torch]] landings in [[North Africa]], Garbo's agent on the [[River Clyde]] reported that a convoy of troopships and warships had left port, painted in Mediterranean camouflage. The letter was postmarked before the landings and sent via airmail, but was artificially delayed by British Intelligence in order to arrive too late to be useful. Pujol received a reply stating "we are sorry they arrived too late but your last reports were magnificent."&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt;

Pujol had been supposedly communicating with the Germans via a courier, a [[KLM|Royal Dutch Airlines]] (KLM) pilot willing to carry messages to and from Lisbon for cash. This meant that message deliveries were limited to the KLM flight schedule. In 1943, responding to German requests for speedier communication, Pujol and Harris created a fictitious radio operator. Radio became the preferred method of communication.&lt;ref name=Holt213&gt;[[#Holt|Holt (2010)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E569Q7s1CnsC&amp;pg=PA213 p. 213].&lt;/ref&gt;

On occasion, he had to invent reasons why his agents had failed to report easily available information that the Germans would eventually know about. For example, he reported that his (fabricated) Liverpool agent had fallen ill just before a major fleet movement from that port, and so was unable to report the event.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman96&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96].&lt;/ref&gt; To support this story, the agent eventually 'died' and an [[obituary]] was placed in the local newspaper as further evidence to convince the Germans.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman106&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA106 p. 106].&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans were also persuaded to pay a pension to the agent's widow.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman126&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA126 p. 126].&lt;/ref&gt;

For radio communication, "Alaric" needed the strongest hand encryption the Germans had. The Germans provided Garbo with this system, which was in turn supplied to the codebreakers at [[Bletchley Park]]. Garbo's encrypted messages were to be received in Madrid, manually decrypted, and re-encrypted with an [[Enigma machine]] for transmission to Berlin.&lt;ref name=BBC_News_Magazine&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Jon|title=The piece of paper that fooled Hitler|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12266109|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 January 2012|quote=The Nazis believed Pujol, whom they code named Arabel, was one of their prize assets|date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the codebreakers the best possible source material for a [[chosen-plaintext attack]] on the Enigma key used for the second leg, namely the [[plaintext|original text]].&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman73&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. "The first code which Garbo was given by the Germans for his wireless communications turned out to be the identical code which was currently in use in the German circuits."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation Fortitude ===
In January 1944, the Germans told Pujol that they believed a large-scale invasion in Europe was imminent and asked to be kept informed. This invasion was [[Operation Overlord]], and Pujol played a leading role in [[Operation Fortitude]], the deception campaign to conceal Overlord. He sent over 500 radio messages between January 1944 and [[D-Day]], at times more than twenty messages per day.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman342&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. p. 342 "...which at times amounted to more than twenty messages per day..."&lt;/ref&gt; During planning for the Normandy beach invasion, the Allies decided that it was vitally important that the German leaders be misled into believing that the landing would happen at the [[Strait of Dover]].&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt;

In order to maintain his credibility, it was decided that Garbo (or one of his agents) should forewarn the Germans of the timing and some details of the actual invasion of Normandy, although sending it too late for them to take effective action. Special arrangements were made with the German radio operators to be listening to Garbo through the night of 5/6 June 1944, using the story that a sub-agent was about to arrive with important information. However, when the call was made at 3&amp;nbsp;AM, no reply was received from the German operators until 8&amp;nbsp;AM. Turning this piece of bad luck on its head, Garbo was able to add more operational details to the message when finally sent and thus increase his standing with the Germans. Garbo told his German contacts that he was disgusted that his first message was missed, saying "I cannot accept excuses or negligence. Were it not for my ideals I would abandon the work."&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt;

[[Image:DummyShermanTank.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|An inflatable [[M4 Sherman|M4]] of the [[First U.S. Army Group]]]]
On 9 June—three days after D-day—Garbo sent a message to German intelligence that was passed to [[Adolf Hitler]] and the {{lang|de|[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]}} (OKW; German High Command).&lt;ref name=Historynet /&gt; Garbo said that he had conferred with his top agents and developed an [[order of battle]] showing 75 divisions in Britain; in reality, there were only about 50. Part of the "Fortitude" plan was to convince the Germans that a fictitious formation—[[First U.S. Army Group]], comprising 11 divisions (150,000 men), commanded by General [[George Patton]]—was stationed in the south and east of Britain.&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt;

The deception was supported by fake planes, inflatable tanks, and vans travelling about the area transmitting bogus radio chatter. Garbo's message pointed out that units from this formation had not participated in the invasion, and therefore the first landing should be considered a diversion. A German message to Madrid sent two days later said "all reports received in the last week from Arabel [spy network codename] undertaking have been confirmed without exception and are to be described as especially valuable."{{sfn|Masterman|2013|p=163}} A post-war examination of German records found that, during Operation Fortitude, no fewer than sixty-two of Pujol's reports were included in OKW intelligence summaries.&lt;ref name=Pujol06&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7tIDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196 196] "The post-war analysis demonstrated that, during the FORTITUDE campaign period, no less than sixty-two of his messages were quoted in the German high command's intelligence summaries."&lt;/ref&gt;

OKW accepted Garbo's reports so completely that they kept two armoured divisions and 19 infantry divisions in the Pas de Calais waiting for a second invasion through July and August 1944. The German Commander-in-Chief in the west, Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], refused to allow General [[Erwin Rommel]] to move these divisions to Normandy.&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt; There were more German troops in the Pas de Calais region two months after the Normandy invasion than there had been on D-Day.&lt;ref name=Pujol07&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 197 "Indeed, there were more German forces in that region at the end of June than there had been on D-Day."&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June, Garbo was instructed by the Germans to report on the falling of [[V-1 flying bomb]]s. Finding no way of giving false information without arousing suspicion, and being unwilling to give correct information, Harris arranged for Garbo to be "arrested".&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman259&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA75 p. 75], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA259 p. 259].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman159&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7tIDAAAAMAAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA159 p. 159].&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to duty a few days later, now having a "need" to avoid London, and forwarded an "official" letter of apology from the Home Secretary for his unlawful detention.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman159 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman397&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5y5vwKyW4C&amp;pg=PA397 p. 397].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans paid Pujol US$340,000&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite book |title=I Lie for a Living: Greatest Spies of All Time |last1=Shugaar |first1=Antony |first2=Steven|last2=Guarnaccia|year=2006 |publisher=National Geographic |isbn=978-0-7922-5316-7 |page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oohnZw6xRkkC&amp;pg=PA71}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support his network of agents, which at one point totaled 27 fabricated characters.&lt;ref name=MarkSeaman40&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]].

== Honours ==
As Alaric, he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] Second Class on 29 July 1944, for his services to the German war effort. The award was normally reserved for front-line fighting men and required Hitler's personal authorisation.&lt;ref name=Pujol10&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 159 "With great happiness and satisfaction I am able to advise you today that the Fuhrer has conceded the Iron Cross to you for your extraordinary merits, a decoration which, without exception, is granted only to first-line combatants. For this reason we send you our most sincere and cordial congratulations."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seaman75"&gt;[[#Seaman|Seaman (2004)]]. p. 75, 286.&lt;/ref&gt; The Iron Cross was presented via radio, and Pujol received the physical medal from one of his German handlers after the war had ended.&lt;ref name=Historynet /&gt;

As Garbo, he received an [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] from King [[George VI]], on 25 November 1944.&lt;ref name=NatArchives_MBE&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Service Records Release 25–26 November 2002|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/nov2002.pdf|publisher=The National Archives (UK)|accessdate=10 January 2012|author=The National Archives|quote=25 November Garbo received MBE from King}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis never realised they had been fooled, and thus Pujol earned the distinction of being one of the few&amp;nbsp;– if not the only&amp;nbsp;– to receive decorations from both sides during World War II.&lt;ref name=BBC_News_Magazine /&gt;

== After the war ==
After the Second World War, Pujol feared reprisals from surviving Nazis. With the help of MI5, Pujol travelled to [[Angola]] and faked his death from [[malaria]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=Javier /&gt; He then moved to [[Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia|Lagunillas]], [[Venezuela]], where he lived in (relative) anonymity running a bookstore and gift shop.&lt;ref name=MI5 /&gt;&lt;!-- called 'La Casa del Regalo' - not in reference --&gt;&lt;ref name=vheadline2004&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=21509|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110221638/http://vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=21509 |archivedate=10 November 2005|date=6 June 2004|first=Oliver L.|last=Campbell|title=Juan Pujol, alias Garbo, was the double agent who had convinced the Germans the invasion was to take place at the Pas de Calais and not at Normandy|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=VHeadline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vheadline2002&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=VHeadline|url=http://vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=2571|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110211956/http://vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=2571 |archivedate=10 November 2005|accessdate=21 February 2012|first=Oliver L.|last=Campbell|title=Not Such an Ordinary Man|date=4 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/209063-mejor-espia-mundo-pujol-venezuela El mejor espia del mundo vendia lapices en Venezuela]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pujol divorced his first wife and married Carmen Cilia,&lt;ref name=Lisbon_Route /&gt; with whom he had two sons, Carlos Miguel and Joan Carlos and a daughter who died in 1975 at the age of twenty.&lt;ref name=Javier /&gt; By 1984, Pujol had moved to his son Carlos Miguel's house in La Trinidad, [[Caracas]].&lt;ref name=Javier /&gt;

In 1971, the British politician [[Rupert Allason]], writing under the pen name ''Nigel West'', became interested in Garbo. For several years, he interviewed various former intelligence officers, but none knew Garbo's real name. Eventually, Tomas Harris' friend [[Anthony Blunt]], the Soviet spy who had penetrated MI5, said that he had met Garbo, and knew him as "either Joan or Jose Garcia". Allason's investigation was stalled from that point until March 1984, when a former MI5 officer who had served in Spain supplied Pujol's full name. Allason hired a research assistant to call every J. García in the Barcelona phone book, eventually contacting Pujol's nephew. Pujol and Allason finally met in [[New Orleans]] on 20 May 1984.&lt;ref name=Pujol11&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 7 "Our rendezvous was to be in New Orleans. There on Sunday, 20 May 1984, I first met my quarry."&lt;/ref&gt;

At Allason's urging, Pujol travelled to London and was received by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] at [[Buckingham Palace]], in an unusually long audience. After that he visited the [[Special Forces Club]] and was reunited with a group of his former colleagues, including [[T. A. Robertson]], [[Roger Fleetwood Hesketh]], Cyril Mills and Desmond Bristow.&lt;ref name=Javier /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pujol08&gt;[[#Pujol|Pujol (1985)]]. p. 2 "Late in May 1984 a group of retired intelligence officers gathered in the drawing room of the Special Forces Club to be reunited with a spy reported dead in 1959."&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 40th anniversary of D-Day, 6 June 1984, Pujol travelled to Normandy to tour the beaches and pay his respects to the dead.&lt;ref name=Pujol11 /&gt;

On November 5, 2016, Jürgen and his wife Sabine Merz were attacked&lt;ref name="feb2017" /&gt; while sailing off the coast of the Philippines and Malaysia. During the incident Sabine was shot and killed by the gunmen. Likely, when she tried to fight back with their personal armament on board the yacht. Later, Jürgen would be taken as a hostage into the jungles of southern [[Sulu province]], where Abu Sayyaf is based, and eventually executed.

Finally, on or before 27 February 2017, Jürgen was beheaded after a ransom of 30 million pesos ($600,000) was not met.&lt;ref name="feb2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mar2017"&gt;{{cite web | title = Philippines recovers body of Germany kidnap victim Jurgen Kantner | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/05/philippines-recovers-body-of-germany-kidnap-victim-jurgen-kantner | work = The Guardian | date = 2017-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, in 2008, he and his wife were also taken from their yacht, Rockall, and held captive in [[Somalia]] by [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] for 52 days before their captors freed them in return for a large ransom. After being returned to Germany, Jürgen criticized his rescue, as he believed paying ransoms increased the risk to other sailors of being captured. Jürgen then started planning to recapture his boat back from the Somali pirates who had captured him. He returned by land and air to Somalia, and stole his boat back from the same beach where he was taken to as a captor. &lt;ref name="march2017"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.thelocal.de/20090518/19345 | title = Formerly kidnapped German 'mad' for returning to Somalia | date = 2009-05-19 | work = The Local }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jürgen and Sabine continued to live aboard Rockall and sail for the rest of their lives.

'''Katherine Mary Peyton''' (13 December 1965 – 9 February 2005)&lt;ref name="guardianobit"&gt;{{cite news | title=Obituary: Kate Peyton | work=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/feb/11/broadcasting.guardianobituaries | accessdate=9 February 2012 | date=11 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British journalist and senior producer for the [[BBC]] [[Johannesburg]] bureau from 2002 to 2005. She was killed in a shooting incident in [[Somalia]] whilst reporting on that country's nascent peace process.

==Background==
Peyton was born in [[Bury St Edmunds]], Suffolk.  She was educated at [[Culford School]] and read civil engineering at [[Manchester University]]. However, while at university she found herself increasingly drawn to books and journalism and resolved to make a career as a producer in broadcasting.&lt;ref name="bbcobit"&gt;{{cite news | title=Obituary: Kate Peyton | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4255239.stm | accessdate=9 February 2012 | date=10 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving university she got her first job, at [[BBC Radio Suffolk]], and also worked at [[BBC Radio Merseyside|Radio Merseyside]] and [[BBC Radio Manchester|GMR]]. Her long-term ambition as a young radio producer was eventually to work in South Africa, a country she had first visited with her family in 1979.&lt;ref name="bbcobit" /&gt;

She finally moved to South Africa to work in the 1990s, firstly for the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and the BBC as a freelance producer. She was eventually appointed to the post of Africa Producer for the BBC early in the new millennium. She covered many major stories, including the emerging AIDS crisis in South Africa, the [[Mozambique]] floods and the humanitarian emergency of [[Darfur]].&lt;ref name="guardianobit" /&gt;

==Murder and aftermath==
In February 2005, Peyton was warned by the BBC's Johannesburg bureau chief that there was concern over her perceived lack of focus. When she was asked to travel to Somalia to report on the situation there for the World Service, she saw it as a chance to demonstrate her commitment and improve the chances of her contract being renewed.&lt;ref name="telegraphrisk"&gt;{{cite news | title=BBC journalist Kate Peyton went to Somalia 'because she felt her job was at risk' | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/somalia/3512633/BBC-journalist-Kate-Peyton-went-to-Somalia-because-she-felt-her-job-was-at-risk.html | accessdate=9 February 2012 | date=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kobolds''' are a [[List of fictional humanoid species|fictional species]] featured in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[roleplaying game]]. Aggressive, xenophobic, yet industrious small [[Humanoid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|humanoid]] creatures, kobolds are noted for their skill at building traps and preparing [[ambush]]es.  In the original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game, kobolds were [[goblinoids]], but they have been depicted as [[reptilian humanoid]]s in later editions of the game.

==Publication history==
The kobolds of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' were inspired by the [[Kobold]] [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]]s of [[German folklore]], but, aside from their shared association with mining and their small stature, the creatures have little in common.{{Or|date=July 2008}}

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (1974–1976)===
The kobold was one of the first monsters introduced in the earliest edition of the game, in the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' "white box" set]] (1974),&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], and [[Dave Arneson]]. ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (3-Volume Set) (TSR, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; where they were described simply as similar to [[Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|goblins]], but weaker. Kobolds were further detailed in Supplement II: ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' (1975).

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 1st edition (1977–1988)===
The kobold appears in the first edition ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Gary Gygax | last = Gygax | first = Gary | title = Monster Manual | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is described as a tribal creature with war bands, found in dank, dark places.

The mythology and attitudes of the kobolds are described in detail in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #63 (July 1982), in [[Roger E. Moore]]'s article, "The Humanoids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Roger E. Moore | last = Moore | first = Roger E. | title = The Humanoids | journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] | volume = #63 | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, in Roger Moore's editorial "Tucker's kobolds" in ''Dragon'' #127 (November 1987), a scenario is described where a band of well-prepared kobolds uses [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] to significantly challenge a far more powerful party of adventurers.&lt;ref name="tuckerskobolds"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Roger E. Moore | last = Moore | first = Roger E. | title = Tucker's Kobolds | journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] | volume = #127 | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article "Hey, Wanna Be a Kobold?" by Joseph Clay in ''Dragon'' #141 (January 1989), kobolds, [[xvart]]s, [[Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|goblins]], and [[Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcs]] were presented as player character races along with two new character classes the "Shaman" and the "Witch Doctor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Joseph Clay | last = Clay | first = Joseph | title = Hey, Wanna Be a Kobold? | journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] | volume = #141 | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (1977–1999)===
This edition of the ''D&amp;D'' game included its own version of the kobold, in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set]]'' (1977, 1981, 1983).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], and [[Dave Arneson]] [1974], edited by [[John Eric Holmes|J. Eric Holmes]]. ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set'' (TSR, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], and [[Dave Arneson]] [1974], edited by [[Tom Moldvay]]. ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set'' (TSR, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], and [[Dave Arneson]] [1974], edited by [[Frank Mentzer]]. ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Set 1: Basic Rules'' (TSR, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; The kobold was featured as a player character race in the ''Orcs of Thar'' gazetteer (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Heard, Bruce | title = [[The Orcs of Thar]] | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | year = 1989 | authorlink = Bruce Heard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobolds were also later featured in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game (1991 boxed set)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game]]'' set (1991), the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia'' (1991),&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron Allston|Allston, Aaron]], [[Steven Schend|Steven E. Schend]], [[Jon Pickens]], and Dori Watry. ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'' (TSR, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game'' set (1994), and the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure Game]]'' set (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Slavicsek|Slavicsek, Bill]].

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition (1989–1999)===
The kobold appears first in the ''Monstrous Compendium Volume One'' (1989), which also introduced the '''urd''', a winged version of the kobold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = David "Zeb" Cook | last = Cook | first = David | title = Monstrous Compendium Volume One | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | year = 1989|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kobold and urd are reprinted in the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Stewart, Doug | title = [[Monster Manual|Monstrous Manual]] | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | year = 1993 | authorlink = Doug Stewart (game designer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kobold is detailed as a playable character race in ''The [[Complete Book of Humanoids]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Bill Slavicsek | last = Slavicsek | first = Bill | title = The [[Complete Book of Humanoids]] | publisher = TSR | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kobold is later presented as a playable character race again in ''[[Player's Option: Skills &amp; Powers]]'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Niles|Niles, Douglas]] and [[Dale Donovan]]. ''[[Player's Option: Skills &amp; Powers]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3.0 edition (2000–2002)===
The kobold appears in the ''Monster Manual'' for this edition (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Skip Williams | last = Williams | first = Skip |authorlink2=Jonathan Tweet|last2=Tweet|first2=Jonathan |authorlink3=Monte Cook|last3=Cook|first3=Monte| title = [[Monster Manual]] | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3.5 edition (2003–2007)===
The kobold appears in the revised ''Monster Manual'' for this edition (2003).

The '''aquatic kobold''', the '''arctic kobold''', the '''desert kobold''', the '''earth kobold''', and the '''jungle kobold''' were all introduced in ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[[Andy Collins (game designer)|Collins, Andy]], [[Jesse Decker]], [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]], and Rich Redman. ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The kobold was detailed in ''Dragon'' #332 (June 2005), in the "Ecology of the Kobold".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink =  | last = Smith | first = Mat | title = The Ecology of the Kobold | journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] | volume = #332 | publisher = Paizo Publishing | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 4th edition (2008–2014)===

The rules for this edition allow kobolds to shift easily around enemies and grant them bonuses when they mob together against a single target.  The backgrounds states they tend to form cults that worship local dragons, and sometimes serve them if the dragon deigns to take notice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Mearls|Mearls, Mike]], [[Stephen Schubert]], and [[James Wyatt (game designer)|James Wyatt]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the article "Creature Incarnations: Kobolds" in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' issue 364 contains a variety of additional kobolds, including the '''kobold chieftain''' (level 5 soldier [leader]), '''kobold wild mage''' (controller), '''kobold piker''' (level 2 brute), '''kobold spiker''' (level 3 controller), '''kobold vermin handler''' (level 3 artillery), '''kobold rat master''' (level 4 elite soldier), '''kobold horde''' (level 6 skirmisher), and '''kobold war priest''' (level 5 controller).

The kobold appears in the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' for this edition (2014), as well as the '''winged kobold''' (or 'urd'). Kobolds in this edition suffer a penalty when exposed to sunlight, but are granted bonuses when they mob up against a single opponent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Mearls|Mearls, Mike]], [[Stephen Schubert]], and [[James Wyatt (game designer)|James Wyatt]]. ''p.195, [[Monster Manual]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
In the 3rd edition of the game, kobolds are distantly related to [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragons]],&lt;ref name=RaceDragon&gt;[[Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel|Kestrel, Gwendolyn F.M.]], [[Jennifer Clarke Wilkes|Wilkes, Jennifer Clarke]], [[Kolja Raven Liquette|Liquette, Kolja Raven]]. ''[[Races of the Dragon]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  and are often found serving them as minions. Kobolds speak a version of the Draconic tongue, with a yipping accent. In their original appearance in the canon, kobolds were described as dog-like humanoids with ratlike tails, horns and hairless scaly skin, and were not associated with dragons. They were called [[goblinoid]]s, although the word had a broader sense than it was later to acquire; in the ''[[Monster Manual|Monstrous Compendium]]'' series and ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' the goblinoid category included not only goblins, hobgoblins and bugbears but also orcs, [[xvart]]s and gremlins. From the third edition, the term "goblinoid" has been reserved for goblins, hobgoblins, [[norker]]s, and similar creatures. Kobolds are much more explicitly reptilian in current editions, though they were egg-layers as far back as first edition ''AD&amp;D''. The ''[[Greyhawk Player's Guide]]'' said they have "certain features that are both reptilian and doglike."

Kobolds are omnivores with no scruples about what or whom they eat. They can digest bark, dirt, leather, eggshells, or their own younger siblings if they are desperate enough.

Kobolds are extremely fecund egg-layers, having the highest birth rate (and death rate) of all humanoid species. A female kobold will lay a clutch of hard-shelled eggs two weeks after fertilization; the eggs must be incubated for an additional 60 days before hatching. Kobolds reach maturity by the age of eight or nine and are considered "great wyrms" by the age of 121. They live up to 135 years. While they do bond with one another, they have no concept of monogamy.

Kobolds have an extreme hatred for [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]], with whom they compete for the same areas and mining rights, as well as [[Pixie (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|pixies]], [[Brownie (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|brownies]], and [[Sprite (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|sprites]]. They are often at war with goblins, and the numerous kobold-goblin wars help keep the populations of both races down to a manageable level. [[Xvart]]s often act as intermediaries between kobolds and goblins, usually dominating and taking out their aggression on the kobolds.

===Environment===
Kobolds are found in all climates. They seem to prefer dark, damp underground lairs and overgrown forests. They are industrious miners and if left to their own devices can carve out massive tunnel complexes, which they quickly fill to capacity thanks to their rapid rate of reproduction – which would explain their use as cannon fodder enemies.

Many kobold lairs are guarded by boars or giant weasels. Their lairs are fluid, with new tunnels continually being excavated and old ones collapsed. Most lairs include a temple or shrine, a kiln, an egg hatchery, and a place for storing food. Larger ones also contain places for cultivating food and livestock.

===Typical physical characteristics===
Kobolds vary in height between 2'-2'8" in 3.5 edition, and 3'6"-4'0" in 4th edition, with scaly, hairless hides, reptilian heads, and tails, and weigh over {{convert|30|lb}} in 3.5 edition and about {{convert|40|lb}} in 4th edition. Males are about three inches taller and ten pounds heavier than most females. Their hides are typically a rust-brown or reddish black color, with ivory-colored horns. Their heads are described as dog-like, but in recent editions they are illustrated as looking more like [[crocodile]]s. Their eyes glow red, and they can see accurately even in lightless conditions up to 60 feet away. Kobolds are described as smelling like a cross between damp dogs and stagnant water.

Unlike dragons, kobolds are cold-blooded. The scales covering their bodies are like that of an iguana or other large lizard. The scales that cover their tails are very fine, so that they resemble the naked tails of rats. Kobolds lose and gain new teeth throughout their lives, often saving and making necklaces from them. Kobolds favor raggedy-looking red or orange clothing made from leather or the silk of giant spiders. They never wear shoes, but they are fond of jewelry and other ornamentation.

Kobolds shed their skin about once a season, in patches, over the course of a week. They keep themselves well-groomed, regularly polishing their horns, claws, and teeth.

===Alignment===
Kobolds are usually lawful evil. Exceptions are more likely to be non-evil than non-lawful. In the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|4th edition of the game]], their alignment is given simply as evil, though this implies orderliness in the 4th edition [[Alignment (role-playing games)#Dungeons &amp; Dragons|alignment system]]. Neutral (unaligned) kobolds also exist, usually the servants of good or unaligned metallic dragons.&lt;ref&gt;''Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
Kobold society is influenced by their lawful evil alignment. They will plan and dig mines industriously, while laying cruel traps for interlopers. If they must confront an enemy, they will mass their troops for an ambush. Among the monstrous humanoids, they are known for cunning plans; unlike many, they also share those plans among the tribe. General plans and goals are common knowledge, and detailed plans are shared with all who ask, to allow them to work fruitfully for the good of the tribe.  Kobolds have a natural hatred of other non-draconic creatures because of mistreatment of their race.

Kobolds have specialized laborers, yet the majority of kobolds are miners. The most coveted careers are trapmaker, sorcerer, caretaker, and warrior. Kobolds typically apprentice in their chosen profession at the age of three. A kobold's job may change over the years based on the needs of the tribe. Kobold tribes are [[Gerontocracy|gerontocracies]], ruled by their eldest member, who is known as the All-Watcher. Often this leader is a powerful sorcerer. Kobold laws may change along with their leaders. Kobolds prefer exile to execution, and in some disputes, kobolds tribes will split in order to spread their kind over a larger region. Kobolds often lay eggs in a common nest, with [[Allomothering|specialized foster parents]] to watch over the eggs and wyrmlings (young under one year).

Kobold society is tribal with war bands based on clans. As many as ten families can be part of a clan. Each clan is responsible for patrolling a ten-mile radius. The most numerous kobold tribes include the Torturers, the Impalers, the Gougers, the Cripplers, and the Mutilators.

===Religion===
The main deity of the kobolds is [[Kurtulmak]], the god of war and mining. The other main god worshipped by kobolds is [[Gaknulak]], the god of protection, stealth, trickery, and traps.  A lesser-known kobold demigod is [[Dakarnok]]. Individual kobolds and kobold tribes may worship other deities of the draconic pantheon; [[Tiamat (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Tiamat]] and [[Io (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Io]] often play a significant role in their creation myths. Kobolds and [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]] have an instinctual hate of each other because of a "prank" played upon Kurtulmak by the gnomish deity [[Garl Glittergold]]. According to some kobold myths, Garl collapsed Kurtulmak's cave because the gnome god saw that they were likely to become the dominant race in the world. The draconic god Io offered Kurtulmak the chance to become the god of his race or to give him the strength to clear the mine. Kurtulmak chose to lead his race in the form of a god. The gnomes, naturally, have their own version of the myth which casts their god in a considerably better light.

Clerics of Kurtulmak are known as the Eyes of Kurtulmak. They rarely live long enough to become chieftains, but they have a great deal of power and influence, serving as mine supervisors and directing the tribe toward "divinely inspired" goals. Organized worship services are almost nonexistent, but most kobolds recite small prayers throughout the day.

Many kobolds believe in reincarnation, which Kurtulmak may use as either reward or punishment depending on one's service to one's tribe. One of the duties of a cleric is to watch over eggs and hatchlings thought to be the reincarnation of a distinguished kobold.

===Language===
Kobolds speak a version of the Draconic tongue, with a yipping accent (their voices are said to resemble the sound of small dogs barking). Some also learn to speak Common, Goblin, Orcish, and Undercommon.

The written form of Draconic was originally developed by kobolds in the service of dragons, as dragons themselves see little reason to write.

===Notable kobolds===
*[[Deekin|Deekin Scalesinger]] is a Kobold bard who is an NPC minion found in several of the expansions to ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/deekin_bigadventure.html| title=Neverwinter Nights: Deekin's Big Adventure| publisher=Bioware| accessdate=2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deekin is a shopkeeper in ''[[Neverwinter Nights 2]]'' as well.

Tucker's kobolds became a famous part of Dungeons &amp; Dragons lore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = EN World | authorlink = EN World| title = Tucker's Kobolds| work = discussion| publisher = EN World| date = 2004-05-25| url = http://www.enworld.org/showthread.php?t=89222| accessdate = 2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; often referred to as an example of how cunning and local knowledge can be used by physically weak opponents to overcome much more powerful adversaries.
*In ''[[Eye of the Beholder (video game)|Eye of the Beholder]]'', the kobolds are led by an undead kobold named Albrik.

==Kobold subraces==

===Urds===
''Urds'' are a subrace of winged kobolds, who otherwise maintained separate societies from standard kobolds. Urds worship the deity [[Kuraulyek]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sargent, Carl]]. ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

In third edition, urds seem to have been replaced with a subset of kobolds known as the ''dragonwrought kobolds'', who occasionally have wings or other draconic qualities, and hold an elevated status in kobold society.

===Other subraces===
The ''aquatic kobold'', the ''arctic kobold'', the ''desert kobold'', the ''earth kobold'', and the ''jungle kobold'' were all introduced in ''Unearthed Arcana'' (2004).

==History==
Kobolds have a scattered history, turning up in isolated regions with no apparent connection to one another. Even given the often nomadic nature of kobolds, divine agency is often evoked to explain how kobolds spread so far. Kobolds are thought to have begun their existence as the servants of dragons.

Unlike goblins, [[Hobgoblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|hobgoblins]], and [[Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcs]], no [[Suloise|Suel]] name for kobolds is given in ''[[The Scarlet Brotherhood]]'', suggesting they were not known in the ancient [[Suel Imperium]].

==Other publishers==
The kobold is fully detailed in [[Paizo Publishing]]'s book ''Classic Monsters Revisited'' (2008), on pages 28–33.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Baur|Baur, Wolfgang]], [[Jason Bulmahn]], Joshua J. Frost, [[James Jacobs (game designer)|James Jacobs]], Nicolas Logue, Mike McArtor, James L. Sutter, [[Greg A. Vaughan]], Jeremy Walker. ''Classic Monsters Revisited'' (Paizo, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Paizo also published ''Kobolds of Golarion'' a 32-page booklet detailing Kobold sociology, physiology and psychology, along with several variant traits, feats and class archetypes, while also introducing several new spells, traps and items.

'''Mary''' ({{lang-fr|Marie}}; {{lang-nl|Maria}}; 13 February 1457 – 27 March 1482), [[Duke of Burgundy|Duchess of Burgundy]], reigned over many of the territories of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], now mainly in [[France]] and the [[Low Countries]], from 1477 until her death. As the only child of [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his wife [[Isabella of Bourbon]], she inherited the duchy upon the death of her father in the [[Battle of Nancy]] on 5 January 1477.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Richard, ''Charles the Bold: the last Valois Duke of Burgundy'', (Boydell Press, 2004), 127&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the great prosperity of many of the territories that comprised the duchy, Mary was often referred to as '''Mary the Rich''' (though this is not usual in English).

==Early years==
Mary of Burgundy was born in [[Brussels]] at the ducal castle of [[Coudenberg]], to [[Charles the Bold]], then known as the Count of Charolais, and his wife [[Isabella of Bourbon]]. Her birth, according to the court chronicler [[Georges Chastellain]], was attended by a clap of thunder ringing from the otherwise clear twilight sky. Her godfather was [[Louis XI of France|Louis, Dauphin of France]], in exile in Burgundy at that time; he named her for his mother [[Marie of Anjou]]. Reactions to the child were mixed: the baby's grandfather, Duke [[Philip the Good]], was unimpressed, and "chose not to attend the [baptism] as it was only for a girl", whereas her grandmother [[Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella of Portugal]] was delighted at the birth of a granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Aline, ''Isabel of Burgundy''&lt;/ref&gt; Her illegitimate aunt [[Anna van Bourgondië|Anne]] was assigned as her governess.

==Heir presumptive==

Philip the Good died in 1467 and Mary's father assumed control of the duchy of Burgundy. Since her father had no living sons at the time of his accession, Mary became his [[heir presumptive]]. Her father controlled a vast and wealthy domain made up of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], the [[Free County of Burgundy]], and the majority of the [[Low Countries]]. As a result, her hand in marriage was eagerly sought by a number of princes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The first proposal was received by her father when she was only five years old, in this case to marry the future King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]].  Later she was approached by [[Charles de Valois, Duc de Berry|Charles, Duke of Berry]], the younger brother of King Louis XI of France, who was intensely annoyed and attempted to prevent the necessary papal dispensation for [[consanguinity]].

[[File:Maria van Bourgondie dubbel vuurijzer 1478 Vlaanderen.jpg|thumb|left|Flanders, double Briquet, struck under Mary of Burgundy in 1478]]

As soon as Louis succeeded in producing a male heir who survived infancy, the future King [[Charles VIII of France]], Louis wanted him to be the one to marry Mary, even though he was thirteen years younger than Mary was.  [[Nicholas I, Duke of Lorraine]], was a few years older than Mary and controlled a duchy that lay alongside Burgundian territory, but his plan to combine his domain with hers was ended by his death in battle in 1473.

==Reign==

Mary assumed the rule of her father's domains upon his defeat in battle and death on 5 January 1477. King Louis XI of France seized the opportunity to attempt to take possession of the Duchy of Burgundy proper and also the regions of [[Franche-Comté]], [[Picardy]] and [[Artois]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The king was anxious that Mary should marry his son Charles and thus secure the inheritance of the [[Low Countries]] for his heirs,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; by force of arms if necessary. Burgundy, fearing French military power, sent an [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] to France to negotiate a marriage between Mary and the six-year-old Dauphin (later King Charles VIII), but returned home without a betrothal; the French king's demands of cession of territories to the French crown were deemed unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Koenigsberger"&gt;{{cite book|first=H. G.|last=Koenigsberger|title=Monarchies, States Generals and Parliaments: The Netherlands in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2V1dbsvEWnkC|isbn=9780521803304}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}}

===The Great Privilege===
Mary was compelled to sign a charter of rights known as the [[Great Privilege]] in [[Ghent]] on 10 February 1477 on the occasion of her formal recognition as her father's heir (the "[[Joyous Entry]]").  Under this agreement, the provinces and towns of [[Flanders]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and [[Count of Holland|Holland]] recovered all the local and communal rights that had been abolished by the decrees of the dukes of Burgundy in their efforts to create a centralized state on the French model out of their disparate holdings in the Low Countries. In particular, the [[Parliament of Mechelen]] (established formally by Charles the Bold in 1470) was abolished and replaced with the pre-existing authority of the [[Parliament of Paris]], which was considered an amenable counterweight to the encroaching centralization undertaken by both Charles the Bold and Philip the Good. The duchess also had to undertake not to declare war, make peace, or raise taxes without the consent of these provinces and towns and only to employ native residents in official posts.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Such was the hatred of the people for the old regime that in spite of the duchess's tears and entreaties, two of her father's most influential councilors, the Chancellor Hugonet and the [[Guy of Brimeu|Sire d'Humbercourt]], were executed in Ghent after it was discovered that they were in correspondence with the king of France.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Marriage===
[[File:Marriage of Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian of Austria.jpg|thumb|Marriage of Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian of Austria]]
Mary soon made her choice among the many suitors for her hand by selecting [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Maximilian of Austria]], the future Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, who became her co-ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Murray Kendall, ''Louis XI'', (W.W.Norton Co. Inc, 1971), 319.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage took place at Ghent on the evening of 16 August 1477.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Heinz-Dieter|last=Heimann|title=Die Habsburger: Dynastie und Kaiserreiche|isbn=3-406-44754-6|pages=38–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's marriage into the [[House of Habsburg]] initiated two centuries of contention between France and the Habsburgs (later of Kings of Spain as well as Holy Roman Emperors), a struggle that climaxed with the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in the years 1701–1714.

In the Netherlands, affairs now went more smoothly; the French aggression was temporarily checked, and internal peace was in large measure restored.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
In 1482, a falcon hunt in the woods near [[Wijnendale Castle]] was organised by [[Adolph of Cleves, Lord of Ravenstein]], who lived in the castle. Mary loved riding and was hunting with Maximilian and knights of the Court when her horse tripped, threw her in a ditch, and then landed on top of her, breaking her back.  She died several weeks later, on 27 March, from internal injuries, having made a detailed will. She was buried in the [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges|Church of Our Lady in Bruges]] on April 3, 1482.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://visitbruges.be/location/must-sees/onze-lieve-vrouwekerk-church-of-our-lady#| title = ONZE-LIEVE-VROUWEKERK (CHURCH OF OUR LADY)| accessdate = March 13, 2014| publisher = VisitBruges.com| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140313140732/http://visitbruges.be/location/must-sees/onze-lieve-vrouwekerk-church-of-our-lady| archivedate = March 13, 2014| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her 2-year-old daughter, [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]], was sent in vain to France, to marry the Dauphin, in an attempt to please Louis XI and persuade him not to invade the territories owned by Mary.

Louis was swift to re-engage hostilities with Maximilian and forced him to agree to the [[Treaty of Arras (1482)|Treaty of Arras of 1482]], by which [[Franche-Comté]] and [[Artois]] passed for a time to French rule, only to be recovered by the [[Treaty of Senlis]] of 1493, which established peace in the Low Countries. Mary's marriage into the House of Habsburg would prove to be a disaster for France, since the Burgundian inheritance would later bring it into conflict with Spain and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

==Family==
[[Image:Grafmarg.JPG|thumb|right|Mary's tomb effigy in the [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges|Church of Our Lady]], Bruges.]]
Mary's son Philip succeeded to her dominions under the guardianship of his father.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Mary, duchess of Burgundy|volume=17||page=824|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her children were as follows:
* [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] (22 July 1478 – 25 September 1506), who succeeded his mother as Philip IV of Burgundy and became Philip I of Castile through his marriage to [[Joanna of Castile]] (known to history as "Juana la Loca").&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Habsburg Monarchy, 1618–1815'', (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Margaret of Habsburg (1480-1530)|Margaret]] (10 January 1480 – 1 December 1530), married to first to [[Juan, Prince of Asturias]], the son and heir of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], and secondly to [[Philibert II, Duke of Savoy]].
* Francis (2 September 1481 – 26 December 1481).

'''Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze''' (2 February 1885 – 31 October 1925) was a [[Bolshevik]] leader during and just prior to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. He was a major Red Army commander in the [[Russian Civil War]] and is best known for defeating [[Pyotr Wrangel|Baron Wrangel]] in Crimea.

==Life and political activity==
[[File:Mikhail Frunze Sophia Frunze 1917.jpg|left|thumb|Mikhail Frunze and his wife Sophia Frunze. Minsk 1917.]]
Frunze was born in [[Bishkek|Pishpek]] (present-day Bishkek in [[Kyrgyzstan]]), then a small [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] garrison town in the [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] part of [[Russian Turkestan]] ([[Semirechye Oblast]]), to a [[Romanian people|Romanian]]&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CMloAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22part+Romanian%22&amp;dq=%22part+Romanian%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|page=194|title=Lenin: A Political Life: Volume 3: The Iron Ring|year=1995|author=[[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] |publisher=''Indiana University Press''|isbn=978-0253351814|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; para-medic ([[feldsher]]) (originally from the [[Kherson Governorate]]) and his [[Russians|Russian]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin McCauley, ''Who's Who in Russia Since 1900'', [[Routledge]], 1997, {{ISBN|0-415-13897-3}}, p. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; wife.

At the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Second Congress]] of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Social Democratic Party Labour Party]] in [[London]] (1903), during the ideological split between [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Julius Martov]], the two main party [[leader]]s, over party tactics (Martov argued for a large party of activists, whilst Lenin wanted a small group of [[professional revolutionaries]] with a large fringe group of sympathisers), Frunze sided with Lenin's majority, the so-called ''Bolsheviks'' ("majoritarians"), opposed to Martov's minority, the ''[[Mensheviks]]'' (or "minoritarians").

Two years after the Second Congress Frunze became an important leader in the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Revolution]], at the head of striking [[textile]] workers in [[Shuya, Ivanovo Oblast|Shuya]] and [[Ivanovo]]. Following the disastrous end of the movement, Frunze was arrested in 1907 and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], spending several months on [[death row]] awaiting his execution.&lt;ref&gt;Триумф и Трагедия - И. В. Сталин: политический портрет. (Triumph and Tragedy - I. V. Stalin : A Political Portrait) Дмитрий Волкогонов ([[Dmitri Volkogonov]]). Book 1, Part 1, PP. 127. Новости Publications. Moscow. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; but he was later reprieved and his sentence was commuted to life at [[Penal labour|hard labour]]. After 10 years in [[Siberia]]n prisons, Frunze escaped to [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]], where he became editor of the Bolshevik weekly newspaper ''Vostochnoe Obozrenie'' (Eastern Perspective).

During the [[February Revolution]], Frunze headed the [[Minsk]] civilian [[militia]] before his election as president of the [[Belarus|Byelorussian]] [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]. He later went to [[Moscow]] and led an armed force of workers to aid in the struggle for control of the city.

==Russian Civil War==
[[File:Béla Kun, Jacques Sadoul, Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Frunze, Sergey Gusev 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Béla Kun]], [[Jacques Sadoul (politician)|Jacques Sadoul]], [[Leon Trotsky]], Mikhail Frunze and [[Sergey Ivanovich Gusev|Sergey Gusev]]. Kharkiv Ukraine 1920.]]
After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Frunze became [[Political commissar|Military Commissar]] for the [[Ivanovo|Ivanovo-Voznesensk]] Province in 1918. In the course of the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917-1922, he was appointed as head of the Southern Army Group of the {{Interlanguage link multi| Red Army Eastern Front | ru |3= Восточный фронт РККА}} (March 1919). After Frunze's troops defeated Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]] and the [[White movement|White Army]] in [[Omsk]], [[Leon Trotsky]] (the head of the [[Red Army]]) gave overall command of the Eastern Front to him (19 July 1919). Frunze went on to rid his native [[Turkestan]] of [[Basmachi Revolt|Basmachi insurgents]] and of [[White Army | White]] troops. He captured [[Khiva]] in February and [[Bukhara]] in September 1920.

In November 1920, Frunze's army retook the [[Crimea]] and managed to push White general [[Pyotr Wrangel]] and his troops out of Russia. He also led, as commander of the southern front, the destruction of [[Nestor Makhno]]'s [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement in [[Ukraine]] and the [[nationalist]] movement of [[Symon Petliura]].

In December 1921, Frunze visited Ankara during [[Turkish War of Independence]] as an ambassador of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and established Turkish - Soviet relations. [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]] valued him as an ally and a friend, to the extent that he placed a statue of Frunze as a part of the [[Republic Monument]] at the [[Taksim Square]], in Istanbul.

In 1921, he was elected to the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Bolshevik Party]], on 2 June 1924 became candidate member of the [[13th Politburo of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Politburo]] and in January, 1925, became the Chairman of the [[Revolutionary Military Council]]. Frunze's support of [[Grigory Zinoviev]] brought him into conflict with [[Joseph Stalin]], one of Zinoviev's chief opponents, with whom they had previously been on amiable terms, owing to the respect that Stalin studiously displayed at that period towards his fellow "old guard" revolutionary and former prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Триумф и Трагедия - И. В. Сталин: политический портрет. (Triumph and Tragedy - I. V. Stalin : A Political Portrait) Дмитрий Волкогонов [[Dmitri Volkogonov]]. Book 1, Part 1, PP. 127. Новости Publications. Moscow. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Frunze had been noted among communist leaders as possessing a very creative and almost unorthodox view on matters of implementation and policy. He gained the respect and admiration of his comrades thanks to his fearless and successful pursuit of complicated military objectives and his endurance during the illegality period of the communist party. He had been considered as a potential successor to Lenin, due to his strength in both theoretical and practical matters of advancing the Communist party agenda, and his seeming lack of personal ambition separate from the party.&lt;ref&gt;Триумф и Трагедия - И. В. Сталин: политический портрет. (Triumph and Tragedy - I. V. Stalin : A Political Portrait) Дмитрий Волкогонов [[Dmitri Volkogonov]]. Book 1, Part 1, PP. 127. Новости Publications. Moscow. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frunze was suffering from a chronic [[gastric ulcer|ulceration]], and although it had been suggested to him many times that he undergo surgery, he tended to favour more conservative treatments. After an especially severe episode in 1925, Frunze was hospitalised. Stalin and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] both came to visit him, and impressed on him the need for an operation.&lt;ref name="izv"/&gt;
[[File:Mikhail Frunze funeral Nov 3 1925.jpg|thumb|Mikhail Frunze funeral 3 November 1925]]
Not long before his death, Frunze wrote to his wife:  "At present I am feeling absolutely healthy, and it seems ridiculous to even think of, and even more-so to undergo an operation. Nevertheless, both party representatives are requiring it."&lt;ref&gt;Триумф и Трагедия - И. В. Сталин: политический портрет. (Triumph and Tragedy - I. V. Stalin : A Political Portrait) Дмитрий Волкогонов [[Dmitri Volkogonov]]. Book 1, Part 1, PP. 128. Новости Publications. Moscow. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frunze died on 31 October 1925. There has been speculation that Stalin or another rival within the party secretly ordered his death, but there is no evidence to support this.&lt;ref&gt;V. Topolyansky. ''Blow from the past.'' (Russian: В. Торолянский. ''Сквозняк из прошлого.'') Novaya Gazeta/InaPress. Moscow. 2006. {{ISBN|5-87135-183-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frunze was administered a [[chloroform]] dose that seven times exceeded the dose normally applied to induce [[Unconsciousness|narcosis]].&lt;ref name="izv"&gt;[http://iz.ru/news/367427 Who Killed Mikhail Frunze] / Кто убил Михаила Фрунзе. Izvestiya. 26 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Frunze was buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]].&lt;!-- All four doctors who had operated on him (Alexei Vasilevich Martynov, Ivan Ivanovich Grekov, Vladimir Nikolaevich Rozanov and Gete) died one by one in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Vladimir+Nikolaevich+Rozanov&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sothebys.com/fr/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.N08646.html/f/79/N08646-79.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Grekov%2c+Ivan+Ivanovich&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Martynov%2c+Aleksei+Vasilevich&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Mikhail Frunze by Isaak Brodsky (1929).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Frunze by [[Isaak Brodsky]].]]

In 1926, the capital city of [[Bishkek]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], was renamed ''Frunze'' in his honour. It reverted to its former name in 1991. Nevertheless, Frunze himself is still commemorated in the city. His equestrian statue still stands in front of the main railway station. A street and a museum in the centre of the city are named after him; the museum contains the cottage in which he grew up, fully intact inside a larger modern structure. Multiple villages bear the name [[Frunze, Russia]].

The [[Frunze Military Academy]], one of the most respected in the former [[Soviet Union]], was also named in his honour.

The [[Soviet 2nd Rifle Division]] was in the past known as 2nd Belarusian Red Banner Rifle Division in the name of M.V. Frunze.

There are stations named ''Frunzenskaya'' in his honour on the [[Frunzenskaya (Moscow Metro)|Moscow Metro]], [[Frunzenskaya (Saint Petersburg Metro)|Saint Petersburg Metro]] and [[Frunzenskaya (Minsk Metro)|Minsk Metro]], and a stone carving of his likeness stands at one end of the station. [[Shuya, Ivanovo Oblast|Shuya]] is home to a memorial museum dedicated to Frunze. Streets in many Russian cities are named after him.

After his death, the first name for boys Frunzik (roughly "Little Frunze") became quite popular in the Caucusus and Soviet Turkestan, the most famous name-bearer probably being [[Frunzik Mkrtchyan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://kino.ukr.net/persons/543/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian battleship Poltava (1911)|Russian battleship Poltava]] was renamed ''Frunze'' in his honour in January 1926, as was the second Kirov-class nuclear battlecruiser (now the "[[Admiral Lazarev]]") in 1981.

General Frunze is also honoured with a place right behind Ataturk, in the Monument of the Republic, located at the heart of Taksim Square, in Istanbul, Turkey.

==Literary depictions==

[[Boris Pilnyak]]'s story ''The Tale of the Unextinguished Moon'' was based on Frunze's death. His death also forms the central element of the first two chapters of [[Vasily Aksyonov]]'s novel ''[[Generations of Winter]]''.

==Quotes==
*"All that we do, every action, should correspond to the highest ideals of the Revolution."
*"The [[Red Army]] was created by the workers and peasants and is led by the will of the [[working class]]. That will is being carried out by the united Communist Party."

[[File:Car Wreck.png|thumb|Miksang Color]]
'''Miksang''' is a [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] word meaning "good eye." It represents a form of [[contemplative]] [[photography]] based on the [[Buddhist art|Dharma Art]] teachings of [[Chögyam Trungpa]], in which the eye is in synchronisation with the contemplative mind. The result of this particular perception of the world, combined with photography, produces a peculiar and open way of seeing the world. Miksang pictures tend to bring the observer back into the original [[contemplation]] state of the author of the picture. The pictures can bring one back to a purer [[perception]] of reality that is often neglected. Miksang involves nothing fancy, no special setup; only a [[visual capture]], in the proper state of mind, of everyday [[reality]].&lt;ref&gt;Midal (2004) p.272n6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jay Cook''' (1967–1987) and '''Tanya Van Cuylenborg''' (1969–1987) were a [[Canadians|Canadian]] couple from [[Saanich, British Columbia]], who were murdered while on a trip to [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] in November 1987. On 18 May 2018 the [[Snohomish County]] Sheriff's Office announced they had arrested a suspect in the case.

== Events prior to the murders ==
Cook and Van Cuylenborg met in high school and had been in a relationship for about six months.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://unsolved.com/gallery/jay-cook-and-tanya-van-cuylenborg/|title=Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg - Unsolved Mysteries|work=[[Unsolved Mysteries]]|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 November 1987, they left in Cook's father's bronze 1977 [[Ford E series#Third generation (1975–1991)|Ford Club]] van for an overnight trip to the Seattle area to purchase parts for Cook's father's business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/reward-offered-in-push-to-solve-killing-of-victoria-couple-in-1987-1.1985532|title=Reward offered in push to solve killing of Victoria couple in 1987|last=Smart|first=Amy|work=[[Times Colonist]]|date=2015-06-30|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook and Van Cuylenborg took the [[MV Coho]] ferry from Victoria to [[Port Angeles, Washington|Port Angeles]], Washington. They then drove south-east on [[U.S. Route 101 in Washington|Route 101]] to [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], where they boarded a second ferry to Seattle. A fuel receipt later found in the van confirms that they purchased fuel on the road between Port Angeles and Bremerton.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/2079753/crime-stoppers-what-happened-to-jay-cook-and-tanya-van-cuylenborg/|title=Crime Stoppers: What happened to Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg?|first=Jon|last=Azpiri|work=[[Global News]]|date=2015-06-27|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were last seen boarding the ferry in Bremerton.

Cook's and Van Cuylenborg's families became concerned when the couple did not return home as planned on 19 November and did not make contact. On 20 November, they were reported missing.

== The murders ==
On 24 November, Tanya Van Cuylenborg's half-naked body was found in a ditch by a rural road near [[Alger, Washington|Alger]], in [[Skagit County, Washington|Skagit County]], Washington, a short distance south of [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She had been raped, bound with plastic ties and shot in the head.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/International+team+tries+crack+unsolved+1987+murders+Victoria+couple/2417538/story.html|title=International team tries to crack unsolved 1987 murders of Victoria couple|last=Boswell|first=Randy|work=[[Vancouver Sun]]|date=2010-01-07|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators initially considered Cook a suspect, though both Cook's and Van Cuylenborg's families vehemently rejected this possibility.

On 25 November, Tanya's wallet and keys were found discarded near the [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] station in Bellingham. The van was found a few blocks away. Inside the van were plastic ties of the same type used to bind Tanya, plastic gloves, and various receipts, including the Bremerton-Seattle ferry ticket, confirming the belief that the couple had taken the second ferry. However, Tanya's [[Minolta X-700]] 35 mm camera, which she had brought on the trip, was missing and has never been recovered.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt;

On 26 November, Jay Cook's body was discovered nearly 60 miles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mynorthwest.com/951649/jay-cook-tanya-van-cuylenborg-cold-case/|title=Snohomish, Skagit cold case gets momentum with modern DNA science|work=[[KIRO-TV]]|date=2018-04-11|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where Tanya's body was found two days earlier. Jay had been beaten with rocks and strangled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{citenews|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4278799/tanya-van-cuylenborg-jay-cook-murder/|title=Second murder charge filed against Washington State trucker in 1987 deaths of Saanich couple|work=[[Global News]]|date=2018-06-16|accessdate=2018-10-17|first=Jon|last=Azpiri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation and later events ==
The police believed that the killer was taunting them by leaving the plastic gloves in plain view. Detective Robert Gebo of the Seattle Police Department stated: "He leaves those behind as a sign to the police that you needn't look for fingerprints because I wore these gloves. And he has confidence that there's nothing that's going to connect him with these crimes."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The police were in fact able to obtain the suspect's [[DNA profiling|DNA]] from the van, although there has been no match on any of the criminal databases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite the lack of a match, the police believe that the specific manner in which the victims were killed (which has not been revealed in detail publicly) suggests that the killer is familiar with the prison system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The lack of a match despite a potential prison background may be explained by the suspect being incarcerated before the DNA collection of criminals became commonplace or technologically possible.

Investigators believe that the couple may have met their killer on one of the ferries, most likely the second one, and offered him a ride when reaching Seattle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the months after the murders, both victims' families received a series of taunting greetings cards featuring graphic descriptions of the murders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The cards bore postmarks from Seattle, [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]], and were written by the same person. In 2010, it was announced that the writer of the cards had been found: a 78-year-old Canadian transient with mental health issues. The police have confirmed that he is not the killer and has no connection to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/news/author-of-taunting-letters-found-but-cleared-of-1987-killings/|first=Diana|last=Hefley|title=Author of taunting letters found but cleared of 1987 killings|work=[[The Herald (Everett)|HeraldNet]]|date=2010-08-27|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''murder of Julia Martha Thomas''', dubbed the "'''Barnes Mystery'''" or the "'''Richmond Murder'''" by the press, was one of the most notorious crimes in late 19th-century Britain. Thomas, a widow in her 50s who lived in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], was murdered on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1879 by her maid Kate Webster, a 30-year-old Irishwoman with a history of theft. Webster disposed of the body by dismembering it, boiling the flesh off the bones, and throwing most of the remains into the [[River Thames]]. 

It was alleged, although never proven, that she had offered the fat to neighbours and street children as [[dripping]] and [[lard]]. Part of Thomas' remains were subsequently recovered from the river. Her severed head remained missing until October 2010, when the skull was found during building works being carried out for [[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]].

After the murder, Webster posed as Thomas for two weeks, but was exposed and fled back to Ireland and her uncle's home at [[Killanne]] near [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]]. She was arrested there on 29&amp;nbsp;March and was returned to London, where she stood trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in July 1879. 

At the end of a six-day trial, she was convicted and sentenced to death after a [[jury of matrons]] rejected her last-minute attempt to avoid the death penalty by pleading pregnancy. She finally confessed to the murder the night before she was hanged, on 29 July at [[Wandsworth Prison]]. The case attracted huge public interest and was widely covered by the press in Great Britain and Ireland. Webster's behaviour after the crime and during the trial further increased the notoriety of the murder.

== Background ==
[[File:Residence of Mrs Thomas at Richmond.png|thumb|alt=Drawing of a suburban semi-detached house with a prominent bay window at the front and a deeply recessed entrance door|Mayfield Cottages, Julia Martha Thomas' house in Richmond. She lived in the left-hand portion (number 2) of the semi-detached villa]]
[[File:Kate-Webster-Martha-Thomas.png|thumb|alt=Drawing of two women with black hair and black clothes|Kate Webster ''(left)'' and Julia Martha Thomas ''(right)'']]

Julia Martha Thomas was a former schoolteacher who had been twice widowed. Since the death of her second husband in 1873, she had lived on her own at 2 Mayfield Cottages (also known as 2 Vine Cottages) in Park Road in Richmond. The house was a two-storey [[semi-detached]] villa built in grey stone with a garden at the front and back. The area was not heavily populated at the time, although her house was close to a [[public house]] called The Hole in the Wall.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=13}}

Thomas was described by her doctor George Henry Rudd as "a small, well-dressed lady" who was about fifty-four years old.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=84}} Elliot O'Donnell, summing up contemporary accounts in his introduction to a transcript of Webster's trial, said that Thomas had an "excitable temperament" and was regarded by her neighbours as eccentric. She frequently travelled, leaving her friends and relatives unaware of her whereabouts for weeks or months at a time.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=10}} She was a member of the lower [[middle class]] and as such was not wealthy, but she habitually dressed up and wore jewellery to give the impression of prosperity.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=14}} Her desire to employ a live-in domestic servant probably had as much to do with status as with practicality. However, she had a reputation for being a harsh employer and her irregular habits meant that she had difficulty finding and retaining servants. Before 1879, she had only been able to keep one maid for any length of time.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=14}}

On 29 January 1879, Thomas took on Kate Webster as her servant. Webster had been born as Kate Lawler in [[Killanne]] in County Wexford in about 1849. She was later described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as "a tall, strongly-made woman of about {{convert|5|ft|5|in|cm}} in height with sallow and much freckled complexion and large and prominent teeth."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=10}} The details of her early life are unclear, as many of her later autobiographical statements proved unreliable, but she claimed to have been married to a sea captain called Webster by whom she had four children. 

According to her account, all of the children died, as did her husband, within a short time of each other. She was imprisoned for [[larceny]] in [[Wexford]] in December 1864, when she was only about 15 years old,&lt;ref name="Lloyd's 30 Mar 1879" /&gt; and came to England in 1867.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=58}} In February 1868, she was sentenced to four years of penal servitude for committing larceny in [[Liverpool]].{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=193}}

She was released from jail in January 1872 and, by 1873, she had moved to Rose Gardens in [[Hammersmith]], West London, where she became friends with a neighbouring family named Porter.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=7}} On 18 April 1874, she gave birth to a son whom she named John W. Webster in [[Kingston upon Thames]].&lt;ref name="Belfast 2 Apr 1879" /&gt; The identity of the father is unclear, as she named three different men at various times. One, a man named Strong, was her accomplice in further robberies and thefts. She later claimed to have been forced into crime, as she had been "forsaken by him, and committed crimes for the purpose of supporting myself and child".{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=8}} 

She moved frequently around West London using various aliases, including Webb, Webster, Gibbs, Gibbons, and Lawler. While living in [[Teddington]], she was arrested and convicted in May 1875 of 36 charges of larceny. She was sentenced to eighteen months in [[Wandsworth Prison]]. Not long after leaving prison, she was arrested again for larceny and was sentenced to another twelve months' imprisonment in February 1877.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=9}} Her young son was cared for in her absence by Sarah Crease, a friend who worked as a [[charwoman]] for a Miss Loder in Richmond.{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=193}}

In January 1879, Sarah Crease fell ill and Webster stood in for her as a temporary replacement at Loder's house. Loder knew Julia Martha Thomas as a friend and was aware of her wish to find a domestic servant. She recommended Webster on the basis of the latter's temporary work for her.{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=194}} When Thomas met Webster, she engaged her on the spot, though she did not appear to have made any inquiries about Webster's character or past.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=15}} After Webster was taken on by Thomas, the relationship between the two women appears to have deteriorated rapidly. Thomas disliked the quality of Webster's work and frequently criticised it. Webster later said:

{{quote
| At first I thought her a nice old lady&amp;nbsp;... but I found her very trying, and she used to do many things to annoy me during my work. When I had finished my work in my rooms, she used to go over it again after me, and point out places where she said I did not clean, showing evidence of a nasty spirit towards me.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=19}}
}}

Webster in turn became increasingly resentful of Thomas, to the point that Thomas attempted to persuade friends to stay with her as she did not like to be alone with Webster. It was arranged that Webster would leave Thomas' service on 28 February.{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=194}} Thomas recorded her decision in her last diary entry: "Gave Katherine warning to leave".&lt;ref name="Times 31 Mar 1879" /&gt;

== Murder and the disposal of the body ==

[[File:Laundry copper.jpg|thumb|upright|Webster boiled Thomas' dismembered body in a laundry copper such as this|alt=Photograph of a brick-lined laundry copper, with a round lid in the top and a grate below for the fire]]

Webster persuaded Thomas to keep her on for a further three days until Sunday 2 March. She had Sunday afternoons off as a half-day and was expected to return in time to help Thomas prepare for evening service at the local [[Presbyterian]] church. On this occasion, however, Webster visited the local alehouse and returned late, delaying Thomas' departure. The two women quarrelled and several members of the congregation later reported that Thomas had appeared "very agitated" on arriving at the church.{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=194}} She told a fellow congregant that she had been delayed by "the neglect of her servant to return home at the proper time", and said that Webster had "flown into a terrible passion" upon being rebuked.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=23}} Thomas returned home from church early, about 9&amp;nbsp;pm, and confronted Webster. According to Webster's eventual confession:

{{quote
| Mrs. Thomas came in and went upstairs. I went up after her, and we had an argument, which ripened into a quarrel, and in the height of my anger and rage I threw her from the top of the stairs to the ground floor. She had a heavy fall, and I became agitated at what had occurred, lost all control of myself, and, to prevent her screaming and getting me into trouble, I caught her by the throat, and in the struggle she was choked, and I threw her on the floor.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=68}}
}}

The neighbours, a woman named Ives (who was Thomas' landlady) and her mother, heard a single thump like that of a chair falling over but paid no heed to it at the time.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=53}} Next door, Webster began disposing of the body by dismembering it and boiling it in the [[laundry copper]] and burning the bones in the hearth. She later described her actions:

{{quote
| I determined to do away with the body as best I could. I chopped the head from the body with the assistance of a razor which I used to cut through the flesh afterwards. I also used the meat saw and the carving knife to cut the body up with. I prepared the copper with water to boil the body to prevent identity; and as soon as I had succeeded in cutting it up I placed it in the copper and boiled it. I opened the stomach with the carving knife, and burned up as much of the parts as I could.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=68}}
}}

The neighbours noticed an unusual, unpleasant smell.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=87}} Webster spoke later of how she was "greatly overcome, both from the horrible sight before me and the smell".{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=68}} However, the activity at 2 Mayfield Cottages did not seem to be out of the ordinary, as it was customary in many households for the washing to begin early on Monday morning.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=87}} Over the next couple of days, Webster continued to clean the house and Thomas' clothes and put on a show of normality for people who called for orders. Behind the scenes, she was packing Thomas' dismembered remains into a black [[Gladstone bag]] and a corded wooden bonnet-box.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=89}} She was unable to fit the murdered woman's head and one of the feet into the containers and disposed of them separately, throwing the foot onto a rubbish heap in Twickenham.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=87}} The head was buried under the ''Hole in the Wall'' pub's stables a short distance from Thomas' house, where it was found 131 years later.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 5 Jul 2011" /&gt;

On 4 March, Webster travelled to Hammersmith to see her old neighbours the Porters, whom she had not seen for six years, wearing Thomas' silk dress and carrying a Gladstone bag which she had filled with some of Thomas' remains. Webster introduced herself to the Porters as "Mrs. Thomas". She claimed that, since last meeting the Porters, she had married, had a child, been widowed, and had been left a house in Richmond by an aunt. She invited Porter and his son Robert to the ''Oxford and Cambridge Arms'' pub in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]].{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=33}} Along the way, she disposed of the bag that she was carrying, probably by dropping it into the [[River Thames]], while the Porters were inside the pub drinking.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=89}} It was never recovered.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=95}} Webster then asked young Robert Porter if he could help her carry a heavy box from 2 Mayfield Cottages to the station. As they crossed [[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], Webster dropped the box into the Thames. She was able to explain it away and did not arouse Robert's suspicions.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=87}}

The following day, however, the box was found washed up in shallow water next to the river bank about a mile downstream. It was spotted by Henry Wheatley, a coal porter who was driving his cart past [[Barnes Railway Bridge]] shortly before seven in the morning. He initially thought that the box might contain the proceeds of a burglary.&lt;ref name="Guardian 10 Mar 1879" /&gt; He recovered the box and opened it, finding that it contained what looked like body parts wrapped in brown paper.&lt;ref name="Times 11 Mar 1879" /&gt; The discovery was immediately reported to the police and the remains were examined by a doctor, who found that they consisted of the trunk (minus entrails) and legs (minus one foot) of a woman. The head was missing and was later assumed to have been thrown into the river separately by Webster.{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=195}} 

Around the same time, a human foot and ankle were found in [[Twickenham]]. It was clear that all of the remains belonged to the same corpse, but there was nothing to connect them with Thomas and no means to identify the remains.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=87}} The doctor who examined the body parts erroneously attributed them to "a young person with very dark hair".&lt;ref name="Times 11 Mar 1879" /&gt; An inquest on 10–11 March resulted in an [[open verdict]] on the cause of death,&lt;ref name="Lloyd's 23 Mar 1879" /&gt; and the unidentified remains were laid to rest in [[Barnes Cemetery]] on 19 March.&lt;ref name="Guardian 30 Mar 1879" /&gt; The newspapers dubbed the unexplained murder the "Barnes Mystery",{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=83}} amid speculation that the body had been used for dissection and anatomical study.&lt;ref name="Times 11 Mar 1879" /&gt;

[[File:John Church sketch.png|left|thumb|upright|alt=Profile drawing of a man with a high-collared shirt and jacket and a dark chest-length beard|John Church, who bought Thomas' furniture from Webster and was falsely implicated by Webster for the murder]]

It was later alleged that Webster had offered two pots of lard to a neighbour, supposed to have been rendered from Thomas' boiled fat. However, no evidence about this was offered at the subsequent trial and it seems likely that the story is merely a legend, particularly as several versions of the story appear to exist.{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=195}} The proprietress of a nearby pub claimed that Webster had visited her pub and tried to sell what she called "best dripping" there. Leonard Reginald Gribble, a writer on [[criminology]], commented that "there is no acceptable evidence that such a repulsive sale was ever made, and it is more than possible that the episode belongs rightfully with the rest of the vast collection of apocryphal stories that has accumulated, not unnaturally, about the persons and deeds of famous criminals."{{sfn|Gribble|1957|p=69}}

Webster continued to live at 2 Mayfield Cottages while posing as Thomas, wearing her late employer's clothes and dealing with tradesmen under her newly assumed identity. On 9 March, she reached an agreement with John Church, a local publican, to sell Thomas' furniture and other goods to furnish his pub, the ''Rising Sun''. He agreed to pay her £68 with an interim payment of £18 in advance.{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=196}} 

By the time that the removal vans arrived on 18 March, the neighbours were becoming increasingly suspicious, as they had not seen Thomas for nearly two weeks. Her next-door neighbour Miss Ives asked the deliverymen who had ordered the goods removed. They replied "Mrs. Thomas" and indicated Webster. Realising that she had been exposed, Webster fled immediately, catching a train to Liverpool and travelling from there to her family home at [[Enniscorthy]]. 

Meanwhile, Church realised that he had been deceived. When he went through Thomas' clothes in the delivery van, he found a letter addressed to the real Thomas. The police were called in and searched 2 Mayfield Cottages. There they discovered blood stains, burned finger-bones in the hearth, and fatty deposits behind the copper, as well as a letter left by Webster giving her home address in Ireland. They immediately put out a "wanted" notice giving a description of Webster and her son.&lt;ref name="Guardian 27 Mar 1879" /&gt;

[[Scotland Yard]] detectives soon discovered that Webster had fled back to Ireland aboard a coal steamer in the company of her young son. The head constable of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) in Wexford realised that the woman being sought by Scotland Yard was the same person whom his force had arrested 14 years previously for larceny. The RIC were able to trace her to her uncle's farm at [[Killanne]] near Enniscorthy&lt;ref name="Lloyd's 30 Mar 1879" /&gt; and arrested her there on 29 March.&lt;ref name="Guardian 30 Mar 1879" /&gt; She was taken to Kingstown (modern [[Dún Laoghaire]]) and from there back to Richmond via [[Holyhead]], in the custody of the Scotland Yard men.&lt;ref name="Times 31 Mar 1879" /&gt; 

On hearing of the crime with which she was charged, her uncle refused to give shelter to her son, and the authorities sent the boy to the local [[workhouse]] until such time as a place could be found for him in an industrial school.&lt;ref name="Times 31 Mar 1879" /&gt;

== Webster's trial and execution ==

July 1879 commemorating the trial, sentence and execution of Webster]]

The murder caused a sensation on both sides of the [[Irish Sea]]. When the news broke, many people travelled to Richmond to look at Mayfield Cottages.&lt;ref name="Times 31 Mar 1879" /&gt; The crime was just as notorious in Ireland; as Webster travelled under arrest from Enniscorthy to Dublin, crowds gathered to gawk and jeer at her at nearly every station between the two locations.&lt;ref name="Freemans 31 Mar 1879" /&gt; 

The pre-trial magistrates' hearings were attended by "many privileged and curious persons&amp;nbsp;... including not a few ladies", according to the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name="Guardian 10 Apr 1879" /&gt; ''The Times'' reported that Webster's first appearance at Richmond Magistrates' Court was greeted by "an immense crowd yesterday around the building&amp;nbsp;... and very great excitement prevailed."&lt;ref name="Times 1 Apr 1879" /&gt;

Webster went on trial at the Central Criminal Court&amp;nbsp;– the [[Old Bailey]]&amp;nbsp;– on 2 July 1879. In a sign of the great public interest aroused by the case, the prosecution was led by the Solicitor General, Sir [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|Hardinge Giffard]]. Webster was defended by a prominent London barrister, Warner Sleigh, and the case was presided over by Mr. [[George Denman|Justice Denman]].{{sfn|Gaute|Odell|1983|p=87}} The trial was just as well-attended as the earlier hearings in Richmond and attracted intense interest from all levels of society; on the fourth day of the trial, the Crown Prince of [[Sweden]]&amp;nbsp;– the future King [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf V]]&amp;nbsp;– turned up to watch the proceedings.&lt;ref name="Guardian 6 Jul 1879" /&gt;

Over the course of six days, the court heard a succession of witnesses piecing together the complicated story of how Thomas had met her death. Webster had attempted before the trial to implicate the publican John Church and her former neighbour Porter, but both men had solid alibis and were cleared of any involvement in the murder.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=55}} She pleaded not guilty and her defence sought to emphasise the circumstantial nature of the evidence and highlighted her devotion to her son as a reason why she could not have been capable of the murder.{{sfn|Conley|2006|pp=84–5}} However, Webster's public unpopularity, impassive demeanour and scanty defence counted strongly against her.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=55}} 

A particularly damning piece of evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her a week before the murder and had said that she was going to [[Birmingham]] to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=198}} and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=97}}

Shortly after the jury returned its verdict and just before the judge was about to pass sentence, Webster was asked if there was any reason why sentence of death should not be passed upon her. She pleaded that she was pregnant in an apparent bid to avoid the death penalty.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=98}} ''The Law Times'' reported that "[u]pon this a scene of uncertainty, if not of confusion, ensued, certainly not altogether in harmony with the solemnity of the occasion." The judge commented that "after thirty-two years in the profession, he was never at an inquiry of this sort." 

Eventually the [[Clerk of Assize]] suggested using the archaic mechanism of a [[jury of matrons]], constituted from a selection of the women attending the court, to rule upon the question of whether Webster was "with quick child".{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=99}} Twelve women were sworn in along with a surgeon named Bond, and they accompanied Webster to a private room for an examination that only took a couple of minutes.{{sfn|Rudd|1916|p=100}} They returned a verdict that Webster was not "quick with child", though this did not necessarily mean that she was not pregnant&amp;nbsp;– a distinction that led the president of the [[Obstetrical Society of London]] to protest at the use of "the obsolete medical assumption that the unborn child is not alive until the so-called '[[quickening]].'"{{sfn|Oldman|2006|pp=110–1}}

A few days before Webster was due to be executed an appeal was submitted on her behalf to the [[Home Secretary]], [[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|R. A. Cross]]. It was turned down with an official statement that after considering the arguments put forward, the Home Secretary had "failed to discover any sufficient ground to justify him in advising [[Queen Victoria|Her Majesty]] to interfere with the due course of the law."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=66}}

Before she was executed, Webster made two statements confessing to the crime. In her first, she implicated Strong, the purported father of her child, who she said had participated in the murder and was responsible for leading her into a life of crime. She recanted on 28 July, the night before she was due to be executed, making a further statement in which she took sole responsibility and exonerated Church, Porter and Strong of any involvement.{{sfn|Wilson|1971|p=198}} She was hanged the following day at Wandsworth Prison at 9&amp;nbsp;am, where the hangman, [[William Marwood]], used his newly developed "[[Hanging#Long drop|long drop]]" technique to cause instantaneous death.{{sfn|Bailey|1993|p=100}} After her death was certified, she was buried in an unmarked grave in one of the prison's exercise yards.{{sfn|Castleden|2005|p=232}} The crowd waiting outside cheered as a black flag was raised over the prison walls, signifying that the death sentence had been carried out.&lt;ref name="Police News 2 Aug 1879 p4" /&gt;

An auction of Thomas' property was held at 2 Mayfield Cottages on the day after Webster's execution. John Church, the publican, managed to obtain Thomas' furniture after all, along with numerous other personal effects including her pocket-watch and the knife with which Thomas had been dismembered. The copper in which Thomas' body had been boiled was sold for five shillings.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=73}} Other visitors contented themselves with taking small pebbles and twigs from the garden as souvenirs.&lt;ref name="Lloyd's 3 Aug 1879" /&gt; The house itself remained unoccupied until 1897, as nobody would live there after the murder. Even then, according to the occupant, servants were reluctant to work at such a notorious place.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=82}} 

It was later rumoured that a "ghostly nun" could be seen hovering over the place where Thomas had been buried.&lt;ref name="Miller 1986 p66" /&gt; To the surprise and disappointment of [[Elliott O'Donnell]], there was no sign that her house was haunted, and Guy Logan noted that the "neat and pretty" appearance of the property gave no hint of the crime that had been committed within: "anything less like the popular conception of a 'murder house' it would be hard to imagine."&lt;ref name="Bondeson2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bondeson|first=Jan|title=Murder Houses of London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch38AwAAQBAJ|date=10 January 2014|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-1491-5|page=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social impact of the murder ==
[[File:Execution of Catherine Webster at Wandsworth Gaol.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration headlined "Execution of Catherine Webster at Wandsworth Gaol", showing a number of scenes including "the prisoner visited by her friends", "the process of pinioning", the final rites being said, "hoisting the black flag" and finally "filling up the coffin with lime"|Webster's execution, as depicted by a souvenir illustration in the ''Illustrated Police News'']]

The murder had a considerable social impact on Victorian Britain and Ireland. It caused an immediate sensation and was widely reported in the press. ''Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser'' of Dublin noted that what it called "one of the most sensational and awful chapters in the annals of human wickedness" had resulted in the press "teem[ing] with descriptions and details of the ghastly horrors of that crime".&lt;ref name="Freemans 31 Mar 1879" /&gt; 

Such was Webster's notoriety that within only a few weeks of her arrest, and well before she had gone to trial, [[Madame Tussaud's]] created a wax effigy of her and put it on display for those who wished to see the "Richmond Murderess".{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=10}} It remained on display well into the twentieth century alongside other notorious killers such as [[Burke and Hare]] and [[Hawley Harvey Crippen|Dr. Crippen]].{{sfn|Carver|2003|p=227}} 

Within days of her execution an enterprising publisher on the [[Strand, London|Strand]] rushed into print a souvenir booklet for the price of a penny, "The Life, Trial and Execution of Kate Webster", which was advertised as "compris[ing] Twenty Handsome Pages, containing her entire History, with Summing-up, Verdict, and interesting particulars, together with her last words, and a FULL-PAGE ENGRAVING of the EXECUTION&amp;nbsp;– Portraits, Illustrations &amp;c."&lt;ref name="Police News 9 Aug 1879" /&gt; ''[[The Illustrated Police News]]'' published a souvenir cover depicting an artist's impression of the day of the execution. It depicted "the prisoner visited by her friends", "the process of pinioning", the final rites being said, "hoisting the black flag", and finally "filling up the coffin with lime".&lt;ref name="Police News 2 Aug 1879 p1" /&gt;

The case was also commemorated, while it was still ongoing, by street ballads—musical narratives set to the tune of popular songs. H. Such, a printer and publisher in [[Southwark]], issued a ballad entitled "Murder and Mutilation of an Old Lady near Barnes" shortly after Kate Webster had been arrested, set to the tune of "[[Just Before the Battle, Mother]]", a popular song of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="H. Such @Apr 1879" /&gt; At the end of the trial Such issued another ballad, set to the tune of "Driven from Home", announcing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
The terrible crime at Richmond at last,
On Catherine Webster now has been cast,
Tried and found guilty she is sentenced to die.
From the strong hand of justice she cannot fly.
She has tried all excuses but of no avail,
About this and murder she's told many tales,
She has tried to throw blame on others as well,
But with all her cunning at last she has fell.&lt;ref name="H. Such Jul 1879" /&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Webster herself was characterised as malicious, reckless and wilfully evil.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=52}} Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous. Servants were expected to be deferential; her act of extreme violence towards her employer was deeply disquieting. At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as domestic servants for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers lived and worked in close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=55}} Servants were very poorly paid and larceny was an ever-present temptation. Had Webster succeeded in completing the deal with John Church to sell Thomas' furniture, she stood to gain the equivalent of two to three years' worth of wages.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=56}}

Another cause of revulsion against Webster was her attempt to impersonate Thomas. She had managed to perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted to little more than cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=55}}

[[File:Kate Webster sketch.png|left|thumb|upright|alt=Sketch drawing of a dark-haired woman wearing a fur collar and a small hat decorated with a bow and feather.|Webster's appearance (depicted here by ''[[The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times]]'') was a topic of comment in the press]]

Exacerbating the crime in the minds of many Victorians was how Webster violated the expected norms of femininity by the standards of the [[Victorian era]]. Victorian ideals saw women as moral, passive and physically weak or restrained.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=56}} Webster was seen as quite the opposite and was described in lurid ways that emphasised her lack of femininity. [[Elliott O'Donnell]], writing in his introduction to the trial transcript, described Webster as "not merely savage, savage and shocking... but the grimmest of grim personalities, a character so uniquely sinister and barbaric as to be hardly human".{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=2}} The newspapers described her as "gaunt, repellent, and trampish-looking", though the reporter for ''[[The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times]]'' commented that she was "not so ill-favoured as she has been described."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=11}}

Webster's appearance and behaviour were seen as key signs of her inherently criminal nature. Crimes were thought to be committed by a social "residuum" at the bottom of society who occupied themselves as "habitual criminals", choosing to live a life of drink and theft rather than improving themselves through thrift and hard work.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=56}} Her strong build, partly a result of the hard physical labour that was her livelihood, ran counter to the largely middle-class notion that women were meant to be physically frail.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=57}} Some commentators saw her facial features as indicative of criminality; O'Donnell commented upon her "obliquely set eyes", which he declared "are not infrequently found in homicides&amp;nbsp;... this peculiarity, which I consider was sufficient in itself, as one of nature's danger signals, to have warned people to steer clear of her".{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=12}}

Webster's behaviour in court and her sexual history also counted against her. She was widely described by reporters as "calm" and "stolid" in facing the court{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=57}} and only cried once during the trial, when her son was mentioned.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=58}} This contradicted the expectation that "properly feminine" women should be penitent and emotional in such a situation.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=57}} Her succession of male friends, one of whom had fathered her child outside wedlock, suggested promiscuous female sexuality—again, strongly counter to expected norms of behaviour.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|pp=57–8}} During her trial she attempted unsuccessfully to evoke sympathy by blaming Strong, the possible father of her child, for leading her astray: "I formed an intimate acquaintance with one who should have protected me and was led away by evil associates and bad companions."{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=58}} This claim played on social expectations that women's moral sense was inextricably linked with sexual chastity—"falling" sexually would lead to other forms of "ruin"—and that men who had sexual relations with women acquired social obligations that they were expected to fulfil.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|p=58}} Webster's attempt to implicate three innocent men also caused outrage; O'Donnell commented that "public opinion, as a whole, undoubtedly condemned Kate Webster, as much, perhaps, for her attempts to bring three innocent men to the scaffold as for the actual murder itself".{{sfn|O'Donnell|1925|p=66}}

According to Shani D'Cruze of the Feminist Crime Research Network, the fact that she was Irish was a significant factor in the widespread revulsion felt towards Webster in Great Britain. Many Irish people had emigrated to England since the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1849, but met widespread prejudice and persistent associations with criminality and drunkenness. The Irish were at worst depicted as bestial and subhuman, and there were repeated episodes of violence between Irish and English workers as well as attacks by [[Fenians]] (Irish nationalists) in England. The demonisation of Webster as "hardly human", as O'Donnell put it, was of a piece with the public and judicial perceptions of the Irish as innately criminal.{{sfn|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|pp=56–7}}

== Discovery of Thomas' skull ==
[[File:Park Road - Thomas murder.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of several houses, partly hidden by trees, behind a garden wall on an upward-sloping suburban road|View of buildings in Park Road, Richmond, associated with the murder of Julia Martha Thomas. (''Left'': the former Mayfield Cottages, where the murder took place; ''centre behind trees'', the house of the naturalist Sir David Attenborough; ''right'', the former ''Hole in the Wall'' pub, where Thomas' skull was discovered on 22 October 2010)]]

In 1952, the naturalist [[David Attenborough]] and his wife Jane bought a house situated between the former Mayfield Cottages (which still stand today) and the ''Hole in the Wall'' pub.&lt;ref name="Smith 31 Dec 2001" /&gt; The pub closed in 2007 and fell into dereliction but was bought by Attenborough in 2009 to be redeveloped.&lt;ref name="Powell 1 Jun 2009" /&gt;

On 22 October 2010, workmen carrying out excavation work at the rear of the old pub uncovered a "dark circular object", which turned out to be a woman's skull. It had been buried underneath foundations that had been in place for at least 40 years, on the site of the pub's stables. It was immediately speculated that the skull was the missing head of Julia Martha Thomas, and the coroner asked Richmond police to carry out an investigation into the identity and circumstances of death of the skull's owner.&lt;ref name="Fleming 2010" /&gt;

[[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon dating]] carried out at the [[University of Edinburgh]] dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while the fact that it had been deposited on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low [[collagen]] levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 5 Jul 2011" /&gt;

The Skull was intered in an unmarked grave at Richmond Cemetery on 24th August 2011.

The coroner recorded a verdict of [[unlawful killing]], superseding the open verdict recorded in 1879. The cause of Thomas's death was given as asphyxiation and a head injury. The police called the outcome "a good example of how good old-fashioned detective work, historical records and technological advances came together to solve the 'Barnes Mystery'."&lt;ref name="BBC News 5 Jul 2011" /&gt;

The '''muzzle clamp''' is a method of killing used by large [[Predation|predators]], usually [[cat]]s such as ''Panthera leo'', the [[lion]], ''Panthera pardus'', the [[leopard]], and ''Panthera uncia'', the [[snow leopard]]. It requires the subduing of [[prey]], usually completely on the ground and pinned by the predator, and the engulfing of the [[Snout|muzzle]] of the prey in the mouth of the predator, blocking [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] through either the mouth or nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Alan|title=Big Cats and their Fossil Relatives|year=1997|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-10229-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
It is generally easier for large, social carnivores to use this method with large prey when there are multiple individuals holding the prey still while it suffocates, in the case of the lion, or for solitary carnivores killing weak or small animals. It is not as common as the [[throat clamp]] with cats. It is also a calculated measure not seen often because most predators are known, especially [[canids]] and [[hyaenids]], for eating the prey while it's still alive and letting it die of loss of blood and/or shock, not bothering with killing it first. This method also silences the prey for the most part and can be used by [[Solitary animal|solitary]] animals to keep the noise down as not to attract other predators with the commotion.

==Anatomy==
[[Canine teeth|Canines]] that are strong and not too long are generally essential for this method because any rapid movement of the head of the prey can break long or fragile canines and canines that are too short won't penetrate into the muscle and skin of the muzzle far enough and the prey can pull free. The predator cannot breath through its mouth when applying a muzzle clamp and must resort to breathing through the nose, which causes the issue of not enough oxygen if the predator is exhausted since panting through the mouth is much more efficient than breathing through the nose for most predators. If the predator is too tired, it may resort to another method of killing or withhold from finishing the prey off until it catches its breath.

'''Nancy Charest''' (November 28, 1959 – March 1, 2014) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician. She represented the electoral district of [[Matane (provincial electoral district)|Matane]] in the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] from 2003 to 2007 as a member of the [[Quebec Liberal Party]]. She was defeated by [[Pascal Bérubé]] of the [[Parti Québécois]] in the [[Quebec general election, 2007|2007 provincial election]].

She ran as the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]'s candidate for the district of [[Haute-Gaspésie—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]]. She lost to [[Bloc Québécois]] incumbent [[Jean-Yves Roy]], but received the highest vote percentage of any non-winning Liberal candidate in the province outside of the [[Montreal]] area. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Charest was found dead on March 1, 2014 along a road in her native Matane, Quebec. The cause of death was [[hypothermia]], caused by exposure while Charest was heavily [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cjad.com/cjad-news/2014/09/24/coroner-death-of-mna-caused-by-hypothermia|title=Coroner: Death of MNA caused by hypothermia|publisher=CJAD Newse|date=September 24, 2014|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was 54 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Former+Liberal+Nancy+Charest+found+dead/9569323/story.html|title=Former Liberal MNA Nancy Charest found dead|publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=March 2, 2014|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bernard|last=Dupéré|title=Décès de l'ancienne députée Nancy Charest|work=TVA Nouvelles|date=March 2, 2014|url=http://tvanouvelles.ca/lcn/infos/regional/estduquebec/archives/2014/03/20140302-130012.html|accessdate=March 2, 2014|trans-title=Death of the former member Nancy Charest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pelorus Jack''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1888&amp;nbsp;– April 1912) was a [[Risso's dolphin]] that was famous for meeting and escorting ships through a stretch of water in [[Cook Strait]], [[New Zealand]], between 1888 and 1912. Pelorus Jack was usually spotted in [[Admiralty Bay, New Zealand|Admiralty Bay]] between Cape Francis and Collinet Point, near [[French Pass]], a notoriously dangerous channel used by ships travelling between [[Wellington]] and [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]].

Pelorus Jack was shot at from a passing ship, and was later protected by a 1904 New Zealand law.

== Appearance ==

Pelorus Jack was approximately {{convert|13|ft|0}} long and was of a white color with grey lines or shadings, and a round, white head.&lt;ref name="pelorus-jack-com"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pelorus-jack.com/about/legend.html | title = The Legend of Pelorus Jack | publisher = pelorus-jack.com | accessdate = 17 August 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080121191804/http://www.pelorus-jack.com/about/legend.html | archivedate = 21 January 2008 | deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although its sex was never determined, it was identified from photographs as a [[Risso's dolphin]], ''Grampus griseus''.  This is an uncommon species in New Zealand waters, and only 12 Risso's dolphins have been reported in that area.&lt;ref name="uwnz"&gt;{{cite web|author = Parkinson, Brian | url = http://www.ecotours.co.nz/Brian/wildlife/nelson/pelorus.htm | publisher = Ecotours New Zealand | title = Unique Wildlife of New Zealand - Pelorus | accessdate = 29 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009020433/http://www.ecotours.co.nz/Brian/wildlife/nelson/pelorus.htm|archivedate=9 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Pelorus Jack guided the ships by swimming alongside a water craft for 20 minutes at a time.  If the crew could not see Jack at first, they often waited for him to appear.

Despite his name, he did not live in nearby [[Pelorus Sound]]; instead, he would often guide ships through dangerous passages of French Pass. However, some local residents familiar with his habits claim that he never went through French Pass itself.&lt;ref name="teara"/&gt;

Pelorus Jack was first seen around 1888 when it appeared in front of the [[schooner]] ''Brindle'' when the ship approached French Pass, a channel located between [[D'Urville Island, New Zealand|D'Urville Island]] and the [[South Island]].  When the members of the crew saw the dolphin bobbing up and down in front of the ship, they wanted to kill him, but the captain’s wife talked them out of it. To their amazement, the dolphin then proceeded to guide the ship through the narrow channel. And for years thereafter, he safely guided almost every ship that came by. With rocks and strong currents, the area is dangerous to ships, but no shipwrecks occurred when Jack was present.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Robbins (author)|Robbins, John]] (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h-9ARz2YAlgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%27%27Diet+for+a+New+America%27+%22John+Robbins%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IyXrUZzUF8euiQeRnYHQAw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA ''Diet for a New America''] H J Kramer, {{ISBN|9781932073416}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sailors and travellers saw Pelorus Jack, and he was mentioned in local newspapers and depicted in postcards.

Jack was last seen in April 1912. There were various rumours connected to his disappearance, including fears that foreign whalers might have harpooned him.  However, research suggests that Pelorus Jack was an old animal; his head was white and his body pale, both indications of age, so it is likely that he died of natural causes.&lt;ref name="uwnz"/&gt;


Since 1989, Pelorus Jack has been used as a symbol for the [[Interislander]], a ferry service across the Cook Strait, and is incorporated into the livery of the ships in the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzmaritime.co.nz/railferries.htm New Zealand's Cook Strait Rail Ferries], New Zealand Maritime Record&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shooting incident ===

In 1904, someone aboard the ''[[SS Penguin]]'' tried to shoot Pelorus Jack with a rifle. Despite the attempt on his life, Pelorus Jack continued to help ships. According to folklore, however, he no longer helped the ''Penguin'', which shipwrecked in Cook Strait in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofwellington.co.nz/fact_sheets/pelorus_jack.pdf Pelorus Jack fact sheet] at the Museum of Wellington&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwest.com.au/~kirbyhs/dolphins3.html The Quest for Wild Dolphins]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protection ===

Following the shooting incident, a law was proposed to protect Pelorus Jack.  He became protected by [[Order in Council]] under the Sea Fisheries Act on 26 September 1904.  Pelorus Jack remained protected by that law until his disappearance in 1912.  It is believed that he  was the first individual sea creature protected by law in any country.&lt;ref name="teara"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/P/PelorusJack/PelorusJack/en | accessdate = 29 December 2006 | author = Alpers, A.F.G. | title = PELORUS JACK | publisher = An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand 1966 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
"Pelorus Jack" is also a popular Scottish Country dance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pelorus Jack |url=https://www.scottish-country-dancing-dictionary.com/dance-crib/pelorus-jack.html |website=Scottish Country Dancing Dictionary |accessdate=14 June 2018}} (dance instructions)&lt;/ref&gt; named in honour of the dolphin. This dance features a set of alternating tandem half-reels (or hays) where two people act as one but swap who leads at the reel ends, this is now known as a ''Dolphin Reel''.

[[Arthur Ransome]] mentions Pelorus Jack as accompanying ships and receiving protection in his 1932 novel [[Peter Duck]]. However, the character of Peter Duck incorrectly locates the dolphin as living in [[Sydney Harbour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ransome |first1=Arthur |title=Peter Duck : a treasure hunt in the Caribbees |publisher=Godine |isbn=0-87923-660-4 |page=200 |edition=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Polyhydramnios''' is a medical condition describing an excess of [[amniotic fluid]] in the [[amniotic sac]]. It is seen in about 1% of pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ES, Spitz, HB, Clark, RA. Sonography of polyhydramnios. AJR Am J Roentgenol 1982; 138:343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill LM; Breckle R; Thomas ML; Fries JK, Polyhydramnios: ultrasonically detected prevalence and neonatal outcome, Obstet Gynecol 1987 Jan;69(1):21-5, {{PMID|3540761}}

Risk of chromosomal abnormalities in patients with idiopathic polyhydramnios. Obstet Gynecol 1992;79:234-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two clinical varieties of polyhydramnios: chronic polyhydramnios where excess amniotic fluid accumulates gradually, and acute polyhydramnios where excess amniotic fluid collects rapidly.

The opposite to polyhydramnios is [[oligohydramnios]], not enough amniotic fluid.

==Causes==
[[File:Ultrasound Scan ND 152505 1531230 cr.png|thumb]]
In most cases, the exact cause cannot be identified. A single case may have one or more causes, including intrauterine infection ([[TORCH complex|TORCH]]), [[Rh disease|rh-isoimmunisation]], or [[chorioangioma]] of the placenta. In a multiple gestation pregnancy, the cause of polyhydramnios usually is [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]]. Maternal causes include [[cardiac]] problems, [[kidney]] problems, and maternal [[diabetes mellitus]], which causes fetal [[hyperglycemia]] and resulting [[polyuria]] (fetal urine is a major source of amniotic fluid).

A recent study distinguishes between mild and severe polyhydramnios and showed that [[Apgar score]] of less than 7, perinatal death and structural malformations only occurred in women with severe polyhydramnios.&lt;ref&gt;Bundgaard A, Andersen BR, Rode L, Lebech M, Tabor A, Prevalence of polyhydramnios at a Danish hospital--a population-based study. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2007 ; 86(12): 1427-31.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In another study, all patients with polyhydramnios, that had a sonographically normal fetus, showed no chromosomal anomalies.&lt;ref name="Barnhard" /&gt;

(M/C for polyhydramnio is fetal anomalies 'Williams Obstetrics, 24th Edition - Cunningham,  Leveno, Bloom et al. Table 11-2)
but these anomalies include:

*[[gastrointestinal]] abnormalities such as [[esophageal atresia]] [[duodenal atresia|&amp; duodenal atresia]] (causing inability to swallow amniotic fluid), anencephaly, facial cleft, neck masses, tracheoesophageal fistula, and diaphragmatic hernias. An annular pancreas causing obstruction may also be the cause. 
*Bochdalek's hernia, in which the pleuro-peritoneal membranes (especially the left) will fail to develop &amp; seal the pericardio- peritoneal canals.  This results in the stomach protrusion up into the thoracic cavity, and the fetus is unable to swallow sufficient amounts of amniotic fluid.
* fetal [[renal]] disorders that result in increased urine production during pregnancy, such as in antenatal [[Bartter syndrome]].&lt;ref name="pmid18695706"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seyberth HW. |title=An improved terminology and classification of Bartter-like syndromes. |journal=Nat Clin Pract Nephrol  |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=560–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18695706 |doi=10.1038/ncpneph0912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular diagnosis is available for these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moldiag.de/en/dis/bartter.htm |title=Hereditary disease: Bartter syndrome |publisher=Moldiag.de |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*neurological abnormalities such as [[anencephaly]], which impair the swallowing reflex. Anencephaly is failure of close of the rostral neuropore (rostral neural tube defect). If the rostral neuropore fails to close there will be no neural mechanism for swallowing.
*chromosomal abnormalities such as [[Down syndrome]] and [[Edwards syndrome]], (which is itself often associated with GI abnormalities).
*Skeletal dysplasia, or dwarfism. There is a possibility of the chest cavity not being large enough to house all of the baby's organs causing the trachea and esophagus to be restricted, not allowing the baby to swallow the appropriate amount of amniotic fluid.

*sacrococcygeal teratoma

==Diagnosis==
There are several pathologic conditions that can predispose a pregnancy to polyhydramnios. These include a maternal history of [[diabetes mellitus]], [[Rh incompatibility]] between the fetus and mother, intrauterine infection, and [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancies]].

During the pregnancy, certain clinical signs may suggest polyhydramnios. In the mother, the physician may observe increased abdominal size out of proportion for her weight gain and gestation age, uterine size that outpaces gestational age, shiny skin with stria (seen mostly in severe polyhydramnios), dyspnea, and chest heaviness. When examining the fetus, faint fetal heart sounds are also an important clinical sign of this condition.

==Associated conditions==
Fetuses with polyhydramnios are at risk for a number of other problems including [[cord prolapse]], [[placental abruption]], premature birth and perinatal death. At delivery the baby should be checked for congenital abnormalities.

==Treatment==
Mild asymptomatic polyhydramnios is managed expectantly. A woman with symptomatic polyhydramnios may need hospital admission. [[Antacids]] may be prescribed to relieve heartburn and [[nausea]].
No data support dietary restriction of salt and fluid.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
In some cases, [[amnioreduction]], also known as therapeutic [[amniocentesis]], has been used in response to polyhydramnios.&lt;ref name="pmid15301292"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Piantelli G, Bedocchi L, Cavicchioni O, etal |title=Amnioreduction for treatment of severe polyhydramnios |series=75 |journal=Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis |volume=Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=56–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15301292 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">The '''Reynolds–Sorgi Incident''' refers to an American [[college football]] in-game incident in which [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] linebacker [[Robert Reynolds (football player)|Robert Reynolds]] choked [[Wisconsin Badgers]] quarterback [[Jim Sorgi]], injuring Sorgi's [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], after the play had been whistled dead. Sorgi was unable to play for the remainder of the game, struggling to breathe and unable to speak.

==The game==
On October 11, 2003, the Buckeyes entered the game as the defending national champions, ranked #3 in the country and on a 19-game winning streak with a record of 5–0. The unranked Badgers came into the game at 5–1, having lost at home to UNLV. The Badgers were without star running back Anthony Davis, who was recovering from a fractured eye-socket caused by a late-hit. The game was played at the Badgers' home [[Camp Randall Stadium]].

Midway through the third quarter, Sorgi scrambled for an eight-yard gain before being brought down by a convergence of OSU tacklers. After the play was called dead, Reynolds grabbed Sorgi's throat with his hand as Sorgi lay on his back. Sorgi's vocal cords were bruised, he had a hard time breathing, and he was unable to speak. He would not return to the game, and though Reynolds was not whistled for a foul, the Badgers came back to win the game.

After the game, [[Big Ten]] commissioner [[James Delany]] commented, "(Reynolds' actions) have no place in our game." Buckeyes coach [[Jim Tressel]] initially claimed he didn't see the play but later said "Robert's conduct was totally unacceptable and has no place in intercollegiate athletics." Ohio State suspended Reynolds for one game and Reynolds issued a public apology.

Years later, on October 28, 2011, Robert Reynolds came forward to make another public apology, stating that he wanted to put the incident behind him and teach his four children about being accountable and moving on from their mistakes. Reynolds also said that he and Sorgi had made amends not long after the incident occurred, something for which Reynolds said he was very grateful.

'''Romance''' is an [[Emotion|emotional]] [[Feeling#Emotion work|feeling]] of [[love]] for, or a [[Interpersonal attraction|strong attraction]] towards, [[Other (philosophy)|another]] [[person]], and the [[Courtship|courtship behaviors]] undertaken by an individual to express those overall feelings and resultant emotions.

Although the [[Psychophysiology|emotions and sensations]] of ''romantic love'' are widely associated with [[sexual attraction]], romantic feelings can exist without expectation of [[Consummation|physical consummation]] and be subsequently expressed. [[History|Historically]], the [[Terminology|term]] ''romance'' originates with the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[chivalry]] as set out in the literature of [[chivalric romance]].

== General definitions ==
Romantic love is a [[Relativism|relative]] term{{when defined as|date=September 2018}} that distinguishes moments and situations within [[intimate relationship]]s as contributing to a deepened relational connection.
#The addition of [[Melodrama|"drama"]] to {{clarify span|text=relationships of close, deep and strong love|reason=at least four potential weasel-terms there; please improve|date=April 2018}}.
#Anthropologist [[Charles Lindholm]] defined love as "an intense attraction that involves the idealization of the other, within an erotic context, with expectation of enduring sometime into the future".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. J. (2001). Romance, parenthood, and gender in a modern African society. ''Ethnology'', 129-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical usage ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
The word "romance" comes from the French [[vernacular]] where initially it indicated a [[Narrative poetry|verse narrative]].  The word was originally an adverb of Latin origin, "romanicus," meaning "of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] style". European medieval vernacular tales, [[Epic poetry|epics]], and [[Ballad|ballads]] generally dealt with chivalric adventure, not bringing in the concept of [[love]] until late into the seventeenth century.

The word ''romance'' developed other meanings, such as the early nineteenth century Spanish and Italian definitions of "adventurous" and "passionate," which could intimate both "love affair" and "idealistic quality."

[[File:Codex Manesse Bernger von Horheim.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bernger von Horheim]] in the ''Codex Manesse'' (early 14th century)]]
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] show that there were complex forms of courtship in ancient as well as contemporary primitive societies. There may not be evidence, however, that members of such societies formed loving relationships distinct from their established customs in a way that would parallel modern romance.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss pioneered the scientific study of the betrothal of cross cousins in such societies, as a way of solving such technical problems as the [[avunculate]] and the [[incest taboo]] (''Introducing Lévi-Strauss''), pp. 22–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 18th century, many marriages were not arranged, but rather developed out of more or less spontaneous relationships. After the 18th century, illicit relationships took on a more independent role. In bourgeois marriage, illicitness may have become more formidable and likely to cause tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordan dayal wiki|url=http://nordan.daynal.org/wiki/index.php?title=Romance|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ladies of the Leisure Class'', [[Rutgers University]] professor Bonnie G. Smith depicts courtship and marriage rituals that may be viewed as oppressive to modern people. She writes "When the young women of the Nord married, they did so without illusions of love and romance. They acted within a framework of concern for the reproduction of bloodlines according to financial, professional, and sometimes political interests." Subsequent [[sexual revolution]] has lessened the conflicts arising out of liberalism, but not eliminated them.

[[Anthony Giddens]], in his book ''The Transformation of Intimacy: Sexuality, Love and Eroticism in Modern Society'', states that romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual's life. He adds that telling a story was one of the meanings of romance. According to Giddens, the rise of romantic love more or less coincided with the emergence of the [[novel]]. It was then that romantic love, associated with freedom and therefore the ideals of romantic love, created the ties between freedom and [[self-realization]].

David R. Shumway, in his book ''Romance, Intimacy, and The Marriage Crisis'', states that the discourse of intimacy emerged in the last third of the 20th century and that this discourse claimed to be able to explain how marriage and other relationships worked. For the discourse of intimacy emotional closeness was much more important than [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. This does not mean by any means that intimacy is to replace romance. On the contrary, intimacy and romance coexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KdVa73vN1BgC&amp;dq=modern+love+by+David+R.+Shumway&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Romance, Intimacy, and The Marriage Crisis|accessdate= 2010-07-08|isbn=978-0-8147-9831-7|author1=Shumway, David R|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st century has seen the growth of [[globalization]] and people now live in a world of transformations that affect almost every aspect of our lives, and love has not been the exception. One example of the changes experienced in relationships was explored by Giddens regarding [[homosexual]] relationships. According to Giddens since homosexuals were not able to marry they were forced to pioneer more open and negotiated relationships. These kinds of relationships then permeated the heterosexual population.

Shumway also states that together with the growth of [[capitalism]] the older social relations dissolved, including marriage. Marriage meaning for women changed as they had more socially acceptable alternatives and were less willing to accept unhappy relations and, therefore, divorce rates substantially increased.

The discourse of romance continues to exist today together with intimacy. Shumway states that on the one hand, romance is the part that offers [[adventure]] and intense emotions while offering the possibility to find the perfect mate. On the other hand, intimacy offers deep communication, [[friendship]], and long lasting sharing.

=== Popularization of love ===
The conception of romantic love was popularized in [[Western culture]] by the concept of [[courtly love]]. [[Knight|Chevaliers]], or knights in the [[Middle Ages]], engaged in what were usually non-physical and non-marital relationships with women of nobility whom they served. These relations were highly elaborate and ritualized in a complexity that was steeped in a framework of tradition, which stemmed from theories of etiquette derived out of [[chivalry]] as a moral code of conduct.

Courtly love and the notion of [[domnei]] were often the subjects of [[troubadours]], and could be typically found in artistic endeavors such as lyrical narratives and poetic prose of the time. Since [[marriage]] was commonly nothing more than a formal arrangement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/courtly-love.htm Middle Ages.com - Courtly Love]&lt;/ref&gt; courtly love sometimes permitted expressions of emotional closeness that may have been lacking from the union between husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/medieval/love.html Courtly Love and the origins of romance]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of courtly love, "lovers" did not necessarily refer to those engaging in [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] acts, but rather, to the act of caring and to emotional intimacy.

The bond between a knight and his [[Lady]], or the woman of typically high stature of whom he served, may have escalated psychologically but seldom ever physically.&lt;ref name="employees.oneonta.edu"&gt;[http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/ARTH/arth214_folder/courtly_love_.html A History of Women: Silences of the Middle Ages]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[knighthood]] during the Middle Ages, the intrinsic importance of a code of conduct was in large part as a value system of rules codified as a guide to aid a knight in his capacity as champion of the downtrodden, but especially in his service to the Lord.

In the context of dutiful service to a woman of high social standing, ethics designated as a code were effectively established as an institution to provide a firm moral foundation by which to combat the idea that unfit attentions and affections were to ever be tolerated as "a secret game of trysts" behind closed doors. Therefore, a knight trained in the substance of "chivalry" was instructed, with especial emphasis, to serve a lady most honorably, with purity of heart and mind. To that end, he committed himself to the welfare of both Lord and Lady with unwavering discipline and devotion, while at the same time, presuming to uphold core principles set forth in the code by the religion by which he followed.&lt;ref name="employees.oneonta.edu"/&gt;

Religious meditations upon the [[Virgin Mary]] were partially responsible for the development of chivalry as an ethic and lifestyle:  the concept of the honor of a lady and knightly devotion to her, coupled with an obligatory respect for all women, factored prominently as central to the very identity of medieval knighthood. As knights were increasingly emulated, eventual changes were reflected in the inner-workings of [[feudal]] society. Members of the [[aristocracy]] were schooled in the principles of chivalry, which facilitated important changes in attitudes regarding the value of women.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1994 {{ISBN|0-8028-3783-2}} page 272&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, a knight was to regard himself towards a lady with a transcendence of premeditated thought—his virtue ingrained within his character. A [[Knight|chevalier]] was to conduct himself always graciously, bestowing upon her the utmost courtesy and attentiveness. He was to echo shades of this to all women, regardless of class, age, or status.&lt;ref name=sweeney&gt;[[James Ross Sweeney]] (1983). "Chivalry", in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', Volume III.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the concept of chivalry and the notion of the courtly [[gentleman]] became synonymous with the ideal of how love and romance should exist between the sexes. Through the timeless popularization in art and literature of tales of knights and princesses, kings and queens, a formative and long standing (sub)consciousness helped to shape relationships between men and women.

[[De amore (Andreas Capellanus)|De amore]] or ''The Art of Courtly Love'', as it is known in English, was written in the 12th century. The text is widely misread as permissive of extramarital affairs. However, it is useful to differentiate the physical from without: romantic love as separate and apart from [[courtly love]] when interpreting such topics as: "Marriage is no real excuse for not loving", "He who is not jealous cannot love", "No one can be bound by a double love", and "When made public love rarely endures".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.umd.edu/~marshall/chivalry.html The Art of Courtly Love by Andreas Capellanus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123205411/http://www.astro.umd.edu/~marshall/chivalry.html |date=2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that romantic love evolved independently in multiple cultures. For example, in an article presented by Henry Grunebaum, he argues "[[Psychotherapy|therapists]] mistakenly believe that romantic love is a [[phenomenon]] unique to Western cultures and first expressed by the troubadours of the Middle Ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1752-0606.1997.tb01037.x | volume=23 | title=THINKING ABOUT ROMANTIC/EROTIC LOVE | year=1997 | journal=Journal of Marital and Family Therapy | pages=295–307 | last1 = Grunebaum | first1 = Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more current and Western traditional terminology meaning "court as lover" or the general idea of "romantic love" is believed to have originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, primarily from that of the French culture. This idea is what has spurred the connection between the words "romantic" and "lover", thus [[neologism|coining]] English phrases for romantic love such as "loving like the Romans do". The precise origins of such a connection are unknown, however. Although the word "romance" or the equivalents thereof may not have the same connotation in other cultures, the general idea of "romantic love" appears to have crossed cultures and been accepted as a concept at one point in time or another.

== Types ==
Romantic love is contrasted with [[platonic love]], which in all usages, precludes sexual relations, yet only in the modern usage does it take on a fully [[nonsexual]] sense, rather than the classical sense, in which sexual drives are sublimated. [[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]] tends to be forgotten in casual thought about love aside from its emergence in psychoanalysis and Nietzsche.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[Unrequited love]] can be romantic in different ways: comic, tragic, or in the sense that sublimation itself is comparable to romance, where the spirituality of both art and [[egalitarian]] ideals is combined with strong character and emotions. Unrequited love is typical of the period of [[romanticism]], but the term is distinct from any romance that might arise within it.&lt;ref&gt;Beethoven, however, is the case in point. He had brief relationships with only a few women, always of the nobility. His one actual engagement was broken off mainly because of his conflicts with noble society as a group. This is evidenced in his biography, such as in Maynard Solomon's account.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romantic love may also be classified according to two categories, "popular romance" and "divine or spiritual" romance:

;Popular romance: may include but is not limited to the following types: idealistic, normal intense (such as the emotional aspect of "[[falling in love]]"), predictable as well as unpredictable, consuming (meaning consuming of time, energy and emotional withdrawals and bids), intense but out of control (such as the aspect of "falling out of love") material and commercial (such as societal gain mentioned in a later section of this article), physical and sexual, and finally grand and demonstrative.
;Divine (or spiritual) romance: may include, but is not limited to these following types: realistic, as well as plausible unrealistic, optimistic as well as pessimistic (depending upon the particular beliefs held by each person within the relationship.), abiding (e.g. the theory that each person had a predetermined stance as an agent of choice; such as "choosing a husband" or "choosing a soul mate."), non-abiding (e.g. the theory that we do not choose our actions, and therefore our romantic love involvement has been drawn from sources outside of ourselves), predictable as well as unpredictable, self-control (such as obedience and sacrifice within the context of the relationship) or lack thereof (such as disobedience within the context of the relationship), emotional and personal, soulful (in the theory that the mind, soul, and body, are one connected entity), intimate, and infinite (such as the idea that love itself or the love of a [[god]] or God's "unconditional" love is or could be everlasting)&lt;ref&gt;Romance In Marriage: Perspectives, Pitfalls, and Principles, by Jason S. Carroll http://ce.byu.edu/cw/cwfamily/archives/2003/Carroll.Jason.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
=== Plato ===
[[File:Eros bow Musei Capitolini MC410.jpg|thumb|Roman copy of a Greek sculpture by [[Lysippus]] depicting [[Eros]], the Greek personification of romantic love]]

Greek philosophers and authors have had many theories of love. Some of these theories are presented in [[Plato]]'s ''Symposium''. Six Athenian friends, including Socrates, drink wine and each give a speech praising the [[deity]] [[Eros]]. When his turn comes, [[Aristophanes]] says in his [[myth]]ical speech that sexual partners seek each other because they are descended from beings with spherical torsos, two sets of human limbs, genitalia on each side, and two faces back to back. Their three forms included the three permutations of pairs of gender (i.e. one masculine and masculine, another feminine and feminine, and the third masculine and feminine) and they were split by the gods to thwart the creatures' assault on heaven, recapitulated, according to the comic playwright, in other myths such as the [[Aloadae]].&lt;ref&gt;''Symposium 189d ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

This story is relevant to modern romance partly because of the image of reciprocity it shows between the sexes. In the final speech before [[Alcibiades]] arrives, [[Socrates]] gives his encomium of love and desire as a lack of being, namely, the being or form of [[beauty]].

=== René Girard ===

Though there are many theories of romantic love—such as that of [[Robert Sternberg]], in which it is merely a mean combining liking and [[sexual desire]]—the major theories involve far more insight. For most of the 20th century, Freud's theory of the family drama dominated theories of romance and sexual relationships. This gave rise to a few counter-theories. Theorists like Deleuze counter Freud and [[Jacques Lacan]] by attempting to return to a more naturalistic philosophy:

[[René Girard]] argues that romantic attraction is a product of [[jealousy]] and rivalry—particularly in a [[love triangle|triangular form]].

Girard, in any case, downplays romance's individuality in favor of [[jealousy]] and the [[love triangle]], arguing that romantic attraction arises primarily in the observed attraction between two others. A natural objection is that this is [[circular reasoning]], but Girard means that a small measure of attraction reaches a critical point insofar as it is caught up in [[mimesis]]. Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', ''As You Like It'', and ''The Winter's Tale'' are the best known examples of competitive-induced romance.&lt;ref&gt;In works such as ''A Theatre of Envy'' and ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World'', Girard presents this mostly original theory, though finding a major precedent in Shakespeare on the structure of rivalry, claiming that it—rather than Freud's theory of the primal horde—is the origin of religion, ethics, and all aspects of sexual relations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Girard's theory of mimetic desire is controversial because of its alleged [[sexism]]. This view has to some extent supplanted its predecessor, Freudian Oedipal theory. It may find some spurious support in the supposed attraction of women to aggressive men. As a technique of attraction, often combined with irony, it is sometimes advised that one feign toughness and disinterest, but it can be a trivial or crude idea to promulgate to men, and it is not given with much understanding of mimetic desire in mind. Instead, cultivating a spirit of self-sacrifice, coupled with an attitude of appreciation or contemplation, directed towards the other of one's attractions, constitutes the ideals of what we consider to be true romantic love. Mimesis is always the desire to possess, in renouncing it we offer ourselves as a sacrificial gift to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Things Hidden from the Foundation of the World, Rene Girard, Stanford University Press, 1978, pp. 283–350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mimetic desire is often challenged by [[feminists]], such as [[Toril Moi]],&lt;ref&gt;The Missing Mother: The Oedipal Rivalries of René Girard. Toril Moi, Diacritics Vol. 12, No. 2, Cherchez la Femme Feminist Critique/Feminine Text (Summer, 1982), pp. 21–31&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that it does not account for the woman as inherently desired.

Though the centrality of rivalry is not itself a cynical view, it does emphasize the mechanical in love relations. In that sense, it does resonate with [[capitalism]] and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] native to post-modernity. Romance in this context leans more on fashion and irony, though these were important for it in less emancipated times. [[Sexual revolution]]s have brought change to these areas. Wit or irony therefore encompass an instability of romance that is not entirely new but has a more central social role, fine-tuned to certain modern peculiarities and subversion originating in various social revolutions, culminating mostly in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;A contemporary irony toward romance is perhaps the expression "throwing game" or simply game. In Marxism the romantic might be considered an example of alienation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arthur Schopenhauer ===

The process of courtship also contributed to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism, despite his own romantic success,&lt;ref&gt;''Essays and Aphorisms''&lt;/ref&gt; and he argued that to be rid of the challenge of courtship would drive people to suicide with boredom. Schopenhauer theorized that individuals seek partners who share certain interests and tastes, while at the same time looking for a "complement" or completing of themselves in a partner, as in the [[cliché]] that "opposites attract", but with the added consideration that both partners manifest this attraction for the sake of the species:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what ultimately draws two individuals of different sex exclusively to each other with such power is the will-to-live which manifests itself in the whole species, and here anticipates, in the individual that these two can produce, an objectification of its true nature corresponding to its aims. 
—''World as Will and Representation'', Volume 2, Chapter XLIV&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
Later modern philosophers such as [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[David Hume]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] also focused on [[morality]], but desire was central to French thought and Hume himself tended to adopt a French worldview and temperament. Desire in this milieu meant a very general idea termed "the passions", and this general interest was distinct from the contemporary idea of "passionate" now equated with "romantic". Love was a central topic again in the subsequent movement of [[Romanticism]], which focused on such things as absorption in nature and the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], as well as [[Platonic love|platonic]] and unrequited love in German philosophy and literature.

French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] linked this idea of love as a lack mainly to [[Sigmund Freud]], and Deleuze often criticized it.

== In literature ==
[[File:DickseeRomeoandJuliet.jpg|thumb|upright|Archetypal lovers [[Romeo and Juliet]] portrayed by [[Frank Bernard Dicksee|Frank Dicksee]]]]

Shakespeare and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] share a similar viewpoint that marriage and romance are not harmoniously ''in tune'' with each other. In Shakespeare's ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', for example, "...there has not been, nor is there at this point, any display of affection between Isabella and the Duke, if by affection we mean something concerned with sexual attraction. The two at the end of the play love each other as they love virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nathan | first1 = Norman | year = 1956 | title = The Marriage of Duke Vincentio and Isabella | url = | journal = Shakespeare Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 43–45 | doi=10.2307/2866112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', in saying "all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage", [[Romeo]] implies that it is not marriage with Juliet that he seeks but simply to be joined with her romantically.

Kierkegaard addressed these ideas in works such as ''Either/Or'' and ''[[Stages on Life's Way]]'':
{{quote|''In the first place, I find it comical that all men are in love and want to be in love, and yet one never can get any illumination upon the question what the lovable, i.e., the proper object of love, really is.''
— ''Stages'', p. 48}}
In ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', British writer [[Iain King]] tried to establish rules for romance  applicable across most cultures.  He concluded on six rules, including:
# Do not flirt with someone unless you might mean it.
# Do not pursue people who you are not interested in, or who are not interested in you.
# In general, express your affection or uncertainty clearly, unless there is a special reason not to.&lt;ref&gt;''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', 2008, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tragedy and other social issues ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The "tragic" contradiction between romance and society is most forcibly portrayed in literature, in Tolstoy's ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', in Flaubert's ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The female protagonists in such stories are driven to suicide as if dying for a cause of freedom from various oppressions of marriage.

Even after sexual revolutions, on the other hand, to the extent that it does not lead to procreation (or child-rearing, as it also might exist in [[same-sex marriage]]), romance remains peripheral though it may have virtues in the relief of [[Stress (physics)|stress]], as a source of inspiration or adventure, or in development and the strengthening of certain social relations. It is difficult to imagine the tragic heroines, however, as having such practical considerations in mind.

Romance can also be tragic in its conflict with society. The [[Tolstoy]] family focuses on the romantic limitations of marriage, and [[Anna Karenina]] prefers death to being married to her fiancé, however this is because she is tired of waiting and being hidden away from public, when her fiance makes failed attempts to get his mother's approval of the marriage. Even being aristocrats did not make them both free, as the society was nevertheless equally binding for all. Furthermore, in the speech about marriage that is given in Kierkegaard's ''[[Either/Or]]'', Kierkegaard attempts to show that it is because marriage is lacking in passion fundamentally, that the nature of marriage, unlike romance, is explainable by a man who has experience of neither marriage nor love.

Reciprocity of the sexes appears in the ancient world primarily in myth where it is in fact often{{when|date=July 2018}} the subject of tragedy, for example in the myths of [[Theseus]] and [[Atalanta]]. Noteworthy female freedom or power was an exception rather than the rule, though this is a matter of speculation and debate.

== Psychology ==
{{cleanup|date=September 2018|reason=Very awkward prose. No indication why the cited authors are significant.}}
Many theorists attempt to analyze the process of romantic love.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Anthropologist [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], in her book ''Why We Love'',&lt;ref&gt;Helen Fisher, 2004, "Why We Love" Henry Holt and Company LLC, 175 Fifth Ave. New York, NY 10010, {{ISBN|0-8050-7796-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses brain scans to show that love is the product of a chemical reaction in the brain. [[Norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], among other brain chemicals, are responsible for excitement and bliss in humans as well as non-human animals. She is famous{{peacock term|date=September 2018}} for the use of MRI to study the brain activity of a person "in love", discovering the importance of the [[ventral tegmental area]] and the [[caudate nucleus]]{{jargon inline|date=September 2018}} in this biological drive. Fisher concludes that these reactions have a genetic basis, and therefore love is a natural drive as powerful as hunger.

In his book ''What Women Want, What Men Want'',&lt;ref&gt;John Townsend, 1998, "What Women Want, What Men Want" Oxford University Press, United Kingdom {{ISBN|978-0-19-511488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist John Townsend takes the genetic basis of love one step further by identifying how the sexes are different in their predispositions. Townsend's compilation of various research projects concludes that men are susceptible to youth and beauty, whereas women are susceptible to status and security. These differences are part of a natural selection process where males seek many healthy women of childbearing age to mother offspring, and women seek men who are willing and able to take care of them and their children.

Psychologist Karen Horney in her article "The Problem of the Monogamous Ideal",&lt;ref&gt;Karen Horney, 1967, "Feminine Psychology," W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., New, York, NY {{ISBN|0-393-31080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the overestimation of love leads to disillusionment; the desire to possess the partner results in the partner wanting to escape; and the friction against sex result in non-fulfillment. Disillusionment plus the desire to escape plus non-fulfillment result in a secret hostility, which causes the other partner to feel alienated. Secret hostility in one and secret alienation in the other cause the partners to secretly hate each other. This secret hate often leads one or the other or both to seek love objects outside the marriage or relationship.

Psychologist Harold Bessell in his book ''The Love Test'',&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bessell, 1984 "The Love Test," Warner Books, 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10103, {{ISBN|0-446-32582-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; reconciles the opposing forces noted by the above researchers and shows that there are two factors that determine the quality of a relationship. Bessell proposes that people are drawn together by a force he calls "romantic attraction", which is a combination of genetic and cultural factors. This force may be weak or strong and may be felt to different degrees by each of the two love partners. The other factor is "emotional maturity", which is the degree to which a person is capable of providing good treatment in a love relationship. It can thus be said that an immature person is more likely to overestimate love, become disillusioned, and have an affair whereas a mature person is more likely to see the relationship in realistic terms and act constructively to work out problems.

Romantic love, in the abstract sense of the term, is traditionally considered to involve a mix of emotional and sexual desire for another as a [[person]]. However, [[Lisa M. Diamond]], a [[University of Utah]] [[psychology]] professor, proposes that sexual desire and romantic love are functionally independent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that romantic love is not intrinsically oriented to same-gender or other-gender partners. She also proposes that the links between love and desire are bidirectional as opposed to unilateral. Furthermore, Diamond does not state that one's sex has priority over another sex (a male or female) in romantic love because her theory suggests{{according to whom|date=September 2018}} it is as possible for someone who is [[homosexual]] to fall in love with someone of the other gender as for someone who is [[heterosexual]] to fall in love with someone of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Martie Haselton, a psychologist at [[UCLA]], considers romantic love a "commitment device" or mechanism that encourages two humans to form a lasting bond. She has explored the evolutionary rationale that has shaped modern romantic love and has concluded that long-lasting relationships are helpful to ensure that children reach reproductive age and are fed and cared for by two parents. Haselton and her [[colleagues]] have found evidence in their experiments that suggest love's [[adaptation]]. The first part of the [[experiment]]s consists of having people think about how much they love someone and then suppress thoughts of other attractive people. In the second part of the experiment the same people are asked to think about how much they sexually desire those same partners and then try to suppress thoughts about others. The results showed that love is more efficient in pushing out those rivals than [[sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1704665,00.html| title=Romance Is An Illusion|date=2008-01-17|accessdate= 2010-07-08 | work=Time | first=Carl | last=Zimmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the University of Pavia{{who|date=September 2018}} suggests that romantic love lasts for about a year (similar to [[limerence]]) before being replaced by a more stable, non-passionate "[[companionate love]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4478040.stm | work=BBC News | title=Romantic love 'lasts just a year' | date=2005-11-28 | accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In companionate love, changes occur from the early stage of love to when the relationship becomes more established and romantic feelings seem to end. However, research from Stony Brook University in New York suggests that some couples keep romantic feelings alive for much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/04/true.love.found/index.html | work=CNN | title=Scientists: True love can last a lifetime | accessdate=2010-04-10 | date=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment patterns===

[[Attachment styles]] that people develop as children can influence the way that they interact with partners in adult relationships, with secure attachment styles being associated with healthier and more trusting relationships than avoidant or anxious attachment styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ainsworth|first=M|title=Infant-mother attachments|journal=American Psychologist|year=1979|volume=34|issue=10|pages=932–937|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.34.10.932|pmid=517843}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=J|title=Influence of attachment styles on romantic relationships|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=59|issue=5|pages=971–980|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazen and Shaver found that adult romantic attachment styles were similar to the categories of secure, avoidant, and anxious that had previously been studied in children’s attachments to their caregivers, demonstrating that attachment styles are stable across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazen|first=C|author2=Shaver, P |title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1987|volume=52|issue=3|pages=511–524|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511|pmid=3572722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, researchers distinguished between dismissive avoidant attachment and fearful avoidant attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartholomew|first=K|author2=Horowitz, L |title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=61|issue=2|pages=226–244|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226|pmid=1920064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have found that secure adult attachment, leading to the ability for intimacy and confidence in relationship stability, is characterized by low attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, while the fearful style is high on both dimensions, the dismissing style is low on anxiety and high on avoidance, and the preoccupied style is high on anxiety and low on avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=K|author2=Clark, C |author3=Shaver, P |title=Self-report measurement of adult attachment.

=== Romantic love definition/operationalization ===
Singer (1984a,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Irving|title=The Nature of Love: Vol. 1. Plato to Luther|year=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1984b,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Irving|title=The Nature of Love: Vol. 2.

The modern world|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;) first defined love based on four [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] terms: ''eros'', meaning the search for beauty; ''philia'', the feelings of affection in close friendships, ''nomos'', the submission of and obedience to higher or divine powers, and ''agape'', the bestowal of love and affection for the divine powers. While Singer did believe that love was important to world culture, he did not believe that romantic love played a major role (Singer, 1987&lt;ref name="Singer 1987"/&gt;). However, Susan Hendrick and Clyde Hendrick at Texas Tech University (1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrick|first=S.

S. |editor=S. J. Lopez &amp; C. R.  Snyder}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have theorized that romantic love will play an increasingly important cultural role in the future, as it is considered an important part of living a fulfilling life. They also theorized that love in long-term romantic relationships has only been the product of cultural forces that came to fruition within the past 300 years. By cultural forces, they mean the increasing prevalence of individualistic ideologies, which are the result of an inward shift of many cultural worldviews.

=== Passionate and companionate love ===
Researchers have determined that romantic love is a complex emotion that can be divided into either passionate or companionate forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brogaard|first=B.|title=On Romantic Love|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berscheid and Walster (1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berscheid|first=E.|title=Interpersonal Attraction (2nd ed.)|year=1978|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=Reading, MA|author2=Walster, E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Hatfield (1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatfield|first=E.|title=The Psychology of Love|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|pages=191–217|editor=R. J. Sternberg &amp; M. I. Barnes|chapter=Passionate and companionate love}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that these two forms can co-exist, either simultaneously or intermittently. Passionate love is an arousal-driven emotion that often gives people extreme feelings of happiness, and can also give people feelings of anguish.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Companionate love is a form that creates a steadfast bond between two people, and gives people feelings of peace. Researchers have described the stage of passionate love as "being on cocaine", since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansari|first1=Aziz|last2=Klinenberg|first2=Eric|title=Modern Romance|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=9781594206276|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that passionate love (as with [[limerence]]) lasts for about twelve to eighteen months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansari|first1=Aziz|last2=Klinenberg|first2=Eric|title=Modern Romance|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=9781594206276|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Firestone, a psychologist, has a theory of the fantasy bond, which is what is mostly created after the passionate love has faded. A couple may start to feel really comfortable with each other to the point that they see each other as simply companions or protectors, but yet think that they are still in love with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Firestone|first1=Robert|title=The Fantasy Bond: A substitute for a truly loving relationship|url=http://www.psychalive.org/the-fantasy-bond-substitute-for-a-loving-relationship/|website=PSYCHALIVE|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results to the fantasy bond is the leading to companionate love. 
Hendrick and Hendrick (1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendrick|first=S. S.|author2=Hendrick, C. |title=Gender differences and similarities in sex and love|journal=Personal Relationships|year=1995|volume=2|issue=1|pages=55–65|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00077.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) studied college students who were in the early stages of a relationship and found that almost half reported that their significant other was their closest friend, providing evidence that both passionate and companionate love exist in new relationships. Conversely, in a study of long-term marriages, researchers (Contreras, Hendrick, and Hendrick, 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Contreras|first=R.|author2=Hendrick, S. S. |author3=Hendrick, C. |title=Perspectives of Marital Love and Satisfaction in Mexican American and Anglo-American Couples|journal=Journal of Counseling &amp; Development|year=1996|volume=74|issue=4|pages=408–415|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1996.tb01887.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that couples endorsed measures of both companionate love and passionate love and that passionate love was the strongest predictor of marital satisfaction, showing that both types of love can endure throughout the years.

=== The triangular theory of love ===
Psychologist Robert Sternberg (1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=R. J.|title=A Triangular Theory of love|journal=Psychological Review|year=1986|volume=93|pages=119–135|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.93.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;) developed the [[triangular theory of love]]. He theorized that love is a combination of three main components: passion (physical arousal); intimacy (psychological feelings of closeness); and commitment (the sustaining of a relationship). He also theorized that the different combinations of these three components could yield up to seven different forms of love. These include popularized forms such as romantic love (intimacy and passion) and consummate love (passion, intimacy, and commitment). The other forms are liking (intimacy), companionate love (intimacy and commitment), empty love (commitment), fatuous love (passion and commitment), and infatuation (passion).
Studies on Sternberg’s theory love found that intimacy most strongly predicted marital satisfaction in married couples, with passion also being an important predictor (Silberman, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silberman|first=S.|title=The relationships among love, marital satisfaction and duration of marriage|journal=Doctoral dissertation, Arizona State University|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;). On the other hand, Acker and Davis (1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acker|first=M.|author2=Davis, M. H. |title=Intimacy, passion and commitment in adult romantic relationships: A test of the triangular theory of love|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|year=1992|volume=9|issue=1|pages=21–50|doi=10.1177/0265407592091002}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that commitment was the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction, especially for long-term relationships.

=== The self-expansion theory of romantic love ===
Researchers Arthur and Elaine Aron (1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aron|first=A.|title=Love and the expansion of self: Understanding attraction and satisfaction|year=1986|publisher=Hemisphere|location=New York|author2=Aron, E. N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) theorized that humans have a basic drive to expand their self-concepts. Further, their experience with Eastern concepts of love caused them to believe that positive emotions, cognitions, and relationships in romantic behaviors all drive the expansion of a person’s self-concept. A study following college students for 10 weeks showed that those students who fell in love over the course of the investigation reported higher feelings of self-esteem and self efficacy than those who did not (Aron, Paris, and Aron, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aron|first=A.|author2=Paris, M. |author3=Aron, E. N. |title=Falling in love: Prospective studies of self-concept change|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1102–1112|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1102}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Mindful relationships ===
Harvey and Ormarzu (1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=J. H.|author2=Ormarzu, J. |title=Minding the close relationship|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=1997|volume=1|pages=223–239|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0103_3|pmid=15659351}}&lt;/ref&gt;) developed a model of minding relationships with five key components: seeking to know and be known by the other; using knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship; accepting the other person; being motivated to continue this process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and developing a sense of appreciation in the relationship. Each of these components is considered adaptive, however, nonadaptive steps to minding a relationship were also theorized by the research team. The five nonadaptive components include: one or both partners out of step in seeking to know and be known by the other; not using the knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship (or using that knowledge to hurt the other); low acceptance and respect for the other person; not being motivated to continue the process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and failing to develop a sense of appreciation in a relationship. Gottman studies the components of a flourishing romantic relationship have been studied in the lab (1994;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|title=What predicts divorce?: The relationship between marital processes and marital outcomes|year=1994|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottman &amp; Silver, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|title=The seven principles for making marriage work|year=1999|publisher=Random House LLC.|location=New York|author2=Silver, N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;). He used physiological and behavioral measures during couples’ interactions to predict relationship success and found that five positive interactions to one negative interaction are needed to maintain a healthy relationship. He established a therapy intervention for couples that focused on civil forms of disapproval, a culture of appreciation, acceptance of responsibility for problems, and self-soothing (Gottman, Driver, &amp; Tabares, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|title=Clinical Handbook of Couple Therapy, 3rd Edition|year=2002|publisher=Guilford PRess|location=New York|author2=Driver, J. |author3=Tabares, A. |editor=A. S. Gurman and N. S. Jacobson|chapter=Building the Sound Marital House: An empirically-derived couple therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Relationship behaviors ===
The most recent{{cn|date=April 2018}} research on romantic love and relationships focuses on behaviors that either sustain a relationship or aid in its dissolution. These behaviors can be considered either appetitive or aversive. Appetitive relationship processes are considered the promotion of positive relationship behaviors, as determined by psychologists Gable and Reis (2001,&lt;ref name="Gable 2001 169–194"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gable|first=S. L.|title=Close romantic relationships: Maintenance and Enhancement|year=2001|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=169–194|author2=Reis, H. T. |editor=J. Harvey &amp; A. Wenzel|chapter=Appetitive and aversive social interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003&lt;ref name="Gable 2003 349–372"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gable|first=S. L.|author2=Reis, H. T. |author3=Elliot, A. J. |title=Evidence for bivariate systems: An empirical test of appetition and aversion across domains|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year=2003|volume=37|issue=5|pages=349–372|doi=10.1016/s0092-6566(02)00580-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Aversive relationship processes are described as eliminating behaviors that have a negative effect on relationships (Gable and Reis 2001,&lt;ref name="Gable 2001 169–194"/&gt; 2003&lt;ref name="Gable 2003 349–372"/&gt;). This new research has also allowed relationship success to be predicted as a function of these appetitive and aversive processes. This is all related to research that shows that sharing positive life events with one’s partner is related to greater relationship satisfaction and intimacy (Gable et al., 2004&lt;ref name="Gable 2004 511–524"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gable|first=S. L.|author2=Reis, H. T. |author3=Impett, E. A. |author4=Asher, E. R. |title=What do you do when things go right? The intrapersonal and interpersonal benefits of sharing positive events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=87|issue=2|pages=511–524 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228 |pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In research by Gable et al. (2003) appetitive (promotion of positive relationship behaviors) and aversive (elimination of negative relationship behaviors) processes are independent constructs. A specific type of appetitive processing, capitalization, leads to increased relationship satisfaction and intimacy when one member of the relationship tells the other about positive life events and receive quality reactions and feedback from the partner (Gable, Reis, Impett, &amp; Asher, 2004&lt;ref name="Gable 2004 511–524"/&gt;).

==Physiology==
Researchers such as Feeney and Noller question the stability of attachment style across the life span since studies that measured attachment styles at time points ranging from 2 weeks to 8 months found that 1 out of 4 adults' attachment style changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feeney|first=J|author2=Noller, P |title=Adult Attachment|year=1996|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a study by Lopez and Gormley found that attachment styles could change during the first year of college and that changes to more secure attachment styles were associated with adjustments in self-confidence ratings and coping styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lopez|first=F|author2=Gormley, B |title=Stability and change in adult attachment style over the first-year college transition: Relations to self-confidence, coping, and distress patterns|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|year=2002|volume=49|issue=3|pages=355–364|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.49.3.355}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, attachment styles in childhood mirror the ones found in adult romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=N|author2=Reads, S |title=Adult attachment, working models, and relationship quality in dating couples|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=58|issue=4|pages=644–663|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.4.644}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research has shown that building interpersonal connections strengthens neural regulatory systems that are involved in emotions of empathy, enjoyment of positive social events, and stress management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schore|first=A|title=Affect regulation and the origin of the self: The neurobiology of emotional development|year=1994|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S|author2=Dickerson, S. |author3=Klein, L. |title=oward a biology of social support|journal=Handbook of positive psychology|year=2002|pages=556–569}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing evidence that early social interactions affect adult relationships.

Another topic of controversy in the field of romantic relationships is that of [[domestic abuse]]. Following the theory that romantic love evolved as a byproduct of survival, it can be said that in some instances, it has turned into a [[maladaptation]]. [[Oxytocin]] is a neurophysical hormone produced in the brain. It is known to cause a decrease in stress response. It also can cause an increase in feelings of [[attachment theory|attachment]]. In the beginning stages of a romantic relationship, OT levels surge and then remain relatively stable over the duration of the relationship. The higher the surge of OT, the greater the likelihood is of partners staying together.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, J., Caetano, R., &amp; Clark, C. L. (1998). Rates of intimate partner violence in the United States. American journal of public health, 88(11), 1702-1704.&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in increasing positive interpersonal behaviors such as trust, altruism, empathy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kosfeld | first1 = M. | last2 = Heinrichs | first2 = M. | last3 = Zak | first3 = P. J. | last4 = Fischbacher | first4 = U. | last5 = Fehr | first5 = E. | year = 2005 | title = Oxytocin increases trust in humans | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7042| pages = 673–676 | doi=10.1038/nature03701 | pmid=15931222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This response is not universal and can in fact, cause the opposite to occur depending on environment and individual. Individuals ranked high in [[rejection sensitivity]] exhibited aggressive tendencies and decreased willingness for cooperation, indicating a link between oxytocin and relationship maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Bartz, J., Simeon, D., Hamilton, H., Kim, S., Crystal, S., Braun, A., ... &amp; Hollander, E. (2010). Oxytocin can hinder trust and cooperation in borderline personality disorder. Social cognitive and affective neuroscience, nsq085.&lt;/ref&gt;

The feelings associated with romantic love function to ensure the greater reproductive fitness of individuals. The obligations of individuals in romantic relationships to preserve these bonds are based in [[kin selection]] theory, where by exhibiting aggressive behavior, a mate can use intimidation and [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] to ward off other potential predators, thus protecting the pair bond and their actual or potential offspring. This has however evolved to the point where it has become detrimental to the fitness of individuals; what is causing attachment to occur in a relationship, is now causing one partner to harm the other.

In the search for the root of intimate partner violence, intranasal oxytocin was administered to a control group and a group of participants with aggressive tendencies. Participants were then surveyed on how willing they were to engage in 5 behaviors towards their romantic partner. What they found was that oxytocin increased IPV inclinations only among the participants with a predisposition towards aggressive tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;DeWall, C. N., Gillath, O., Pressman, S. D., Black, L. L., Bartz, J. A., Moskovitz, J., &amp; Stetler, D. A. (2014). When the Love Hormone Leads to Violence Oxytocin Increases Intimate Partner Violence Inclinations Among High Trait Aggressive People. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 1948550613516876&lt;/ref&gt; Oxytocin decreases trust and prosocial behavior in individuals with interpersonal difficulties. This, coupled with its role in relationship maintenance, illustrates that oxytocin serves to instill a sense of territoriality and protectiveness towards a mate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14819">'''Sexual bullying''' is a type of [[bullying]] and [[Sexual harassment|harassment]] that occurs in connection with a person's [[sex]], body,  [[sexual orientation]] or with [[sexual activity]]. It can be [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], or [[emotional abuse|emotional]].

==Definition==
The [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] has defined sexual bullying as "any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology."&lt;ref name=NSPCC02 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The erstwhile [[Beatbullying]] organisation (now defunct) had a similar definition.&lt;ref name=BB01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbclic.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=56 |title=What is sexual bullying?  |publisher=[[Beatbullying]] |date= |accessdate=24 Apr 2010 |quote = {{dead link|date=July 2018}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be the use of sexual words to put someone down, like calling someone a slut, a slag, or gay, or spreading rumours about someone's alleged sex life. In its most extreme form, it can be inappropriate touching, [[sexual assault]] or even [[rape]].&lt;ref name=BB01 /&gt; This term is primarily used in the United Kingdom and is not yet used in other areas.
Definitions and descriptions of bullying and of sexual bullying can be problematic, however. Offensive terms are often deployed in a friendly way, so the context of such exchanges is very important, and adults sometimes misinterpret them. Conversely, while much sexual bullying is overt, a great deal is not, and appears to be ordinary bullying. An example of this is the teasing by tough boys of a 'geeky' boy for his academic ability. What is actually happening is that the boy is being mocked for his lack of machismo, or his lack of engagement in heterosexist banter with girls or boys. Superficially, the bullying has no sexual content, but is underpinned by the aggressors staking a claim to dominance for their 'type of boy' (See Mac An Ghaill, 1994 and Duncan, 1999).

==Prevalence==
As part of its research into sexual bullying in schools, the [[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] programme commissioned a
questionnaire aimed at young people aged 11–19 years in schools and youth clubs across five regions of [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBC01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_7811000/7811468.stm |title=Rising problem of sexual bullying in schools |publisher=[[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]  |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey revealed that of the 273 young people who responded to the questionnaire, 28 had been forced to do something sexual and 31 had seen it happen to someone else. Of the 273 respondents, 40 had experienced unwanted touching.&lt;ref name=NSPCC01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/questions/sexual_bullying_wda70106.html |title=What is sexual bullying and how can I manage it within educational settings? |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Government figures show that in school year 2007/8 there were 3,450 fixed period exclusions and 120 permanent exclusions from schools in [[England]] due to sexual misconduct.&lt;ref name=DCSF01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000860/index.shtml |title=Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusions from Schools in England 2007/08 |publisher=UK Government's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That equates to 19 exclusions per school day&lt;ref name=BB02 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbclic.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=145&amp;Itemid=48 |title=Beatbullying on Panorama tonight to discuss Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[Beatbullying]] |date= |accessdate=24 Apr 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for incidents including groping and using sexually insulting language. From April 2008 to March 2009, [[ChildLine]] counselled a total of 156,729 children. Of these, 26,134 children spoke about bullying as a main concern and 300 of these talked specifically about sexual bullying.&lt;ref name=NSPCC03 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/policyandpublicaffairs/policysummaries/sexual_bullying_in_education_settings_wdf68771.pdf |title=NSPCC policy summary. |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25% of children who have attended [[Kidscape]] free ZAP anti-bullying sessions have reported some form of sexual bullying.&lt;ref name=kc01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidscape.org.uk/info/sexualbullying.asp |title=Sexual 7 Bullying |publisher=[[Kidscape]] |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122220056/http://kidscape.org.uk/info/sexualbullying.asp |archivedate=22 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant proportion of LGBT students experience homophobic and transphobic violence in school. This is shown consistently by data from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America and the Pacific, with the proportion affected ranging from 16 per cent in Nepal to 85 per cent in the United States. LGBT students are also more likely to experience such violence at school than at home or in the community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LGBT students report a higher prevalence of violence at school than their non-LGBT peers. In New Zealand, for example, lesbian, gay and bisexual students were three times more likely to be bullied than their heterosexual peers and in Norway 15–48 per cent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students reported being bullied compared with 7 per cent of heterosexual students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types of interactions==
A survey by the UK National Union of Teachers suggests that sexual bullying is most often carried out by boys against girls, although girls are increasingly harassing girls and boys in a sexual manner.&lt;ref name=NUT01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/10552 |title=NUT policy statement on preventing sexual harassment and bullying |publisher=[[National Union of Teachers]] |date= |accessdate=25 Apr 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717025547/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/10552 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil01 &gt;Sexual Bullying: Gender Conflict and Pupil Culture in Secondary schools, Neil Duncan, Routledge,1999&lt;/ref&gt; shows that sexual bullying starts at primary school level and usually  takes the form of verbal insults by boys directed at girls and women through demeaning sexually abusive and aggressive language. A NUT study&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NUT02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/4954 |title=A Serious Business: an NUT Report on sexism and harassment in schools |publisher=National Union of Teachers |work=University of Warwick |year=2006 |accessdate=25 Apr 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609071015/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/4954 |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that these verbal insults are generally centred on girls' sexual status including terms such as 'bitch', 'slag', 'tart' and 'slut'. Other researchers cite similar evidence.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Divide: Gender in the primary school, M Clark, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents are typically dismissed as playful behaviour or justified through humour, however.&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt; The research also shows that boys are also subjected to a range of sexual bullying by other boys and by girls although this is said to be less obvious. The most prevalent issue is sexual verbal abuse and being called obscene names. The names that cause most offence to boys are homophobic terms and those that are associated with the 'absence' of high status masculinity.&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil01/&gt; Sexual bullying can involve spreading rumours about someone's sexuality or sex life,&lt;ref name="Womankind guide"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=C.|last2=Wharf|first2=H.|title=Stop sexual bullying: Preventing violence, promoting equality: Act now|url=http://www.womankind.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/published-YP-report-Nov-2010.pdf|website=WOMANKIND Worldwide|publisher=WOMANKIND Worldwide|accessdate=23 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203094243/http://www.womankind.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/published-YP-report-Nov-2010.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or showing or posting sexual comments, photos, or videos,&lt;ref name=Kidshealth&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual harassment and sexual bullying|url=http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/guys/harassment.html#|website=TeensHealth|publisher=The Nemours Foundation|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[revenge porn]].

Some people, including the UK charity [[Beatbullying]], have claimed that children are being bullied into providing 'sexual favours' in exchange for protection as gang culture enters inner city schools.&lt;ref name=BBC02 &gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6500005.stm |title= Girls bullied for 'sex favours'  |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= 27 March 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-bullying groups and teachers' unions, including the [[National Union of Teachers]], challenged the charity to provide evidence of this, as they had no evidence that this sort of behaviour was happening in schools.&lt;ref name=BBC02 /&gt;

==Associated effects and risks==
[[Bullying]] victimization occurs more frequently in [[sexual minorities]] than [[heterosexual]] individuals.&lt;ref name="Ref1 Phys Health Disparities"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=J.

'''Susan Anderson''' (January 31, 1870 – April 16, 1960) was an American [[physician]] and one of the first women to practice medicine in [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=cvl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloradovirtuallibrary.org/content/susan-anderson|title=Susan Anderson, Mountain Doctor|work=Colorado Virtual Library|publisher=Colorado State Library|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Anderson was born in 1870 in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], and later moved to [[Kansas]]. Her parents divorced when she was young, and she lived with her father, younger brother, and grandmother. After she graduated from high school in 1891, her family moved to [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]] after gold had been discovered there. Although she originally wanted to work as a [[telegraph operator]], she was encouraged by her father to attend medical school at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=cvl/&gt;

Anderson became a licensed physician after graduating from medical school in 1897. She returned to Cripple Creek before moving around Colorado in attempt to practice in [[Denver]], [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]] and [[Eaton, Colorado|Eaton]], but found it difficult to find work.&lt;ref name=cvl/&gt;&lt;ref name=cgw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogreatwomen.org/index.php/item/104-susan-anderson|title= Susan "Doc Susie" Anderson|publisher=[[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was briefly engaged but was left at the altar by her fiancé in 1900.&lt;ref name=bhm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessheroinemagazine.com/heroine-of-history-susan-anderson/|title=Heroine of History – Susan Anderson: Care-taker for All|first=Kat|last=Michels|date=June 14, 2013|work=Business Heroine Magazine|accessdate=June 1, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602204117/http://businessheroinemagazine.com/heroine-of-history-susan-anderson/|archivedate=June 2, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, she was appointed Coroner of [[Grand County, Colorado]], during which time she investigated many of the deaths involved in the construction of the [[Moffat Tunnel]] railroad.&lt;ref name=cgw/&gt;

After contracting [[tuberculosis]] in 1907, Anderson relocated to [[Fraser, Colorado]], where residents affectionately nicknamed her "Doc Susie"; for 49 years, she was the only physician in Fraser.&lt;ref name=cgw/&gt;&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/library/2012/07/11/doc-susie-fraser-colorado/2301/|title="Doc Susie" of Fraser, Colorado|date=July 11, 2012|work=[[The Denver Post]]|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She tended to a range of patients and medical conditions including childbirth, skiing injuries, and particularly [[pneumonia]] during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. Although most of her work involved making house calls to patients, Anderson never owned a horse or car, and she was usually paid in food or firewood rather than money.&lt;ref name=cgw/&gt;

During the 1950s, Anderson was the focus of several newspaper and magazine stories. Actress [[Ethel Barrymore]] offered to make a film about Anderson's life, but the latter declined.&lt;ref name=cgw/&gt; Anderson retired in 1956 and was admitted to [[Denver General Hospital]] with poor health in 1958, where she stayed until her death; she died in 1960, aged 90, and was buried in Cripple Creek.&lt;ref name=bhm/&gt;

Anderson was inducted into the [[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=cgw/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6714">The '''Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence''' is a position within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] responsible for directing the Treasury's efforts to cut the lines of financial support for terrorists, fight financial crime, enforce economic sanctions against [[rogue nations]], and combat the financial support of the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The Under Secretary is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

The current Under Secretary is [[Sigal Mandelker]], appointed by President [[Donald Trump]], and confirmed to the position by the Senate on June 21, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/nomination/115th-congress/172&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The Under Secretary heads the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI), created under 31 USC 312, when the administration of President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] announced on May 8, 2004, that the Executive Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC), the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN), the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC), and allocated resources from the Treasury Department would be brought under the new office's control. The Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence also possesses oversight of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, created under 31 USC 311, [one of sixteen agencies in the United States Intelligence Community per 50 USC 3003]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bush Administration Announces Creation of New Office in Ramped up Effort to Fight the Financial War on Terror | url=http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/js1219.htm | accessdate= September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Reserve]] remains outside the jurisdiction of this office, and cannot be investigated by it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

==History==
The position's predecessor, the Under Secretary for Enforcement, managed law enforcement aspects of the Department prior to the reorganization. The Under Secretary for Enforcement provided oversight and policy guidance for the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]], the [[U.S. Customs Service]], the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]]; the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]], the [[U.S. Secret Service]], the Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, and the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]. The Under Secretary also provided policy guidance over the [[Internal Revenue Service]]'s Crime Investigation.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. Treasury - Biography of Jimmy Gurule, Under Secretary for Enforcement | url=http://www.treas.gov/organization/bios/gurule-e.html | accessdate= September 21, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071003045324/http://www.treas.gov/organization/bios/gurule-e.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. Treasury - Duties &amp; Functions of the Under Secretary of Enforcement | url=http://www.treas.gov/education/duties/treas/u-sec-enforcement.shtml  | accessdate= February 13, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060213064754/http://www.treas.gov/education/duties/treas/u-sec-enforcement.shtml |archivedate = February 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of these agencies are now non-existent or have been moved into other federal departments. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was split into two separate bureaus, with one handling certain law enforcement aspects and the other handling tax collection aspects. The former was moved into the [[United States Department of Justice]], while the latter was kept within the Department of the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About TTB:Home | url=http://www.ttb.gov/about/index.htm  | accessdate= June 18, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060618080606/http://www.ttb.gov/about/index.htm |archivedate = June 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center are now within the [[Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United States Secret Service: History | url=http://www.ustreas.gov/usss/history.shtml | accessdate= September 21, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071004233514/http://www.ustreas.gov/usss/history.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to FLETC — Federal Law Enforcement Training Center | url=http://www.fletc.gov/ | accessdate= September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Customs Service was moved into the Department of Homeland Security when it became part of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CBP.gov - home page | url=http://www.cbp.gov/ | accessdate= September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the Homeland Security Act of 2002&lt;ref name="Homeland Security Act of 2002"&gt;[[Homeland Security Act of 2002]] Homeland Security Act of 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Custom Service's "revenue functions" were retained by Treasury.
