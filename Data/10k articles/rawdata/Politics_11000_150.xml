== Cross-border raid details ==
Based on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 PARA (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the India–Myanmar border and destroyed two Militant camps one each of NSCN (K) and KYKL, along the India–Myanmar border. The operations were carried out inside the Myanmar territory along the Nagaland and Manipur border at two locations. One of the locations is near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two transit camps of the Naga militants.

Seventy-two special army commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. They were equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles. The commandos wore the uniforms of the 12 Bihar Battalion of Indian army, which was then deployed on the India–Myanmar border.&lt;ref name="hindu_remark"&gt;{{cite news|title=Army Chief Rawat’s remarks on Myanmar raid leaves Centre red-faced|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/army-chief-rawats-remarks-on-myanmar-raid-leaves-centre-red-faced/article21255413.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=3 December 2017|newspaper=The Hindu|date=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Troops were divided into two groups after they fast roped from Dhruv helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least 15 kilometers before they reached the training camps. Each of the two teams were further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Mi-17 helicopters of the IAF were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong In its statement after the operation the Indian Army said it was in communication with Myanmar and that, "There is a history of close cooperation between our two militaries. We look forward to working with them to combat such terrorism.".&lt;ref name="zeenews.india.com"/&gt;

Indian Army has claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties (158 reported&lt;ref name="zeenews.india.com"/&gt;) on the attackers behind the ambush on Army on 4 June, which claimed the lives of 18 Army jawans of 6 Dogra Regiment in Chandel district of Manipur.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This has been marked as the biggest attack on Indian Army after [[Kargil war]] of 1999.

{{United Kingdom constitutional formation}}

The '''Acts of Union 1800''' (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single '''Act of Union 1801''') were parallel acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] which united the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (previously in [[personal union]]) to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The acts [[came into force]] on 1 January 1801, and the merged [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] had its  [[First Parliament of the United Kingdom|first meeting]] on 22 January 1801. 

Both acts remain in force, with amendments, in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;From [[legislation.gov.uk]]:

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Two acts were passed in 1800 with the same [[long title]], '''An Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland'''. The [[short title]] of the act of the British Parliament is '''Union with Ireland Act 1800''', assigned by the [[Short Titles Act 1896]]. The short title of the act of the Irish Parliament is '''Act of Union (Ireland) 1800''', assigned by a 1951 act of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], and hence not effective in the Republic of Ireland, where it was referred to by its long title when repealed in 1962.

==Background==
{{unbalanced|section|date=February 2017}}
Before these Acts, Ireland had been in [[personal union]] with England since 1541, when the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] had passed the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]], proclaiming King [[Henry VIII of England]] to be [[King of Ireland]]. Since the 12th century, the King of England had been technical overlord of the [[Lordship of Ireland]], a papal possession. Both the Kingdoms of Ireland and England later came into personal union with that of [[Scotland]] upon the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603.

In 1707, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] were united into a single kingdom: the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Upon that union, each House of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed a congratulatory address to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], praying that, "May God put it in your royal heart to add greater strength and lustre to your crown, by a still more comprehensive Union".&lt;ref&gt;Journals of the Irish Commons, vol. iii. p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish parliament at that time was subject to a number of restrictions that placed it subservient to the [[Parliament of England]] (and following the union of England and Scotland, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]), however Ireland gained effective legislative independence from Great Britain through the [[Constitution of 1782]].

By this time access to institutional power in Ireland was restricted to a small minority, the [[Anglo-Irish]] of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]], and frustration at the lack of reform among the Catholic majority eventually led, along with other reasons, to a [[1798 Rebellion|rebellion in 1798]], involving [[Expedition d'Irlande|a French invasion of Ireland]] and the seeking of complete independence from Great Britain. This rebellion was crushed with much bloodshed, and the subsequent drive for union between Great Britain and Ireland that passed in 1800 was motivated at least in part by the belief that the rebellion was caused as much by reactionary loyalist brutality as by the United Irishmen.

Furthermore, Catholic emancipation was being discussed in Great Britain, and fears that a newly enfranchised Catholic majority would drastically change the character of the Irish government and parliament also contributed to a desire from London to merge the parliaments.

== Passing the Acts ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
Complementary acts had to be passed in the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland.

The Parliament of Ireland had recently gained a large measure of legislative independence under the [[Constitution of 1782]].  Many members of the Irish Parliament jealously guarded this autonomy (notably [[Henry Grattan]]) and a motion for union was legally rejected in 1799.

Only [[Church of Ireland|Anglicans]] were permitted to become members of the Parliament of Ireland, though the great majority of the Irish population were [[Roman Catholic]], with many [[Presbyterian]]s in [[Ulster]]. In 1793 Roman Catholics regained the right to vote if they owned or rented property worth £2 p.a. The Catholic hierarchy was strongly in favour of union, hoping for rapid [[Catholic emancipation|emancipation]] and the right to sit as MPs – which was however delayed after the passage of the acts until [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829| 1829]].

From the perspective of Great Britain, the union was desirable because of the uncertainty that followed the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789; if Ireland adopted Catholic Emancipation, willingly or not, a Roman Catholic parliament could break away from Britain and ally with the French, while the same measure within a united kingdom would exclude that possibility. Also the Irish and British parliaments, when creating a regency during [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]'s "madness", gave the Prince Regent different powers. These considerations led Great Britain to decide to attempt merger of the two kingdoms and their parliaments.

The final passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was achieved with substantial majorities, in part according to contemporary documents through bribery, namely the awarding of [[peerage]]s and [[honour]]s to critics to get their votes.&lt;ref name=Ward1994p28&gt;Alan J. Ward, ''The Irish Constitutional Tradition'' p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the first attempt had been defeated in the [[Irish House of Commons]] by 109 votes against to 104 for, the second vote in 1800 produced a result of 158 to 115.&lt;ref name=Ward1994p28 /&gt;

==Provisions==
The Acts of Union were two complementary Acts, namely:

* The '''Union with Ireland Act 1800''' (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3 c. 67),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act | title = Union with Ireland Act 1800 | type=
| number = (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3 c. 67) | language = English | date = 2 July 1800 | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Geo3/39-40/67 | access-date = 6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Act of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and
* The '''Act of Union (Ireland) 1800''' (40 Geo. 3 c. 38),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act | title = Act of Union (Ireland) 1800 | type=
| number = (40 Geo. 3 c. 38) | language = English | date = 1 August 1800 | url =  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aip/Geo3/40/38/contents | access-date = 6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Act of the [[Parliament of Ireland]].

They were passed on 2 July 1800 and 1 August 1800 respectively, and came into force on 1 January 1801. They ratified eight articles which had been previously agreed by the British and Irish Parliaments:
* Articles I–IV dealt with the political aspects of the Union. It created a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|united parliament]].
** In the House of Lords, the existing members of the Parliament of Great Britain were joined by, as [[Lords Spiritual]], four bishops of the [[Church of Ireland]], rotating among the dioceses in each session and as [[Lords Temporal]] 28 [[representative peers]] elected for life by the [[Peerage of Ireland]].
** The House of Commons was to include the pre-union representation from Great Britain and 100 members from Ireland: two members from each of the 32 counties and from the two largest boroughs, and one from each of the next 31 boroughs and from [[Dublin University (constituency)|Dublin University]]. The other 84 Irish parliamentary boroughs were disfranchised; all were [[pocket borough]]s, whose patrons received £15,000 compensation for the loss of what was considered their property.
::{{see also|United Kingdom general election, 1801}}
* Article V united the established [[Church of England]] and Church of Ireland into "one Protestant Episcopal Church, to be called, The United Church of England and Ireland"; but also confirmed the independence of the [[Church of Scotland]].
* Article VI created a [[customs union]], with the exception that customs duties on certain British and Irish goods passing between the two countries would remain for 10 years (a consequence of having trade depressed by the ongoing war with revolutionary France).
* Article VII stated that Ireland would have to contribute two-seventeenths towards the expenditure of the United Kingdom. The figure was a ratio of Irish to British foreign trade.
* Article VIII formalised the legal and judicial aspects of the Union.

Part of the attraction of the Union for many Irish Catholics was the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]], allowing [[Roman Catholic]] MPs, who had not been allowed in the Irish Parliament. This was however blocked by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] who argued that emancipating Roman Catholics would breach his [[Coronation of the British monarch#Recognition and oath|Coronation Oath]], and was not realised until 1829.

The traditionally separate [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]], which had been funded by the Irish Parliament, was merged into the larger [[British Army]].

===The first parliament===
In the first Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the members of the House of Commons were not elected afresh. By royal proclamation authorised by the Act, all the members of the last House of Commons from Great Britain took seats in the new House, and from Ireland [[Members of the 1st UK Parliament from Ireland|100 members were chosen]] from the last Irish House of Commons; both members from each of the 32 counties and from the two largest boroughs, and one each (chosen by lot) from the next 31 boroughs and from [[Dublin University (constituency)|Dublin University]].

The flag, created as a consequence of the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1800, still remains the [[flag of the United Kingdom]]. Called the [[Union Flag]], it combined the flags of [[St George's Cross]] (which included [[Wales]]) and the [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Saltire]] of Scotland with the [[St Patrick's Saltire]] to represent Ireland (it now represents Northern Ireland).

'''''Agunah''''' ({{lang-he|עגונה}}, plural: '''agunot''' (עגונות); literally "anchored" or "chained") is a [[halakha|halakhic]] term for a [[Jewish]] woman who is "chained" to her [[marriage]]. The classic case of this is a man who has left on a journey and has not returned, or has gone into battle and is [[missing in action|MIA]]. It is used a borrowed term to refer to a woman whose husband refuses, or is unable, to grant her a [[divorce]] document in [[Jewish religious law]], known as a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]''.

For a divorce to be effective, [[Halakha|Jewish law]] requires that a man grant his wife a ''get'' of his own [[free will]]. Without a ''get'' no new marriage will be recognized, and any child she might have with another man would be considered a ''[[mamzer]]'', a term often translated as (but dissimilar to the concept of) a [[bastardy|bastard]]. It is sometimes possible for a woman to receive special dispensation from a ''[[Posek|halakhic authority]]'', called a ''heter agunah'', based on a complex decision supported by substantial evidence that her husband is presumed dead.

Because of the difficulty for women in such situations, it has been a task for every generation of halakhic authorities to try to find halakhically acceptable means to permit such women to remarry. In the past it was not uncommon, due to the danger of travel and primitive means of communication, for people leaving home never to be heard of again; consequently rabbis often had had to deal with this issue. Over the past few centuries, thousands of [[responsa]] have been written to deal with cases of agunot.

In the past most ''agunah'' cases were due to a husband [[declared death in absentia|dying without leaving clear evidence of his demise]], or becoming [[mentally ill]] ([[insane]]). Nowadays many ''agunah'' cases arise as a result of a husband withholding a ''get'', perhaps seeking a more favorable divorce settlement,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} or out of vindictiveness. In response ''agunah'' groups have organized to support these women and try to find a solution to this problem. Various remedies have been proposed, but as yet, no one solution has common acceptance. Nevertheless, the [[Prenuptial Agreement for the Prevention of Get-Refusal]] is one remedy which is in use in [[Modern Orthodox]] Jewish communities worldwide and is accepted by moderate{{who|date=August 2016}} halakhic authorities.

== Causes ==
Circumstances leading to a woman being declared an ''agunah'' are:
* The disappearance of the husband without any witnesses declaring that he is dead;
* The husband succumbing to a physical or mental disease that leaves him in a [[coma]] or insane and unable actively to grant a divorce;
* The husband refusing to grant his wife a ''get'' when she is deemed entitled to one under Jewish law. A woman denied a ''get'' by her husband is technically called a ''mesorevet get'', although the term ''agunah'' is more commonly used.

A woman who is denied a divorce from her husband is not considered an ''agunah'' until her husband refuses an order by a [[Beth Din|rabbinic court]] to give her a ''get''.

What constitutes a legitimate request for a divorce is based on halakhic considerations and the particular case of the couple. See [[Agunah#Mesorevet get|''Mesorevet get'']] below.

== Background ==

Because of the serious nature of [[adultery]] in Jewish law, an ''agunah'' is forbidden to marry another man, regardless of the circumstances, whether accidental or malicious, that left her an ''agunah'' in the first place, or the amount of time that has passed since she first became an ''agunah''. A child born from another man to an ''agunah'' is considered a ''[[mamzer]]'' (halakhically illegitimate), and may only marry another mamzer or a convert.

Because of the dire situation of the ''agunah'', every effort is made to release her from her marriage. This can be done in three ways:
* Locating the husband and persuading him to give his wife a ''get'';
* Providing evidence that the husband is dead;
* Finding a flaw in the original marriage ceremony, thereby retroactively annulling the marriage.

According to most [[rabbi]]s, reasonable circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove the death of the husband, and no direct testimony is required. This is based, among other things, on the [[talmud]]ic assertion: "The Rabbis taught: 'If he fell into a [[lion]]'s den, &lt;nowiki&gt;[bring witnesses to] testify [that he is dead]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, if he fell into a ditch of snakes and scorpions - &lt;nowiki&gt; [there is] no [need] to testify [that he is dead]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'" (Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 121a). In other words, if it is known that the man fell into a ditch of snakes and scorpions and did not come out, it can be assumed that he is dead, and there is no need for further evidence (unlike falling into a lion's den where there is still a slight chance of survival). If, however, it is later discovered that the husband is not dead, the woman will find herself in particularly bad circumstances: her children from her second marriage will be considered ''mamzerim'' (bastards), and she will be forced to divorce both her first and second husbands, subject to the halakhic ruling that an adulterous woman "is forbidden to her husband and the man with whom she fornicated". While such situations are extremely rare under normal circumstances, they did occur in the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]] and also occurred frequently in the wake of [[pogrom]]s and other forms of persecution.

Finding a flaw in the marriage ceremony is considered to be a last resort in releasing an ''agunah''. It is rarely used as it is typically difficult to find actual cause in most marriages sufficient to invalidate them retroactively. In Jewish law, a marriage must be performed in front of two witnesses. In order to release the ''agunah'', efforts are made to identify reasons why one of the witnesses was ineligible. This is typically unachievable as strong efforts are made at the time of marriage to ensure the validity of the witnesses and the marriage ceremony. Another possibility is to prove that the woman did not consent to the marriage clearly and of her own free will, so that the marriage ceremony is declared invalid. This too is not generally accepted amongst the halakhic authorities as there is generally no method to disprove intent. It is felt that the purpose of this endeavor is solely or primarily to retroactively delegitimize a marriage that was performed and accepted often many years previously. Annulling the marriage has no impact on the status of the woman's children. However, since it is not a generally accepted mechanism, it may leave the wife susceptible to a halakhic ruling that she was still married, and any subsequent relations with another man to be adultery. And it may lead to other halakhic problems, so it is only used as a last resort by the authorities that do accept its use.

Only a woman can be declared an ''agunah''. None of the prohibitions listed above goes into effect for a man whose wife has disappeared. This is because there is no prohibition in the Torah for a man to have two wives, and a child born to a married man with a single woman is not considered to be a ''mamzer''. In the beginning of the 11th century, [[Rabbenu Gershom]] issued a decree prohibiting Jewish men from practising [[bigamy]] (though this was not accepted by certain remote Jewish communities such as the [[Yemenite Jew]]s). To prevent this decree from causing flippant divorces previously unnecessary, [[Rabbenu Gershom]] also decreed that "a woman may not be divorced against her will." In certain extreme circumstances, however, such as the case of a man whose wife is missing, or who refused to accept a ''get'' for an extended period, a ''[[heter meah rabbanim]]'' (exemption by one hundred rabbis) may permit him to take a second wife (in the latter case, after depositing a ''get'' with them).{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} This exemption is applied nowadays, only in extremely rare circumstances. Thus, it is not uncommon{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} for a woman to maliciously refuse acceptance of a ''get'', in effect "chaining" her husband.

In modern and ancient times, [[war]]fare has been a major cause of women being declared ''agunot'' (plural of ''agunah''), as (especially in ancient times) soldiers are often killed with no one knowing. Many efforts have been made to resolve this problem in accordance with halakhic principles. During [[World War II]], some [[United States|American]] Jewish and other [[chaplain]]s provided combat soldiers with a "provisional ''get''", which only goes into effect if the husband is missing in action, leaving his wife an ''agunah''. This is based on a talmudic explanation of the incident of [[King David]] and [[Bathsheba]] (see [[Books of Samuel|II Samuel 11]]). According to the traditional view, David did not sin by lying with a married woman, since all of his soldiers gave a "provisional ''get''" to their wives before leaving for battle. "Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: 'Everyone who went to war on behalf of David, left a provisional ''get'' for his wife'" ([[Talmud|Talmud Bavli]], [[Moed|Tractate Shabbat]] 56a).

== In Israel ==

In 1947 [[David Ben-Gurion]] agreed that the authority in matters of marriage and divorce would be invested in the hands of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and an agreement was signed in recognition of this decision (among other matters). This agreement is known as the "status quo letter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140226172841/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/10/civil-marriage-israel-jews-secular-orthodox-rabbinical-court.html|title=Israel's Rabbis Keep Lock On Jewish Marriage - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|date=2014-02-26|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 the [[Knesset]] enacted the Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage and Divorce) Law, 5713 – 1953.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02840.html&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1 of the Law states, "Matters of marriage and divorce of Jews in Israel, being citizens or residents of the State, shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts."&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; The substantive provision of section 2 of this Law further states: "Marriages and divorces of Jews shall be performed in Israel in accordance with Jewish religious law" (din torah).&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt;

In 2010, Israel passed the Civil Union Law, allowing a couple to marry civilly in Israel if they are both registered as officially not belonging to any religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Rachael Gelfman Schultz |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/israel/Contemporary_Life/Society_and_Religious_Issues/Freedom_of_Religion/civil_marriage_in_israel.shtml |title=Civil Marriage in Israel |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date=2014-01-31 |access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Muslim woman in Israel may petition for and receive a divorce through the Sharia courts without her husband's consent under certain conditions, and a marriage contract may provide for other circumstances in which she may obtain a divorce without her husband's consent. A Muslim man in Israel may divorce his wife without her consent and without petitioning the court.&lt;ref name="hr2010"&gt;2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. ''This article incorporates public domain material from this source''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians in Israel may seek official separations or divorces, depending on the denomination, through ecclesiastical courts.&lt;ref name="hr2010"/&gt;

In 2007 the Chief Rabbinate found that in Israel men and women were refused divorce in equal numbers, 180 women and 185 men over a two-year period. The Director-General of the Rabbinical Courts said this showed that "the claims by women's organizations of thousands of women whose husbands refuse to give them divorces have no basis in reality".&lt;ref name="inn"&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A woman suffers more in this situation, as she is Biblically forbidden to marry again; and children she might bear to another man would be considered [[mamzer]]im ([[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]]) according to halakhah. A man is similarly not permitted to marry before being divorced, but the ban is much less severe (because monogamy was instituted by one single overreaching authority in Europe in around the year 1000 CE, and was accepted in Europe among the ([[Ashkenazim]]), whereas [[Sefardic]] and [[Mizrahi]] (Eastern) Jewish communities did not formally accept monogamy only until very recently.) This considered, a man's future children will not be considered illegitimate."&lt;ref name="inn"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2015 [[Tzohar (organization)|Tzohar]] (a religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the [[Israeli Bar Association]], introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a [[Get (divorce document)|get]]; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/03/03/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/new-prenup-aims-to-prevent-agunot |title=Israeli rabbinic, legal groups partner for prenup in bid to prevent agunot &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2015-03-03 |access-date=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[Knesset]] passed a law, slated to remain in effect for three years, allowing Israel’s rabbinical courts to handle certain cases of Jewish women wishing to divorce their Jewish husbands, even if neither the wife nor the husband is an Israeli citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-gives-rabbinical-courts-unprecedented-control-over-diaspora-jew-1.6216340 |title=Israel gives rabbinical courts unprecedented jurisdiction over Diaspora Jews - Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Mesorevet get / ''Get'' refusal'' ==
''Mesorevet get'' is a term for a Jewish woman who is chained to her marriage because of her husband's refusal to give her a ''get'' she is entitled to. A ''mesorevet get'' is a "victim of ''get'' refusal," otherwise known as a "modern-day ''agunah''."

According to halakha, a ''get'' is only valid when it is given by a husband to his wife of his own free will (''Yebamot,'' 14:1). However, under certain circumstances{{which|date=August 2016}} pressure may be applied on a husband to force him to grant a divorce to his wife. Where a woman has proven one or more of a list of particular grounds for divorce, the rabbinical court ([[beth din]]) may apply pressure on the husband in these situations (''Ketubot,'' 7:10; ''Gittin'', 9:8). There are some halakhic decisors who would act accordingly in the cases of abuse or neglect (''[[Shulchan Aruch]], Even HaEzer,'' 154:3). Nevertheless, not under all circumstances is a wife entitled to demand a divorce according to halakha. If a wife who is not halakhically entitled to a divorce does demand one, she may not be considered as a ''mesorevet get'' by a Rabbinical Court. However, not any woman who wants to leave an unwanted marriage but is refused by her husband, is considered to be a victim of ''get'' refusal. There are opinions that deem a woman's repugnance for her husband as acceptable halakhic grounds for coercion (''[[Rambam]], Mishna Torah, Hilchot Ishut'', 14:8). "It is said: In cases of granting a ''get'' to a woman, the man is forced until he says, 'I wish to do so'" (Babylonian [[Talmud]], ''Arachin'' 21a; ''Rambam, Mishna Torah, Hilchot Gerushin,'' 2:2). Nevertheless, in almost all cases, it is required to leave the man some say in the matter, lest the ''get'' be considered a "coerced divorce", which is halakhically invalid. As ruled by ''[[Rabbeinu Tam]]'' (''Sefer HaYashar'', Response 24; ''Rema, Even HaEzer'' 154:21), pressures that can be exerted against the man include [[shunning]], denying him communal benefits and honors, and in extreme cases even imprisonment. Legend has it that as a last resort where all else has failed, a tactic has been sparingly used in the past, to let him spend a night near a nameless grave, or to frighten him in some other way.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In Israel, rabbinical courts are allowed by law to implement various measures to persuade a man to grant his wife a ''get'' (Rabbinical Courts Law [Enforcement of Divorce Rulings] 5755-1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamishpat.com/Courses/99408/408-01-hok%20kium%20gerushin-1995.doc |title=Chok Batei Din Rabbaniim |year=1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306052457/http://www.hamishpat.com/Courses/99408/408-01-hok%20kium%20gerushin-1995.doc |archive-date=March 6, 2009 |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sanctions are a modern-day version of the aforementioned, ''Harchakot D'Rabeinu Tam,'' which include: revoking of a driver's license, closing of bank accounts, revoking professional licenses such as medical and legal, cancellation of a passport, and incarceration. Practically, one of the most effective of these has turned out to be revoking a recalcitrant husband's driver's license. Even so, neither the laws nor the Israeli Rabbinical Courts' enforcement, or lack thereof, have succeeded in erasing the blight of ''get'' refusal within Israeli society. In the Diaspora, the Rabbinical Courts have no such powers. Any practical power that they may wield would be the product of a binding arbitration agreement ([[Prenuptial Agreement for the Prevention of Get-Refusal]]), if signed previously by the combating couple. Within the past decade, both Orthodox rabbinical groups&lt;ref&gt;Beth Din of America http://www.bethdin.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and women's organizations&lt;ref&gt;Women's Organizations [http://www.jofa.org/about.php/advocacy Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728055519/http://www.jofa.org/about.php/advocacy |date=2007-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have decried the increasing number of cases of ''get'' refusal, as well as establishing task forces to deal with the issue and to help individual victims of ''get'' refusal.&lt;ref&gt;Help Individual Victims [http://www.youngisraelrabbis.org.il/divorce.htm Council of Young Israel Rabbis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706112933/http://www.youngisraelrabbis.org.il/divorce.htm |date=July 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
{{jf}}
Many women's groups feel that rabbinical courts fail to use all the measures at their disposal to force men to grant their wives a ''get'', thereby allowing a vengeful husband to blackmail his wife for years. Public criticism of the courts, as well as demonstrations, have been attempted to influence particularly notorious cases.

Several solutions have been proposed to help women who are denied a ''get'':
* Increasing the means available to the rabbinic courts to force husbands to grant their wives a ''get''. In Israel, rabbinic courts can even imprison a husband until he acquiesces and grants a ''get'' to his wife. This is not, however, an option for rabbinic courts elsewhere, since they do not have the support of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/236485|title='Those who won't grant divorces will be marked like Cain'|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Having couples sign a [[Jewish prenuptial agreement]], which requires the husband to pay high spousal support to his wife if he denies her a ''get'', so as to provide incentive to the couple not to delay the divorce. Halakhic authorities in the United States have validated particular prenuptial agreements for the prevention of get-refusal.&lt;ref&gt;theprenup.org http://theprenup.org/rabbinic.html and the Council of Young Israel Rabbis in Israel {{Cite web|url=http://www.youngisraelrabbis.org.il/prenup.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001162535/http://www.youngisraelrabbis.org.il/prenup.htm |archive-date=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Having couples prepare a "provisional ''get''," which will only go into effect under certain predefined circumstances.
* Having couples agree to a "conditional marriage," which includes a stipulation in the marriage ceremony citing that under certain conditions (such as living apart for an extended period of time), the marriage itself would be nullified with no need for a ''get''.

In 1995 the Israeli parliament gave the rabbinical court expanded legal power to sanction men who refuse to give their wives a ''get'' by suspending their driver's licenses, seizing their bank accounts, preventing travel abroad and even imprisoning those who do not comply with an order to grant a divorce; however, women's groups say the 1995 law is not very effective because the court uses sanctions in less than 2% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=By Edmund Sanders, Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-fg-israel-divorce-problems-20130726,0,4730957.story |title=Israel divorce law traps women in marriages that died long ago |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2013-07-26 |access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Justice Menachem HaCohen of the [[Jerusalem]] Family Court offered new hope to ''agunot'' when he ruled that a man refusing his wife a ''get'' must pay her NIS 425,000 in punitive damages, because "[R]efusal to grant a ''get'' constitutes a severe infringement on her ability to lead a reasonable, normal life, and can be considered emotional abuse lasting several years." He noted that "[T]his is not another sanction against someone refusing to give a ''get'', intended to speed up the process of granting a ''get'', and this court is not involving itself in any future arrangements for the granting of a ''get'', but rather, it is a direct response to the consequences that stem from not granting a ''get'', and the right of the woman to receive punitive damages." This ruling stemmed from the Public Litigation Project initiated by the advocacy organization [[Center for Women's Justice Israel|Center for Women's Justice]] as one of a number of successful lawsuits filed in Israeli civil courts claiming financial damages against recalcitrant husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Susan|title=The Tort of Get Refusal: Why Tort and Why Not?|journal=Conversations|series=Orthodoxy: Family &amp; Gender Issues|issue=5|url=http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/tort-get-refusal-why-tort-and-why-not|access-date=July 19, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110703092706/http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/tort-get-refusal-why-tort-and-why-not| archive-date= 3 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, an Israeli survey revealed that there only 180 cases of refusing-get husbands including 69 documented agunah cases. In contrast, there are 190 cases in which the wife refuses to give the husband a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;''Arutz Sheva'' article 28 June 2007. [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/122884 Related news item].&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Israel, an ''agunah'' could obtain a civil divorce and remarry via [[civil marriage]], as non-Israeli legal systems generally do not recognize the ''agunah'' status. Nevertheless, an ''agunah'' would not typically pursue a second marriage, since her first marriage is still valid according to halakha, any other sexual relationships would constitute [[adultery]] from her first husband. Furthermore, according to halakha, any children born by an agunah are considered [[mamzer]]im (bastards).

In 2014 the Rabbinate of [[Uruguay]] instituted the requirement for all Jewish couples that marry under its auspices to sign a rabbinic prenuptial agreement. The agreement states that in the case of the couple divorcing civilly, the husband is obligated to immediately deliver to his wife a get. The initiative was launched by Sara Winkowski, a director of the Kehila, the Comunidad Israelita del Uruguay (Jewish Community of Uruguay), who is also a Vice President of the World Jewish Congress and longtime activist for the rights of women within Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vosizneias.com/153024/2014/01/23/montevideo-uruguay-chief-rabbi-institutes-rabbinic-pre-nuptial-agreement/ |title=Montevideo - Uruguay Chief Rabbi Institutes Rabbinic Pre-Nuptial Agreement |publisher=Vosizneias.com |access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agunah Day ==

Agunah Day was established by ICAR - The International Coalition for Agunah Rights - in 1990, to raise public awareness to the plight of the Agunah and galvanize action to solve the problem. It is observed on the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]] date of the [[Fast of Esther]].&lt;ref&gt;The connection between the Fast of Esther and Agunah Day was presented as the explanation within a private member's bill to the Israeli Knesset on Agunah Day 2010. The bill, which did not pass into law, was drawn up by ICAR in an attempt to have Knesset officially declare the Fast of Esther as "Agunah Day" https://www.knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/18/2268.rtf The explanation for the proposed bill was authored by Dr. Rachel Levmore, Rabbinical Court Advocate, Coordinator for Matters of Iggun and Get-Refusal for the Council of Young Israel Rabbis in Israel and the Jewish Agency; member of ICAR. Translated by Shoshana Tessler; edited by Robyn Shames&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fast of Esther was chosen by ICAR as Agunah Day in order to symbolize identification with the Agunah for two contrasting reasons – due to affliction and due to salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voices-magazine.com/index.php?page=inside_page&amp;id=180 |title=Ta'anit Esther is International Agunah Day |publisher=Voices Magazine |date=2010-07-16 |access-date=2012-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328104825/http://www.voices-magazine.com/index.php?page=inside_page&amp;id=180 |archive-date=2012-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Esther, the Agunah of the present era does not want to be in the marriage in which she finds herself. Like Esther, many women who are refused a get live in fear of their spouses and live a double life. Like Esther, the Agunah, a victim of get-refusal, finds herself lacking control of her own freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voices-magazine.blogspot.com/2011/02/taanit-esther-and-international-agunah.html |title=Ta'anit Esther and International Agunah Day |publisher=Voices Magazine |date=February 28, 2011 |access-date=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservative Judaism ==

At the 1998 Jerusalem ''Agunot Conference'', Rabbi Mayer Rabinowitz, the Chairman of the Joint Bet Din of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Movement]], explained the four approaches taken by leaders of Conservative Judaism to find remedies for the problem of the agunah.&lt;ref name="MR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/agunot.html |first=Meyer E. |last=Rabinowitz |title=Agunot (Abandoned Wives), adapted from his comments at the 1998 Agunot Conference, in Jerusalem |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |year=1998 |access-date=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first, beginning in the 1950s, was the inclusion of the [[Lieberman clause]], named for Talmudic scholar and [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] (JTS) professor [[Saul Lieberman]], in the ''[[ketuba]]'', requiring that a get be granted if a civil divorce is ever issued. Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's [[Rabbinical Council of America]], and respected Orthodox rabbis, including [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], supposedly recognized the clause as valid.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt; Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] principle of the [[separation of church and state]], Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civil court.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt; However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards|law committee]], had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.

The second approach fell into the category of conditional marriages, ''t'nai b'kiddushin,'' and was based in part on past approaches used by both the French and Turkish rabbinates—but, according to Rabinowitz—had improvements gleaned from lessons learned from those past experiences. The ketubah was not changed, but a separate pre-marital agreement was signed, and in the presence of the rabbinical court, the prospective groom read it, and the prospective bride stated that she agreed to it. The agreement was that the parties understood that if a civil divorce were ever granted, then a get must be delivered within six months of that date. A refusal to abide by that agreement would give the court no choice but to consider the original marriage, and the original declaration of the groom, so flawed that it would be as if that marriage never occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Eliezer Berkovits, ''Tenai be-nisuin uve-get'', as cited in Rabinowitz, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The third approach, using contacts both within Judaism and external to it, was to coerce the recalcitrant husband to grant a get. One example cited at the conference was a case where the civilly-divorced husband planned to remarry, this time to a Catholic woman in a Catholic religious ceremony. The Conservative movement's Bet Din contacted the Catholic Church, which agreed to refuse to have the marriage performed until the previous marriage was religiously dissolved, resulting in the almost immediate granting of the get by the husband.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt;

Finally, in 1968, by a unanimous vote of the law committee, the final approach was initiated, when it was decided that the Joint Bet Din of the Conservative Movement could annul marriages as a last resort, based on the Talmudic principle of ''hafka'at kiddushin''. According to Rabinowitz, just the threat of this action was sometimes enough to compel the former husband to grant a get.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt;

== Changes in Orthodox approach ==
There is a long history of concern for the agunah on the part of orthodox rabbis, and a number of proposals have been put forth for consideration by religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;A. Freimann, ''Seder Kiddushin Ve'nisuiin'', Mosad HaRav Kook, Jerusalem:1964 (Hebrew). This book includes an extensive history of such attempts for a period of over two thousand years, pp. 385-397.&lt;/ref&gt; So far, no solution has been found that satisfies most orthodox religious leaders.

A number of modern papers and conferences have continued to discuss both issues and possible solutions, including the possibility of a modern ''[[takkanah]]'', religious legislative enaction, to empower the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] to intervene to annul marriages retroactively, in a way that was possible for some time during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin H. Haut, ''Divorce in Jewish Law and Life,'' Sepher-Hermon Press, New York:1983. Pages 49-53 discuss the past, and pages 95-100 discuss proposals for the present and future.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mucjs.org/ARUDraftFinal.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606070659/http://www.mucjs.org/ARUDraftFinal.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-06 |title='&amp;#39;The Manchester Analysis: Draft Final Report of the Agunah Research Unit'&amp;#39;, University of Manchester, England, July 2009.

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as studies and discussions continue, a number of modern works and conferences have referenced the work of past Orthodox rabbis, such as [[Ya'akov Moshe Toledano]], who recommended in 1930/31 that every Jewish marriage be made contingent on the "continuing agreement" of the local rabbinic court, so that the court could retroactively annul the marriage as a remedy to the agunah problem;&lt;ref&gt;Responsa Yam Hagadol, Cairo, 1931, No.74, cited in ''The Manchester Analysis,'' ''op.cit.'', footnote 1113, p163.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mnachem Risikoff]], who recommended in 1937 that such consideration be given not to every local court, but at least to the Jerusalem rabbinical court, specifically recognizing that authority in the words recited under the [[chuppah]], the wedding canopy. Risikoff, among others,&lt;ref&gt;One example is Rabbi Elisha Ancselovits, ''The Man Divorces--the Woman Gets Divorced: Explaining the halakha as an aid to solving the Problem of Marriage for th Secular Sector,'' ''Ma'agilim 3'', 2000, 99-121, as cited in ''The Manchester Analysis,'' ''op.cit.'', 206. Ancselovits believes the [[Sheva Brachot]], the traditional wedding blessings can be recited for such a union. Other authorities cited on this page raise the problem that according to [[Maimonides]], even though his was a minority opinion, the option of joining with a pilegesh was only reserved for kings.&lt;/ref&gt; also proposed a discussion of the reinstatement of the Biblical status of the [[pilegesh]], a relationship status between man and woman that does not require a Get upon dissolution, thereby avoiding the category of agunah.&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Analysis'', ''op.cit.,'' pages 91, 155, 162, 163, 174, 180. This work references Risikoff's book, ''Shaarei Shamayim'' (New York, 1937), which includes both his arguments for enhanced recognition of the court in general, and reliance on it -- through a creative revision of the traditional words recited by a groom during a Jewish marriage ceremony -- in the case of the Agunah, in particular.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haut, ''op. cit. This description of Risikoff's position is quoted based on an earlier secondary source: A. Freimann, ''Seder Kiddushin V'Nisuin'', Mossad HaRav Kook, Jerusalem: 1964 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Between Civil and Religious Law: The Plight of the Agunah in American Society'', Irving Breitowitz, Greenwood Press, 1993. Breitowitz's book was reviewed in ''Jewish Action'', Winter 1994, Vol. 55, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches that have been discussed by religious leaders, including leading orthodox rabbis, have included the possibility of [[prenuptial agreement]]s, not incorporated into the ketubah or mentioned in the words recited by the groom during the ceremony, through which the husband and wife agree to abide by orders of a designated Beth Din, regarding the giving or acceptance of a get. Rabbi [[Jechiel Perr]] discussed such a proposal,&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Observer,"" October 1982&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been reported that Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], looked upon this idea with favor.&lt;ref&gt;Haut, op cit., 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, discussions have considered the possibility of various forms of coercion that could be applied to the husband, to compel him to grant the Get.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt;

No proposal has so far met with universal approval on the part of the Orthodox rabbinate, although there have been some cases of individual rabbis taking what has been viewed as "maverick" individual action, including the convening of rabbinic courts to annual marriages, using the [[Geonim|Geonic]] model. Such actions have been widely condemned within the orthodox community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/9638/orthodox-groups-criticize-2-rabbis-annulling-marriages |first=Debra |last=Nussbaum Cohen |title=Orthodox groups criticize 2 rabbis annulling marriages |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=November 27, 1998 |access-date=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the International Rabbinic Fellowship (IRF), an international organization of (as of 2012) 150 Modern Orthodox rabbis, passed a resolution saying that, "IRF Rabbis may not officiate at a wedding unless the couple has signed a halakhic prenuptial agreement. IRF Rabbis are further encouraged to participate ritually only in weddings in which the couple has signed a halakhic prenuptial agreement. Ritual participation includes but is not limited to reading the [[ketubah]], serving as a witness, and making one of the [[sheva berachot]]." This makes the IRF the only Orthodox rabbinical organization in the world to require its members to use a halakhic pre-nuptial agreement in any wedding at which they officiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalrabbinicfellowship.org/news/international-rabbinic-fellowship-takes-historic-step-prevent-future-agunot |title=International Rabbinic Fellowship Takes Historic Step to Prevent Future Agunot &amp;#124; |publisher=Internationalrabbinicfellowship.org |date=2012-05-24 |access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Zika le-Yibbum'' ==
A related case is that of a woman whose husband has died childless: in such a situation, the husband's brother is required by Jewish law to enter into a [[Yibbum|levirate marriage]] with the widow so as to have children with her in the name of the deceased. The brother can refuse to do yibbum and instead perform a ceremony known as [[chalitza]] to release her from her bond to him (in modern times ''chalitza'' is nearly always performed instead of ''yibbum''). If the brother is missing, or if he is still a child, the woman is required to wait until he is located or has reached [[B'nai Mitzvah|adolescence]] so that he can perform the ''chalitza'' ceremony. There have been recorded cases of the husband's brother trying to blackmail the widow by delaying the ''chalitza'' ceremony, effectively leaving her as an ''agunah''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Agunah by choice ==
There are more cases in which women choose not to accept a ''get'' when a husband wants to give one, then cases in which the man refuses to grant a ''get''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/225002|title=Rabbinical Court statistics: Rabbinical Court: More female than male get-refusers|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the husband wishes to remarry, and the wife refuses the ''get,'' he may invoke a procedure of ''[[Heter meah rabbanim|heter me'ah rabbanim]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/223910/the-heter-meah-rabbonim-an-overview.html|title=The Heter Meah Rabbonim – An Overview|date=2014-03-27|work=Yeshiva World News|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are also cases where the ''get'' is offered for protection. For example, if the husband is undertaking a dangerous activity, or is being imprisoned for a lengthy time, he may wish to divorce entirely to help his wife by freeing her. Often, such offers are refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19507017/gathered_about_town/|title=Gathered About Town|last=|first=|date=1896-10-07|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Karaite Judaism ==
As followers of Torah exclusively, the [[Karaite Jews]] say that a woman can claim a divorce. If a man refuses to give divorce to his wife, the ''[[beit din]]'' (Jewish legal court) may exercise its legal power to grant a divorce instead. Consequently, there are no agunot in Karaite Judaism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

'''Assaulting, kidnapping, and assassinating the government officials of the United States''', their families, and foreign dignitaries and official guests, is a crime under various statutes, including {{usc|18|111}} ([[Assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers or employees]]), {{usc|18|112}} (Protection of foreign officials, official guests, and internationally protected persons), {{usc|18|115}} (Influencing, impeding, or retaliating against a Federal official by threatening or injuring a family member), {{usc|18|351}} ([[U.S. Congress|Congressional]], [[U.S. Cabinet|Cabinet]], and [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] assassination, kidnapping, and assault), and {{usc|18|1751}} ([[U.S. President|Presidential]] and Presidential staff assassination, kidnapping, and assault). Senator [[Robert Byrd]] stated, in introducing the bill that became 18 U.S.C. 351, "This legislation is needed to protect representative democracy. Passage would help guarantee the right of any Member of Congress to fulfill his constitutional duties and responsibilities as an elected official of our country."&lt;ref name=Layton&gt;{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

'''"Bass to Mouth"''' is the tenth episode of the [[South Park (season 15)|fifteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 219th episode overall. It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on October 19, 2011. Much of the episode's plot alludes to [[WikiLeaks]] and its surrounding controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://splitsider.com/2011/10/south-park-recap-bass-to-mouth|title=South Park Recap: 'Bass to Mouth' |last=Bahr |first=Lindsey |date=2011-10-20 |work=[[Splitsider]] |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and is rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States.

==Plot==
A new [[gossip]] website named Eavesdropper gains popularity among the [[List of students at South Park Elementary|students of South Park Elementary]] by posting embarrassing information gleaned through unlawful access to the confidential phone calls and emails of the school and its student body. While [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is elated at the embarrassment of one such student, Pete Melman, who defecated in his pants while in class, and required his mother to bring him a clean pair of [[jeans]], the school administrators are displeased. Recalling that a year earlier, another student, Corey Duran, suffered a similar incident and committed [[suicide]] as the result of Cartman spearheading a campaign of ridicule and torment against him, [[Mr. Mackey]], [[Principal Victoria]] and [[Mr. Adler]] ask Cartman not to let the same thing happen to Pete. Though Cartman initially rebuffs their request, telling them that it is impossible to contain such an incident, they offer to make it worth Cartman's while, piquing his interest.

Cartman engineers a repeat of Pete's incident by giving another student, Jenny Simons, [[cupcake]]s laced with laxatives, causing her to defecate in her pants in the middle of class. After Jenny breaks her [[pelvis]] by attempting suicide, Cartman is pleased, feeling that Jenny's suicide attempt will make everyone forget about Pete, but the administrators angrily explain to him that they did not want ''anyone'' to attempt suicide. After they tell him that he must fix this or forfeit that which they promised him, Cartman devises a plan to reward the student body for their recent state exam scores with a pizza party, at which they will feed the students pizza laced with [[laxatives]] and [[Arby's]] [[Horseradish|horsey sauce]], thus causing the entire student body to suffer the same misfortune as Pete and Jenny, diffusing the torment they experienced. Although initially outraged at Cartman's idea, they realize they do not have a better one, and decide to implement it.

The student body, save [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], continues to enjoy Eavesdropper until [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] has a change of heart when the site publishes information from a private email of his that he sent to [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. This revelation angers his girlfriend, Wendy. Rallying the student body against Eavesdropper, the students discover from the [[IP address]]es of the site's postings that they are being made from the school's music room, where they discover a blond-haired rat at a computer terminal. The rat escapes, though they discover that his name is [[WikiLeaks|Wikileaks]]. 

Meanwhile, Lemmiwinks, the old school gerbil from the episode "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]", who is now Vernon Trumpski's pet, is visited by the ghostly Frog King, who previously guided him to safety in that episode. The Frog King tells him that Lemmiwinks' brother, Wikileaks, is spreading terrible rumors based on hacked emails. When Lemmiwinks exhibits reluctance to confront his own brother, the Frog Prince and his colleague, the Sparrow Prince, send another spirit guide, the Catatafish, to Stan and his friends, instructing them to go to Trumpski's house and take Lemmiwinks.
	 	
As Cartman and the administrators prepare the pizza, the administrators uphold their end of the agreement by presenting singer [[Selena Gomez]] to Cartman, and then beating her up, much to Cartman's delight. Their actions are observed by Wikileaks, who announces to his site's visitors that he will soon reveal his biggest story yet. As the public reacts to this announcement, the school administrators, worried that they will be fired when their plan is exposed by Eavesdropper, devise to distract the public with an even bigger story, that of a student's suicide. Mackey decides that they will engineer Cartman's suicide by literally [[Throw under the bus|throwing him under a bus]].
	 	
The children procure Lemmiwinks from Vernon's home, and take him to the school by bus, but on the way there, the school administrators throw Cartman in front of it, and declare that Cartman committed suicide. The students and administrators continue with Lemmiwinks to the school, where he confronts and kills Wikileaks, allowing Mackey to delete the content of Eavesdropper. Cartman, who suffered only a broken arm and leg, gets revenge on the administrators by giving them laxative-laced cupcakes, causing Mackey to defecate so severely, it propels him through the hallway.

==Production==
In the creator commentary for the episode, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker said that the episode started with just the idea of Cartman helping the kid who crapped his pants before they realized that Wikileaks sounds like Lemmiwinks and it became a ''[[TMZ]]'' based episode. The fight between Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks was just a [[rotoscoped]] animation of real footage of two squirrels fighting.&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Trey Parker &amp; Matt Stone| date=March 2012 |title=South Park: The Complete Fifteenth Season: "Bass to Mouth"|format= |medium=DVD Disc|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Ryan McGhee of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' graded the episode a B, stating, "What seemed initially like the show’s take on school bullying turned into an epic struggle between two rats for supremacy. While the two main plots did intersect, they spent too long apart to truly feel like one and the same story. Both had strong elements, but didn’t fully mix."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/bass-to-mouth,63515/ |title=Bass To Mouth |last=McGee |first=Ryan |date=2011-10-19 |work=[[The A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3947">A military '''caretaker''' or '''caretaker detachment'''  is a group of one or more personnel assigned to maintain for future use a [[military base]], [[fortification]], or other facility that is ungarrisoned but not abandoned. Naval [[reserve fleet]]s and military aircraft in [[Aircraft boneyard|long-term storage]] are also maintained by caretakers. Whether the personnel are military or civilian varies by country, branch of service, and time period. 

==British use==
From 1688 through 1802 the [[Corps of Invalids (Great Britain)|Corps of Invalids]] was used for garrison and caretaking duties in the British Isles, freeing more capable troops for overseas service.&lt;ref name=dean&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dean |first1=C.

==United States use==
Some of the smaller [[US Army]] installations had only a single [[ordnance sergeant]] as a caretaker during that rank's existence from 1832 to 1920. Between wars many [[Seacoast defense in the United States|coastal fortifications]] would be among military facilities in caretaker status. For [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] forts, General Order No. 83 of 1913 specified caretaker detachment composition and duties in detail, requiring a minimum of one [[non-commissioned officer]] of coast artillery and three privates for each fort, also with an ordnance sergeant "when practicable".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BJ06AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA64&amp;lpg=RA1-PA64&amp;dq=caretaker+detachment&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HhvUv4vrxp&amp;sig=SLeVjIqE7Dnw6eA-wb08nYyaD_s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj36-a4jOLeAhUfJDQIHTp2CSQQ6AEwD3oECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=caretaker%20detachment&amp;f=false General Orders, No. 83, War Department, December 30, 1913]&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1914 55 US coastal forts (including seven in Hawaii and Panama) were garrisoned, while 39 (including six overseas) were not; the latter were under construction or in caretaker status.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xdagAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA613&amp;lpg=PA613&amp;dq=caretaker+detachment&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l3H6pXeGJ6&amp;sig=zHyd4Q5pxF7SoVeIK-rEJ-DmriI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVvtz-jOLeAhVRKH0KHfuKDwsQ6AEwCHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=caretaker%20detachment&amp;f=false US Army appropriation bill hearings, fiscal year 1916, pp. 611–614]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7448">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Caroline'' test}}
The '''''Caroline ''test''' is a 19th-century [[Legal tests|formulation]] of customary [[international law]], reaffirmed by the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Tribunal]] after [[World War II]], which said that the necessity for [[Preemptive war|preemptive self-defense]] must be "instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation." The test takes its name from the [[Caroline affair|''Caroline'' affair]].

==Historical background==
{{Main|Caroline Affair|Upper Canadian Rebellion of 1837}}

In 1837, settlers in [[Upper Canada]] rebelled against the [[Great Britain|British]] colonial government. The [[United States]] remained officially neutral about the rebellion, but American sympathizers assisted the rebels with men and supplies, transported by a [[steamboat]] named the ''Caroline''. In response, a British force from Canada entered United States territory at night, seized the ''Caroline'', set the ship on fire, and sent it over [[Niagara Falls]]. At least one American was killed.&lt;ref name=nichols&gt;Nichols, Thomas (2008). ''The Coming Age of Preventive War''. University of Pennsylvania Press. p. 2. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-4066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British claimed that the attack was an act of self-defense. In a letter to the British Ambassador, Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]] argued that a self-defense claimant would have to show that the:

{{quotation|
necessity of self-defense was instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of 
means, and no moment of deliberation ..., and that the British force, even 
supposing the necessity of the moment authorized them to enter the territories 
of the United States at all, did nothing unreasonable or excessive; since the act, 
justified by the necessity of self-defense, must be limited by that necessity, and 
kept clearly within it.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Daniel. 'Letter to [[Henry Stephen Fox]]', in K.E Shewmaker (ed.). ''The Papers of Daniel Webster: Diplomatic Papers, vol. 1. 1841-1843'' (1983) 62. Dartmouth College Press. {{ISBN|978-0-87451-245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
==Requirements==
The terms "anticipatory self-defense", "preemptive self-defense" and "preemption" traditionally refers to a state's right to strike first in self-defense when faced with imminent attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charles Pierson |year=2004 |title=Preemptive Self-Defense in an Age of Weapons of Mass Destruction: Operation Iraqi Freedom |journal=Denver Journal of International Law and Policy |publisher=University of Denver |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3262/is_1_33/ai_n29150681/?tag=content;col1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to justify such an action, the ''Caroline'' test has two distinct requirements:

# The use of force must be necessary because the threat is imminent and thus pursuing peaceful alternatives is not an option ('''necessity''');
# The response must be proportionate to the threat ('''proportionality''').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Legal War: A Justification for Military Action in Iraq |publisher=''Gonzaga Journal of International Law'' |url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/110/26/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116232151/http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/110/26/ |archivedate=2010-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Webster's original formulation, the necessity criterion is described as "instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation". This has later come to be referred to as "instant and overwhelming necessity".&lt;ref&gt;May, Larry (2007).  ''War Crimes and Just War''. Cambridge University Press. p. 206. {{ISBN|978-0-521-69153-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refname1&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirgis |first=Frederic L. |title=Pre-emptive Action to Forestall Terrorism |url=http://www.asil.org/insigh88.cfm |publisher=American Society of International Law |accessdate=17 August 2010 |date=June 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707020942/http://www.asil.org/insigh88.cfm |archivedate=7 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The principle of self-defense had been acknowledged prior to the ''Caroline'' test, but it was notable for setting out specific criteria by which it could be determined whether there had been a legitimate exercise of that right.&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;O'Brien, John (2002). ''International law''. Cavendish Publishing Limited. p. 682. {{ISBN|978-1-85941-630-3}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=wY4T25cRwCEC&amp;lpg=PA682&amp;ots=31yJD42EQM&amp;pg=PA682#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Extract]&lt;/ref&gt; The test was accepted by the United Kingdom and came to be accepted as part of [[customary international law]].&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;

The threat or use of force is prohibited by customary [[international law]] and the [[UN]] Charter when it is part of a [[Preventative war|preventive war]] waged against the territory of any State.  In the [[Lotus case|''Lotus'' case]], the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] decided, "the first and foremost restriction imposed by international law upon a State is that - failing the existence of a permissive rule to the contrary - it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory of another State."&lt;ref&gt;Case of the S.S. "Lotus" (France v. Turkey), PCIJ Series A, No. 10, at p. 18 (1927) [http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_A/A_10/30_Lotus_Arret.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927023939/http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_A/A_10/30_Lotus_Arret.pdf# |date=2013-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Caroline'' test was recognized and endorsed by the [[Nuremberg Tribunal]], who adopted the same words used in the test in judging [[Operation Weserübung|Germany's invasion of Norway and Denmark]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Olaoluwa, Olusanya (2006). ''Identifying the Aggressor Under International Law: A Principles Approach''. Peter Lang Pub Inc. p.  105. {{ISBN|978-3-03910-741-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of self-defense is permitted, when the conditions of customary international law regarding necessity and proportionality are met. [[Article 51]] of the UN Charter recognizes "the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense ''if an armed attack occurs'' against a Member of the United Nations, until the [[Security Council]] has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security." The ''Caroline'' test applies in cases where Article 51 is not a permissive rule because a defensive action was taken before an armed attack occurred.&lt;ref name=refname1/&gt;

To this day, the ''Caroline'' test is considered the customary law standard in determining the legitimacy of  self-defense action.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Helen (2005). ''The 'War on Terror' and the Framework of International Law''. Cambridge University Press. p. 157. {{ISBN|978-0-521-54735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Thomas Nichols wrote: {{Cquote| Thus the destruction of an insignificant ship in what one scholar has called a 'comic opera affair' in the early 19th century nonetheless led to the establishment of a principle of international life that would govern, at least in theory, the use of force for over 250 years.&lt;ref name=nichols /&gt;}}

A '''city manager''' is an official appointed as the [[Administration (government)|administrative]] [[Management|manager]] of a city, in a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] form of city government. Local officials serving in this position are sometimes referred to as the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) or [[chief administrative officer]] (CAO) in some municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naperville.il.us/community_relations_government.aspx City of Naperville&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Dayton, Ohio]] suffered a great flood in 1913, and responded with the innovation of a paid, non-political city manager, hired by the commissioners to run the bureaucracy; civil engineers were especially preferred. Other small or middle sized American cities, especially in the West, adopted the idea.

In Europe, smaller cities in the Netherlands were specially attracted by the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Couperus, "The managerial revolution in local government: municipal management and the city manager in the USA and the Netherlands 1900–1940." ''Management &amp; Organizational History'' (2014) 9#4 pp: 336-352.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1940 there were small cities with city managers that grew enormously by the end of the century: Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; Rochester, New York; and San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;Harold A. Stone et al., ''City Manager Government in Nine Cities'' (1940); Frederick C. Mosher et al., ''City Manager Government in Seven Cities'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a technical sense, the term "city manager," as opposed to CAO, implies more discretion and independent authority that is set forth in a charter or some other body of [[codified law]], as opposed to duties being assigned on a varying basis by a single superior such as a mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Svara, James H. and Kimberly L. Nelson. (2008, August). Taking Stock of the Council-Manager Form at 100. ''Public Management'' Magazine, pp 6-14, at: {{cite web |url=http://icma.org/pm/9007/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831195247/http://www.icma.org/pm/9007/ |archivedate=2008-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Municipal government diagram.png|thumb|500px|Municipal government diagram.]]
Most sources trace the first city manager to [[Staunton, Virginia]] in 1908. Some of the other cities that were among the first to employ a manager were [[Sumter, South Carolina]] (1912) and [[Dayton, Ohio]] (1914); Dayton was featured in the national media, and became a national standard. The first "City Manager's Association" meeting of eight city managers was in December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City managing, a new profession |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/433/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Dec 14, 1914 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city manager, operating under the [[council-manager government]] form, was created in part to remove city government from the power of the political parties, and place management of the city into the hands of an outside expert who was usually a business manager or engineer, with the expectation that the city manager would remain neutral to city politics.  By 1930 200 American cities used a city manager form of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Bruce Fairbanks|author2=Patricia Mooney-Melvin|author3=Zane L. Miller|title=Making Sense of the City: Local Government, Civic Culture, and Community Life in Urban America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jT_3aZGDE4C&amp;pg=PA85|year=2001|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
As the top appointed official in the city, the city manager is typically responsible for most if not all of the day-to-day administrative operations of the municipality, in addition to other expectations.&lt;ref name=duties&gt;[http://bookstore.icma.org/FreeDocs/Council-Manager%20FAQ%20Brochure.pdf Council Manager Form of Government, ICMA publication]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duties#2"&gt;[http://icma.org/upload/library/2009-06/%7B660CAD64-A62D-4486-B22B-BDD53952F8AA%7D.pdf Sample Ordinance, ICMA.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the basic roles, responsibilities, and powers of a city manager include:
* Supervision of day-to-day operations of all city departments and staff through department heads;
* Oversight of all recruitment, dismissal, disciplining and suspensions;
* Preparation, monitoring, and execution of the city budget, which includes submitting each year to the council a proposed budget package with options and recommendations for its consideration and possible approval;
* Main technical advisor to the council on overall governmental operations;
* Public relations, such as meeting with citizens, citizen groups, businesses, and other stakeholders (the presence of a mayor may alter this function somewhat);
* Operating the city with a professional understanding of how all city functions operate together to their best effect;

The responsibilities may vary depending upon charter provisions and other local or state laws, rules, and regulations. In addition, many states, such as the states of New Hampshire and Missouri, have codified in law the minimum functions a local "manager" must perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C000-099/0780000610.HTM MRS] [http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/III/37/37-6.htm NH RSA]&lt;/ref&gt; The City Manager position focuses on efficiency and providing a certain level of service for the lowest possible cost.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Lynn. "The Impact Of Government Structure On Local Public Expenditures." Public Choice 136.3/4 (2008): 457-473. Political Science Complete. Web. 25 Sept. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; The competence of a city manager can be assessed using composite indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manager members of the ICMA are bound by a rather rigid and strongly enforced code of ethics that was originally established in 1924. Since that time the code had been up-dated/revised on seven occasions, the latest taking place in 1998. The updates have taken into account the evolving duties, responsibilities, and expectations of the profession; however the core dictate of the body of the code--“to integrity; public service; seek no favor; exemplary conduct in both personal and professional matters; respect the role and contributions of elected officials; exercise the independence to do what is right; political neutrality; serve the public equitably and governing body members equally; keep the community informed about local government matters; and support and lead our employ-ees”—have not changed since the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?bcid=72&amp;hsid=1&amp;ssid1=2514&amp;ssid2=2570&amp;ssid3=2571 |title=ICMA Code of Ethics page |access-date=2009-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106171929/http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?bcid=72&amp;hsid=1&amp;ssid1=2514&amp;ssid2=2570&amp;ssid3=2571 |archive-date=2007-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile==
In the early years of the profession, most managers came from the ranks of the engineering professions.&lt;ref name=stillman&gt;Stillman, Richard J. (1974). ''The Rise of the City Manager: A Public Professional in Local Government.'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the typical and preferred background and education for the beginning municipal manager is a master's degree in Public Administration (MPA) and at least several years’ experience as a department head in local government or as an assistant city manager. As of 2005 more than 60% of those in the profession had a MPA, MBA, or other related higher-level degree.&lt;ref name="ICMA#1"&gt;[http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?ssid1=2868&amp;ssid3=2868&amp;from=search&amp;hsid=9&amp;bcid=812 ICMA statistics]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average tenure of a manager is now 7–8 years and has risen gradually over the years. Tenures tend to be less in smaller communities and higher in larger ones, and they tend to vary as well depending on the region of the country.&lt;ref name="ICMA#1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ammons, David M and Matthew J. Bosse. (2005). “Tenure of City Managers: Examining the Dual Meanings of ‘Average Tenure’.” ''State &amp; Local Government Review'', Vol. 37, No. 1, pp. 61-71. at: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4355387]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2892">The '''Corrective Revolution''' (officially launched as the "Corrective Movement")&lt;ref name="books.google.no"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DVxr9qy-g2EC&amp;pg=PA168]&lt;/ref&gt; was a reform program (officially just a change in policy) launched on 15 May 1971 by [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Anwar Sadat]].&lt;ref name="books.google.no"/&gt; It involved purging [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] members of the government and security forces, often considered pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], and drumming up popular support by presenting the takeover as a continuation of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], while at the same time radically changing track on issues of foreign policy, economy, and ideology. Sadat's Corrective Revolution also included the imprisonment of other political forces in Egypt, including [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Islamism|Islamists]].

==History==
Shortly after taking office, Sadat shocked many Egyptians by dismissing and imprisoning two of the most powerful figures in the regime, Vice President [[Ali Sabri]], who had close ties with Soviet officials, and Sharawy Gomaa, the Interior Minister, who controlled the secret police.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1225.html|work=The New York Times|title=Anwar el-Sadat, the Daring Arabian Pioneer of Peace with Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadat's rising popularity would accelerate after he cut back the powers of the secret police,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; expelled Soviet military from the country and reformed the Egyptian army for a renewed confrontation with Israel.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; During this time, Egypt was suffering greatly from economic problems caused by the [[Six-Day War]] and the Soviet relationship also declined due to their unreliability and refusal of Sadat's requests for more military support.&lt;ref name="Anwar Sadat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iBiblio.org/sullivan/bios/Sadat-bio.html |title=Anwar Sadat |accessdate=22 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125000520/http://ibiblio.org/sullivan/bios/Sadat-bio.html |archivedate=25 January 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadat also targeted [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Islamism|Islamists]]. The imprisonment of Islamists had a strong effect later on, as these Islamists were often members of the [[Takfir wal-Hijra]] movement and the Corrective Revolution marked the beginning of the crackdown that caused them to spread across the Arab world and Europe, ultimately resulting in the spread of radical political Islam in these regions, and also the [[assassination of Anwar Sadat]].

For instance, in 2013, the [[World Bank]] blacklisted [[SNC-Lavalin]] and its subsidiaries from "bidding on its global projects under its fraud and corruption policy" due to the Padma Bridge scandal.&lt;ref name="bank_corruption"/&gt; Canada also ranks at the bottom of the bribery-fighting rankings, "with little or no enforcement of anti-bribery measures".&lt;ref name="canada_at_bottom_in_fighting_bribery"/&gt; The 2014 [[Ernst &amp; Young]] global fraud survey found that "twenty percent of Canadian executives believe bribery and corruption are widespread in this country".&lt;ref name="canada_not_immune"/&gt; According to a study by the Graduate School of Public Policy at the [[University of Saskatchewan]], "a large proportion of Canadians see their politicians and their institutions as fundamentally corrupt".&lt;ref name="discrepancies"/&gt;

=== Ontario ===
Corruption in [[Ontario]] is increasingly a major issue in government, civil service, business and non-profit sectors. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} In the last decade{{when|date=May 2016}}, the Ontario Liberal government has faced serious and high-profile corruption cases including [[eHealth Ontario|eHealth Scandal]], [[Ontario power plant scandal]], and [[Ornge#December 2011-February - financial scandal and police investigation|Ornge scandal]]. These cases have implicated the leadership of the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Ontario Liberal party]] in corruption, including former three-time premier [[Dalton McGuinty]]. The [[Kathleen Wynne]]-led Liberal government that succeeded him is facing several corruption cases including bribery during elections.&lt;ref name="ontari_election_bribery"/&gt; Prominent Liberal Party fundraiser [[Gerry Lougheed Jr.]] has been criminally charged by the [[Ontario Provincial Police]].&lt;ref name="ontario_liberal_party_bribery_scandal"/&gt; Wynne stood by Lougheed even after the police filed charges.&lt;ref name="ontario_liberal_party_bribery_scandal"/&gt; Lougheed was later acquitted. &lt;!--http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/sudbury-byelection-scandal-gerry-lougheed-1.4271574--&gt;

Ontario's Liberal government has been accused of corruption for its dealings with teachers' unions ([[Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation]], [[Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association]], [[Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario]]). According to accusations{{who|date=May 2016}}, the Liberal government offers "rich contracts, special treatment, secret agreements and generous payoffs with public dollars" for the teachers' unions, and other unions in return for helping the Liberal government get elected and stay in power.&lt;ref name="ontario_liberal_party_teachers_union_corruption"/&gt; An investigation in  ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' found that the Ontario government has offered{{clarify|date=May 2016}} more than $3.7 million in secret payments to teachers' unions.&lt;ref name="ontario_liberal_party_teachers_payout"/&gt;

The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] has alleged that [[Ontario Provincial Police Association]] leaders, including President James (Jim) Christie, Vice-president Martin Bain and chief administrative officer Karl Walsh have committed [[fraud]], and guilty of [[money laundering]] and corruption. The charges include "unusual investment of union money in condos in the Bahamas", "formation of a company to provide exclusive travel services for both union business and personal travel by members", "formation of a consulting company" that billed the union $5000 per month, and for "questionable vacation and travel expenses billed to the union".&lt;ref name="ontario_police_union_corruption"/&gt;

=== Québec ===
The [[Charbonneau Commission]] established in 2011 to investigate corruption in Québec, has uncovered long running, widespread corruption including "price-fixing schemes among construction companies bidding on municipal governments", "illegal donations to the province's major political parties from some of its biggest engineering firms" and links between the [[Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec]], the Quebec Federation of Labour (FTQ), the province's biggest federation of unions, and organized crime.&lt;ref name="quebec_corruption_problem"/&gt;

On January 26, 2017, the former mayor of Montreal [[Michael Applebaum]] was found guilty of 8 corruption-related charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jaela Bernstien|title=Ex-Montreal mayor Michael Applebaum found guilty of 8 corruption-related charges|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/applebaum-ruling-corruption-1.3952413|accessdate=January 26, 2017|agency=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=January 26, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applebaum was found guilty in relation to cash kickbacks related to real estate development projects and a municipal contract for the management and maintenance of the NDG Sports Centre.

In 2015, employees of EBR Information Technology firm, [[IBM]] Canada and [[Revenu Québec]] were arrested for fraud, conspiracy and breach of trust in relation to computer equipment and services contracts to the provincial government.&lt;ref name="ibm_ebr_arrests"/&gt; There are widespread "financial and management irregularities with the Québec government's computer networks."&lt;ref name="quebec_it_fraud"/&gt;

== Corruption by sector ==

=== Health ===
Dr. [[Shiv Chopra]], a former employee of [[Health Canada]] and a [[whistle-blower]], has criticized Health Canada for circumventing safety and efficacy regulations to please product manufacturers, for systematic collusion with corporations in "extra-parliamentary decisions involving the imposition of new risks on society" and for overlooking the responsibility to protect health and humans, in pursuit of [[capital (economics)|capital]]-making profits".&lt;ref name="corrupt_to_the_core"/&gt; Dr. [[Michele Brill-Edwards]] previously issued similar warnings and expressed the same concerns earlier.

Some doctors and clinics have been found to overbill and/or double bill the [[Medicare (Canada)|Canadian Health System]].&lt;ref name="doctors_overbill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="companies_overbill"/&gt; Some walk-in clinics intake regular patients at a higher cost to the system without informing the patients about the cost or other options that might be available.&lt;ref name="walk_in_clinics_corruption"/&gt; In Canada, doctors do not disclose the costs of visits or procedures to the patients. That information can only be obtained through a freedom of information request. This lack of transparency contributes to the proliferation of this form of corruption.

Some dentists overcharge, change the codes for the procedures, waiving co-payment{{clarify|date=May 2016}} or treat patients other than the insurance holder.

In Alberta, a medical inquiry established the existence of queue-jumping and illegal fast-tracking of private clinic referrals.&lt;ref name="queue_jumbing"/&gt; Alberta's former head of Health Services, [[Stephen Duckett]], noted that "preferential access to care was a common practice when he took over and politicians had fixers who could get valued constituents faster treatment."&lt;ref name="queue_jumbing"/&gt;

=== Education ===
Some private high schools have been found to illegally and unethically aid students earn inflated grades, credits and credentials.&lt;ref name="cash_for_marks_torstar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BC_private_schools_buy_marks"/&gt; Thus, those with financial means are able to access top university programs and scholarships at the expense of merit students.&lt;ref name="cash_for_marks_torstar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marks_for_fee"/&gt; These schools are referred to as "credit mills" or "credit shops".&lt;ref name="marks_for_fee"/&gt; Lax governmental oversight is a major cause of this corruption.&lt;ref name="cash_for_marks_torstar"/&gt;

A report in 2007 said that the majority of students at Canadian universities are engaged in cheating.&lt;ref name="cheating_scandal"/&gt; Among the cheaters, a disproportionate number are international students.&lt;ref name="cheating_international_students"/&gt; "Students who cheat are unlikely to be caught and face few penalties when they are."&lt;ref name="cheating_scandal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cheating_students"/&gt;

=== Research and Scholarly Publishing ===
Two of Canada's leading medical journal publishers [[Andrew John Publishing]] and [[Pulsus Group]] have been purchased by [[OMICS Publishing Group]], which is considered a [[Predatory open access publishing|predatory]] and junk science publisher.&lt;ref name="junk_science"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2016/09/29/canadian-medical-journals-hijacked-for-junk-science.html | title=Canadian medical journals hijacked for junk science | publisher=The Toronto Star | date=September 29, 2016 | accessdate=September 29, 2016 | author=Marco Chown Oved &amp; Favaro &amp; Elizabeth St. Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMICS is being sued by [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]]. FTC has alleged that OMICS "misrepresented the legitimacy of its publications, deceived researchers, and obfuscated sizeable publication fee."&lt;ref name="ftc_crack_down"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/2016/09/ftc-cracking-predatory-science-journals/ | title=The FTC Is Cracking Down on Predatory Science Journals | publisher=Wired | date=September 19, 2016 | accessdate=September 29, 2016 | author=Megan Molteni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulsus Group has been on [[Jeffrey Beall]]'s list of "Potential, possible, or probable" [[Predatory open access publishing|predatory open-access publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/ |title=LIST OF PUBLISHERS |work=Scholarly Open Access |last1=Beall |first1=Jeffrey |authorlink=Jeffrey Beall |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917143148/https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/ |archivedate=September 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax ===
Canada has a very high rate of [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref name="cost_of_tax_evasion"/&gt; Individuals and companies with high net worths use offshore [[tax haven]]s to illegally avoid paying tax. Canadians have $170 billion sitting in the world's top ten tax-haven countries.&lt;ref name="Canadians_offshore_havens"/&gt; Canadian federal and provincial governments lose an estimated $8 billion a year to tax havens alone.&lt;ref name="Canadians_offshore_havens"/&gt; [[Black market]] or under-the-table commercial activity also contributes to tax avoidance losses. The full cost of tax evasion is an estimated $80 billion per year.&lt;ref name="cost_of_tax_evasion"/&gt; Tax evasion and corruption are facilitated by lawyers, administrative corruption and inefficiency in the [[Canada Revenue Agency]],&lt;ref name="CRA_corruption"/&gt; Canadian and foreign banks.&lt;ref name="Canadas_banks_help_tax_havens"/&gt;

Canada's lax regulations make it one of the top{{clarify|date=May 2016}} countries for anonymous shell companies,&lt;ref name="shell_companies"/&gt; which are often used for tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing and organized crime.

Highly reputed multinational accounting firm [[KPMG]] has been accused by the Canada Revenue Agency of offering tax evasion schemes as products to its clients. It alleged that the KPMG tax structures were in reality a "sham" intended to deceive the tax authorities.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/kpmg-offshore-sham-deceived-tax-authorities-cra-alleges-1.3209838 |title=KPMG Offshore 'Sham' Deceived Tax Authorities, CRA Alleges |work=cbc.ca |date=September 10, 2015 |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; KPMG offered a "no tax" scheme in return for a fee of 15%{{clarify|date=May 2016}} and in one case before the courts, it earned $300,000 in fees.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

=== Law Enforcement ===
{{See also|List of excessive police force incidents in Canada|List of controversies involving the Royal Canadian Mounted Police}}
The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]]'s own study found 330 internal corruption cases between 1995 and 2005.&lt;ref name="rcmp_corruption_study"/&gt; "Improperly giving out police information was the most common type of corrupt behaviour, followed by fraud, misuse of police officer status, theft and interference with the judicial process."&lt;ref name="rcmp_corruption_study"/&gt; These numbers are likely an understatement of true levels as the RCMP has admitted not tracking "hundreds of cases of serious misconduct committed by Mounties across the country for years".&lt;ref name="rcmp_corruption"/&gt; Also, in 2013 nearly 300 current and former female Mounties joined a class-action lawsuit alleging harassment.&lt;ref name="rcmp_sexual_assult"/&gt;

[[Canada Border Services Agency|CBSA]] which was formed out of the merger of the 3 legacy border protection agencies, in 2004, including, Immigration Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Canada Customs and currently has no oversight body what so ever.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} It is widely believed there is a considerable amount of questionable activity has gone largely unnoticed, unreported or suppressed according to complaints from former and current Border Service Officers, (BSO's). Most of the few cases, have been in the media only briefly, and had little to no follow up.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The CBSA, normally distances itself from liability by blaming "rogue employees", other departments and outside contractors. The complaint process is nearly impossible to navigate for both the public and employees. Many of those employees who have spoken out, have stated they were in fear of reprisals. Despite legislation known as ATIP, or Access to Information Policy, acquiring statistics, or reports is also a complex process, that can take months despite the standard 60-day law to comply and appeals to the Public Service Integrity Commission are often "Well Founded." Early retirements are a common remedy for offenses involving management.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

As noted above, Ontario Provincial Police Association leadership has allegedly committed fraud, money laundering and corruption.&lt;ref name="ontario_police_union_corruption"/&gt;

In 2016, [[Toronto Police Service]] faced several high-profile cases of corruption and disproportionate use of force. Constable James Forcillo was found guilty of attempt of murder in the death of 18-year-old [[Death of Sammy Yatim|Sammy Yatim]].&lt;ref name="sammy_yatim_death"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2016/01/25/jury-returns-in-murder-trial-for-const-james-forcillo-charged-in-shooting-death-of-sammy-yatim.html | title=Forcillo guilty of attempted murder in shooting death of Sammy Yatim | date=January 25, 2016 | accessdate=January 28, 2016 | author=Alyshah Hasham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four police officers were arrested and charged with "nine counts of obstructing justice and eight counts of perjury".&lt;ref name="toronto_police_charged_with_obstructing_justice_and_perjury"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-police-saunders-1.3423318 | title=4 Toronto police officers charged with perjury, obstructing justice | date=January 28, 2016 | agency=[[CBC News]] | accessdate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-profit sector ===
In Canada, donations to recognized [[Charitable organizations (Canada)|charities]] receive tax refunds. This system has been abused extensively. "Typically, tax-shelter firms hook up with a little-known charity that becomes a sort of tax receipt mill, suddenly writing millions of dollars in bogus receipts and making grandiose claims of saving the world.  Some $3.2 billion in receipts given in the last few years to 100,000 Canadians have either been disallowed or soon will be".&lt;ref name="charity_tax_scam"/&gt;

Many charities have been found to be shell organizations for profit based schemes.&lt;ref name="charity_scam"/&gt; A [[Toronto Star]] investigation revealed that "self-reported information is so riddled with inaccuracies as to be absolutely useless to a donor" and federal government does not verify the claims by charities of their area of "good works".&lt;ref name="charity_scam"/&gt;  Further more, "The Star found the primary regulator, the federal Charities Directorate, is virtually powerless to deal with problem charities."&lt;ref name="charity_scam"/&gt;

Several charities in Canada have been found to be front organizations for terrorist organizations or organized crime.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Insurance ===
[[Insurance fraud#Automobile insurance|Auto insurance fraud]] involving scammers, auto repair shops, paralegals and medical clinics is widespread in Ontario. It is estimated that the auto insurance fraud costs [[Ontario]] drivers $1.3 billion per year.&lt;ref name="auto_insurance_fraud"/&gt; Other forms of insurance fraud are also relatively common, including that related to homes and property, and disability and workers' compensation which anecdotal evidence, at least, suggests is rife with abuse and fraud.

Investigation into insurance scams in [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]] revealed that [[Peel Regional Police|police officers]] colluded with the [[Tow-truck driver|tow truck drivers]] and fraudsters in staging accidents. "Fraudulent accident reports" were provided by a veteran officer. Other officers were involved in tipping off the tow trucks of the accident locations.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Drivers licensing ===
Canadian provinces mandate written and road tests (graduated licensing) to obtain license to drive automobiles. Truck drivers must undergo specialized training and obtain a commercial license. Some provinces such as Ontario has privatized drivers licensing, while others offer it as a public service. There exist corruption at various levels of drivers licensing.

A dangerous corruption is when non-qualified people obtain drivers licenses by bribing licensing officers.&lt;ref name="bribing_drivers_license_employees"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fake_drivers_licensing"/&gt; Issuing of fake in-class driving lesson certificates is another scam related to obtaining licensing. In-class driver lesson certificates are used to get discount rates from insurance companies.

A Toronto Star investigation found that "truck-driver testing centre is letting learners earn their licences without being required to drive on a major expressway".&lt;ref name="truck_driving_scheme"/&gt; Further more, many driving schools offer in-vehicle "lessons even though they are not authorized  by the province to do so".&lt;ref name="truck_driving_scheme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="truck_driving_unregulated_schools"/&gt;

Another fraud associated with drivers licensing is issuance of fake drivers licenses. In many cases, drivers licensing officers have been bribed to issue fake licenses which are then used for various illegal purposes such as to obtain credit, make insurance claims etc.&lt;ref name="fake_drivers_licensing"/&gt;

=== Real estate ===
Fraud and corruption is committed by all parties at all levels in the real estate sector. Buyers, sellers, realtors, developers, lawyers, mortgage brokers and banks have been implicated in various fraud and corruption cases.&lt;ref name="mortgage_fraud"/&gt; Money laundering, lying about income and occupation, fake bids, value falsification, title fraud and falsely claiming as owner-occupied are common real estate frauds in Canada.&lt;ref name="law_society_report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mortgage_fraud_definition"/&gt;

Money laundering is likely in the real estate sector of major Canadian cities. Chinese buyers are suspected of laundering money through the Vancouver real estate market in large numbers, with the help of major Canadian banks.&lt;ref name="vancover_real_estate_money_laundering"/&gt; According to a ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' investigation, "some Canadian banks allow wealthy Asian investors to skirt Chinese law by helping them bring in large amounts of money, which is then often used to buy real estate in Vancouver."&lt;ref name="banks_bend_rules"/&gt; A report by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada indicates "dramatic under-reporting of large cash transactions and suspicious transactions" in the Vancouver real estate sector.&lt;ref name="vancover_real_estate_money_laundering"/&gt;

In 2012, Equifax uncovered $400 million of mortgage fraud in Canada, which experts suspect represents only a fraction of the cheating taking place in the country's real estate market".&lt;ref name="eqifax_realestate_fraud_report"/&gt;

The [[Panama Papers]] leak of documents from the law offices of [[Mossack Fonseca]] brought to light a rather high level of referrals by Canadian banks to the Panamanian offshore specialist. The [[Royal Bank of Canada]] (RBC) sent 370+ clients to Mossack Fonseca over the years, for example, but they underlined that the bank did not help its customers to avoid taxes or hide income. "We have an extensive due diligence process... RBC works within the legal and regulatory framework of every country in which we operate," said a bank spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/panama-papers-business-reaction-1.3519525 |title=RBC t wrongdoing after being named in Panama Papers:'There are a number of legitimate reasons' to set up foreign holding companies, bank spokesman says |publisher=CBC News |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; RBC CEO [[David I.

''abc.com.py''.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that any link between Canadian businesses and the Panama Papers offshore companies must have originated a long time ago, before Canadian banks took action to stop money laundering.&lt;ref name="canada1"/&gt;

==Government and civil service ==

=== Employment insurance overcharges===

In the late 1990s and 2000s, the Government of Canada illegally overcharged Canadians with respect to employment insurance premiums. The overcharges exceeded $40 billion. As noted by the Auditor General of Canada in her 2004 report:
:Parliament did not intend, in my view, that the Account would accumulate a surplus beyond what could reasonably be spent for employment insurance purposes, given the existing benefit structure, while also providing for an economic downturn. Accordingly, in my opinion, the Government did not observe the intent of the Employment Insurance Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Auditor General of Canada|title=2004 Public Accounts of the Government of Canada|url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/201/301/public_accounts_can/pdf/2004/v1pa04e.pdf|accessdate=January 26, 2017|pages=2. 29 to 2. 30|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2008, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the overcharges were unlawful. As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''Confédération des syndicats nationaux v. Canada (Attorney General)'':

:[96] For these reasons, I would therefore allow the appeals in part and declare that the versions of ss. 66.1  and 66.3  of the Employment Insurance Act  that applied in 2002, 2003 and 2005 are invalid and that employers' and employees' premiums for 2002, 2003 and 2005 were collected unlawfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confédération des syndicats nationaux v.

=== Panama Papers ===
No Canadian politicians' names from the national government have surfaced in the [[Panama Papers]] as of the end of May 2016. ''The Globe and Mail'' did ask Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]], whose name did not appear in either of the document releases, about this, for the record. He told reporters that he does not have any money in offshore accounts, and had "entirely and completely been transparent about mine and my family's finances. That is something I learned early on that Canadians expect from their leaders."&lt;ref name="canada3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fife|first1=Robert|title=Trudeau says he does not have money in offshore accounts|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-says-he-does-not-have-money-in-offshore-accounts/article29563513/|accessdate=April 9, 2016|agency=The Globe and Mail Inc.|work=The Globe and Mail|date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some names of Canadian individuals did appear in the leaked documents, according to ICIJ investigation partner the ''Toronto Star''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2016/04/04/how-offshore-tax-havens-are-costing-canada-billions-of-dollars-a-year.html# |title=How offshore banking is costing Canada billions of dollars a year: An unprecedented leak of secretive offshore tax-haven data contains stunning new revelations about the diversion of wealth from government coffers to hidden bank accounts |author1=Robert Cribb |author2=Marco Chown Oved |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadians for Tax Fairness{{who|date=May 2016}} has calculated that legal tax avoidance by corporations alone cost the Canadian treasury almost $8 billion (Canadian) a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/04/06/homegrown-loopholes-cost-canada-more-than-panama-tax-havens-walkom.html |title=Homegrown loopholes cost Canada more than Panama tax havens: Walkom |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 30, 2016 |publisher=The Star |author=Thomas Walkom}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it calculated the 2015 numbers, the group found that corporations and individuals combined sent CAN$40 billion of declared assets to tax havens, and the ten most popular tax havens alone now held $270 billion (Canadian) in assets.&lt;ref name="Marco Chown Oved"/&gt;

=== Paradise Papers ===
More than 3,000 Canadian names including three former [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime ministers]], current [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal party]] operatives, a hockey team, trusts, foundations and individuals are identified in the [[Paradise Papers]] relating to offshore accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/paradise-papers-canada-connection-1.4386126 |title=More than 3,000 Canadian names in the Paradise Papers |date=November 6, 2017 |work=CBC |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/paradise-papers/2017/11/05/massive-leak-pulls-back-the-curtain-on-offshore-tax-havens-again.html |title=Massive leak pulls back the curtain on offshore tax havens — again |date=November 5, 2017 |work=The Toronto Star |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents link [[:fr:Stephen Bronfman|Stephen Bronfman]], the chief liberal party fund-raiser and close aide to prime minister [[Justin Trudeau]] to tax avoidance schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/justin-trudeau-adviser-stephen-bronfman-offshore-paradise-papers |title=Revealed: Justin Trudeau's close adviser helped move huge sums offshore |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |date=November 5, 2017 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax expert Marwah Rizqy has noted that if these documents are proven accurate, they contain the "smoking gun" linking Stephen Bronfman to illegal tax sheltering/avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stephen-bronfman-trudeau-paradise-papers-1.4382511 |title=Trudeau's chief fundraiser linked to Cayman Islands tax scheme |date=November 5, 2017 |work=CBC |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-corruption mechanisms ==

=== Public Service Commission ===
Canada's public service is set up to work independently from the political party in power. The mandate of the [[Public Service Commission of Canada|Public Service Commission]] is to protect the public service from political interference and "ensure professional, non-partisan public service".&lt;ref name="psc"/&gt; The Office of Public Service Values and Ethics is tasked with implementing values, ethics and policies to prevent corruption.&lt;ref name="best_practices"/&gt;

The [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] government of [[Stephen Harper]] defeated in the last election, has been criticized for political interference in an array of administrative bodies including Statistics Canada, Elections Canada, the Canadian Military Complaints Commission, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, Public Works and the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="independence_of_public_service_study"/&gt;

=== Auditor General, Ombudsman ===
Canada's federal and provincial governments have independent and strong [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] offices. The Auditor-General reports to the Parliament, not to the cabinet, and conducts annual and special audits to examine the government's activities and hold it to account. Auditor-General reports have brought to light major scandals, corruption, waste and inefficiencies, and led to changes in governments.

Ombudsman offices are tasked with investigating public complaints about government. Special ombudsmans or commissioners are tasked with investigating and reporting to Parliament about key areas. The [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]], Environment and Sustainable Development Commissioner and [[Information Commissioner of Canada]] are examples of these special offices.

=== Civilian oversight bodies ===
Civilian oversight bodies are used to hold account, to check power and provide input for government and industry bodies. They are specially used to hold account the police, RCMP, military and [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|CSIS]].

In 2012, Office of the Inspector General, which was a key oversight body for the Canada's spy agency CSIS was abolished by the Conservative government.&lt;ref name="csis_overseer_abolished"/&gt; The government said the oversight functions were consolidated within the civilian [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]].

=== ''Access to Information Act'' ===
Canada's ''[[Access to Information Act]]'' came into force in 1983. However, in recent years the legislation has been severely criticized to be outdated and in-effective. Centre for Law and Democracy ranks Canada 56th out of 95 countries in terms of the strength of the Access to Information legislation.&lt;ref name="access_to_information_blocked"/&gt; Both Federal and various Provincial and Territorial access to information systems are overburdened, in part, by the refusal of many governments and agencies to informally release various data either as a matter of routine course or upon informal request, instead demanding that written requests be made pursuant to relevant access to information legislation, subsequently triggering a cumbersome and time consuming formal process for frequently trivial and even obviously public information. As of 2015 there are thousands of individuals employed full-time throughout all levels of government and their agencies tasked with processing formal requests for access to information; this represents a cost to the Canadian taxpayer of hundreds of millions of dollars annually and does not include additional expenses including outside legal and other professional opinions, tribunal hearings, motions and appeals in courts, multiple access to information commissions and tribunals across the country, and various other expenses that likely bring the annual cost to the taxpayer into the billions of dollars.

An investigation by the Information Commissioner of Canada has found that the conservative government's staff have systematically interfered with the processing of access to information requests.&lt;ref name="tories_intefer_with_right_to_information"/&gt;

=== Conflict of Interest laws ===
All levels of governments enforce conflict of interest laws for civil servants and politicians. The laws generally require disclosure of actual or perceived conflict of interests and appropriate measures, such as recusal from decisions.&lt;ref name="conflick_of_interest"/&gt;

Conflict of interest laws have been used to highlight an array of improper dealings by politicians. For instance, in 2015 an Ethics Commissioner report found "Government Services Minister Diane Finley breached conflict-of-interest rules by giving preferential treatment and federal funding to a project" that received "one of its lowest ratings" in an assessment done by the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development.&lt;ref name="conflict-of-interest"/&gt; The project proposal was submitted by the Canadian Federation of Chabad Lubavitch by Ottawa rabbi Chaim Mendelsohn, who had close ties to the Conservative party, the Prime Minister's Office and then-foreign affairs minister John Baird."&lt;ref name="conflict-of-interest"/&gt;

=== Federal Accountability Act ===
[[Federal Accountability Act]] is a major anti-corruption legislation passed in 2006 by the [[Premiership of Stephen Harper|Harper Conservative government]].  It introduced several mechanisms to combat corruption including [[Commissioner of Lobbying]], [[Parliamentary Budget Officer]], [[Public Sector Integrity Commissioner]], [[Ethics Commissioner (Canada)|Ethics Commissioner]], limits to election donations and enhancement of lobbying rules.

=== Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act ===
[[Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (Canada)|Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act]] is a [[whistleblower]] protection act. The act "provides a confidential process for employees in Canada's federal public sector to come forward with any information about possible wrongdoing within the federal government and state corporations", except Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) and the Canadian Forces.

=== Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act ===
Canada signed and agreed to implement the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] and the [[OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]. The [[Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act]] (CFPOA) was enacted in 1999. The CFPOA applies to persons and companies, aiming to prevent and punish the acts of bribery of foreign public officials to obtain or retain a business advantage. Companies have to develop effective compliance programs with focus on specific areas relevant for the CFPOA.

The aim of the law is to monitor, punish and prevent bribery and other criminal acts being committed by Canadians and Canadian companies in foreign countries. In 2014, Ottawa consultant Nazir Karigar was the first person to be convicted under this law. He was convicted for the Air India bribery scheme.

A 2013 progress report indicates that Canada has failed to implement many of the recommendations and earns an overall score of "Moderate". OECD criticized Canada for lack of prosecutions and lack of resource allocation to address corruption.

=== Opendata, open government, and transparency initiatives ===
Canadian governments at all levels and citizen organizations have undertaken various [[Open data in Canada|Open data]], [[Open government]] and transparency initiatives. The Open Government Strategy was launched by the federal government in March 2011. Various datasets have been released under municipal open data initiatives such as [[Toronto Open Data]]. Sharing of MP/MPP/Councilor expenses online, sunshine lists, posting detail program budgets and expenditures online and crime statistics are some examples of open data being released online. Open data has increased public scrutiny of abuses, helping monitor, prosecute and prevent corruption.

=== International conventions and transparency initiatives ===
Canada has ratified [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] and the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]].

The government of Canada is part of the multilateral [[Open Government Partnership]] initiative. Canada joined the [[International Aid Transparency Initiative]] (IATI) in 2011. Canada was a supporting country to the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]], and it intends to implement the EITI.

=== First Nations Financial Transparency Act ===
The First Nations Financial Transparency Act was created in 2013 by the Harper Conservative government, with the purpose of increasing financial transparency in First Nations Communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/first-nations-financial-transparency-act-becomes-law-reserve-audits-chiefs-salaries-to-be-publicized|title=First Nations financial transparency act becomes law; reserve audits, chiefs' salaries to be publicized|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Nations Financial Transparency Act requires First Nation bands to publicly disclose their financial statements, including salary information of their councillors. Disclosure of this information has highlighted relatively high salaries of many chiefs, in comparison to extreme poor living conditions of their members. For instance, Shuswap band has 87 on-reserve members. Its Chief Paul Sam earned $202,413 tax free salary while many band members endured winters without water or electricity.&lt;ref name="FNFTA"/&gt; First Nations Financial Transparency Act has promoted higher vigilance regarding band leadership's activities and financial management by members and fellow councilors.

On December 18, 2015, [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs]] [[Carolyn Bennett]] announced that the Liberal government will stop enforcing the Act, and will "suspend any court actions against First Nations who have not complied with the Act", releasing funds withheld from First Nations communities that have not complied with the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1024739|title=Statement by the Honourable Carolyn Bennett on the First Nations Financial Transparency Act|date=December 18, 2015|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integrity Regime ===
Government of Canada's Integrity Regime prohibits the federal government from doing business with any company if "they, or members of their board of directors have been convicted or absolutely/conditionally discharged in the last three years" of various corruption and malpractice related offenses including income and excise tax evasion, secret commissions and bribing a foreign public official.&lt;ref name="integrity_regime"/&gt;

The politicians created authoritarian-oligarchic governance regime in Ukraine where the corruption is ubiquitous and no chances to implement a European choice of the Ukrainian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bazaluk|first=Oleg|authorlink= |date=2016 |title= Corruption in Ukraine: Rulers’ Mentality and the Destiny of the Nation|pages=XIV|chapter= Introduction|chapterurl=https://books.google.kz/books?id=weH6DAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Corruption+in+Ukraine:+Rulers%E2%80%99+Mentality+and+the+Destiny+of+the+Nation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivtv7Vur_aAhUBJSwKHReID0UQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=education&amp;f=false |isbn=9781443896894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption Perceptions Index ratings===
[[Transparency International]] produces an annual report listing each country's [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] score.  This "score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and, through 2011, ranged between 10 (highly clean) and 0 (highly corrupt)."&lt;ref name=CPI2006Table/&gt; In the 2010 report, the least corrupt country listed was Denmark with a score of 9.3, and the most corrupt of the 178 countries listed was Somalia with a score of 1.1.&lt;ref name=TPIAnnRep2010/&gt;  From 2012 on, the scores were presented on a 0-100 scale.&lt;ref name="2012-CPI-Table-Full-Data"/&gt; In the 2016 report, Denmark was still the least corrupt country listed with a score of 90, and Somalia was still the most corrupt of the 176 countries listed, with a score of 10.  By comparison, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom tied as 10th least corrupt countries with a score of 81, and the United States was 18th least corrupt with a score of 74.&lt;ref name=2016CPI/&gt;

The following table lists Ukraine's place in the Corruption Perceptions Index table, based on Transparency International's annual reports from 1999 onward. The methods used in assessing the Index change from year to year, so comparisons between years are difficult.

Nominally, the true score has a 1 in 20 probability of being above the upper range, and a 1 in 20 probability of being below the lower range.

In 2014's [[Transparency International]] [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] Ukraine was ranked 142nd out of the 175 countries investigated (tied with [[Uganda]] and [[the Comoros]]).&lt;ref name="en.interfax.com.ua"/&gt;
Note: For 1999 and 2000, the data were listed as 1998 and 1999 respectively.  From 2001, the data listed are stated to be for the year of the annual report.  Up to 2005, the annual report included some measures of the uncertainty of the index scores; these data were omitted from the annual reports from 2006 onwards, but were contained in the CPI report.

===Public Perception of Corruption in Institutions of Ukraine===
The following table shows average scores from a survey of Ukrainian public perception of corruption in Ukraine's institutions. Comparable figures for the United Kingdom and the United States from surveys for 2009 (for British and American people's perception of corruption in their own countries) are shown at the bottom of the table.

[[File:Crofting Township.jpg|thumb|left|''{{lang|gd|Peighinn Choinnich}}'', crofting town near {{lang|gd|Ùig}} in the [[Isle of Skye]] ]]
The '''Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886''' ({{lang-gd|Achd na Croitearachd 1886}}) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that created legal definitions of ''crofting parish'' and ''crofter'', granted security of [[land tenure]] to crofters and produced the first [[Crofters Commission]], a land court which ruled on disputes between [[landlord]]s and [[croft (land)|crofters]]. The same court ruled on whether [[parish]]es were or were not crofting parishes. In many respects the Act was modelled on the [[Irish Land Acts]] of [[Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870|1870]] and [[Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881|1881]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Land, Faith and the Crofting Community: Christianity and Social Criticism in the Highlands of Scotland 1843–1893 |last=MacColl |first=Allan W. |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780748626748 |pages=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By granting the crofters security of tenure, the Act put an end to the [[Highland Clearances]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson: ''The Companion to Gaelic Scotland.'' 1983, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was largely a result of crofters' agitation which had become well organised and very persistent in [[Skye]] and of growing support, throughout the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], for the [[Crofters Party]], which had gained five [[member of parliament|members of parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|general election]] of 1885. Agitation took the form of [[rent strike]]s (withholding rent payments) and occupying land which the landlords had reserved for hunting or sheep.

The Act itself did not quell the agitation. In particular it was very weak in terms of enabling the Crofters Commission to resolve disputes about access to land. It was enough however to make much more acceptable, politically, the use of troops in confrontations with agitators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/644246228|title=Labour and Scottish nationalism|last=1950-|first=Keating, Michael,|date=1979|publisher=Macmillan|others=Bleiman, David,|isbn=1349046787|location=London|oclc=644246228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was not fully effective in increasing the equality of land distribution in Scotland. By the year 2000, two-thirds of Scotland's land area was still owned by only 1&amp;nbsp;252 landowners out of a population of 5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Wightman: ''Scotland: Land and Power.'' 2000, p. 23–29 (figures are for 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

During the [[Highland Clearances]], the crofters had no official rights to the land; until 1886, it was legal to evict any crofter at the landlord's convenience. The Land Wars commenced in Scotland in 1874 with the successful legal case of the [[Bernera Riot]] on the island of Great Bernera in the Outer Hebrides.  The crofters wanted recognition of their traditional rights to the land that they had enjoyed under the [[Scottish clans|clan system]] from the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunter: ''The making of the crofting community''. 1976, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Through political and economic development the gentry began to take an alternate perspective on their tenantry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cultural force of ''{{lang|gd|dùthchas}}'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[heritage]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was pervasive in Gaeldom and was central to the social cohesion of the clan because it articulated the expectations of the masses that the ruling family had the responsibility to act as their protectors and guarantee secure possession of land in return for allegiance, military service, tribute and rental. It was a powerful and enduring belief which lived on long after the military rationale of clanship itself had disappeared and tribal chiefs had shed their ancient responsibilities and become commercial landlords.&lt;ref&gt;Devine: ''Clanship to Crofters' War.'' 1993, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Land agitation in Scotland began because of the "Home Rule" movement in Ireland and information and opinions of this movement brought by fishermen to the [[Outer Hebrides]]. Believed that they were the rightful owners of the land, crofters used [[rent strike]]s and what came to be known as land raids: crofter occupations of land to which crofters believed they should have access for common grazing or for new crofts, but which landlords had given over to sheep farming and hunting parks (called deer forests).{{fact|date=February 2016}} The strife grew more intense; the landlords hired warships for protection from the crofters. From time to time there were open uprisings and riots. 

In 1884 [[Representation of the People Act 1884|suffrage was extended]] to men owning land worth at least [[pound sterling|£]]10 or paying £10 in rent annually. This included many Highland crofters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crowley |first1=D.W. |title=The Crofters’ Party, 1885 to 1892 — The first British independent common people’s political party |url=http://www.caledonia.org.uk/land/documents/Crofters%27%20Party.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=24 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a political level the crofters wanted legal rights, so the ''{{lang|gd|Comunn Gàidhealach Ath-Leasachadh an Fhearainn}}'' ('Highland Land Law Reform Association') was established in 1885 in [[London]]. The [[Crofters' Party]] was established and elected five MPs in 1885. ''{{lang|gd|Is Treasa Tuath na Tighearna}}'' ('The people are stronger than the lord') was their best-known slogan.

The government feared that the "Home Rule" movement would spread to the {{lang|gd|[[Gàidhealtachd]]}} (Gaelic-speaking areas in Scotland) from Ireland. The [[Napier Commission]] interviewed crofters all over the {{lang|gd|Gàidhealtachd}} and made careful study of the crofters' position, publishing its report in 1884. [[William Gladstone]] tried to pass a new law granting crofters more rights, but it was voted down in May 1885. Gladstone left his post in 1885 but the other parties created a new government. Gladstone returned to power in January 1886, and the act was finally passed 25 June 1886.

==The Act==
For the first time in [[Scottish history]], the Crofting Act of 1886 affirmed the rights of crofters to their land. It also granted a legal status to crofting towns.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter: ''The making of the crofting community.'' 1976, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;
The Act dealt with the following points especially:
* It gave [[security of tenure]] to the crofters, as long as they worked the croft and paid the rent.
* Crofters had the right to pass down their croft to their descendants. 
* Crofters had the right to be paid for land improvements, such as erecting fences and drainage
* A standard of reasonable rent was established and required.
* The first [[Crofters' Commission]] was established.
* Crofters had the opportunity to reassess the rent with the Crofters' Commission.

The Act specified eight [[shires of Scotland|counties of Scotland]] as counties where parishes might be recognised as crofting parishes: [[Argyll]], [[Caithness]], [[Cromartyshire|Cromarty]], [[Inverness-shire|Inverness]], [[Orkney]], [[Ross-shire|Ross]], [[Shetland]], and [[Sutherland]]. Within these counties a crofting parish was a parish where there were year-by-year [[tenant farmer|tenant]]s of land (tenants without leases) who were paying less than £30 a year in rent and who had possessed effective common [[grazing rights]] during the 80 years since 24 June 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/49-50/29/contents|title=Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crofters' Commission also was in charge of establishing [[fair rent]] and reevaluating rents every seven years. If crofters believed that the rent was too high they had the opportunity to go to the commission. Quite often the rents were lowered or even removed, if the crofters had already been paying too much.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter: ''The making of the crofting community.'' 1976, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission had the power to reform the Act and establish other Acts, as well as grant green land to crofters in order to enlarge small crofts.

==Results==
There were different opinions about the Act. On the one hand crofters complained that the Act did not go far enough, because they were not granted automatic right to fertile land for expansion of their small crofts. Worse, the Act did not delineate the position of [[cotter (farmer)|cotters]], who had never had land. After a while, they saw that the Commission was willing to protect their rights, especially with regard to [[rent security]]. Unfortunately, the Commission was underfunded and there was not enough land to distribute to crofters. The Act did not resolve the greatest complaint of the crofters, that the land should be returned to them. There was no resolution of the issue where landlords and crofters wanted the same piece of land.&lt;ref&gt; Thomson: ''The Companion to Gaelic Scotland.'' 1983, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the landlords said that there was "communism looming in the future" and ''[[The Scotsman]]'' wrote that the Act was a "great infringement on the rights of private property.'"&lt;ref&gt;Hunter:  ''The making of the crofting community.'' 1976, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act did not end the land agitation, because [[Arthur Balfour]] believed that the Act gave moral authority to the authorities to quell every uprising to reestablish "law and order."&lt;ref&gt;Hunter: ''The making of the crofting community.'' 1976, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, warships were sent to the Isle of Skye and [[Tiree]].

In the years after the Act, ''{{lang|gd|Comunn Gàidhealach Ath-Leasachadh an Fhearainn}}'' (now called ''{{lang|gd|Dionnasg an Fhearainn}}'', "the Land League") and the Crofters' Party the political influence that they had had, because they could not agree on the issue of land and how far to follow the "Home Rule" movement in Ireland on the issue of land ownership. 

This opinion was raised again in the [[Crofting Act 1976]] in which crofters gained the legal right to purchase their land for fifteen years' rent. However, by owning their own land, crofters lost the right to CCAGS (''Crofting Counties Agricultural Grant Scheme''). In the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] the right of purchase was given to community organizations even against the will of landowners, to advance social and economic development. The [[Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010]] granted equality between tenants and landowners, especially with regard to grants and obligations and clarified the details of residency requirements. Now, tenants or owners must live within {{convert|32|km|abbr=in}} of the croft. Crofts not in use may be granted to new tenants. 

Looking back in history, Hunter believes that the Act established an old-fashioned order, with a place for the tenantry quite different than as in Ireland where crofters could buy their land under "Home Rule" acts. The Act was neither effective in the development of crofting communities nor did it encompass the political and social beliefs of those communities.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter: ''The making of the crofting community.'' 1976, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; But according to [[Andy Wightman|Wightman]], the Act paved the road to further land development in Scotland, although it did not affect areas outside the {{lang|gd|Gàidhealtachd}}. Wightman also stated that the "land question" has yet to be resolved, as two-thirds of Scotland's land area is still owned by only 1&amp;nbsp;252 landowners out of a population of 5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Wightman: ''Scotland: Land and Power.'' 2000, p. 23–29 (figures are for 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Randall Hertz''' (born October 6, 1960) is an [[United States|American]] [[architect]], inventor and educator. He is known for his work in [[sustainable architecture]] and as an early innovator in the development of [[recycled]] building materials.

== Biography ==
David Hertz got his start in architecture at a young age. In high school Hertz often sneaked into construction sites because of his interest in building. After being caught by a property owner, he was introduced to the building's designer, famed Los Angeles architect [[John Lautner]]. Hertz then apprenticed under Lautner for four years. After receiving a degree from the [[Southern California Institute of Architecture]] in 1980, Hertz went on to work in the office of [[Frank Gehry]] before founding his own firm, Syndesis, in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://installationmag.com/looking-back-looking-ahead-sci-arc-40/&lt;/ref&gt;  That year, Hertz developed "Syndecrete," a form of concrete which incorporates post-consumer and industrial waste such as [[polypropylene]] carpet fibers and [[fly ash]], and is lighter weight than traditional concrete, and may have other waste products such as wood, crushed glass, or plastic chips added for decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Popular Science, Oct 1990, pg 54 https://books.google.com/books?id=lQEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;ots=2SQUCu1jom&amp;dq=syndecrete%20magazine&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;  Syndecrete was included in the [[MoMA]] show "Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design" in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design, Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY, 1995 (First Edition) {{ISBN|0870701312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he became [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] accredited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/organizations/david-hertz-architect-inc?view=employees&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 he founded the architectural firm S.E.A., the [http://studioea.com Studio of Environmental Architecture], based in [[Venice Beach, California]], which has an emphasis in environmentally sustainable buildings, making use of high efficiency light and water systems, as well as solar panels and solar water heating.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smgbc.org/participants.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Hertz was elected to the prestigious College of Fellows of The [[American Institute of Architects]] as the youngest member in its 152-year history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dht.dwell.com/homes/mckinely-residence Dwell Home Tours&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  His architectural and material work has been exhibited internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ga-ada.co.jp/japanese/ga_gallery/2006/0603-05_GAH2006/gallery_gah2006.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://europeanarch.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-city-and-world-exhibition.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Hertz currently is involved with the construction of environmentally beneficial residences and commercial buildings, primarily in and around [[Venice, California]] with his company Studio of Environmental Architecture, as well as promoting sustainability, including a presentation at TEDx in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/9745&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, residences he designed and built were featured in Los Angeles [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) Monograph Tour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aialosangeles.org/calendar/hertz-monograph-tour#.VS7o4ytdWAc&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, he was featured in [[KCRW]]'s  Art Talk in the episode titled "Daring and Inspirational Architecture Around the World."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/art-talk/daring-inspirational-architecture-around-the-world&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, he spoke at the Greenbuild Expo in Los Angeles on historical and cutting edge techniques of extracting drinking water from the air.&lt;ref&gt;https://greenbuildexpo.com/Attendee/Conference/SpeakerDetails?id=571338&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, ORO Editions has published a monograph titled "The Restorative Home: Ecological Houses by David Hertz" which focuses on residential homes built throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webb|first1=Michael|title=The Restorative Home: Ecological Houses by David Hertz|date=2015|publisher=ORO Editions|isbn=9781941806692|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hertz is also working to promote widespread adoption of [[atmospheric water generator]] technology with Skywater, using his machine in [[Venice, California]] to provide drinking water and water for local community gardens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/04/david-hertzs-skywater&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his wife Laura Doss-Hertz have also partnered with the [[GO Campaign]] to fund sustainable water projects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gocampaign.org/initiatives/go-water/&lt;/ref&gt; Hertz founded The Skysource/Skywater Alliance team which was selected from 98 teams from 27 countries for the Grand Prize of the Water Abundance XPRIZE  having made more than 2,000 liters of water in 24 hours using 100% renewable energy at a cost of less than 2 cents/ liter. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.xprize.org/articles/waxp-grand-prize-winner &lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2017, Hertz sold his home residence for $14.6 million USD&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-californication-house-venice-record-20170424-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable projects ==
Completed in 2003, Hertz's home residence took was built in two phases, and consists of four structures connected by enclosed bridges, in a style inspired by Balinese architecture.  The building was designed as a testbed for many of his environmentally conscious building ideas, such as rooftop solar heating panels for water, [[radiant heating]], sustainable woods used throughout, and extensive use of his custom concrete, Syndecrete, which uses recycled industrial and post-consumer waste.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dwell.com/my-house/article/sustainability-stages&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the large Syndecrete walls are designed to work as a solar sink, absorbing the sun's heat during the day and slowly release it at night.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/style/la-hm-chexcerpt30jun30-story.html#page=1&lt;/ref&gt;    The house was regularly used as a location in the series [[Californication (TV series)]].

The [[Mullin Automotive Museum]], located in [[Oxnard, California]], was completed in 2010, and holds the car collection of philanthropist [[Peter W. Mullin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/art-talk/hot-and-cool-reasons-to-go-to-oxnard-and-laguna&lt;/ref&gt;  Hertz renovated the 50,000 sq, ft building which previously held the Otis Chandler Transportation Museum, and added features such as [[solar panels]] and a rooftop garden to make the building more environmentally sustainable, while also including new and vintage [[Art Deco]] elements in the decorations throughout, to keep in tune with the collection of 1920's and '30s automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-weston/new-mullin-automotive-mus_b_568188.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hertz completed his most ambitious and widely recognized project to date. The [[747 Wing House]] was built from a mothballed [[Boeing 747-100]] in the [[Santa Monica]] mountains. The project was extremely complex and called for using a [[CH-47 Chinook]] cargo helicopter to transport sections of the plane to the building site.&lt;ref&gt;Amelar, Sarah. ''Come Fly With Me''. Architectural Record, 2012, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://studioea.com/profile/ David Hertz FAIA, Studio of Environmental Architecture, Green Buildings, Sustainable Design, Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California | Profile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  By making use of large sections of prefabricated material, he was able to reduce the greenhouse emissions that would have been required to bring raw materials and remove waste material.

Another example of Hertz's creative use of unusual building materials is the "Panel House," in [[Venice Beach, California]], so named because of its use of industrial refrigerator panels to provide insulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://inhabitat.com/touring-the-panel-house/&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed for the owner of a company that manufactures automobile washing equipment, the house was constructed like a miniature sky-scraper, utilizing a heavy metal frame in poured-concrete base, making weight-bearing walls unnecessary and allowing for large, automated windows which provide ocean views from almost anywhere in the house.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/garden/13clean.html?_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the house earned the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design's American Architecture Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.optimaweb.com/pdfs/2009_AMERICAN_ARCH_AWARDS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323175233/http://www.optimaweb.com/pdfs/2009_AMERICAN_ARCH_AWARDS.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Hertz along with a team called the Skysource/Skywater Alliance &lt;ref&gt;https://water.xprize.org/prizes/water-abundance/teams/the_skysource_skywater_alliance&lt;/ref&gt; won the XPRIZE Water Abundance competition &lt;ref&gt;https://water.xprize.org/prizes/water-abundance/articles/the-path-to-a-water-abundance-xprize-winner&lt;/ref&gt; by achieving the foundation's goal of producing at least 2,000 liters of water in a single day for no more than two cents per liter.

The '''Government Performance Coalition''' was created in 1999 by a group of organizations and researchers with the goal of presenting the [[President of the United States]], government managers, [[United States Congress|Congress]], the media, and the public views on the improvement of government management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seagov.org/initiatives/other.shtml|title=Performance Reporting for Government—Reporting initiatives|website=www.seagov.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition maintains that it seeks to ensure a continued focus and attention to performance and management issues and to identify existing issues that need new attention, and refine past efforts and highlight related governance policies that affect performance.&lt;ref&gt;Mission statement from Government Performance Coalition Website: http://www.govresults.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition, comprising nearly two dozen organizations, meets regularly in Washington, D.C. to serve as a clearinghouse for its individual members’ respective agendas regarding government management improvement.  During presidential election years, the Coalition sponsors events to highlight the importance of good government management issues in the campaign and to prepare materials that would be helpful to the winning candidate’s incoming political appointees.

==Resource development==
The Coalition was initially formed to develop resource materials to support the eventual winner of the 2000 presidential campaign.  In that effort, it sponsored a series of forums on key management issues, such as [[human capital]], [[Finance|financial management]], and [[performance management]].  These forums and associated recommendations were compiled into a report given to the incoming administration for President George W. Bush.  In a memorandum dated December 20, 2000, the coalition identified critical issues that require new policy directions such as the high-risk areas in the General Accounting Office (e.g. [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] financial management, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Housing and Urban Development Corporation|HUD]], student aid, superfund, [[NASA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memos to the President: Management Advice from the Nation's Top Public Administrators|last=Abramson|first=Mark|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2001|isbn=0742522393|location=Lanham|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the recommendations were subsequently used to frame his [[President's Management Agenda]]. 

In 2008, the Coalition members, both individually and collectively, sponsored a series of forums in 2008 with recommendations to the incoming Obama Administration to place an appropriate emphasis on performance. It recommended three broad initiatives: 1) implement a performance-based framework at agencies; 2) invest more in federal human resources; and, 3) mandate the use of innovation and technology to revolutionize government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2008/12/obama-urged-to-focus-on-performance-based-government/28197/|title=Obama urged to focus on performance-based government|work=Government Executive|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barack Obama’s fiscal year 2010 budget has a section titled “Building a High-Performance Government,” with its first item being “Putting Performance First.”&lt;ref&gt;Office of Management and Budget, "The President's Fiscal Year 2010 Budget," ''Analytical Perspectives,'' "Building a High-Performance Government," Washington, DC (2009). http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/building.pdf. Retrieved 06-30-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The Coalition members jointly sponsored the publication of a book as part of the 2004 presidential transition. That book, “Getting Results: A Guide for Federal Leaders and Managers”&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=fPDHRFxxJEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=DRGPHYKWqX&amp;dq=Getting%20Results%3A%20A%20Guide%20for%20Federal%20Leaders%20and%20Managers&amp;pg=PP1 White, Barry, and Kathryn Newcomer, eds., "Getting Results: A Guide for Federal Leaders and Managers," Management Concepts and the George Washington University Center for Public Service Innovation (Washington, DC) 2005&lt;/ref&gt; was an orientation guide provided to incoming political appointees to help them be successful managers in the federal government. The coalition, through the Performance Institute, also trains thousands of government managers every year on performance-based topics as well as methodologies and best practices for transparency and citizen services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.performanceinstitute.org/about-us/about/|title=About - The Performance Institute|work=The Performance Institute|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A February 2009 article in [[Government Executive magazine]] described the Coalition as “An unfunded organization with no professional staff, the coalition is run through the volunteer efforts of good government group leaders. Early in the Bush administration, the coalition received some funding for a joint book project on performance management advice, but it now operates primarily as a clearinghouse for its member organizations' efforts.”  The article continues:  “The loose structure isn't just a vehicle for agreement at the coalition. It's a requirement. Because of the variety of governance structures among the member groups, it's impossible for them all to commit to a concerted lobbying campaign or even formally endorse a program.”&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Alyssa. “Gathering Good,” ''Government Executive'', February 2009: http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?filepath=/features/0209-01/0209-01s3.htm&amp;oref=search&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members of the Government Performance Coalition==

The members of Government Performance Coalition include: [[American Society for Public Administration]], [[Association of Government Accountants]], Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group, The Public Sector Consortium, [[CNA Corporation]], Coalition for Effective Change, Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration at George Washington University, [[Grant Thornton]], [[IBM Center for The Business of Government]], [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]], American University Institute for the Study of Policy Implementation, Management Concepts, [[Mercatus Center]] at George Mason University, [[National Academy of Public Administration (United States)]], [[Partnership for Public Service]], [[The Performance Institute]], and Senior Executives Association.{{Cn|date = August 2015}}

The '''Great Canadian Flag Debate''' (or '''Great Flag Debate''') was a national debate that took place in 1963 and 1964 when a new design for the [[flag of Canada|national flag of Canada]] was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadashistory.ca/Magazine/Online-Extension/Articles/The-Great-Flag-Debate|title=The Great Flag Debate|last=Levine|first=Allan|date=|website=Canada's History|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the flag debate had been going on for a long time prior, it officially began on June 15, 1964, when [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Lester B. Pearson]] proposed his plans for a new flag in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The debate lasted more than six months, bitterly dividing&lt;ref name="Fraser FOC"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Flags of Canada | author=Fraser, A.B. | year=1998 | at=Chapter V}}&lt;/ref&gt; the people in the process. The debate over the proposed new Canadian flag was ended by [[cloture|closure]] on December 15, 1964. It resulted in the adoption of the "[[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf]]" as the Canadian national flag. 

The flag was inaugurated on February 15, 1965, and since 1996, February 15 has been commemorated as [[National Flag of Canada Day]].

[[File:John A Macdonald election poster 1891.jpg|200px|thumb|An 1891 election poster featuring Macdonald and the undefaced Red Ensign]]

=== Union Jack and Red Ensign ===
For much of its [[Canadian Confederation|post-Confederation]] history, Canada used both the [[Union Flag|Royal Union Flag]] (Union Jack) as its national flag, and the [[Canadian Red Ensign]] as a popularly recognized and distinctive Canadian flag.

The first Canadian Red Ensigns were used in Prime Minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]'s time. The Governor General at the time of Macdonald's death, [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], wrote to London in 1891:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Dominion Government has encouraged by precept and example the use on all public buildings throughout the provinces of the Red Ensign with the Canadian badge on the fly... [which] has come to be considered as the recognized flag of the Dominion, both ashore and afloat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under pressure from pro-imperial public opinion, Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] raised the Union Flag over Parliament, where it remained until the re-emergence of the Red Ensign in the 1920s. In 1945, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], having flown the Union Jack over Parliament throughout the war, made the Canadian Red Ensign the official Canadian flag by [[Order in Council]].  Mackenzie King also tried to give Canada a new flag. The recommendation that came back was a Red Ensign, but substituting the coat of arms of Canada with a gold maple leaf. Mackenzie King stopped the venture.

'A flag to suit the minority.''' satirising the minority rights of Francophone Canadians by showing the [[French tricolor]] given greater prominence than the [[Union Jack]] and the maple leaf surrounded by two [[fleurs-de-lis]].]]

In 1958, an extensive poll was taken of the attitudes that adult Canadians held toward the flag. Of those who expressed opinions, over 80% wanted a national flag entirely different from that of any other nation, and 60% wanted their flag to bear the [[maple leaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;odesi&gt; Dataset: Canadian Gallup Poll, August 1958, #270|url=http://odesi1.scholarsportal.info/webview/index.jsp?v=2&amp;submode=variable&amp;study=http%3A%2F%2F142.150.190.11%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2Fcipo-270-E-1958-08&amp;gs=10F1&amp;variable=http%3A%2F%2F142.150.190.11%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2Fcipo-270-E-1958-08_V51&amp;mode=documentation&amp;top=yes|website=odesi1.scholarsportal.info|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lester B. Pearson ===

From his office as [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|leader of the opposition]], Lester Pearson issued a press release on January 27, 1960, in which he summarized the problem and presented his suggestion as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Canadian Government taking full responsibility as soon as possible for finding a solution to the flag problem, by submitting to Parliament a measure which, if accepted by the representatives of the people in Parliament, would, I hope, settle the problem.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government of the time, headed by Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]], did not accept the invitation to establish a new Canadian flag, so Pearson made it [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] policy in 1961, and part of the party's election platform in the [[Canadian federal election, 1962|1962]] and [[Canadian federal election, 1963|1963 federal elections]]. During the election campaign of 1963, Pearson promised that Canada would have a new flag within two years of his election. No previous party leader had ever gone as far as Pearson did, by putting a time limit on finding a new national flag for Canada. The 1963 election brought the Liberals back to power, but with a minority government. In February 1964, a three-leaf design was leaked to the press.

[[File:Canada Pearson Pennant 1964.svg|200px|thumb|right|Lester Pearson's preferred choice for a new flag was nicknamed "the Pearson Pennant".]]

At the 20th [[Royal Canadian Legion]] Convention in [[Winnipeg]] on May 17, 1964, Pearson faced an unsympathetic audience of Canadian Legionnaires and told them that the time had come to replace the Canadian Red Ensign with a distinctive maple leaf flag.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/02/14/canadas-maple-leaf-flag-born-amid-bitter-debate.html|title=Leader Lester Pearson wanted a flag to represent the new, multicultural Canada. John Diefenbaker was vehemently opposed. The battle was ferocious.|last=Hunter|first=Paul|date=2015-02-14|newspaper=The Toronto Star|issn=0319-0781|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Canadian Legion and the Canadian Corps Association wanted to make sure that the new flag would include the Union Flag as a sign of Canadian ties to the United Kingdom and to other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], that use the Union Flag in the quarter of their national flag.

Lester Pearson's preferred choice for a new flag was nicknamed "the Pearson Pennant". Pearson’s first design featured the three maple leaves on a blue background. Pearson preferred this choice, as the blue bars reflected Canada's motto, "From Sea to Sea".

==Parliamentary debate begins==

=== Opening resolution ===
On June 15, 1964, Pearson opened the parliamentary flag debate with a resolution:

{{cquote|… to establish officially as the flag of Canada a flag embodying the emblem proclaimed by His Majesty King [[George V]] on November 21, 1921 — three maple leaves conjoined on one stem — in the colours red and white then designated for Canada, the red leaves occupying a field of white between vertical sections of blue on the edges of the flag.}}

Pearson sought to produce a flag which embodied history and tradition, but he also wanted to excise the Union Jack as a reminder of Canada's heritage and links to the [[United Kingdom]]. Hence, the issue was not whether the maple leaf was pre-eminently Canadian, but rather whether the nation should exclude the British-related component from its identity.

=== Diefenbaker opposition ===
Diefenbaker led the opposition to the Maple Leaf flag, arguing for the retention of the Canadian Red Ensign. Diefenbaker and his lieutenants mounted a [[filibuster]]. The seemingly endless debate raged on in Parliament and the press with no side giving quarter. Pearson forced members of Parliament to stay over the summer, but that did not help. 

On September 10, 1964, the Prime Minister yielded to the suggestion that the matter be referred to a special flag committee. The key member of the 15-person panel, Liberal Member of Parliament [[John Matheson]] said that they "were asked to produce a flag for Canada and in six weeks!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Conservatives at first saw this event as a victory, for they knew that all previous flag committees had suffered miscarriages.  During the next six weeks the committee held 35 lengthy meetings.  Thousands of suggestions also poured in from a public engaged in what had become a great Canadian debate about identity and how best to represent it.

3,541 entries were submitted: many contained common elements:

* 2,136 contained [[maple]] leaves
* 408 contained Union Jacks
* 389 contained [[beaver]]s 
* 359 contained [[Fleurs-de-lys]]

At the last minute, Matheson slipped a flag designed by historian [[George Stanley]] into the mix. The idea came to him while standing in front of the Mackenzie Building of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], while viewing the college flag flying in the wind. Stanley submitted a March 23, 1964 [[George Stanley#Designer of the Canadian Flag|formal detailed memorandum]]&lt;ref name="memorandum"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://people.stfx.ca/lstanley/stanley/flagmemo2.htm |title=Full text of George Stanley's Flag Memorandum |access-date=March 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309045945/http://people.stfx.ca/lstanley/stanley/flagmemo2.htm |archive-date=March 9, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to John Matheson on the history of Canada's emblems, predating Pearson's raising the issue, in which he warned that any new flag "must avoid the use of national or racial symbols that are of a divisive nature" and that it would be "clearly inadvisable" to create a flag that carried either a Union Jack or a Fleur-de-lis. The design put forward had a single red maple leaf on a white plain background, flanked by two red borders, based on the design of the flag of the Royal Military College.  The voting was held on October 22, 1964, when the committee’s final contest pitted Pearson’s pennant against Stanley’s. Assuming that the Liberals would vote for the Prime Minister’s design, the Conservatives backed Stanley. They were outmaneuvered by the Liberals who had agreed with others to choose the Stanley Maple Leaf flag. The Liberals voted for the red and white flag, making the selection unanimous (15–0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/02/13/how-the-vote-on-canadas-flag-was-rigged.html |title=How the vote on Canada's flag was 'rigged' &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2015-02-13 |accessdate=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== House of Commons ==

=== Debate ===
The committee had made its decision, but not the House of Commons. Diefenbaker would not budge, so the debate continued for six weeks as the Conservatives launched a [[filibuster]]. The debate had become so ugly that the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' called it "The Great Flag Farce."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Closure and vote ===
The debate was prolonged until one of Diefenbaker's own senior members, [[Léon Balcer]], and the Créditiste, [[Réal Caouette]], advised the government to cut off debate by applying [[cloture|closure]]. Pearson did so, and after some 250 speeches, the final vote adopting the Stanley flag took place at 2:15 on the morning of December 15, 1964, with Balcer and the other francophone Conservatives swinging behind the Liberals. The committee's recommendation was accepted 163 to 78. At 2:00 AM, immediately after the successful vote, Matheson wrote to Stanley:  "Your proposed flag has just now been approved by the Commons 163 to 78. Congratulations. I believe it is an excellent flag that will serve Canada well."&lt;ref name="postcard"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://people.stfx.ca/lstanley/stanley/postcard.htm |title=John Matheson's postcard to George Stanley, 15 December 1964, 2:00 AM, announcing the House of Commons' approval of Stanley's design for the new Canadian Flag |access-date=March 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232416/http://people.stfx.ca/lstanley/stanley/postcard.htm |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of December 15, the Commons also voted in favor of continued use of the Union Flag as a symbol of Canada's allegiance to the Crown and its membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Senate approval followed on December 17, 1964.  The "Royal Union Flag", as it would be officially termed, would be put alongside the new flag on days of Commonwealth significance.

== Aftermath ==
Queen [[Elizabeth II]] approved the Maple Leaf flag by signing a royal proclamation on January 28, 1965, when both Prime Minister Pearson and Leader of the Opposition Diefenbaker were in London attending the funeral of Sir [[Winston Churchill]].

The flag was inaugurated on February 15, 1965, at an official ceremony held on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]] in the presence of [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] Major-General [[Georges Vanier]], the prime minister, the members of the Cabinet, and Canadian parliamentarians. Also throughout Canada, at the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]], and at Canadian legations and on Canadian ships throughout the world, the Canadian Red Ensign was lowered and the Maple Leaf flag was raised. As journalist [[George Bain (journalist)|George Bain]] wrote of the occasion, the flag "looked bold and clean, and distinctively our own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/the-flag-distinctively-our-own-feature/ |title=The Flag: Distinctively Our Own |last=Hillmer |first=Norman |author-link=Norman Hillmer |date=14 February 2012 |website=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment to the old Canadian Red Ensign has persisted among many people, especially veterans.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-symbolism-of-an-individual-flying-the-Red-Ensign-instead-of-the-modern-Canadian-flag&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the Canadian Government first used the Canadian Coat of Arms (whose shield was used on the Red Ensign) on a red flag for [[Canadian Centennial|the nation's centennial celebrations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ca_coa.html |title=Canadian Coat-of-Arms flag |last=Borsa |first=Bill |date=20 February 2004 |website=[[Flags of the World]] |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to appeal to those who were used to the Red Ensign and had not yet become accustomed to the Maple Leaf Flag.

The Canadian Red Ensign itself can sometimes be seen today in Canada, often in connection to veterans' associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legion.ca/who-we-are/ritual-and-awards/colour-party/ |title=Royal Canadian Legion - Colour Party|date=25 February 2016 |website=[[Royal Canadian Legion]] |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]] adopted their own versions of the Red Ensign as their respective provincial flags in the wake of the national flag debate. 

On the other hand, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] used the Union Flag as [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|its provincial flag]] from 1952 until 1980; the blue triangles on the new flag adopted in 1980 are meant as a tribute to the Union Flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.nl.ca/aboutnl/flag.html |title=Provincial Flag |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=[[Government of Newfoundland and Labrador]] |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Columbia]]'s [[Flag of British Columbia|flag]], which features the Union Flag in its top portion, was introduced in 1960 and is actually based on the shield of the [[Coat of arms of British Columbia|provincial coat of arms]], which dates back to 1906.&lt;ref name="BCsymbols"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/bcfacts/ |title=B.C. Quick Facts |author= |publisher=[[British Columbia|Province of British Columbia]] |accessdate=17 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216065524/http://www.gov.bc.ca/bcfacts/ |archivedate=16 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, both Newfoundland's use of the Union Flag and the adoption of BC's flag are unrelated to (and, in fact, pre-date) the great flag debate.

=== National Flag Day ===
Since 1996, February 15 has been commemorated as [[National Flag of Canada Day]] in Canada.

{{Campaignbox Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars}}

The '''Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars''' (1790–1816) were a series of [[civil war|wars]] between the [[New South Wales Corps]] and the Indigenous clans of the [[Hawkesbury River|Hawkesbury river]] and [[Nepean River|Nepean river]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. Mostly taking place in what is now the [[Greater Western Sydney]] area and, at times, parts of the [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|eastern suburbs]], the conflict consisted of ''[[Pemulwuy's War]]'' (1790–1802) and the ''Nepean War'' (1814–16) as well as the interwar violence of the ''1804–05 conflict''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper="The Sun Herald" | date = 16 February 2008 | url = http://blogs.sunherald.com.au/whoweare/archives/2008/03/who_we_are_the_11.html | title = WHO WE ARE: The man who nearly changed everything | first = David | last = Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Henniker Heaton, ''Australian Dictionary of Dates and Men of the Time'', Sydney, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al Grassby and Marji Hill, ''Six Australian Battlefields'', North Ryde: Angus &amp;Robertson, 1988:99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Australian frontier wars|frontier war]] began in 1795 when the British established farms along the Hawkesbury River west of Sydney. Some of these settlements were established by soldiers as a means of providing security to the region.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre, Stuart (1999). A Concise History of Australia. Cambridge Concise Histories (First ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-62577-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The local [[Darug people]] raided farms until Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie|Macquarie]] dispatched troops from the [[British Army]] [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Regiment]] in 1816. These troops patrolled the Hawkesbury Valley and ended the conflict by killing 14 Indigenous Australians in a raid on their campsite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Connor | first= John | authorlink = | title= The Australian frontier wars, 1788–1838 | publisher= UNSW Press | location= Sydney | year= 2002 | isbn= 0-86840-756-9 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JWE5r39Ed1oC | ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous Australians led by [[Pemulwuy]] also conducted raids around [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]] during the period between 1795 and 1802. These attacks led Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] to issue an order in 1801 which authorised settlers to shoot Indigenous Australians on sight in Parramatta, [[Georges River]] and [[Prospect, New South Wales|Prospect]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10389b.htm|title=Pemulwuy (c. 1750 – 1802)|last=Kohen|first=J. L.|year=2005|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|Aboriginal nations]] occasionally allied themselves to the British in order to conquer more land for their tribes, and just as quickly returned to a state of war against the British. It was fought using mostly [[guerrilla]]-warfare tactics; however, several conventional battles also took place. The wars resulted in the defeat of the Hawkesbury river and Nepean river Indigenous clans who were subsequently dispossessed of their lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the expansion of [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|European settlement]], large amounts of land was cleared for farming, which resulted in the destruction of Aboriginal food sources. This, combined with the introduction of new diseases such as [[smallpox]], caused resentment within the Aboriginal clans against the British and resulted in violent confrontations, coordinated by men such as Pemulwuy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/pemulwuy |title= Pemulwuy |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|History of Sydney}}
===Aboriginal people of the Sydney region===
The Sydney region comprised a variety of nations that were united by a common language. These nations were the Eora who lived along the coast, the [[Tharawal]] to the south, the [[Dharug]] to the northwest and the Gandagara to the southwest. Within the language groups there were several clans. The [[Eora people]] generally comprised three main clans known as the [[Cadigal]], Wanegal, and the [[Cammeraygal]], and several smaller ones. The Dharug people, however, were the largest dialect of the Sydney region and consisted of the [[Wangal]], [[Kurrajong, New South Wales|Kurrajong]], Boorooberongal, [[Cattai]], [[Bidjigal]], Gommerigal, [[Mulgoa]], Cannemegal, Bool-bain-ora, Cabrigal, [[Muringong]] and the [[Dural]] clans. A clan typically numbered between 50–100 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aabr.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=74 |title=Aboriginal People of the Sydney Region |publisher=Australian Association of Bush Regenerators |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The colony===
Following Britain's loss of its American colonies during the [[American Revolutionary War]], economic situations in Britain forced it to establish new colonies. After Captain [[James Cook]] claimed the east coast of Australia for Britain in 1770 it was decided that a penal colony would be set up there to help relieve Britain's jails as well as to prevent French influence from growing in the Pacific.

The arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788 at [[Port Jackson]] marked the beginning of the colonization of Australia. At the time it was used as a penal colony to which criminals and political dissidents were sent as punishment, however, a small number of free settlers also took up land. The penal colony had been established at Port Jackson (present-day Sydney) which was the traditional land of the Cadigal people. The penal colony had a population of around one thousand and for the first few years struggled to adapt to the [[climate of Australia|Australian climate]].

==Conflicts==
===1789, Skirmish at Botany Bay===
[[File:Natives of Botany Bay.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Aboriginal men hunting at Botany Bay (1789).]]
In March 1789, sixteen convicts marched to [[Botany Bay]] with the intention of plundering the natives of their fishing-tackle and spears. They had armed themselves with whatever tools they could find such as hatchets, shovels, and clubs. As they arrived near the bay a body of natives ambushed them, and in the [[skirmish]] most of the convicts fled. 

Those who fled back to the camp alerted the military to the attack. An officer with a detachment of marines quickly rushed to their aid, however they were too late to repel the natives which left one convict dead and seven severely wounded. [[Arthur Phillip]] sought no vengeance against the natives for this event as the convicts had hostile intentions, and instead dealt punishments on the convicts involved.&lt;ref&gt;''The Settlement at Port Jackson'', by Watkin Tench, Chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;

===1790, Attack on Governor Phillip===
[[File:Arthur_Phillip_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_12992.jpg|thumb|200px|Despite being attacked, Governor Arthur Phillip ordered that Aboriginals must be [[Indigenous rights|well-treated]], and that anyone killing Aboriginal people would be [[capital punishment in Australia|hanged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Governors of New South Wales|last=Tink|first=Andrew|publisher=The Federation Press|year=2009|isbn=9781862877436|pages=42–43|editor=Cavalier, Rodney}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On 7 September 1790, upon hearing news of a gathering of natives at South-head near [[Broken Bay]], [[Governor Arthur Phillip]] and three others made their way towards the reported happenings. When the boat arrived at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly Cove]], the natives were found busily consuming on a whale. Governor Phillip stepped out unarmed and accompanied by one seaman, Lieutenant Waterhouse. 

Phillip called out for [[Bennelong]], a native whom he befriended, and discoursed for some time at the pleasure of seeing his old [[acquaintance]]. Gifts were traded between them and continued for more than half an hour until a native armed with a spear came forward and stopped at a distance of twenty to thirty yards from the party. Phillip extended his hand and called to him, advancing at the same time. However, as the governor came nearer to the native it only seemed to terrify him further and subsequently fixed his lance in his throwing-stick and aimed it at him.

Phillip thought to [[Retreat (military)|retreat]] would be more dangerous than to advance and so he called out "Weeree Weeree" (bad; you are doing wrong). [[Watkin Tench]] reports in his journal that Phillip took out his dirk (dagger) and threw it on the ground to show he meant no harm but the aboriginal man was frightened by the noise of this action. His words fell on deaf ears and the native fired his lance, striking the governor on his right shoulder, as the native immediately retreated into the woods. Instant confusion on both sides took place as spears were thrown in all directions, and Phillips party retreated to the boat. On board the vessel, a seaman fired his [[musket]] into the natives but it is not known if any were killed. 

Apprehension for the safety of the party took place and Lieutenant Long and a detachment of marines were immediately sent to escort them back in case a native [[ambush]] were to finish the party off. Upon arriving at Manly Cove, they were greeted by three natives who said that the man who had wounded the governor belonged to a tribe from the [[Broken Bay ]]area and that they highly condemned what he had done. It was later discovered that Wileemarin was responsible for the attack. Tench reports that it was a "misapprehension" and placed no blame on Wileemarin. Governor Phillip survived his wounds and ordered that there were to be no [[revenge|retaliatory]] attacks made against the natives, arguing that it was just a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;''The Settlement at Port Jackson'', by Watkin Tench, Chapter IX&lt;/ref&gt;

===1790–1802, Pemulwuy's War===
{{See also|Pemulwuy}}
[[File:Pemulwuy aka Pimbloy.jpg|thumb|220px|Pemulwuy on a canoe.]]
Pemulwuy was an [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal Australian]] man born around 1750 in the area of [[Botany Bay]] in [[New South Wales]]. He is noted for his [[Resistance movement|resistance]] to the European settlement of Australia which began with the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47152902|title=Aboriginal Sydney : a guide to important places of the past and present|last=Studies.|first=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press|year=|isbn=0855753706|location=|pages=140|oclc=47152902|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have been a member of the [[Bidjigal]] (Bediagal) clan of the [[Eora]] people.

[[Pemulwuy]] persuaded the [[Eora]], [[Darug people|Dharug]] and [[Tharawal people]] to join his campaign against the newcomers. From 1792 Pemulwuy led raids on settlers from Parramatta, [[Georges River]], [[Prospect, New South Wales|Prospect]], Toongabbie, [[Brickfield Hill]] and [[Hawkesbury River]]. His most common tactic was to burn crops and kill [[livestock]]. Whether Pemulwuy was actively withstanding European settlement, or was only attempting to uphold Aboriginal law, which often involved revenge acts, is debated by historians. Regardless, the British believed the attacks made against them were acts of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/messagestick/stories/s2893382.htm |title=Pemulwuy: A War of Two Laws Part 1 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 1797, Pemulwuy led a group of aboriginal warriors, estimated to be at least 100, in an attack on a government farm at [[Toongabbie]]. This incident has more recently become known as the [[Battle of Parramatta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper = "The Sun Herald" | date = 16 February 2008 | url = http://blogs.sunherald.com.au/whoweare/archives/2008/03/who_we_are_the_11.html | title = WHO WE ARE: The man who nearly changed everything | first = David | last = Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Henniker Heaton, ''Australian Dictionary of Dates and Men of the Time'', Sydney, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al Grassby and Marji Hill, ''Six Australian Battlefields'', North Ryde: Angus &amp;Robertson, 1988:99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/pemulwuy |title= Pemulwuy |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1790, Murder of John McIntyre====
On 9 December 1790, a [[Royal Marines|marine]] [[sergeant]] and three convicts, including the governor's gamekeeper, McIntyre, went out on a shooting party. After they passed the northern arm of Botany Bay they decided to stay at a hut formed of boughs which had been erected by other sportsmen who hunted for game at night. At about 1:00 am the sergeant was awakened by rustling bushes and assuming it to be from a [[kangaroo]] called to his [[comrades]], who immediately drew their weapons. According to [[Watkin Tench]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;About one o’clock, the sergeant was awakened by a rustling noise in the bushes near him, and supposing it to proceed from a kangaroo, called to his comrades, who instantly jumped up. On looking about more narrowly, they saw two natives with spears in their hands, creeping towards them, and three others a little farther behind. As this naturally created alarm, McIntyre said, “don’t be afraid, I know them,” and immediately laying down his gun, stepped forward, and spoke to them in their own language. The Indians, finding they were discovered, kept slowly retreating, and McIntyre accompanied them about a hundred yards, talking familiarly all the while. One of them now jumped on a fallen tree and, without giving the least warning of his intention, launched his spear at McIntyre and lodged it in his left side. The person who committed this wanton act was described as a young man with a speck or blemish on his left eye. That he had been lately among us was evident from his being newly shaved.&lt;ref name="tench chapter eight"&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/tench/watkin/settlement/chapter8.html#chapter8 Watkin Tench, ''The Settlement at Port Jackson'', Chapter Eight] accessed 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The group was pursued by the settlers with muskets, but they escaped. McIntyre was taken back to the settlement, gravely wounded. Tench suspected that McIntyre had previously killed Aboriginal people, and noted the fear and hatred that the Aboriginal people, including [[Bennelong]] (an Aboriginal man who Governor Phillip had captured, in hopes of interaction with the Aboriginals) showed towards him.&lt;ref name="Tench"&gt;{{Citation | title = A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson | first = Watkin | last = Tench | chapter = Chapter viii | url = http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/tench/watkin/settlement/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The poor wretch now began to utter the most dreadful exclamations, and to accuse himself of the commission of crimes of the deepest dye, accompanied with such expressions of his despair of God’s mercy, as are too terrible to repeat," wrote Tench of McIntyre.&lt;ref name="tench chapter eight"/&gt; The gameskeeper died on 12 December. Before then, Colbee and several other aboriginals, came in to see the body. "Their behaviour indicated that they had already heard of the accident, as they repeated twice or thrice the name of the murderer Pimelwi, saying that he lived at Botany Bay," wrote Tench".&lt;ref name="tench chapter eight"/&gt;

====1790–1791, Governor Phillip's Military Expeditions====
An irate [[Governor Arthur Phillip]] ordered Lieutenant Tench to gather his company of marines and lead an expedition against the Bidjigal in retaliation for Pemulwuy's attack on McIntyre.  He ordered that two Bidjigal were to be captured and ten killed; these ten were then to be beheaded and the heads returned to the settlement. Tench swiftly suggested an alternative and less bloodthirsty plan, that six Bidjigal be captured and brought to [[Sydney Cove]] but that none be killed out of hand.&lt;ref name=Moore118&gt;Moore 1987, pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

Tench's proposal was accepted, and the expedition set out on 14 December in search of Pemulwuy and the Bidjigal tribe. The expedition was the largest military operation since the founding of the colony, comprising Tench, Lieutenants [[William Dawes (British Marines officer)|William Dawes]] and John Poulden, and 46 marines. However, despite three days of searching there was no sign of the Bidjigal. On 17 December Tench ordered a return to Sydney Cove to gather supplies.&lt;ref name=Moore118/&gt; A second expedition set out in the late afternoon of 22 December, comprising Tench and 39 marines. Tench unwisely decided to march at night in the hope of surprising the Bidjigal in their camp, and at sunset his company forded the [[Cook's River]] and continued south towards [[Wolli Creek]].&lt;ref name=Moore118/&gt;

The waterway was reached at 2:15am but the majority of marines seeking to cross it became stuck in mud along its banks. Tench himself was trapped waist-deep in the mud and had to be pulled to land on the end of a tree branch. A stock-take of equipment subsequently showed around half of the company's muskets had become unserviceable from exposure to the mud and water. After a few hours rest on the riverbank Tench abandoned the expedition, and the bedraggled marines again made their way back to Sydney Cove.&lt;ref name=Moore118/&gt; The expeditions having failed, it was decided to instead avenge McIntyre by strictly punishing any Aboriginal considered to have transgressed against the settlement's laws. In late December a marine detachment opened fire on two Aborigines who were seen removing potatoes from a settlement garden.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1987, pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; One, named Bangai, was wounded and later found dead.&lt;ref name="Tench"/&gt;

However, on closer inspection the origin of the noise was found to be two natives armed with [[spears]]. McEntire attempted to defuse the situation by laying down his gun and telling his comrades not to be afraid. He then began speaking with the natives in their own language, and they slowly retreated about {{convert|100|yd|m}} as McEntire followed them. Without warning, Pemulwuy jumped on a fallen tree and launched his spear at McEntire, which lodged in his left side. McEntire immediately withdrew to rejoin his party and alerted them to what had happened. Two of the armed marines set out in pursuit of the natives but they had already escaped. They then escorted the wounded man back to the colony, arriving in Sydney at 2 am the next morning. Surgeons examined McEntire's wound and proclaimed that it was mortal. Following this, McEntire apparently confessed of "crimes of the deepest dye".

Colbee and several other natives came to visit McEntire, telling him that it had been Pemulwuy who had attacked him and that he lived at Botany Bay. The surgeons wanted to remove the spear but the natives violently opposed this, saying that he would die if the shaft was taken out. However, on 12 December it was deemed necessary and so the surgeons successfully removed it. The spear penetrated McEntire about 7-and-a-half inches through his ribs and into the left lobe of his lungs. The spear itself consisted of a wooden barb with several smaller barbs made from stone fastened onto it with yellow gum. McEntire eventually died on 20 December 1790.&lt;ref&gt;''The Settlement at Port Jackson'', by Watkin Tench, Chapter XII, 1790&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Phillip was convinced the attack on McEntire had been unprovoked. There had been similar attacks against unarmed men in the past, in which some settlers had been killed or seriously wounded, and he believed that the natives had to be punished to deter them from any future attacks. The governor made orders to capture six Aborigines that were living near the Botany Bay heads, stating that if it was not possible to take them alive, then they were to be killed. At the same time, he declared it unlawful for soldiers or settlers to injure or fire on a native except in [[self-defence]], or to take any of their possessions.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/01/1067597158244.html Keith Vincent Smith, "Australia's oldest murder mystery", ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 1 November 2003] accessed 26 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  

A military party consisting of two captains, two subalterns and forty privates was formed. With three days' provisions they were ordered to march to Botany Bay to take the six natives as prisoners, and destroy all [[weapons of war]], but were given strict instructions not to destroy anything else and were not to harm any women and children. Governor Phillip reasoned that seventeen convicts had been either killed or wounded since 1788 and he firmly believed the tribe living on the north arm of Botany Bay, the Bidjigal tribe, to be the principal aggressors. The goal of the military expedition, according to the governor, was "to convince them of...[British]...superiority and to infuse an universal terror, which might operate to prevent farther mischief".

Early morning on 14 January 1791, the detachment marched towards the Bidjigal territory with Captain Hill and Captain Tench in command. The first sighting occurred at a beach head from where five natives managed to escape. Shortly after, they marched into a small native village which had already been deserted, and three canoes filled with natives were seen making their way across to the opposite side of the river. After searching the village, no weapons of war were found.

The first military expedition had been a total failure, but the governor sent out a second detachment under Tench with the same orders. This time it was decided that an attack would be made at night and following several time-consuming debacles, the detachment arrived just before sunrise. Consisting of two officers, three sergeants, three corporals, and thirty private marines, Tench split the detachment into three divisions, with each division converging on the village at the same time from different directions. When they arrived, once again they found the village had been deserted. Following this second failure, two natives were detected robbing a potato farm. A sergeant and a party of soldiers pursued them and after overtaking them, a brief skirmish occurred which left one native man, Bangai, mortally wounded and resulted in three others being captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/tench/watkin/settlement/chapter12.html |chapter=Chapter XII: Transactions of the Colony in Part of December, 1790 |title=The Settlement at Port Jackson |author=Tench, Watkin |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1804–05, Interwar conflict===
[[File:Joseph Lycett View upon the Napean.jpg|thumb|220px|Nepean river, 1825.]]
Along the Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers there was a nexus between drought, the expansion of settlement and fighting between settlers and Aboriginal people. Drought began in 1803.&lt;ref name=Gaz021804&gt;''Sydney Gazette'',  February 1804.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, [[Philip Gidley King]] allocated 4,435 acres, nearly twice as much the previous record of 2,631 acres in 1799. In 1804, he allocated 10,000 acres in land grants and over 20,000 acres in commons on the Hawkesbury.&lt;ref&gt;Ed., R. J. Ryan, ''Land Grants, 1788–1809,'' Australian Documents Library, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Land grants were made where there was easy access to water, particularly the creeks and paleochannels along the Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers. Conflict was inevitable as these areas were important food sources for Aboriginal people. The only records of conflict in 1804–05 come from Governor King's despatches and the ''Sydney Gazette'', which was an official newspaper. Unlike other periods there are no other sources to balance the official accounts.

In 1803, settlement was extended down stream of [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]] to Portand Head by the Coromandel settlers, non-conformist free settlers who arrived on the Coromandel. Fighting broke out there in May 1804. Matthew Everingham, his wife and servant on their Sackville Reach farm; and John Howe on his Swallow Rock Reach farm were wounded. Governor King sent troops with orders for constables and settlers to support the Portland Head settlers.&lt;ref name=Gaz03061804&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 3 June 1804&lt;/ref&gt; In June there was a stand off between 300 warriors and a group of settlers in which no casualties were reported. In the same month a settler was speared; crops from the farms of Bingham and Smith were taken; John Wilkin was speared and the farms of Cuddie and Crumby on [[South Creek (New South Wales)|South Creek]], at what is now [[Llandilo]], were burnt by a group of 150 warriors who spared the life of a convict there. Joseph Kennedy fired on Aboriginal people taking corn from his fields on the Upper Crescent Reach, as did James Dunn on Portland Reach.&lt;ref name=GazSun061804&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', Sunday, June 1804&lt;/ref&gt; The 1804 fighting stopped in mid-June with the killing of the Aboriginal warriors, Major White and Terribandy, somewhere around Richmond Hill.&lt;ref name=Gaz17061804&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 17 June 1804&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaz15071804&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 15 July 1804&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-April 1805, Branch Jack led attacks upon isolated Hawkesbury River farms killing three settlers.&lt;ref name=Gaz21041805&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 21 April 1805.&lt;/ref&gt; General orders were issued sending [[NSW Corps]] soldiers to the frontier farms and banning Aboriginal people from the farms.&lt;ref name=Gaz28041805&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 28 April 1805.&lt;/ref&gt; The government farm at Seven Hills was attacked and two of Macarthurs's stockmen at Cobbity were killed. An attack on the ''William and Mary'' at [[Pittwater]] was thwarted and two salt boilers thought killed were escorted back to Sydney by Aboriginal people.&lt;ref name=Gaz28041805 /&gt; In early May 1805, the Bidjigal people around Prospect sued for peace.&lt;ref name=Gaz28041805 /&gt; The most intense fighting occurred in mid May with more attacks on boats at Pitt Water, attacks on farms at Seven Hills and Concord, and attacks on travellers at Homebush. Andrew Thompson led an attack on Aboriginal camps near the junction of the Nepean, Grose and Hawkesbury Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 12 May 1805&lt;/ref&gt; Tedbury, son of Pemulwuy, was captured near [[Pennant Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 19 May 1805.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the fighting continued on the Hawkesbury and [[Georges River]]s and South Creek. The fighting appears to have ceased with the apprehension of the Aboriginal warrior, Musquito, in late June.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 7 July 1805&lt;/ref&gt; Five white men were killed in 1805. The Governor's report of six Aboriginal casualties in the fighting should be treated with caution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series I, Vol. 5, The Library Committee of the Commonwealth Parliament, 1915, page 497.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawkesbury Nepean War 1814–16===
[[File:William Charles Piguenit00.jpg |thumb|200px|left|The Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers, 1881]] 
There are more sources for the fighting on the Nepean and Hawkesbury Rivers, than for the earlier 1804-05 conflict, reflecting the greater [[literacy]] levels of the free settlers, officials and clergy taking up large land grants, not just along the waterfronts but on the land between the creeks and rivers. A severe drought beginning in 1812 put additional pressure on both settlers and Aboriginal people.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne McLoughlin, Landed Peasantry or Landed Gentry: a geography of land grants, in Graeme Aplin, ed., A Difficult Infant: Sydney before Macquarie, UNSW Press, Kensington, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; William Reardon, the first to die in February 1814, appears to have been speared in mistake for another man who accused some Aboriginal men of destroying his vegetable garden on Cox's Fernhill estate at Mulgoa.&lt;ref&gt;St Matthews Church of England Windsor NSW Parish Registers 1810 to 1856, Lake Macquarie Family History Group Inc, Hawkesbury City Council, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1814, a number of farms were attacked including Fernill and Campbell's Shancarmore.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 7 May 1814.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting in 1814 in the [[Appin, New South Wales|Appin]] district appears to have centred around a number of farms and individuals. An Aboriginal boy was killed by three Veteran Company soldiers while taking corn, probably on Broughton's farm. Warriors drove two of the soldiers off and killed private Eustace as he was reloading and mangled his body. In response a group of [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]] settlers fired into an Aboriginal camp, killing a woman and two children. The woman's body was mutilated and one of the dead children had been both shot and beaten. John Kennedy buried the bodies on his farm, an act of kindness that may have saved the life of a young girl who was on the spot when Aboriginal warriors killed two of the killers of the woman and children near Kennedy's farm. 

Wallah, the leader of these warriors also spared the life of the girl's brother because their mother Mrs Byrnes had given food to Aboriginal people. Hannibal Macarthur wrote to his uncle in mid May telling him that Aboriginal warriors had killed a man and woman on their Cowpasture farm and that escaped convicts were involved in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy Wentworth Correspondence, MLA752, CY699, pages 183-6, Page 105 Old Times, Sydney, May 1903, and Pages 301-302, Sibella Macarthur Onslow, (ed), Some Early Records of the Macarthurs of Camden, Angus and Robertson Ltd., Sydney, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Macquarie's response was measured, sending out a small party of soldiers and warning the settlers against further provocation.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', Saturday, 18 June 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1814 two children on the Daly's Mulgoa farm were killed after Mrs Daly fired at a party of Aboriginal people. Mrs Daly and her infant were spared.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 23 July 1814&lt;/ref&gt; The only conflict in 1815 appeared to be the spearing of a man and a woman on Macarthur's [[Bringelly]] farm as a result of an argument over a blanket.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 5 August 1815.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drought in Australia|drought]] broke in January 1816 and there were a number of floods during the year. Fighting broke out in March 1816. Four men were killed while pursuing Aboriginal warriors who had taken crops from Palmer's Bringelly farm. The lives of a man and a woman were spared when warriors took crops from Wright's farm on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Gazette, 9 March 1816&lt;/ref&gt; An attack was made on the government camp at Glenroy on the western side of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] and the government cart on its way there was also attacked. On the Grose River Mrs Lewis and a convict were killed in a dispute over wages. At the end of the month between eighty and ninety warriors attacked farms at Lane Cove.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 30 March 1816&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=173-174 |first=John |last=Ritchie |title=The Evidence to the Bigge Reports, New South Wales Under Governor Macquarie| |volume=Volume 1 The Oral Evidence |publisher=Heinemann |location=Melbourne |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:View near Grose Head NSW 1809 Evans a1528253.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Grose Valley]], 1809]]
[[Governor Macquarie]] ordered out several parties of the 46th regiment in April 1816. Captain Wallis went south to Appin, Captain Schaw to the Hawkesbury and Lieutenant Dawe was detached to the Cow pastures.&lt;ref&gt;AONSW, Reel 6045, 4/1734, pages 149-168&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers were sent to protect the Glenroy depot.&lt;ref&gt;Letter Macquarie to Murphy, 22/04/1816, NLA mfm N257, Reel 6065 AONSW CSO 4/1798, pages 39-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the guides points to the complex nature of the hostilities. Schaw unsuccessfully chased a handful of warriors around the Hawkesbury and after a white guide failed to guide the soldiers in a surprise attack on a camp at [[Maroota]] he marched south to the Cow Pastures. When the nature of Wallis' military expedition became clear to the Aboriginal guides, Bundle and Bootbarrie or Budburry, they left Captain Wallis. John Warby, a white guide, also disappeared for a time from Wallis' command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.mq.edu.au/all/journeys/people/profiles/warby.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309174116/http://www.lib.mq.edu.au/all/journeys/people/profiles/warby.html |archivedate=9 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Schaw's pursuit of a party of warriors on the [[Wingecarribee River]] ended after Colebee told him that the tracks of the warriors were two days old.

The Appin Massacre came about because local settlers guided Captain Wallis to an Aboriginal camp containing women and children near Broughton's farm, suggesting that attacks upon Aboriginal people were opportunistic. Despite the lack of orders regarding decapitation, the skull of Carnimbeigle ended up in the hands of the [[Edingburgh]] phrenologist, Sir George Mackenzie.&lt;ref&gt;Sir G. S. Mackenzie, Bart., Illustrations of Phrenology, with engravings, London, 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; Many years after the killings William Byrne wrote that the bodies of sixteen Aboriginal people were decapitated and the soldiers were rewarded for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Page 105, Old Times, Sydney, May 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Macquarie's May 1816 Proclamation ordered magistrates and troops at Sydney, [[Parramatta]] and Windsor to support settlers in driving off hostile Aboriginal people.&lt;ref name=Gaz04051816&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 4 May 1816.&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation had the effect of indemnifying soldiers and settlers against charges of murder.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 96-98, Saxe Bannister, Statements and Documents relating to proceedings in New South Wales in 1824, 1825 and 1826, Capetown, Printed by W. Bridekirk, Heeregracht, 1827.&lt;/ref&gt; Serjeant Broadfoot carried out two sweeps of the Nepean without reporting casualties in May. On his second expedition he reported meeting Magistrate Lowe in the field with a party of the 46th at Bents Basin on the Nepean. This is the only report of Lowe being in the field.&lt;ref&gt;AONSW, pages 72-73, Sejeant Broadfoot to Governor, Macquarie, 23 May 1816.&lt;/ref&gt; Four settlers were killed on the Kurrajong slopes in June and July. Magistrate William Cox put parties of soldiers, settlers and native guides in the field capturing and killing Butta Butta, Jack Straw and Port Head Jamie in mid July. At least three of these men were executed without trial.&lt;ref&gt;Page 187, Sir William Dixson - documents relating to Aboriginal Australians, 1816-1853, ML, reel CY2743; DL Add 81, State Library of NSW.

Boughton (Cooramill), Reminiscences of Richmond, From the Forties Down, Cathy McHardy, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;The fighting extended in August. Four Aboriginal children from the Hawkesbury were put in the Native Institution. They were probably picked up in unreported raids. In late August two hundred of Cox's sheep and a shepherd were killed at Fernhill. The expedition sent out in response reported no casualties. 

===Aftermath===
Settlers were driven from their [[Hunter Valley]] farms in late 1816.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sydney Gazette]]'', 31 August 1816.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1816 Magistrate [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]] outlined his plan to Governor Macquarie to put five parties of soldiers, settlers and guides into the field to scour the [[Grose River|Grose]], Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers. There were no reports of Aboriginal casualties from these expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;Call No: DL Add 81, Digital Order No: a1893188 and a1893191, [[State Library of New South Wales]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apparent lack of Aboriginal casualties fighting ceased on the Hawkesbury Nepean River system in 1816. Governor Macquarie was generous in his rewards. Cox received payments in October 1816 and February 1817. Serjeant Broadfoot also received two payments. The guides received land grants for their services. [[Breastplates]] were made for Aboriginal guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.mq.edu.au/digital/lema/1816/1816oct.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330195908/http://www.library.mq.edu.au/digital/lema/1816/1816oct.html |archivedate=30 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}  DL Add 81, Digital order No. a1893189, [[State Library of New South Wales]], Call No: DLDOC 132, Digital Order No: a3057004&lt;/ref&gt; Macquarie's April 1817 report to Bathurst, while highlighting the success of his measures, made no mention of Aboriginal casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Page 342, ''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series I, Vol. IX, The Library Committee of the Commonwealth Parliament, Sydney, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the silence of the land there are other records that point to something catastrophic happening to the Aboriginal people of the Hawkesbury Nepean in 1816. The Macarthur letters noted the absence of Aboriginal people upon their return in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Macarthur Papers, 1823-97, A4360, CY2378, [[State Library of New South Wales|Mitchell Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; George Bowmans' 1824 memorandum to Magistrate Scott recalled soldiers indiscriminately killing Aboriginal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.mq.edu.au/research/colonial_case_law/nsw/other_features/correspondence/documents/document_102a/ |title=Memorandum for Mr Scott [Document 102a] |work=Original Documents on Aborigines and Law, 1797-1840 |publisher=Centre for Comparative Law History and Governance of Macquarie University, and State Records NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministers, Threlkeld and Lang, both had stories of killings on the Hawkesbury.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colonist]]'', 27 October 1838&lt;/ref&gt; Prosper Tuckerman recalled his father tell him that 400 Aboriginal people had been killed at that time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Windsor and Richmond Gazette]]'', 25 October 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, [[John Dunmore Lang]] wrote: "There is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of New South Wales of which all the waters of New Holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains."&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 1834.

The '''Human Rights Tulip''' ({{lang-nl|Mensenrechtentulp}}) is an annual prize awarded by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Dutch ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to a human rights defender or organisation who promotes and supports human rights in innovative ways. The Human Rights Tulip was established in 2007 and presented for the first time on 10 December 2008.

The prize consists of a statuette and support worth €100.000 to assist the winning individual or organization to further develop and scale up their innovation.

The procedure of awarding the Human Rights Tulip starts with an open nominating procedure. The winner is selected by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs on the basis of public voting and the advice of an independent jury.

In October 2013, The Netherlands Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans decided to retain the award but to seek greater awareness for it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisnews.nl/human-rights-tulip.html ''Human Rights Tulip to Continue to Exist''], Netherlands Info Service, 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the foreign ministry appointed the international development organisation [[Hivos]] to run the selection process for the award.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hivos.org/news/hivos-assist-mfa-human-rights-tulip-award-2014-and-2015 ''Hivos to assist MFA Human Rights Tulip Award 2014 and 2015''], Hivos International, 3 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership continued in 2015, when the shortlist of six candidates was composed of three gaining the most votes in a public voting process, and three more selected by the Foreign Ministry and Hivos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Award|url=http://www.humanrightstulip.nl/about-the-award|publisher=Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49818">The topic of '''Human Rights in Asia''' is one that encompasses an immense number of states, international governmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations. All these institutions contribute a variety of services and perspectives towards human rights, covering topics including the enforcement, monitoring, and criticisms of human rights in Asia. There is no single body that covers all of human rights in Asia, as such a diverse and widespread region requires a number of institutions to properly monitor the multitude of elements that fall under the scope of human rights. There have historically been numerous criticisms of human rights in Asia, but a variety of new treaties and conventions now strive to accomplish a level of [[human rights]] as they are known on the international stage.
[[File:Greater_East_Asia_Conference_Map.PNG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greater_East_Asia_Conference_Map.PNG|thumb|418x418px|Greater Asian Area]]
Human rights in Asia are monitored by many organizations (both governmental and non-governmental), a few examples being the [[ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights]] (AICHR) and [[Human Rights Watch]]. Tolerance of these organizations varies from state to state, with voluntary intergovernmental programs (i.e. ASEAN) often seeing more state-cooperation than neutral non-governmental organizations would typically receive.

The number of criticisms towards Asian states has dramatically increased in recent decades, with many human rights advocates calling for increased transparency and greater international pressure upon Asian states to refrain from any human rights infractions. Aforementioned calls for international pressure have gone unanswered, however, as most of the international community finds it increasingly difficult to challenge the actions of the growing Asian powers: particularly China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/09/how-china-buys-the-silence-of-the-worlds-human-rights-critics.html|title=How China buys the silence of the world's human rights critics|last=Lau|first=Mimi|date=2017-07-09|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While states have put forward somewhat muted complaints in recent years, non-governmental organizations continue to 'name and shame' states that have shown themselves to be guilty of human rights infractions.

== History of Human Rights in Asia ==

=== Southeast Asia ===
[[File:Southeast-Asia-map.PNG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Southeast-Asia-map.PNG|thumb|527x527px|Southeast Asian Region]]
[[Southeast Asia]] has historically not adopted the same definition of human rights that could be found in Western European or North American countries. The first sign of human rights recognition came in the form of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) put forward by the United Nations. This declaration, however, was not binding and therefore not enforced. The UDHR had only 51 states worldwide ratify its existence (those who were members of the United Nations); many of the Southeast Asian countries had not yet acquired membership. This primarily Western-based notion of human rights had by no means permeated Southeast Asia; instead, the ideological opposite of human rights was true: there were no expectations of equal treatment based upon socioeconomic, cultural, religious, etc. status.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel A. (2000). ''East meets West : human rights and democracy in East Asia''([Online-Ausg.] ed.). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''[[Singapore]]''', certain fundamental freedoms are still restricted such as the freedom of assembly. Meetings of any kind are still heavily regulated, requiring a police permit for gatherings of 1 individual or more. Public gatherings for any cause are further restricted by the Singapore government, with many events in recent history being shut down under the pretense of the 'Public Order Act'. Singapore also regularly rejects applications for police permits to gather for assemblies "directed towards a political end".&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/singapore|title=World Report 2018: Rights Trends in Singapore|date=2017-12-20|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore has retained and employed the death penalty numerous time throughout history, especially in drug related criminal cases. Executions often take place relatively quickly after conviction and almost never have any transparency. Singapore's LGBTQ community has seen heavy restrictions throughout history, such as the long-standing policy of criminalizing same-sex relations - a policy that remains in place today.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

'''[[Indonesia]]''' has a long history of committing numerous human rights infractions that have gone unpunished. Numerous members of the Indonesian security forces have been found responsible for human rights violations including rape, beatings, unlawful detention, etc. but have not be brought to justice. Indonesia's media, while officially deemed 'free press', suffers from intimidation tactics employed by powerful government or business figures. Numerous journalists have been jailed under supposed violations of various criminal and civil defamation laws.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2010/country-chapters/indonesia|title=World Report 2010: Rights Trends in Indonesia|date=2010-01-20|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious freedom has been an issue of Indonesia for numerous years, despite its constitution dictating complete religious freedom/tolerance. Legal restrictions upon any religion except the 6 sanctioned state religions have existed in Indonesia for decades and are not expected to be lifted any time soon.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Labor laws in Indonesia continue to be harsh, with hundreds of thousands of girls in Indonesia being subjected to involuntary labor. These children are often prohibited from leaving their places of employment and are often abused physically, psychologically, and sexually.

=== Central Asia ===
Human rights in [[Central Asia]] have received less attention from media in recent years following the outbreak of conflict with Western powers than previous decades, but that is not to say that they are completely overlooked on the international stage by international governmental organizations or non-governmental organizations. Local interest in the adoption and upholding of human rights has also been relatively minimal, with proposed international governmental organizations (IGOs) such as the [[Central Asian Union]] (CAU) choosing to focus on other issues such as security, economic development, and cultural permeation.
[[File:Central_Asia_-_political_map_2008-es.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Asia_-_political_map_2008-es.svg|left|thumb|353x353px|Central Asia]]
It is important, however, to remember that Central Asia has many human rights issues that plague the lives of its citizens. For example, [[Human Rights Watch]] has compiled numerous reports with aims of drawing attention to the fact that '''[[Afghanistan]]''' remains in a state of conflict, seeing citizen death tolls either stay high or slowly grow; general safety of citizens is an uncertainty in Afghanistan, with human rights violations including torture, unlawful detainment, etc. by the government and other groups also going unchecked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/asia/afghanistan|title=Afghanistan|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These human rights violations have existed in Afghanistan throughout recent history and continue to exist today. Furthermore, numerous cases of sexual assault can be found throughout Afghanistan but often receive very little (if any) attention from the government&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/13/raped-then-assaulted-afghan-justice-system|title=Raped, then Assaulted by the Afghan Justice System|date=2017-12-13|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in fact, the opposite is true: the Afghan government often orders the performance of "virginity checks" upon women which essentially entails governmental sanctioned sexual assault or humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/12/01/un-who-condemns-virginity-tests|title=UN: WHO Condemns ‘Virginity Tests’|date=2014-12-01|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking specifically at '''[[Kyrgyzstan]]''', Human Rights Watch reported very few improvements to human rights in 2017 within the state, with the government acknowledging issues such as torture as an issue but doing nothing proactive to combat them. Human rights violations such as torture are considered to be de facto interrogation tools and are likely employed by the government and its police forces. Authorities in Kyrgyzstan registered registered 199 complaints of torture in 2015, with only 34 cases actually ever being looked into.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/kyrgyzstan|title=World Report 2017: Rights Trends in Kyrgyzstan|date=2017-01-12|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other questionable Kyrgyz actions have included the mid-June proposal of a foreign media blackout to avoid bad international coverage; these constitutional amendments were heavily condemned by both domestic and international journalists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''[[Kazakhstan]]''' is another Central Asian country that has had issues in recent history with human rights violations. Human Rights Watch condemned the Kazakhstan government for the detainment and jailing of peaceful protesters in 2016, with other violations such as restriction of movement and torture also being suspected following detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/kazakhstan|title=World Report 2017: Rights Trends in Kazakhstan|date=2017-01-12|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land claim protests are of particular prevalence as of late, with peaceful protests resulting in violent conflict between activists and government forces. The Kazakhstan government has justified said violent reactions by pointing to domestic laws striking freedom of association and assembly from their citizens' human rights, but said revocations of rights has been subjected to heavy criticism by the United Nations, European Union, and Human Rights Watch.

Other Central Asian countries share both similar situations regarding human rights violations and a lack of movement to rectify said violations.

=== South Asia ===
[[File:India_map_mod.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:India_map_mod.png|thumb|321x321px|South Asian Region]]
[[South Asia]] includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - each state having varying degrees of effective human rights policies and/or goals. This region of Asia has seen some dramatic improvements regarding human rights in past years but still has room to improve, especially in human rights genres such as children's rights or women's rights. Some improvements in recent years have included a number of pacts and declarations to combat the world's highest children marriage rate in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/bangladesh|title=World Report 2018: Rights Trends in Bangladesh|date=2017-12-14|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous cases of stalking, sexual assault, and rape have persisted in Bangladesh in recent years and the number of cases reported have continued to increase annually. Sexual and gender orientation has taken strides forwards in Southern Asia recently, seeing the official recognition of a third gender for [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]] come into effect; policy regarding this third gender, homosexual relationships, etc. has remained somewhat stagnant however, seeing relatively slow implementation of existing goals and the slowing of upcoming rules or regulations. Enforced or involuntary disappearances also continue to be an issue in Southern Asia, with United Nations requests for investigation being continually denied and Human Rights Watch statements simply being ignored.

One of the most prominent and long-lasting issues for Southern Asia, particularly '''[[Bangladesh]]''', is the problem of arsenic in drinking water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) have stated an estimated 40 million people have been poisoned in Bangladesh alone and that local governments have taken few (if any) steps to rectify the problem. The arsenic is thought to come from water filtering through arsenic-rich rocks and local mining activity; the latter of the reasons is difficult to show, however, due to the refusal of Bangladesh to sanction any kind of investigation into the matter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/water-quality/guidelines/arsenic-information/en/|title=Arsenic in drinking water|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/water-quality/guidelines/WSH03.06fulltext.pdf?ua=1|title=Arsenic, Drinking-water and Health Risk

[[File:Bt-map.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bt-map.png|left|thumb|Bhutan]]
'''[[Bhutan]]''' is one of the region's leading human rights advocates, adopting numerous pro-human rights policies and regulations in the past years. Bhutan has officially committed itself to the "enjoyment of all human rights" and has shown progress in recent history via a skyrocketing [[Gross National Happiness|gross national happiness]] (GNH) rating.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2014/04/bhutans-human-rights-record-defies-happiness-claim/|title=Bhutan’s Human Rights Record Defies ‘Happiness’ Claim|last=Diplomat|first=Vishal Arora, The|work=The Diplomat|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNH rating is a scale which most experts see as increasingly relevant to gauging success within a country and general citizen happiness. The GNH replaces the standard measurement, [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and its adoption has been considered by many developed nations including Canada and Japan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Bhutan has taken steps to rectify historical divisions within the country's population, a clear political inequality remains in Bhutan, rendering some citizens unable to exercise fundamental rights such as freedom of movement or freedom of association.

'''[[India]]''' finds itself as one of the leading economic powers of the region, but still is plagued with numerous human rights issues and violations. India has had numerous issues with rape and sexual assault in past years, particular against women and children. The government has condemned these acts but has taken very few steps to truly combat said issues and as a result, they still remain immensely prevalent in Indian society today. Despite policies aimed at helping victims of rape or sexual assault being implemented, victims still face immense shame at hospitals or police stations; it is assumed that while the number of cases is already extremely high, there are many more unreported instances due simply to the potential of humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/india|title=World Report 2018: Rights Trends in India|date=2018-01-18|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has also faced international condemnation for abusing its sedition and criminal defamation laws to silence political critics within its borders and thus ensuring only comments of satisfaction whereas, in reality, the opposite may potentially be true. Furthermore, India is faced with the immense problem of cultural elitism; [[Hinduism]] is the religion of most Indians and is often forced upon minority groups by either citizens or government officials. This cultural elitism has led to mass violence against minority groups by Hindu followers and despite being condemned by India's Prime Minister, is still present in today's Indian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/18/india-unchecked-attacks-religious-minorities|title=India: Unchecked Attacks on Religious Minorities|date=2018-01-18|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/india/report-india/|title=India 2017/2018|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pakistan]]''' is potentially the most volatile country in Southern Asia, seeing citizen-targeting terror attacks stemming from racially or politically motivated conflicts bring about high civilian casualties. Following the appearance of terror groups such as [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] and [[Lashkar-e-Omar]], bombings of hospitals, educational facilities, government buildings, etc. became common occurrences, each attack claiming an increasing number of civilian lives.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2010/country-chapters/pakistan|title=World Report 2010: Rights Trends in Pakistan|date=2010-01-20|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforced disappearances and the use of child soldiers have also seen frequent use through recent years, both of which have received immense international condemnation. The government has taken few steps to fix many of these human rights issues, due both to a lack of motivation and lack of resources. Abuses of women remained a prominent issue for Pakistan in recent decades, seeing instances of rape, sexual assault, forced marriage, etc. rampant throughout the country. Religious minorities in Pakistan have continued to suffer greatly from both terror organizations and the government itself, falling prey to religious policies specifically aiming to eradicate cultural/religious minorities and immense violence by terror groups and government forces alike. Immense fighting in the country brought the creation of millions of refugees; most of which have yet to permanently settle due to the instability of the region.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== East Asia ===
[[East Asia]] is home to many countries that have dominated the international community's attention in recent years. Human rights conditions in many East Asian countries have been the subject of numerous debates at the international level given the notable international actors being examined (i.e. China, Japan, etc.). The varying types of governments found in Eastern Asia have affected their respective countries' transparency regarding human rights; furthermore, these Eastern Asian countries have varying level of human rights, with some states choosing to uphold the strictest human rights issues while others sanction numerous human rights violations and atrocities.
[[File:Map_of_China_en_names.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_China_en_names.svg|left|thumb|351x351px|China]]
In '''[[China]]''' being such a significant economic and political power on the international stage, naturally their human rights record has been called into question by the international community and numerous non-governmental organizations. China has historically been harsh upon its critics and this trend has continued in recent history, seeing enforced disappearances remain a widespread occurrence across China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/|title=CHINA 2017/2018|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34592336|title=What is China accused of?|last=Ruz|first=Camila|date=2015-10-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has also held the title for the most annual executions in recent years; while official statistics remain state secrets, China still has 46 crimes punishable by death. The Chinese government has claimed that the number of executions has fallen by 60%, seeing only a few thousand executed every year, but there is no credible way to verify these statistics.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/china-and-tibet|title=World Report 2017: Rights Trends in China|date=2017-01-12|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; General living conditions have improved in recent years, with China successfully lifting millions of people out of poverty and allowing them to meet their basic needs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights on his mission to China, available from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/35/26/Add.2&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Women's rights remain somewhat basic in China but the international community has pushed the Chinese government to adopt improved rights, especially regarding women's rights within the Chinese judiciary system which as of 2013, was slated on the Chinese legislative agenda for the first time as point of discussion.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, available from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.hrichina.org/sites/default/files/outcome_report_of_the_working_group_on_upr.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; China also received international praise regarding their relative 'hands-off' approach to their autonomous regions (i.e. Xinjiang).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While there has historically been suspicion of torture in China, the general attitude towards torture has shifted in recent years; the Chinese government now openly opposes torture and punishes those who partake in it. Regarding the suspicion of torture carried out by the government itself, there have been no official admissions of torture in recent years but the international community has continued to pressure China to adopt various anti-torture laws and ensure that confessions obtained via torture are not considered admissible in the judiciary system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''[[Japan]]''' has held its human rights record in immensely high standing, strictly observing basic freedoms such the freedom of assembly, association, and expression. Domestic nationals have in recent history been protected by a strict set of codified working laws in Japan and enjoy a wide variety of workplace rights and freedoms to ensure safety and fair working conditions. The same, however, cannot be said for migrant workers from China and Korea; these foreign workers have historically had no real legislation protecting their working conditions and often fall prey to poorer working conditions and lesser wages. Migrant workers also suffer from other rights infractions, including the prevention of free movement, the prohibition of free communication (i.e. via cellphone, landline, etc.), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hurights.or.jp/english/hurights1/human-rights-in-japan.html|title=Overview: Human Rights in Japan - hurights1|website=www.hurights.or.jp|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan has historically not had any anti-discrimination laws due to a lack of evidence of any consistent discrimination within the country; this, however, changed in 2017 with the adoption of an anti-hate speech law following the provision of evidence showing a growing anti-Korean sentiment within Japan.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/japan|title=World Report 2017: Rights Trends in Japan|date=2017-01-12|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Japan's most notable human rights violations over the last decades was the provision of [[comfort women]] for their military services, namely before and during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Most of these comfort women were not Japanese nationals, but in fact Korean or Chinese captives captured in combat or purchased on a black market. These women suffered countless instances of sexual assault and rape; something the Japanese government has pledged to reconcile for and find justice for the women. In 2017, Japan began taking steps towards reconciliation by offering official apologies to numerous comfort women and donating 1 billion yen (approximately US$10 million) to Korea's [[Foundation for Reconciliation and Healing]]. Japan has continued their usage of the death penalty in recent years, executing 2 prisoners in 2017 by hanging following their convictions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
[[File:South-Korea_blank.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:South-Korea_blank.png|left|thumb|South Korea]]
'''[[South Korea]]''' shares many of the same civil and political liberties as Japan, enjoying a vibrant and relatively liberal society. There have been some instances of the government using outdated laws as a means of detaining those who criticize the government, but these cases are somewhat rare. South Korea is relatively intolerant of the LGTBQ community and has seen numerous cases of discrimination in recent years in numerous arenas, ranging from the judicial system to corporate board rooms. Women in South Korea do not enjoy the same civil liberties as women in European or North American states, instead being pushed into traditional housewife and caretaker roles by their partners. Women have also been fined up to 2 million won when found to have had an abortion without their husband's consent. South Korea also has left their policies regarding North Korea active, meaning any citizen found to be spreading positive North Korean 'propaganda' can be jailed for up to one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/south-korea|title=World Report 2018: Rights Trends in South Korea|date=2017-12-14|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:North_Korea_CIA_WFB.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:North_Korea_CIA_WFB.png|thumb|291x291px|North Korea]]
'''[[Mongolia]]''' has suffered from a poor record of human rights throughout history, seeing numerous cases of torture and assault on the part of both the government and individuals. Mongolia abolished the death penalty in 2017, but it has since been proposed to reintegrate the death penalty into the judicial system by the newly elected president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/mongolia/report-mongolia/|title=MONGOLIA 2017/2018|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongolia has also seen a high number of domestic abuse cases in recent decades and has taken no real steps to rectify the situation. Mongolia is also the home to a number of migrant workers; these workers have yet to be officially recognized by the Mongolian government and therefore have been given no official rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Mongolia Human Rights Report 2016''. US State Department, ''Mongolia Human Rights Report 2016''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[North Korea]]''' has been and continues to be the home of some of the world's worst human rights conditions. Numerous reports documenting appalling human rights violations have been compiled by North Korean defectors, outside NGOs, etc. North Korea has been accused of a number of human rights violations including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and forced abortion. North Korea has also restricted all basic civil and political liberties for its citizens, including any kind of freedom of movement or association while also providing no forums for political input. Women in North Korea continue to face a wide range of abuses including non-criminalized marital rape, forced marriage, and sexual torture; these acts are undertaken by both the government and other family members (typically husbands, fathers, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/north-korea|title=World Report 2018: Rights Trends in North Korea|date=2017-12-20|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean prison facilities have also historically provided some of the worst living conditions in the world, likely being the cause of hundreds of thousands of deaths of recent decades. These prison camps house mainly political prisoners and typically entail harsh (if not fatal) labor, regular torture, violent sexual assault and/or rape, and other appalling human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/north-korea/|title=North Korea {{!}} Amnesty International|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea has fallen under harsh criticisms from the international community for years and their abominable human rights records remains a regular topic of conversation within the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] as a potential threat to global peace and security.

== Monitoring and Regulatory Institutions ==
As the Asian region is home to a plethora of states each with varying degrees of human rights standards and general values or cultures, it comes as no surprise that Asia does not share one central authority regarding human rights.

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===

[[File:The_universal_declaration_of_human_rights_10_December_1948.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_universal_declaration_of_human_rights_10_December_1948.jpg|thumb|311x311px|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]
While a number of countries within today's greater Asian region were not members of the United Nations at the time it passed the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], most of those who were chose to vote in favor of it (i.e. Afghanistan, Pakistan, India). This declaration has 30 articles all pertaining to various facets of human rights; for example:
* '''Article 1:''' All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Article 9:''' No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''Article 19:''' Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
The UDHR was created in hopes of establishing a standard of living for people around the world, ensuring humane conditions for people regardless of their state. The UDHR is still considered the central authority regarding human rights, though it holds no binding power over states and therefore is still regularly ignored by numerous states when alternatives better serve state-interests.

=== ASEAN Human Rights Declaration ===

As mentioned above, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) can be considered the most established socio-economic regional organization in Asia. ASEAN operates solely in South East Asia, with member states including Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Myanmar, Brunei, and Laos. While ASEAN initially focused on economic development in South East Asia, it has recently started to expand its scope of operation into other areas of South East Asian society (i.e. human rights). In 2009, ASEAN formed the [[ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights]] hoping it would assist in the promotion and regulation of human rights conditions in the region. The commission created and later unanimously adopted the newly-drafted [[ASEAN Human Rights Declaration]] in November 2012 which called for basic and fundamental rights for all citizens in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asean.org/asean-human-rights-declaration/|title=ASEAN HUMAN RIGHTS DECLARATION - ASEAN {{!}} ONE VISION ONE IDENTITY ONE COMMUNITY|date=2012-11-19|work=ASEAN {{!}} ONE VISION ONE IDENTITY ONE COMMUNITY|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration has 40 articles which include:
* '''Article 3:''' Every person has the right of recognition everywhere as a person before the law.  Every person is equal before the law. Every person is entitled without discrimination to equal protection of the law.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* '''Article 11:''' Every person has an inherent right to life which shall be protected by law. No person shall be deprived of life save in accordance with law.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* '''Article 22:''' Every person has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. All forms of intolerance, discrimination and incitement of hatred based on religion and beliefs shall be eliminated.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* '''Article 33:''' ASEAN Member States should take steps, individually and through regional and international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights recognized in this Declaration.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
While the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration has been ratified by all ASEAN member states, there is still evidence of human rights transgressions in the region despite codified laws against said actions existing. The very existence of this declaration, however, shows progress regarding the acknowledgement of basic human rights in a region that traditionally expressed no interest in recognizing human rights regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/02/human-rights-violations-endemic-in-south-asia/|title=Human rights violations endemic in South Asia|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CESR_Official_Logo.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CESR_Official_Logo.jpg|left|thumb]]

=== Center for Economic and Social Rights ===

The [[Center for Economic and Social Rights]] (CESR) focuses on a collection of rights, including political rights, economic rights, social rights, etc. The CESR works throughout the entirety of Asia, often cooperating with the [[Asia Pacific Forum]] (APF) when working of improving rights situations in regions where the CESR does not have an established presence. The CESR opts to improve human rights conditions and regulations throughout Asia by supporting [[National human rights institution|National Human Rights Institutions]] (NHRIs). Rather than attempting to enact change as an international actor, CESR and APF provide a variety of services and support options to NHRIs across Asia under the pretense that these domestic National Human Rights Institutions will be able to push for change much more efficiently than an international organization would.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cesr.org/national-human-rights-institutions|title=National Human Rights Institutions {{!}} CESR|website=www.cesr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some benefits to National Human Rights Institutions include:
* NHRIs have a legally defined relationship with the state, which gives them authority to monitor compliance with international human rights norms&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

* NHRIs rely on a broader set of advocacy tools than the judiciary or civil society groups as well as a quasi-judicial competence to receive complaints and scrutinize law and practice; they provide advice, assistance and capacity building to government&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

* Uniquely positioned between government, civil society and the UN human rights system, NHRIs can bring together various governmental and non-governmental actors&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

* As permanent institutions, NHRIs are able to track issues over extended periods to identify trends in the level of rights fulfillment&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Association for Human Rights in Central Asia ===

[[File:Logo-ahrca-en).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Logo-ahrca-en).jpg|right|225x225px]]
The [[Association for Human Rights in Central Asia]] (AHRCA) is a French independent human rights organization founded in 2006. This association focuses primarily on human rights monitoring, reporting on numerous human rights infraction including torture, abysmal working conditions, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] restrictions, media repression, etc. The AHRCA monitors states that lie within Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Rather than enacting change themselves, AHRCA heavily relies upon international rights mechanisms to bring change to Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ahrca.eu/|title=Association for Human Rights in Central Asia|website=ahrca.eu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AHRCA focuses include but are not limited to:
* Protection against torture
* Support for political prisoners
* Protection of Refugees
* Freedom of Religion
Recent activist initiatives include the AHRCA calling for an international boycott of Uzbek cotton as it relies heavily upon compulsory child labor when harvested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ahrca.eu/publications/report/985-key-human-rights-concerns-in-uzbekistan|title=Key human rights concerns in Uzbekistan|last=AHRCA|website=ahrca.eu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session16/UZ/JS3_UPR_UZB_S16_2013_JointSubmission3_E.pdf&amp;action=default&amp;DefaultItemOpen=1|title=JS3_UPR_UZB_S16_2013_JointSubmission3_E.pdf|website=lib.ohchr.org|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hrw_logo.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hrw_logo.svg|left|186x186px]]

=== Human Rights Watch ===

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) is widely regarded as one of the world's most reliable nongovernmental human rights organizations. HRW was established in 1978 and monitors countries around the globe, publishing more than 100 annual reports and generating extensive media coverage of human rights infractions. Furthermore, HRW meets regularly with state governments and intergovernmental organizations (i.e. the United Nations, European Union, African Union, etc.) to provide policy advice, briefings, etc. Aside from the extensive monitoring HRW published annually, the organization also focuses heavily on facilitating change in the regions they work within. For example, HRW actively organizes and covers protests or activist movements against a wide variety of issues (i.e. garbage burning in Lebanon). HRW has been involved in the Asian region for numerous years, regularly releasing various reports and criticisms on every Asian country. These reports focus on a number of issues, including fundamental freedoms, women's rights, child labor, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/|title=Human Rights Watch|website=Human Rights Watch|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significant Human Rights Violations ==

=== 2005 Andijan Unrest ===

[[File:Chapel_in_Andijan_01.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chapel_in_Andijan_01.JPG|thumb|253x253px|Andijan Chapel]]
The 2005 [[Andijan]] Unrest human rights violation took place in Uzbekistan and is one of the worst mass civilian executions in recent history, seeing civilian death tolls estimated to be between 200 to upwards of 1500. This human rights violation was prompted by the government's reluctance to release 23 local businessmen who had been charged with extremism, fundamentalism, and separatism. A small militia group gathered outside of the prison where these businessmen were being held and broke them out in the early hours of the morning, killing a number of prison guards and holding various government officials captive. Uzbek citizens took to the streets in support of this prison break, occupying Babar Square to protest governmental corruption, unjust judiciary systems, etc.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;''Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe''. Warsaw. 20 June 2005. Retrieved 28 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Government forces blocked all roads to the square in hopes to contain the protest, but many simply walked past military forces on foot and joined the protest.&lt;ref&gt;''Council on Foreign Relations''. Retrieved 28 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; There were early reports of gunfire exchanged between civilians and military forces, but the protesters in the Babar Square were not deterred and remained in the same location. Between 5pm - 6pm, the government initiated a large offensive upon the Babar Square without any warning. The Uzbek armed forces used sniper rifles, assault rifles, and armed personnel carriers (APCs) against the protesting civilians, indiscriminately firing upon men, women, and children alike.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; There were later reports of armed forces systemically executing immobile injured civilians and moving hundreds of bodies into mass graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4550845.stm|title=How the Andijan killings unfolded|date=2005-05-17|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the government claiming it took action solely against supposed terror groups embedded within the protest, Uzbekistan came under heavy international criticism following the Andijan massacre.

=== Khmer Rouge Genocide ===

The [[Khmer Rouge]] genocide was carried out by Cambodian communists between the years of 1975 and 1979. This political group had been slowly increasing its population while simultaneously being armed by groups such as the [[Viet Cong]] and the [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese army]]. Following the Khmer Rouge's victory in the [[Cambodian Civil War]] in 1975, the group began the mass killings that would plague the countries for the next half-decade. Death tolls during the Khmer Rouge genocide are estimated to be between 1.5 to 3 million, with at least half of those numbers being politically-motivated executions. Those who were not subjected to politically-motivated executions died either from abysmal work conditions or disciplinary torture followed by execution. The Khmer Rouge regime strictly enforced its social engineering policies, most of which focused on the recreation of an agrarian society.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Frey, Rebecca Joyce (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=m569AfPJkB4C&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=Cercle+Marxiste+Khmer+Students+Association&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SYzdfdGVqy&amp;sig=2q_QlsvdRqq5Iq_C9ayMVYoUuug&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hclQU7ffIYGtyATGhYHIDw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cercle%20Marxiste%20Khmer%20Students%20Association&amp;f=false ''Genocide and International Justice'']. Infobase Publishing. pp. 266, 267. {{ISBN|0816073104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This focus brought the mass-eviction of the Cambodian urban population and later the forced marches of the urban population into rural areas in order to work farming (typically rice) institutions. Furthermore, the Khmer Rouge expected production of rice per hectare to triple from 1 ton to 3 tons; this expectation did not account for the immense inefficiency created by placing an urban population in typically rural jobs.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The urban population simply did not have the required skill set to achieve the goals of the Khmer Rouge and many were executed as economic saboteurs (labelled as such due to their production rates). Executions were carried out at first with firearms, but following an ammunition shortage, Cambodian teenagers were armed with blunt melee weapons and forced to carry out executions on enemies of the Khmer Rouge. An estimated 20,000 mass graves have been discovered since the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. In 2014, Khmer Rouge leaders [[Nuon Chea]] and [[Khieu Samphan]] received life sentences for crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Ben (1997).

=== The Daoxian Massacre ===

The [[Dao County|Daoxian]] Massacre occurred during China's cultural revolution and lasted for 66 days between the 13th of August and the 17th of October in 1967. Those who were massacred were suspected to be enemies of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC). Typically, local CPC members and revolutionary enthusiasts carried out unofficial arrests; those arrested and later executed by aforementioned local CPC members or militias received a brief, unjust trial where those judging were the same individuals who had ordered the arrests themselves. Victims were killed in a number of ways, including shooting, beatings, and decapitation. Furthermore, those who carried out these executions supposedly on behalf of the CPC would be rewarded with high wages, improved living conditions, etc. It is important to note that while the CPC did not officially sanction these militias and paramilitary groups executing counterrevolutionaries, it did not take any measures to stop these unsanctioned executions until numerous complaints from those who survived the Daoxian Massacre reached the top level of government. The killings ceased following the deployment of the 47th Field Army force but those who partook in the executions were never punished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/cultrev.htm "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, 1966-1976"].

=== Genocidal Rape in Bangladesh ===

The 1971 [[Bangladesh war for independence]] saw members of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani military]] and their supporting militias rape between 200,000 and 400,000 women and girls in an attempt of ethnic extinguisher. The Pakistani military leaders had declared Bengali freedom fighters as "Hindus" and that their women were simply spoils of war for the military to use as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War#CITEREFHerbert L. Bodman, Nayereh Esfahlani Tohidi1998|Herbert L. Bodman, Nayereh Esfahlani Tohidi 1998]], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were help in special camps where they were repeatedly raped by rotating Pakistani army groups; these women could only escape the camps by hanging themselves with their hair - an action that led to the military shaving the heads of all the camp's inmates. Those who were not subjected to these rape camps would typically be raped, killed, and bayoneted in the genitalia.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;[[Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War#CITEREFArens2010|Arens 2010]], p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Pakistani military attempted to keep these systematic rapes out of international media, numerous human rights agencies and media outlets published reports or stories regarding this genocidal rape; Pakistan subsequently came under immense international criticism, reprimanding them for their actions. One should also note that while the Pakistani military argues there were no more than a few hundred cases of rape and that said cases were simply the actions of deviant soldiers, it is much more likely that the military had adopted a policy outlining practices that would ensure the extinguishing of the Bengali people.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

'''[[Count]] Ian Melcher Shering Wachtmeister af Johannishus''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈvaktmeɪstɛr}}; 24 December 1932 – 11 November 2017) was a Swedish industrialist and [[politician]].&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ne.se/ian-wachtmeister|encyclopedia=[[Nationalencyklopedin]]|title=Ian Wachtmeister|accessdate=10 May 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Riksdag|Swedish Riksdag]] from 1991 to 1994.&lt;ref name="NE"/&gt; He was the son of Count Ted Wachtmeister and Adrienne, ''née'' [[De Geer]].

==Biography==
Wachtmeister was born on the family estate [[Nääs]] outside [[Nyköping]] in [[Södermanland County]] on 24 December 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last =Tamas | first =Gellert | year =2002 | title =Lasermannen | publisher =Ordfront | publication-place =Stockholm | page =55 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wgEfBfw6qkoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=ian+wachtmeister+född&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2fnm9ctZ_V&amp;sig=1OZU1j3IrnCDTYx9B7IwmNFBfZs&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C-C6VKH_LIr1UsLAg9AC&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ian%20wachtmeister%20född&amp;f=false | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wachtmeister studied mining and metallurgy at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]] and graduated in 1957. He then embarked on a successful industrial career culminating in [[CEO]] posts at Oxelösunds Järnverks AB 1970-1978 and Gränges Aluminium AB 1978-1983.

Together with record company owner [[Bert Karlsson]] he founded the populist political party ''[[Ny Demokrati|New Democracy]]'',&lt;ref name="NE"/&gt; and as party leader achieved parliamentary representation in the 1991 general election from [[Örebro County]]. The party's criticism of the Swedish immigration politics generated accusations of racism. Wachtmeister left the party in April 1994.&lt;ref name="NE"/&gt;

Prior to the election in 1998, Wachtmeister organised the short lived and unsuccessful ''[[Det nya partiet]]'' (The New Party). Thereafter he focused on managing his business interests, in particular the company ''The Empire''.

In 2010 he was associated with the political party [[Sweden Democrats]] as a "general advisor" to their leader [[Jimmie Åkesson]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/ian-ger-rad-at-sd-ledaren_5368661.svd&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in 2009 he expressed his intention to vote for the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] in the [[Swedish general election, 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwt.se/ekonomi/article613504.ece |accessdate=22 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114075646/http://www.nwt.se/ekonomi/article613504.ece |archivedate=14 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of cancer on 11 November 2017.

==History==

===In mythology===
[[File:Gokceada3.JPG|thumb|200px|View of [[Samothrace]] from Imbros]]

According to [[Greek mythology]], the palace of [[Thetis]], mother of [[Achilles]], king of [[Phthia]], was situated between Imbros and [[Samothrace]].

The stables of the winged horses of [[Poseidon]] were said to lie between Imbros and [[Tenedos]].

[[Homer]], in [[The Iliad]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In the depths of the sea on the cliff
Between Tenedos and craggy Imbros
There is a cave, wide gaping
Poseidon who made the earth tremble,
stopped the horses there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], [[The Iliad]] Book XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eëtion, a lord of or ruler over the island of Imbros is also mentioned in [[the Iliad]]. He buys [[Priam]]'s captured son [[Lycaon (Troy)|Lycaon]] and restores him to his father.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], [[The Iliad]], Book XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; Homer also writes that [[Hera]] and [[Hypnos]] leave [[Lemnos]] and Imbros making their way to [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], [[The Iliad]], Book XIV.&lt;/ref&gt;
Homer mention Imbros in the Iliad on other occasions too.

Imbros is mentioned in the [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]] which was dedicated to [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;Homeric Hymn 3 to Delian Apollon&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apollonius of Rhodes]] also mention Imbros in the first book of his work [[Argonautica]].&lt;ref&gt;APOLLONIUS RHODIUS, BOOK 1 OF ARGONAUTICA&lt;/ref&gt;

===In antiquity&lt;!--'Ancient Imbros' redirects here--&gt;===
For ancient Greeks, the islands of [[Lemnos]] and Imbros were sacred to [[Hephaestus]], god of [[metallurgy]], and on ancient coins of Imbros an [[ithyphallic]] [[Hephaestus]] appears.

In classical antiquity, Imbros, like Lemnos, was an Athenian [[cleruchy]], a [[colony]] whose settlers retained Athenian citizenship; although since the ''Imbrians'' appear on the Athenian tribute lists, there may have been a division with the native population. The original inhabitants of Imbros were [[Pelasgians]], as mentioned by [[Herodotus]] in [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']], Book V.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 511 or 512 BC the island was captured by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] general [[Otanes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=lAIyAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Larcher's Notes On Herodotus: Historical And Critical Comments On The History Of Herodotus (1844), p.105]&lt;/ref&gt; But later, [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]] conquered the island from Persia after the [[battle of Salamis]]; the colony was established about 450 BC, during the first Athenian empire, and was retained by [[History of Athens|Athens]] (with brief exceptions) for the next six centuries. [[Thucydides]], in his ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' describes the colonization of Imbros,&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Book VII.&lt;/ref&gt; and at several places in his narrative mentions the contribution of Imbrians in support of Athens during various military actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Books III, IV, and V.&lt;/ref&gt; He also recounts the escape of an Athenian squadron to Imbros.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Book VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 2nd century A.D., the island may have become independent under [[Septimius Severus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'': "Imbros"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strabo]] mention that [[Cabeiri]] are most honored in Imbros and Lemnos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], Geography.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] mention that Imbros was sacred to Cabeiri and [[Hermes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |title=Initiation into the Mysteries of the Ancient World|page=37|id=N2zyCQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imbrian Mysteries were one of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece (similar to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]). Unfortunately, very little are known about Imbrian Mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |title=Initiation into the Mysteries of the Ancient World|page=38|id=N2zyCQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine era===

Prior to the [[Fall of Constantinople]], several larger islands south of Imbros were under Genoese rule, part of territory historically held in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] by the independent [[Republic of Genoa|Maritime Republic of Genoa]] (1005-1797, predating the [[East-West Schism|East–West schism]] of 1054) a political development within the Western Roman Empire of city-states such as [[Venice]], [[Pisa]] and [[Amalfi]]. Defended by the Genoese Navy, one of the largest and most powerful in the Mediterranean, [[Corsica]] remained a prominent western Mediterranean territory in the Tyrhennian Sea until [[Napoleon]]'s conquest.

At the beginning of the 13th century, when the Fourth Crusade and its aftermath temporarily disrupted Venice's relations with the Byzantine Empire, Genoa expanded its influence north of Imbros, into the Black Sea and Crimea. An extensive network of mercantile routes and associated ports promoted expansion of Byzantine culture, its goods and services - including scholars and craftsmen schooled in ancient Classical traditions - into Italy, France, Greece, Monaco, Russia, Tunisia, Turkey and Ukraine. The Renaissance's renewal of European culture was spawned in part by the rapid influx of exiles from Constantinople at the close of the 15th century. Not all the trade exchanges were as beneficial however: in the debit column can be recorded the 1347 European import of the [[Black Death|plague]] via a Genoese trading post in the Black Sea. High mortality precipitated a weakening in the balance of maritime powers, leading to political strife with Venice and outright war. After a failing alliance with France against Barbary pirates, Genoa became a satellite of Spain; a native son and heir to its vital maritime tradition, Christopher Columbus, sponsored the discovery of the Americas in 1492.

===Ottoman era===
After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 the Byzantine forces in Imbros left the island. In the aftermath following the withdrawal, delegates from the island went to İstanbul for an audience with the Ottoman Emperor [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] to discuss terms allowing them to live harmoniously within the Ottoman Empire.

After the island became Ottoman soil in 1455 it was administered by Ottomans and Venetians at various times. During this period, and particularly during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Kanuni Sultan Süleyman]] (1520-1566), the island became a foundation within the Ottoman Empire. Relations between the Ottomans and Venetians occasionally led to hostilities - for example, in June 1717 during the [[Turkish-Venetian War (1714-1718)]], a tough but ultimately fairly indecisive [[Battle of Imbros (1717)|naval battle]] between a Venetian fleet, under Flangini, and an Ottoman fleet was fought near Imbros in the [[Aegean Sea]]. Nevertheless, the island's residents continued to live in relative peace and prosperity until the 20th century.

In 1912 during the [[First Balkan War]], the Greek Navy invaded the island. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Athens]] in 1913 all of the Aegean islands except Bozcaada and Gökçeada were ceded to Greece.

===First World War===
In 1915, Imbros played an important role as a staging post for the allied Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, prior to and during the invasion of the Gallipoli peninsula. A field hospital, airfield and administrative and stores buildings were constructed on the island. In particular, many [[ANZAC]] (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) soldiers were based at Imbros during the Gallipoli campaign, and the island was used as an air and naval base by ANZAC, British, and French forces against Turkey. On Imbros was the headquarters of General [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |title=Gallipoli: The battlefield guide|id=ct8AWvmF9nQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 1918, a naval action (see [[Battle of Imbros (1918)]]) took place in the Aegean near the island when an Ottoman squadron engaged a flotilla of the British Royal Navy.

[[Patrick Shaw-Stewart]], wrote his famous poem ''Achilles in the Trench'', one of the best-known war poems of the First World War, while he was at the Imbros. He seemed to enjoy speaking [[ancient Greek]] to the inhabitants of Imbros. In one of his letters he wrote: "here I am, living in a Greek village and talking the language of [[Demosthenes]] to the inhabitants (who are really quite clever at taking my meaning)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |title=Stand in the Trench, Achilles: Classical Receptions in British Poetry of the Great War|page=37|id=BahEGJK76wMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between Turkey and Greece===
Between November 1912 and September 1923, Imbros, together with [[Tenedos]], were under the administration of the Greek navy. Both islands were overwhelmingly ethnically Greek, and in the case of Imbros the population was entirely Greek.&lt;ref name="Alexandris"/&gt;

Negotiations to end the Balkan war started in December 1912 in London and the issue of the Aegean islands was one persistent problem.  The issue divided the great powers with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy supporting the Ottoman position for return of all the Aegean islands and Britain and France supporting the Greek position for Greek control of all the Aegean islands.{{sfn|Kaldis|1979|ps=}}  With Italy controlling key islands in the region, major power negotiations deadlocked in London and later in Bucharest.  Romania threatened military action with the Greeks against the Ottomans in order to force negotiations in Athens in November 1913.{{sfn|Kaldis|1979|ps=}}  Eventually, Greece and Great Britain pressured the Germans to support an agreement where the Ottomans would retain Tenedos, [[Kastelorizo]] and Imbros and the Greeks would control the other Aegean islands.  The Greeks accepted the plan while the Ottoman Empire rejected the ceding of the other Aegean islands.{{sfn|Kaldis|1979|ps=}}  This agreement would not hold, but the outbreak of World War I and the Turkish War of Independence put the issue to the side.

During [[World War I]] [[Gallipoli Campaign]], the [[British Empire|British]] used the island as a supply base and built a 600m. long airstrip for military operations.{{sfn|Jones|1928|ps=}}

In 1920, the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] with the defeated [[Ottoman Empire]] granted the island to Greece. The Ottoman government, which signed but did not ratify the treaty, was overthrown by the new Turkish nationalist Government of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], based in Ankara. After the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] ended in Greek defeat in Anatolia, and the fall of [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and his Middle Eastern policies, the western powers agreed to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] with the new Turkish Republic, in 1923. This treaty made the island part of Turkey; but it guaranteed a special autonomous administrative status for Imbros and Tenedos to accommodate the Greeks, and excluded them from the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]] that took place between Greece and [[Turkey]], due to their presence there as a majority.&lt;ref&gt;See link to the text of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], below&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 14 of the treaty provided specific guarantees safeguarding the rights of minorities in both the nations.{{sfn|Immigration and Asylum: From 1900 to the Present, Volume 2|2005|ps=}}

However shortly after the legislation of "Civil Law" on 26 June 1927 (Mahalli Idareler Kanunu), the rights accorded to the Greek population of Imbros and Tenedos were revoked, in violation of the Lausanne Treaty. Thus, the island was demoted from an administrative district to a sub-district which resulted that the island was to be stripped of its local tribunals. Moreover, the members of the local council were obliged to have adequate knowledge of the Turkish language, which meant that the vast majority of the islanders were excluded. Furthermore, according to this law, the Turkish government retained the right to dissolve this council and in certain circumstances, to introduce police force and other officials consisted by non-islanders. This law also violated the educational rights of the local community and imposed an educational system similar to that followed by ordinary Turkish schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexandris|first=Alexis|title=Imbros and Tenedos:: A Study of Turkish Attitudes Toward Two Ethnic Greek Island Communities Since 1923|year=1980|publisher=Pella Publishing Company|page=21|url=http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/13027/07_1_1980.pdf?sequence=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massive scale persecution against the local Greek element started in 1961, as part of the ''Eritme Programmi'' operation that aimed at the elimination of Greek education and the enforcement of economic, psychological pressure and violence. Under these conditions the Turkish government approved the appropriation of the 90% of the cultivated areas of the island and the settlement of additional 6,000 ethnic Turks from mainland Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Λιμπιτσιούνη|first=Ανθή Γ.|title=Το πλέγμα των ελληνοτουρκικών σχέσεων και η ελληνική μειονότητα στην Τουρκία, οι Έλληνες της Κωνσταντινούπολης της Ίμβρου και της Τενέδου|publisher=Αριστοτέλειο Πανεπιστήμιο Θεσσαλονίκης|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashgate Studies in Pilgrimage"&gt;{{cite book| last1= Eade | first1= John| last2= Katic| first2=  Mario| title= Ashgate Studies in Pilgrimage| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBqrBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=imvros%2Bdiscrimination&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7w6CzbpgJ-&amp;sig=cYdJQsbxui2v9xB4dfbJKNL7m2s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN5_XBt4TKAhUBOBQKHQ1SDCUQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| publisher= Ashgate Pub Co|date=28 June 2014| page=38 |isbn=978-1472415929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish Government, also, closed the Greek schools on the island and classified it as "supervised zone", which meant that [[expatriate]]s could not visit the island and their homes without special admission.&lt;ref name="Ashgate Studies in Pilgrimage"/&gt; Greeks on the island were also targeted by the construction of an open prison on the island that included inmates convicted of rape and murder, who were then allowed to roam freely on the island and harass locals.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish public unaware of truth of Imbros: Patriarch|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-public-unaware-of-truth-of-imbros-patriarch.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=34603&amp;NewsCatID=341|newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=14 November 2012}} "According to Feryal Tansuğ, a historian at Istanbul’s Bahçeşehir University, who compiled the book "İmroz Rumları, Gökçeada Üzerine" (Rums of Imbros, on Gökçeada), non-Muslims on the island were targeted as part of an official policy that included allowing inmates at a jail built on the island to roam free and harass locals."&lt;/ref&gt; Some are said to have committed the same crimes before the prison was closed down in 1992.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"/&gt; Farming land was expropriated for the prison.&lt;ref name = "Helsinki_Watch_Report_1992&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/TURKEY923.PDF  DENYING HUMAN RIGHTS AND ETHNIC IDENTITY: THE GREEKS OF TURKEY - A Helsinki Watch Report 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, with the 1964 Law On Land Expropriation (No 6830) the farm property of the Greeks on the island where taken away from their owners.&lt;ref name="Human_Rights_in_Turkey"&gt;{{cite book| last = Arat| first = Zehra F.

Additional population settlements from Anatolia occurred in 1973, 1984 and 2000. The state provided special credit opportunities and agricultural aid in kind to those who would decide to settle in the island.&lt;ref&gt;Babul, 2004: 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; New settlements were created and existing settlements were renamed with Turkish names.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"/&gt; The island itself was officially renamed to Gökçeada in 1970.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"/&gt; On the other hand, the indigenous Greek population being deprived of its means of production and facing hostile behaviour from the government and the newly arrived settlers, left its native land. The peak of this exodus was in 1974 during the Cyprus crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Babul, 2004: 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1991, Turkish authorities ended the military "forbidden zone" status on the island.&lt;ref name = "Helsinki_Watch_Report_1992/&gt;

In 1992, Panimbrian Committee mentioned, that members of the Greek community are "considered by the authorities to be second class citizens" and that the local Greeks are afraid to express their feelings, to protest against certain actions of the authorities or the Turkish settlers, or even to allow anybody to make use of their names when they give some information referring to the violation of their rights, fearing the consequences which they will have to face from the Turkish authorities.&lt;ref name = "Helsinki_Watch_Report_1992/&gt; Same year the [[Human Rights Watch]] report concluded that the Turkish government has denied the rights of the Greek community on Imbros and Tenedos in violation of the Lausanne Treaty and international human rights laws and agreements.&lt;ref name = "Helsinki_Watch_Report_1992/&gt;

By 2000, only 400 Greeks remained, while the Turks were around 8000.&lt;ref name="Eade"/&gt; {{As of|2015}}, only 318 Greeks remained on the island, whereas the number of Turks increased to 8,344.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"/&gt; A diaspora of approximately 15,000 Imbriots based mostly in Greece maintains strong links to the island.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"/&gt;

==Geography==

===Geology===
Imbros is mainly of [[volcanic]] origin and the highest mountain of the island İlyas Dağ, is an extinct cone-shaped [[stratovolcano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10064-010-0270-6#/page-1 |title=Physical and mechanical properties of Gokceada: Imbros (NE Aegean Sea) Island andesites|publisher=Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquakes===
Imbros is situated directly south of the [[North Anatolian Fault]], lying within the [[Anatolian Plate]] very close to the boundary between the [[Aegean Sea Plate|Aegaean Sea]] and [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] Plates. This fault zone, which runs from northeastern Anatolia to the northern Aegean Sea, has been responsible for several deadly earthquakes, including in Istanbul, Izmit and Imbros among others, and is a major threat to the island. On 24 May 2014, Imbros was shaken by a strong [[2014 Aegean Sea earthquake|earthquake]] with a magnitude of 6.9 [[Moment magnitude scale|M&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;]]. 30 people were injured and numerous old houses were damaged, some of them irreparably. A major earthquake is expected to occur along this fault line in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usb000r2hc#summary |title=M6.9 - 19km S of Kamariotissa, Greece |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor noticeable earthquakes are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deprem.ibb.gov.tr/tr/index.html |title=İstanbul ve Civarının Deprem Etkinliğinin Sürekli İzlenmesi Projesi - Marmara Bölgesi |publisher=Deprem.ibb.gov.tr |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035848/http://deprem.ibb.gov.tr/tr/index.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The island has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with warm and dry summers, and wet and cool winters. Although summer is the driest season, some rainfall does occur in summer. Snow and ground frost are not uncommon in winter.

; Çınarlı : Çınarlı (also known as "Gökçeada" or "Merkez" meaning "center") is the only town on Imbros, known as ''Panaghia Balomeni'' (Παναγία Μπαλωμένη) in Greek; there is a small [[Gökçeada Airport|airport]] nearby.

===Villages===
Most of the settlements on Imbros were given Turkish names in 1926.
; Bademli köyü : Older Greek name is ''Gliky'' (Γλυκύ). It is located to the northeast of the island, between Çınarlı town and Kaleköy/Kastro.
; Dereköy : Older Greek name is ''Schoinoudi'' (Σχοινούδι). It is located at the center of the west side of island. Due to the emigration of the Greek population (largely to Australia and the USA; some to Greece and Istanbul before the 1970s), Dereköy is largely empty today. However, many people return on every 15 August for the festival of the [[Virgin Mary]].
; Eşelek / Karaca köyü : It is located at the southeast of the island. It is an agricultural area that produces fruit and vegetables.
; Kaleköy : Older name is ''Kastro'' (Κάστρο) ([[Latin language|Latin]] and Greek for [[castle]]). Located on the north-eastern coast of island, there is an antique castle near the village. Kaleköy also has a small port which was constructed by the French Navy during the occupation of the island in the First World War, and is now used for fishing-boats and yachts.
; Şahinkaya köyü : It is located near Dereköy.
; Şirinköy : It is located in the southwest of island.
; Tepeköy : Older Greek name is ''Agridia'' (Αγρίδια). It is located in the north of the island, and is home to the largest Greek population among all villages. İlyas Dağ, an extinct volcano located to the south of the village, has an elevation of {{convert|673|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which makes it the highest point of the island.
; Uğurlu köyü : It is located in the west of the island.
; Yeni Bademli köyü : It is located at the center-northeast of the island, near Bademli. It has many motels and ''pensions.''
; Yenimahalle : Older Greek name is ''Evlampion'' (Ευλάμπιον). It is located near the town of Çınarlı on the road to Kuzulimanı port.
; Zeytinli köyü : Older Greek name is ''Aghios Theodoros'' (Άγιος Θεόδωρος). Demetrios Archontonis, known as [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople]], was born there on 29 February 1940. The village has beautiful historic Greek houses and gets its Turkish name from the surrounding [[olive grove]]s (''Zeytinli köy'' meaning "[[Olive]]-ville" in Turkish.) The village is very popular among tourists during high season.
; Others : '''Yeni Bademli köyü''', '''Eşelek / Karaca köyü''', '''Şahinkaya köyü''', '''Şirinköy''' and '''Uğurlu köyü''' were established after 1970.

===Cittaslow===
Gökçeada is one of the eight "[[cittaslow]]s" of Turkey and is the second in being accepted as one, after [[Seferihisar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cittaslow.org/network/country/35 |title=Turkey - Cittaslow International |publisher=www.cittaslow.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barba Yorgo tavern, Tepeköy village, Gökçeada, Turkey - 20050713.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Barba Yorgo's [[taverna]] in Tepeköy]]
The island was primarily inhabited by ethnic Greeks from ancient times through to approximately the 1960s. Data dating from 1922 taken under Greek rule and 1927 data taken under Turkish rule showed a strong majority of Greek inhabitants on Imbros, and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] had a strong presence on the island.&lt;ref name="Alexandris"/&gt;

Article 14 of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923) exempted Imbros and Tenedos from the large-scale population exchange that took place between Greece and Turkey, and required Turkey to accommodate the local Greek majority and their rights:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The islands of Imbros and Tenedos, remaining under Turkish sovereignty, shall enjoy a special administrative organisation composed of local elements and furnishing every guarantee for the native non-Moslem population insofar as concerns local administration and the protection of persons and property. The maintenance of order will be assured therein by a police force recruited from amongst the local population by the local administration above provided for and placed under its orders.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the treaty provisions relating to administrative autonomy for Imbros and protections of minority populations was never implemented by the Turkish government."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Human Rights Watch|title=Denying Human Rights and Ethnic Identity: The Greeks in Turkey|year=1992|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdubdhMwM1YC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a significant decline in the Greek population of the island.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt;

A recent development whose long-term significance remains to be evaluated was the three-day visit of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]] [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew]], a native of Imbros, (11–13 August 2011) in the course of which he met Stavros Lambrinidis, the foreign minister of Greece, apparently the first minister in office to visit the island, not officially though, since the Treaty of Lausanne (sources:SOP;Oecumenisme Informations no.420, December 2011).

* In 1923, Turkey dismissed the elected government of the island, and installed mainlanders. 1,500 Imbriots who had taken refuge from the [[Turkish War of Independence]] on [[Lemnos]] and in [[Thessalonica]] were denied the right to return, as undesirables and their property was confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Libitsiouni |first=Anthi |title=Το πλέγμα των ελληνοτουρκικών σχέσεων και η ελληνική μειονότητα στην Τουρκία,.

* In 1927, the system of local administration on Imbros was abolished, and the Greek schools closed. In 1952-3, the Greek Imbriots were permitted to build new ones, closed again in 1964.&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt;
* In 1943, Turkey arrested the Metropolitan of Imbros and Tenedos with other Orthodox clerics. They also confiscated the lands on Imbros belonging to the monasteries of [[Great Lavra]] and [[Koutloumousiou monastery|Koutloumousiou]] on [[Mount Athos]], expelled the tenants, and installed settlers; when the Mayor of Imbros and four village elders protested, they were arrested and sent to the mainland.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Between 1964 and 1984, almost all the usable land on Imbros had been expropriated, for inadequate compensation, for an army camp, a minimum-security prison, reforestation projects, a dam project, and a national park.&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;{{cite web|last=Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights |title=Gökçeada (Imbros) and Bozcaada (Tenedos): preserving the bicultural character of the two Turkish islands as a model for co-operation between Turkey and Greece in the interest of the people concerned |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc08/EDOC11629.pdf |work=Parliamentary Assembly Assemblée parlementaire |accessdate=18 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002134443/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc08/EDOC11629.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nicholas Palaiopoulos, a town councilor, was arrested and imprisoned in 1962 for complaining to the Greek Ambassador on the latter's visit to Imbros; he, together with the Mayor of Imbros and 20 others, was imprisoned again in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexandris|first=Alexis|title=Imbros and Tenedos:: A Study of Turkish Attitudes Toward Two Ethnic Greek Island Communities Since 1923|year=1980|publisher=Pella Publishing Company|pages=28–29|url=http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/13027/07_1_1980.pdf?sequence=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The old Cathedral at Kastro (Kaleköy) was desecrated on the night of the Turkish landing on Cyprus in 1974; the present Cathedral was looted in March 1993; criminal activities have included a number of rapes and murders, officially blamed on convicts and soldiers, but none of them has been solved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Through the latter half of the 20th century, the Turkish government implemented a program to settle mainland Turks on Imbros and Tenedos (Bozcaada).&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"/&gt;
* On 28 October 2010, the Greek cemetery of the island was [[desecrated]], an action condemned by the [[Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish public unaware of truth of Imbros: Patriarch|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=turkey-condemns-desecration-against-greek-orthodox-cemetery-in-gokceada-2010-10-31|newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|date=31 October 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these events have led to the Greeks emigrating from both islands. According to 1927 Population Census, Imbros population was 6,555 Greeks, and 157 Turks; in contrast at the 2000 Population Census the Greeks had become a minority on the island.&lt;ref name="Ashgate Studies in Pilgrimage"/&gt; In 2000, there were around 400 Greeks, while the Turks were around 8000.&lt;ref name="Eade"&gt;{{cite book| last1= Eade | first1= John| last2= Katic| first2=  Mario| title= Ashgate Studies in Pilgrimage| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBqrBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=imvros%2Bdiscrimination&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7w6CzbpgJ-&amp;sig=cYdJQsbxui2v9xB4dfbJKNL7m2s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN5_XBt4TKAhUBOBQKHQ1SDCUQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| publisher= Ashgate Pub Co|date=28 June 2014| page=38 |isbn=978-1472415929 }} In 2014 there were around 300 Greeks and 8,344 Turks.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the former Greeks of Imbros and Tenedos are in [[diaspora]] in Greece, the [[United States]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Struggle for Justice'', pp.33-73; they ascribe the resettlement program to an article in the Turkish magazine "Nokta".&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the Greek school on Imbros was reopened after 51 years.  {{As of|2015}}, there are 14 students, only one of whom was born on the island, the rest from diaspora families that returned to the island.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"/&gt; In addition, a member of the Greek community is serving on the Imbros municipal police force {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"/&gt;

A Turkish documentary of 2013, "Rüzgarlar" (Winds), by Selim Evci, is focused on the discriminative government policies of the 1960s against the Greek population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ΒΙΝΤΕΟ: Τα τουρκικά εγκλήματα στην Ίμβρο, αποκαλύπτει τουρκική ταινία|url=http://www.onalert.gr/stories/tourkika-eglimata-stin-imvro-apokalyptei-tourkiki-tainia|publisher=onalert.gr|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Food Chemicals Codex]] specifies the labeling requirements for food ingredients including lactylates. In the European Union, lactylates must be labelled in accordance with the requirements of the applicable [[Directive (European Union)|EU regulation]]. Lactylates may be labelled as [[#Calcium_stearoyl-2-lactylate|calcium stearoyl lactylate]] (CSL), [[#Sodium_stearoyl-2-lactylate|sodium stearoyl lactylate]] (SSL), or [[#Lactylic_esters_of_fatty_acids|lactylic esters of fatty acids]] (LEFA).&lt;ref name = FCC-CSL&gt;{{cite book | title = Food Chemical Codex | edition = 7 | chapter = Calcium Stearoyl Lactylate | pages = 157–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = FCC-SSL&gt;{{cite book | title = Food Chemical Codex | edition = 7 | chapter = Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate | pages = 964–965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = FCC-LEFA&gt;{{cite book | title = Food Chemical Codex | edition = 7 | chapter = Lactylic Esters of Fatty Acids | pages = 561–563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lactylates were developed in the 1950s by the C.J. Patterson Company as non-[[petrochemical]] alternatives to Sta-Soft, a [[Polyethylene glycol|polyoxyethylene]] derivative of [[stearic acid]], for delaying the [[staling]] of [[bread]].&lt;ref name=Glabe&gt;{{citation | inventor-last=Glabe | inventor-first=E.F. | title=Method of Preparing Bakery Products |issue-date=Mar. 18, 1958 | patent-number=2827378 | country-code=US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lord&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Lord | first=D.D. | title=The action of polyoxyethylene monostearate upon starch with reference to its softening action in bread | journal=J.

In 1954, the inventors published an article showing that CSL improved mix tolerance, bread volume and overall quality.&lt;ref name=Thompson3&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thompson | first1=J.B. | last2=Buddemeyer | first2=B.D. | title=Improvement of flour mixing characteristics by a stearyl lactylic acid salt | journal=Cereal Chem. | year=1954 | volume=31 | pages=296–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSL won FDA approval for use as a food additive in April 1961 and was first used as a commercial bakery additive in the United States in 1962.&lt;ref name = Benniga/&gt; The research was acknowledged as a major achievement in the baking industry, winning the [[Food Technology Industrial Achievement Award]] in 1965. SSL use as a bakery additive followed in 1968.&lt;ref name = Boutte&gt;{{cite book | last1=Boutte | first1=T. | last2 = Skogerson | first2=L. | chapter = Stearoyl-2-lactylates and oleoyl lactylates | title = Emulsifiers in Food Technology | editor-last = Whitehurst | editor-first=R.J | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | place = Oxford | year=2004 | pages=207–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
[[File:Generalized Lactylate Manufacturing Process.png|thumb|330px | alt = image of a cartoon depicting the lactylate manufacturing process | Lactylate Manufacturing Process]]
The original lab-scale preparation of lactylates involved [[Ester#Alcoholysis of acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides|esterification]] of lactic acid or [[Polylactic acid|poly(lactic acid)]] with an [[Acyl chloride|acid chloride]] derivative of the desired fatty acid.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name = Thompson2/&gt; Current manufacturing practices were patented in January 1956 and combine [[fatty acid]]s (e.g. naturally derived [[stearic acid]]) and [[lactic acid]] at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name=Thompson4&gt;{{citation | inventor1-last=Thompson | inventor1-first=J.B. | inventor2-last=Buddemeyer | inventor2-first=B.D | title=Salts of Fatty Acid Esters of Lactylic Acids | patent-number=2733252 | country-code = US | issue-date = Jan. 31, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; For CSL and SSL, the stearic acid component is typically produced from [[Vegetable fats and oils|vegetable oils]] such as [[soybean oil]] or [[palm oil]].&lt;ref name = Markley/&gt;

Lactic acid is primarily produced by [[lactic acid fermentation]] of [[sugar]] with lactic acid [[bacteria]] (similar to the bacteria used to produce [[yogurt]]). The sugar can be [[sucrose]], [[fructose]], or [[glucose]] obtained from [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]] or [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]]. Because the lactic acid is derived from [[plant]] sources and not from [[milk]] or [[Dairy product|milk products]], it does not contain any residual [[lactose]]. Therefore, people who are [[Lactose intolerance|lactose intolerant]] can consume lactylates without concern.&lt;ref name = Baniel/&gt;

Lactylates, in the free acid form, are not readily water dispersable. To improve the water dispersibility and emulsification properties, the [[carboxylic acids]] comprising lactylates can be [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] using [[hydroxides]] or [[carbonates]] of [[Alkali metal|group 1]] or [[Alkaline earth metal|group 2]] [[metals]] such as [[sodium]] or [[calcium]].&lt;ref name = Young&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Young | first1 = F.V.K. | last2 = Poot | first2 = C. | last3 = Biernoth | first3 = E. | last4 = Krog | first4 = N. | last5 = Davidson | first5 = N.G.J. | last6 = Gunstone | first6 = F.D. | chapter = Processing of Fats &amp; Oils | title = The Lipid Handbook | edition = 2nd | editor1-last = Gunstone | editor1-first = F.D. | editor2-last = Harwood | editor2-first = J.L. | editor3-last = Padley | editor3-first = F.B. | publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall | place = London | year = 1994 | page = 301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At room temperature, lactylates can be viscous liquids or solids depending on the starting fatty acid, the total recoverable lactic acid content, and the degree of neutralization. Solid lactylates are often processed into powders. The traditional method is to solidify the liquid into a flake and grind the resulting flake into a powder. Newer methods utilize spray [[Congelation|congealing]] to directly form beads.&lt;ref name = Krog&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Krog | first1 = N.J. | last2 = Spars¯ | first2 = F.V. | chapter = Food Emulsifiers:  Their Chemical and Physical Properties | editor1-last = Friberg, S.E. | editor1-first = S.E. | editor2-last = Larsson | editor2-first = K. | editor3-last = Sjˆblom | editor3-first = J. | title = Food Emulsions | edition = 4th | publisher = Marcel Dekker | place = New York | year = 2004 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manufacturing process of lactylates is an [[Ester#Esterification of carboxylic acids|esterification reaction]]. The [[water]] coproduct is removed by [[evaporation]] to drive the reaction towards the desired product composition in accordance with [[Le Chatelier's principle]]. Water removal is accomplished either by [[sparging (chemistry)|sparging]] with a constant stream of dry nitrogen or by [[Vacuum#Outgassing|vacuum outgassing]] with the use of a vacuum pump system. Using nitrogen sparging or vacuum outgassing also protects the reaction mixture from undesirable [[oxidation]] processes.&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson4/&gt;

[[File:C16andC18lactylates.png|thumb|400px | alt = structure of a few of the chemical entities comprising commercial lactylates | Structure of Lactylate Species]]
The manufacturing process does not produce chemically pure lactylates (e.g. stearoyl-2-lactylate) for two reasons. First, the source fatty acid is not chemically pure since it is typically derived from natural sources. The source fatty acid may contain varying ratios of different fatty acids (e.g. [[lauric acid]] (C12:0), [[myristic acid]] (C14:0), [[palmitic acid]] (C16:0), [[stearic acid]] (C18:0), [[arachidic acid]] (C20:0), [[behenic acid]] (C22:0), etc.). Second, lactic acid readily undergoes self-esterification producing a variety of polylactyls (typically numbering from one to three lactyl groups).&lt;ref name = Thompson4/&gt;

Chemically pure lactylates (e.g. stearoyl-1-lactylate, stearoyl-2-lactylate, etc.) can be produced through an intermediate [[benzyl]] [[ether]] derivative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elliger | first1 = Carl A. | title = A convenient preparation of pure stearoyl-2-lactylic acid | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 27 | pages = 527 | year = 1979 | doi = 10.1021/jf60223a037}}&lt;/ref&gt; This synthetic pathway provides a convenient route to the production of analytical standards of the individual lactylate components.

==Functionality==

===Overview===
[[Image:Emulsions.svg|frame|right|A. Two immiscible liquids, not yet emulsified.&lt;br /&gt;B. An emulsion of Phase II dispersed in Phase I.&lt;br /&gt;C. The unstable emulsion progressively separates.&lt;br /&gt;D. The [[surfactant]] (purple outline around particles) positions itself on the interfaces between Phase II and Phase I, stabilizing the emulsion.]]
Due to differences in physical properties, oil does not readily mix with water. Many food and non-food systems require stabilization of mixtures of oil and water in order to prevent phase separation. Therefore, additives are used to provide stability. Lactylates are such additives.&lt;ref name = Bennett&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bennett | first1 = H. | last2 = Bishop Jr. | first2 = J.L. |  last3 = Wulfinghoff | first3= M.F. | chapter = Introduction | title = Practical Emulsions Volume 1 Materials and Equipment | publisher = Chemical Publishing Company | place = New York | year = 1968 | page =1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lactylates are surface active and are therefore [[surfactants]]. Lactylates contain [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] polar groups, which interact with water, and non-polar [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] groups, which interact with fats and oils. These interactions provide stability to an oil/water system resulting in the formation of an [[emulsion]]. Therefore, lactylates are often referred to as emulsifiers. The degree of interaction is dependent on the identity of the fatty acid, the mole ratio of fatty acid to lactic acid, the degree of neutralization and the nature of the neutralizing base (if applicable) used in the manufacture of the lactylate.&lt;ref name = Bennett2&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bennett | first1 = H. | last2 = Bishop Jr. | first2 = J.L. |  last3 = Wulfinghoff | first3= M.F. | chapter = Basic Considerations | title = Practical Emulsions Volume 1 Materials and Equipment | publisher = Chemical Publishing Company | place = New York | year = 1968 | pages = 3–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Bennett3&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bennett | first1 = H. | last2 = Bishop Jr. | first2 = J.L. |  last3 = Wulfinghoff | first3= M.F. | chapter = Ingredients and Additives | title = Practical Emulsions Volume 1 Materials and Equipment | publisher = Chemical Publishing Company | place = New York | year = 1968 | pages = 37–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in the next two sections, applications of lactylates extend beyond their use as surfactants in both food and non-food systems. Such applications include strengthening dough, delaying bread staling, enhancing foam, and preventing microbial growth.&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bennett3/&gt;

===Food applications===
The largest food application of lactylates is in the manufacture of baked goods such as [[yeast]]-leavened bakery products. In these systems, lactylates are added to strengthen dough and delay bread staling (i.e. soften the crumb).&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt; Dough in commercial bakeries requires some resistance to mechanical abuse and shock to maintain desirable volume in the finished baked good. Dough strengtheners interact with the [[protein]] components (e.g. [[gluten]]) in the dough. The interactions reinforce the protein network, preventing collapse of the loaf during baking. These additives ensure each loaf of bread conforms to the visual and textural quality expectations of the manufacturer and consumer.&lt;ref name=Nylander&gt;{{cite book | last1=Nylander | first1=T. |last2=Arnebrant | first2=T. |last3=Bos | first3=M. | last4=Wilde | first4=P. | chapter = Protein/Emulsifier Interactions | title = Food Emulsifiers and Their Applications | editor1-last=Hasenhettl | editor1-first=G.L. | editor2-last = Hartel | editor2-first = R.W. | publisher=Springer | place = New York | year = 2010 | edition = 2 | pages = 89–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumb softeners are added to bread to reduce or delay [[staling]] of the finished baked good. Bread staling occurs when the starch components form hard crystals. Crumb softeners complex with the starch components, preventing or delaying the formation of starch crystals.&lt;ref name = Hasenhuettl&gt;{{cite book | last=Hasenhuettl | first=G.L. | chapter = Emulsifier-Carbohydrate Interactions | title = Food Emulsifiers and Their Applications | editor1-last=Hasenhettl | editor1-first=G.L. | editor2-last = Hartel | editor2-first = R.W. | publisher=Springer | place = New York | year = 2010 | edition = 2 | pages = 63–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lactylate enriched bread will remain fresh for up to five days after baking.&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt; Bread prepared without lactylates begins to stale within one to three days after production.&lt;ref name = Benniga/&gt;&lt;ref name = Hasenhuettl/&gt;

In other food applications, lactylates are used as emulsifiers. For example, lactylates are used in non-dairy creamers to help disperse the fat-based creamer throughout the hot beverage. The lactylate stabilizes (i.e. prevents separation of) the oil-in-water emulsion. Another use of lactylates is as whipping agents. In these applications, the lactylate helps aeration of the continuous phase (e.g. egg whites) and stabilization (prevention of collapse) of the resulting [[foam]]s. In these systems, lactylates are added to decrease the interfacial tension between the mutually insoluble components providing stability to the mixture, referred to as a [[Colloid| colloidal suspension]].&lt;ref name = Bennett3/&gt;

===Non-food applications===
Lactylates are also widely used in non-food applications such as [[cosmetics]] or personal care products.&lt;ref name = Murphy1/&gt;&lt;ref name = Murphy2/&gt; In these applications, lactylates function as emulsifiers, conditioners, foam boosters, or plasticizers. These lactylates are typically manufactured from [[behenic acid]], [[isostearic acid]], or medium-chain fatty acids such as [[capric acid]], [[lauric acid]], and [[myristic acid]]. The lactylates may also be partially neutralized. For these applications, calcium salts are not typically used, since the resulting lactylates will not be as readily water dispersible as the sodium analog.&lt;ref name = Baiocchi/&gt;

Lactylated esters of fatty acids (LEFAs) manufactured using medium-chain fatty acids (e.g. capric or lauric acids) are [[microbicide]]s. A recent study indicated that the LEFA sodium lauroyl lactylate might be an effective [[antimicrobial]] against the [[gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive bacterium]] ''Clostridium perfringens''.&lt;ref name=Lensing&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lensing | first1=M | last2=van der Klis | first2=J.D. | last3=Fabri | first3=T | last4=Cazemier | first4=A | last5=Else | first5=A.J. | title=Efficacy of a lactylate on production performance and intestinal health of broilers during a subclinical ''Clostridium perfringens'' infection | journal=Poult Sci. | year=2010 | volume=89 | pages=2401–2409 | doi=10.3382/ps.2010-00942}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bacterium affects the digestive system of poultry, reducing the growth rate of the chickens thereby requiring more time to reach maturity. Antibiotics are often added to poultry feed to help prevent infection and maintain healthy growth. EU legislation&lt;ref name=EU&gt;{{cite journal | title = Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on Additives for Use in Animal Nutrition | journal = Official Journal of the European Union | date = 2003-10-18 | pages = L268/29–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; banned use of antibiotics for growth promotion on January 1, 2006.&lt;ref name = EUROPA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/05/1687&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN | title = EUROPA – Press Releases – Ban on antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed enters into effect | date = 22 December 2005 | work = EUROPA – The official website of the European Union | publisher = EUROPA | accessdate = 2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the industry is looking for viable alternatives.

Some lactylates also have the potential for being [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]], [[Renewable resource#Biomass|biorenewable]] replacements for certain petroleum-based surfactants, such as [[Ethoxylation|ethoxylated alcohols]]. Preliminary investigations also show that lactylates could be used in oil [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] or recovery applications.&lt;ref name=Sabatini&gt;{{citation | last1 = Sabatini | first1 = D.A. | last2=Knox | first2=R.C. | last3=Harwell | first3=J.H. | title = Surfactant-Enhanced DNAPL Remediation: Surfactant Selection, Hydraulic Efficiency, and Economic Factors | volume = Environmental Research Brief EPA/600/S-96/002 | date = August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental fate==
[[File:Environmental Fate of Lactylates.png|thumb|500px | alt = image of lactylate environmental fate | Lactylate Environmental Fate Pathway]]
A 2007 study done by Wildlife International, Ltd.&lt;ref name = Schaefer/&gt; determined a lactylate's ready biodegradability by the [[carbon dioxide]] evolution test method. The study was performed on a LEFA sodium salt produced from oleic acid and lactic acid. The test method determines if microbes, in this case activated sludge inoculum, can digest a test material, thereby returning the carbon-based material back into the environment as carbon dioxide to complete the [[carbon cycle]]. To meet or exceed the OECD Guideline 301B criteria for "readily biodegradable",&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{citation | last = Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development |  title = OECD Guideline 301B for Testing of Chemicals – Ready Biodegradability: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Evolution (Modified Sturm Test) | date = 17 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sample must produce 60% of the theoretical amount of carbon dioxide (TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) within a 10-day window of reaching 10% TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The LEFA used in the study had a final average cumulative percent biodegradation of 92.0% and the test solution had a pH of 7.1 at the end of the 28-day test. Therefore, the test material met the criteria to be considered readily biodegradable. In the presence of water, lactylates will break down ([[hydrolyze]]) into [[fatty acid]] and [[lactic acid]].&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt; Based on all available information, lactylates do not meet any hazard categories under [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act#Lists of Chemicals.28Section 301-304 and 311-313.29|SARA Title III, Sections 311–313]].&lt;ref name = EPA&gt;{{citation | last = EPA | title = Consolidated List of Chemicals Subject to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) and Section 112(1) of the Clean Air Act | volume = EPA 550-B-01-003 | date = Oct 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and safety==

===Overview===
Lactylates have been subjected to extensive safety evaluations prior to being [[Regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration#Food additives|FDA approved]] for use as food additives. The first safety evaluations were initiated by the C.J. Patterson Company in 1950. These [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[toxicology]] studies focused on Verv&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate. Data collected from eighteen separate investigations over eleven years were extensively reviewed by [[Physiology|physiologists]], [[Toxicology|toxicologists]], and [[statistician]]s. The results of these studies conclusively demonstrated lactylates to be non-toxic by ingestion leading to FDA approval in April 1961.&lt;ref name = Benniga/&gt; Research into the safety of lactylates has since continued, with the latest study being completed in 2010.&lt;ref name = Lamb/&gt; The results of each new study have confirmed the safety of lactylates.&lt;ref name = Lamb/&gt;&lt;ref name = Phillips&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Topp |first2 = C. | last3 = Gangolli | first3 = S.D. | title = Studies on the Metabolism of Calcium Stearoyl-2-Lactylate in the Rat, Mouse, Guinea-pig, and Man | journal = Food and Cosmetics Toxicology | volume = 19  | year = 1981 | pages = 7–11 | doi=10.1016/0015-6264(81)90296-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolism===
A 1961 ''[[in vitro]]'' study conducted by Hodge showed that [[lipase]] will hydrolyze lactylates into stearic acid and lactic acid.&lt;ref name = JECFA/&gt; A 1981 study&lt;ref name = Phillips/&gt; expanded this research by treating various tissue and biological fluid preparations with [[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]]-[[Isotopic labeling|labeled]] CSL, incubated at 37&amp;nbsp;°C (98.6&amp;nbsp;°F), and examined for lactylate hydrolysis. Assays used [[thin layer chromatography]] (TLC) with [[Radioactive tracer|radioactivity detection]] to determine the levels of intact CSL and lactate (lactic acid). &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled CSL was found to undergo rapid hydrolysis in homogenized rat, mouse, and guinea-pig liver and [[Intestinal mucosa#Mucosa|intestinal mucosa]], whereas CSL hydrolyzed much slower in rat and mice whole blood. In human duodenal mucosa, CSL rapidly hydrolyzed, while CSL showed no significant hydrolysis in human whole blood.

Two [[metabolism]] studies were conducted by Hodge in 1961.&lt;ref name = JECFA/&gt; The first showed that rats fed either SSL or CSL excreted only traces of lactate in [[Feces|fecal]] fat. The second study showed that 60% of the total &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C from &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled CSL was excreted as &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; within 24 hours when fed to rats. The results were found to be virtually identical (58%) to a physical mixture of stearic acid and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled lactic acid. A follow up study in mice and guinea-pigs was conducted in 1981 using &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled CSL and lactic acid. The authors concluded that [[excretion]] of both CSL and lactic acid followed a [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] pathway (excretion via CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) followed by excretion as [[urine]] and [[feces]]. Most of the excretion occurred within the first 7 hours of the study. Chromatography on the urine showed most of the radioactivity co-eluted with lactic acid, implying that CSL was hydrolyzed during metabolism.&lt;ref name = Phillips/&gt;

===Acute toxicity===
A 1952 study by Schuler and Thornton established the oral [[LD50]] of SSL in rats as over 25 g/kg body weight.&lt;ref name = JECFA/&gt;

===Chronic toxicity===
Several feeding studies were conducted on rats starting in the 1950s.&lt;ref name = JECFA/&gt; The researchers varied the test duration (27 days to 6 months), type of lactylate (CSL, SSL and [[#Lactylic esters of fatty acids|SLA]] ), and dose levels (0.5 to 25%) as well as number of rats and gender. A few of the studies compared lactylates to physical mixtures of lactate salts (sodium or calcium), stearic acid, and lactic acid. In most studies, the lactylate-fed rats were compared to control groups fed normal diets. The primary conclusions established the [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]] (NOAEL) for rats at 2%. Higher levels could produce growth retardation or increased relative liver weights, especially if the test diets had high levels of saturated fatty acids from lactylates or other fatty acid sources. Rats fed lactylates supplemented with a fat high in unsaturated fatty acids (achieving a desired 0.6 ratio saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio) had normal liver weights. If the test rats were switched back to a normal diet, growth rates recovered. These results established the [[acceptable daily intake]] (ADI) levels for CSL and SSL as 20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg bw/day.

Another feeding study was conducted on dogs.&lt;ref name = JECFA/&gt; The test group was fed 7.5% CSL for two years, and the results were compared to the results from a control group fed a regular diet. The test group showed no adverse effects and all test results were normal. When one dog was given 7.5% CSL for one month, 12.5% for two weeks, and 15% for another month, no changes were seen in the blood, organ weights or tissue appearance.

More recently, an investigation of the chronic toxicity of SSL was conducted on rats.&lt;ref name = Lamb/&gt; Four different levels (0%, 1.25%, 2.5%, and 5%) were fed to male and female Wistar WU rats over the course of a year. The results showed that SSL is well tolerated by the test rats at all dose levels. The authors recommended a revised NOAEL of 5% and an ADI of 22.1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg bw/day for human consumption.

===Contact dermatitis===
[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|180px |[[Patch test]]]]
One non-peer-reviewed case study was reported in 2005 by Danish doctors regarding a 61-year-old woman with a history of [[Contact dermatitis|contact allergies]]. [[Patch test]]s showed a strong positive reaction from a 5% SSL in [[petroleum jelly|petrolatum]] solution. The patch tests were extended to include 26 individuals with no history of allergies. These controls were administered a patch test of the same preparation. The test results showed 11 negative responses, 14 doubtful/probably irritant responses and only 1 mild positive response. The authors concluded that the original subject "belongs to a group of patients who have sensitive, labile skin that easily contract new allergies." Thus, the 61-year-old woman had apparently developed a sensitization towards SSL.&lt;ref name = Jensen&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = C.D. | last1 = Jensen | first2 = K.E. | last2 = Andersen | title = Allergic contact dermatitis from sodium stearoyl lactylate, an emulsifier commonly used in food products | journal = Contact Dermatitis | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | year = 2005 | pages= 116 | doi=10.1111/j.0105-1873.2005.0650c.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest application of CSL is in yeast leavened bakery products. Although CSL was introduced to the market first, most applications utilize [[#Sodium_stearoyl-2-lactylate|SSL]]. The main reason for the preference of SSL over CSL is that CSL has less crumb softening effects than SSL. However, CSL is still preferred in some applications, such as lean hearth bread type formulations. In these applications, CSL is preferred because CSL performs better than SSL as a dough strengthener, while the finished product does not require a soft crumb or a perfectly symmetrical loaf shape.&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt;

[[File:Effect of SSL on Bread Volume.png|thumb|500px | alt = The Effect of SSL on Bread Volume | The Effect of SSL on Bread Volume&lt;ref name = Tsen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsen | first1 = C.C. | last2 = Hoover | first2 = W.J. | title = High-Protein Bread from Wheat Flour Fortified with Full-Fat Soy Flour | journal = Cereal Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–16 | year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The largest marketed use of SSL is in [[yeast]]-raised bakery products. SSL is used in the majority of manufactured [[bread]]s, [[bun]]s, [[wrap (sandwich)|wrap]]s, [[tortilla]]s, and similar bread-based products to ensure consistent product quality. Use levels for baked goods will vary between 0.25 – 0.5% based on flour. The typical application level is 0.375% and will be adjusted depending on the type and quality of [[flour]] used.&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt;

Compared to [[#Calcium_stearoyl-2-lactylate|CSL]], SSL offers some advantages. First, SSL disperses and hydrates more readily in water than CSL. Therefore, SSL does not require pre-hydration. Second, SSL provides better crumb softening than CSL. SSL's crumb softening effect is noticeable up to 5–7 days after baking. Third, in rich bread formulations (e.g. pan bread and hamburger buns), SSL provides better dough strengthening than CSL. Use of SSL in these formulations will yield (nearly) perfect symmetry in the finished baked good. Because of these characteristics, SSL is currently used in more baking applications than CSL.&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt;

Research has explored the possibility of replacing SSL with the use of [[enzymes]]. Enzyme technologies, by themselves, have not been able to completely replace SSL. A major limitation of enzymes is the production of gummy bread of unpredictable quality. Also, enzymes often do not augment dough strength, which is necessary to prevent loaf collapse during baking. Currently, enzymes are being used in conjunction with SSL to maximize the shelf life of bread. SSL is very good at increasing softness of bread during the first week after baking. Enzyme technology works best after the first 5 days of shelf life. Therefore, bread with optimal softness throughout the desired shelf life is obtained by using a combination of these technologies.&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt;

===Lactylic esters of fatty acids===

====Overview====
Lactylic esters of fatty acids (LEFA) are versatile additives used in foods, cosmetics, and packagings.&lt;ref name = Ash/&gt;&lt;ref name = CFR-LEFA&gt;{{citation | title = Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, part 172 | chapter =  Lactylic esters of fatty acids | date = January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEFAs are [[Toxicity|non-toxic]],&lt;ref name = JECFA/&gt;&lt;ref name = Lamb/&gt; [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]],&lt;ref name = Schaefer/&gt; and typically manufactured using [[Renewable resource|biorenewable]] [[Raw material|feedstocks]].&lt;ref name = Markley/&gt;&lt;ref name = Baniel/&gt;

As described by the [[Food Chemicals Codex]] 7th edition, LEFAs occur as liquids to hard, waxy solids.&lt;ref name = FCC-LEFA/&gt; They are mixed fatty acid esters of lactic acid and its polymers, with minor quantities of free lactic acid, [[poly(lactic acid)]], and fatty acids. They are dispersible in hot water and are soluble in organic solvents, such as vegetable oils.

The following table contains useful information for commercially available LEFAs.&lt;ref name = CFR-CSL2/&gt;&lt;ref name = Ash/&gt;&lt;ref name = Baiocchi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lensing/&gt;&lt;ref name = CFR-LEFA/&gt;&lt;ref name = Australia&gt;{{citation | title= National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme|url=http://www.nicnas.gov.au| place = Australia | date = Apr 10, 2002 | volume = File No: LTD 1001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Ash2&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Food Additives | edition = 2 | last1 = Ash | first1 = M. | last2 = Ash | first2 = I. | publisher = Synapse Information Resources | year = 2002 | place = Endicott, NY | pages= 382, 717, 731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food labeling requirements====
The [[Food Chemicals Codex]] considers LEFAs to be a general lactylate category for those lactylate products that do not conform to the specifications of either [[#Calcium_stearoyl-2-lactylate|CSL]] or [[#Sodium_stearoyl-2-lactylate|SSL]]. As such, the FCC only requires that LEFAs conform to the specifications established by the vendor.&lt;ref name = FCC-LEFA/&gt; The composition of the LEFAs will vary depending on the types of fatty acids used, the ratios of the fatty acids to lactic acid, the degree of neutralization, and the nature of the base(s) used for neutralization (if applicable). As of 2004, there was no corresponding legislation in the EU.&lt;ref name = Boutte/&gt;

====Food applications and maximum use levels====
In the United States, LEFA food applications are covered by 21 CFR 172.848. Permitted maximum use levels are limited to the levels necessary to achieve the intended physical or technical effect. Applications include: [[Baking|baked goods]] and mixes, [[pancake| pancake mixes]], [[cake]] [[Icing (food)|icings]], [[Buttercream|fillings]], and [[Cake#Cake decorating|toppings]], [[Dried fruit|dehydrated fruits]] and [[Frozen vegetables|vegetables]], [[Non-dairy creamer|creamers]], [[frozen dessert]]s, [[Shortening|liquid shortenings]], precooked [[instant rice]], and [[Pudding| pudding mixes]].&lt;ref name = CFR-LEFA/&gt;

'''Macaco Tião''' ("Tião the Monkey") (January 16, 1963 in [[Rio de Janeiro]] – December 23, 1996 in Rio de Janeiro) was a [[chimpanzee]] of the Rio Janeiro Zoo who was very popular with children and visitors.&lt;ref name="riozoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rio.rj.gov.br/riozoo/tiao.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506004446/http://rio.rj.gov.br/riozoo/tiao.htm |archivedate=2006-05-06 |title=Macaco Tião, 32 anos de preferência nacional |author=Rio Zoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="estadão1994"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/ext/diariodopassado/20040116/000205438.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310230616/http://www.estadao.com.br/ext/diariodopassado/20040116/000205438.htm|archivedate=2007-03-10|date=16 January 1994|accessdate=2016-03-10|title=Mau humorado, macaco Tião completa 31 anos|author=Estadão}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="estadão2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/ultimas/cidades/noticias/2005/mar/18/75.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310230746/http://www.estadao.com.br/ultimas/cidades/noticias/2005/mar/18/75.htm|archivedate=2007-03-10|date=18 March 2005|accessdate=2016-03-10|title=Zoológico do Rio completa 60 anos nesta sexta|author=Estadão}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His name ("Tião") is in memory of Rio de Janeiro's [[patron saint]], [[Saint Sebastian|São Sebastião]]. He was {{convert|1.52|m|ftin}} tall and weighed {{convert|70|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="riozoo"/&gt;

==History==
Tião started to become popular in the 1980s for his temperament, regarded as constant "bad mood" and having the habit of throwing mud and feces on the visitors of the zoo, especially politicians such as [[Marcello Alencar]].&lt;ref name="estadão1994"/&gt;

Tião became a celebrity in [[Brazil]], when in 1988, a magazine, ''[[Casseta Popular]]'', jokingly created his extra official candidature for mayor as a protest in defence of [[null vote|null voting]]. At the time, voting was written on papers instead of registered using [[Electronic voting|voting machines]]. It is estimated that more than 400,000 ballots were cast for him, and he reached third place in an election with 12 candidates. Because of that, he is now on the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most voted chimpanzee in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2008/11/081104.aspx|title=Most Votes For A Chimpazee|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|date=November 4, 2008|accessdate=2010-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126014306/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2008/11/081104.aspx#|archive-date=2010-01-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Tião was not a registered candidate, all his ballots were considered as null. In 1996, the [[Elections in Brazil|voting system in Brazil]] was changed to electronic machines, so votes could no longer be cast for non-registered candidates.

Macaco Tião had always attracted enormous attention and had a special place in the zoo, built especially for him.&lt;ref name="riozoo"/&gt;

Nationally famous, lots of different Brazilian newspapers and the French ''[[Le Monde]]'' registered the news about his death,&lt;ref name="riozoo"/&gt; in December, 23 of 1996. Tião died of [[diabetes]] at the age of 34. The city of Rio de Janeiro declared official mourning of three days, with the flags of Rio de Janeiro's Zoo being flown at half-staff.&lt;ref name="riozoo"/&gt; His body was taken to the primate center of the state of Rio de Janeiro ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160405160523/http://www.inea.rj.gov.br/fma/centro-primatologia.asp Centro de Primatologia do Estado do Rio de Janeiro - CPRJ]), in the [[Guapimirim]] city, where his skeleton is preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guapimirimonline.com/historia.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117050754/http://guapimirimonline.com/historia.php# |archive-date=2016-11-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Malinta Tunnel''' is a tunnel complex built by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] on the island of [[Corregidor]] in the [[Philippines]]. It was initially used as a bomb-proof storage and personnel bunker, but was later equipped as a 1,000-bed hospital.&lt;ref name="cidotcom"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Corregidor:Malinta Tunnel | url=http://www.corregidorisland.com/malinta.html | accessdate = 14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main tunnel, running east to west, is {{convert|831|ft|m}} long, {{convert|24|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|18|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Whitman | first =Paul | title = Corregidor Then and Now: A Battlefield Revisited | url=http://www.corregidor.org/chs_revisit/revisit.html | accessdate = 14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branching off from this main shaft are 13 lateral tunnels on the north side and 11 lateral tunnels on the south side. Each lateral averaged {{convert|160|ft|m}} in length and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in width.&lt;ref name="cidotcom"/&gt;

==Name==
The Malinta Tunnel derives its name from Malinta Hill, a {{convert|390|ft|m|sing=on}} rise through which its shaft is bored. ''Malinta'' is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "many leeches",&lt;ref name="McCallus"&gt; {{cite book|last=McCallus|first=Joseph|title=The MacArthur Highway and Other Relics of American Empire in the Philippines|date=2010|publisher=Potomac Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''linta'' being the local word for "[[leech]]".

==Construction==
Its construction, without benefit of new equipment or funds apportioned by the [[United States Congress]] due to agreements reached during the [[Washington Naval Conference]],&lt;ref name=LeanYears_Strong&gt;{{cite web | last = Strong | first = Paschal N. | title = The Lean Years | url=http://corregidor.org/chs_lean_years/leanyear_01.htm | accessdate = 13 March 2018

The Army Corps of Engineers rented obsolete equipment from [[Baguio]] gold miners for a nominal fee and made do with condemned [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] from the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Department]]. The explosive delivered was in powder form, and had to be wrapped into makeshift cartridges using magazine pages, which were placed into holes drilled into the rock.&lt;ref name=LeanYears_Strong/&gt; Labor was provided by the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] in the form of 1,000 convicts from the [[Bilibid Prison]] in [[Manila]]. A company of engineers from the [[Philippine Scouts]] worked on the construction as [[Construction foreman|foremen]] and clerks.&lt;ref name=LeanYears2_Strong&gt;{{cite web

==Battle of Corregidor==
During the [[Battle of Corregidor]], the third lateral on the north side from the east entrance served as the headquarters of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and the [[U.S. Army Forces Far East|USAFFE]]. Malinta Tunnel also served as the seat of government of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. At the vicinity of the tunnel's west entrance in the afternoon of 30 December 1941, [[Manuel L. Quezon]] and [[Sergio Osmeña]] took their oaths of office as President and Vice-president of the Philippine Commonwealth in simple ceremonies attended by members of the garrison.&lt;ref name="cidotcom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="showcaves"/&gt;

[[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] troops forced the surrender of the remaining American and Filipino forces on 6 May 1942 while under the command of [[Lieutenant General|Lt. Gen.]] [[Jonathan M. Wainwright (general)|Jonathan Wainwright]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Louis. [http://corregidor.org/chs_army/morton_04.htm "The Fall of Corregidor"]. Corregidor.org. Retrieved on 29 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retaking of Corregidor==
During the [[Battle of Corregidor (1945)|re-taking of the island]] by U.S. forces in 1945, Japanese soldiers who had been trapped in the tunnel after the entrance was blocked as a result of gunfire from {{USS|Converse|DD-509}} began committing suicide by detonating explosives within the tunnel complex the night of 23 February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =United States Coast Artillery of Manila and Subic Bay, 1941: Malinta | url=http://www.corregidor.org/chs_battery1/malinta1.htm | accessdate = 14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapsed laterals resulting from these explosions have never been excavated.

==Today==
Today, Malinta Tunnel is the venue of an audio-visual presentation by National Artist [[Lamberto V. Avellana]] of events that occurred during [[World War II]], including the evacuation of President Quezon and General MacArthur by [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three]] from Corregidor to [[Mindanao]]. They were later flown to Australia. Quezon ran a [[government in exile]] in the United States during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Philippines Travel Guide: Corregidor Island

'''Meibion Glyndŵr''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈməibjɔn ɡlɨnˈduːr}}, '''Sons of [[Owain Glyndŵr|Glyndŵr]]''') was a [[Welsh nationalist]] movement violently opposed to the loss of [[Welsh culture]] and [[Welsh language|language]]. They were formed in response to the housing crisis precipitated by large numbers of houses being bought by wealthy [[England|English]] people for use as [[holiday home]]s, pushing up house prices beyond the means of many locals. They were responsible for setting fire to English-owned holiday homes in [[Wales]] from 1979 to the mid-1990s.

== History ==
The group first came to prominence in 1979. In the first wave of attacks, eight English-owned holiday homes were destroyed within the space of a month. In 1980 Welsh Police carried out a series of raids in [[Operation Tân]] in an effort to find the culprits. Within the next ten years around 220 properties were damaged by the campaign.&lt;ref name="BBC2004"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4084013.stm MP's theory over cottage burnings], BBC News, 10 December 2004. Accessed 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It peaked in the late 1980s with the targeting of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs' homes and [[David Hunt, Baron Hunt of Wirral|David Hunt]], the then [[Welsh secretary]], was a target in 1990.

Responsibility for the bombings had been taken by four separate movements: [[Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru]] ("the movement to defend Wales"), [[Cadwyr Cymru]] ("the keepers of Wales"), Meibion Glyndŵr, and the [[Welsh Army for the Workers Republic]] (WAWR), whose attacks were on political targets in the early 1980s.  Meibion Glyndŵr was the only group to have any claim to long-term success, although since the mid-1990s the group has been inactive, and Welsh nationalist violence has ceased, at least on an organisational level. Letters claiming responsibility for attacks were signed "[[Rhys Gethin]]", in homage to one of Owain Glyndŵr's most prominent followers.

A reinvestigation into [[postal bomb]]ings led to the conviction of [[Sion Aubrey Roberts]] in 1993. A [[Plaid Cymru]] [[member of parliament]], [[Elfyn Llwyd]], speculated that the group was an [[MI5]] front.&lt;ref name="BBC2004" /&gt;

== Activities ==
* 1979–94: Meibion Glyndŵr fire-bomb around 220 English-owned homes.
* 1988–89: Meibion Glyndŵr declared that "every white settler is a target". The group also placed incendiary bombs in Conservative party offices in [[London]] and estate agents' offices in London, [[Liverpool]], [[Sutton Coldfield]], [[Haverfordwest]], [[Carmarthen]] and [[Llandeilo]].
* 1990: Poet and priest [[R. S. Thomas]] calls for a campaign to deface English-owned homes.
* 1993: Sion Aubrey Roberts, a member of Meibion Glyndŵr, was jailed for twelve years for sending letter bombs to Conservative politicians.

'''General elections''' were held in [[Mexico]] on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senado.gob.mx/consultoria/calendario-electoral.php Electoral Calendar] Senate of the Republic (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Voters elected a new [[President of Mexico]] to serve a term  of five years and ten months (reduced by two months from the constitutional mandate due to a change in the inauguration date as of 2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/23-04-2018/3410806 |title=Más allá del debate: corrupción y violencia sin control marcan agenda en la elección mexicana |author=Redacción| date=23 April 2018 |publisher=Sin Embargo |access-date=1 July 2018 |quote="Seis candidatos a la carrera para ocupar Los Pinos a partir del próximo primero de diciembre por un período de cinco años y 10 meses.

It was one of the largest election days in Mexican history, with most of the nation's states  holding state and local elections on the same day, including nine governorships, with over 3,400 positions subject to elections at all levels of government.&lt;ref name = "ABC-Sveen-2018-07-02" /&gt;  It was the most violent campaign Mexico has experienced in recent history, with 130 political figures killed since September 2017.&lt;ref name = "ABC-Sveen-2018-07-02" /&gt;

The incumbent president [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] was not [[Sexenio (Mexico)|constitutionally]] eligible for a second term. Incumbent members of the legislature are term-limited, thus all members of Congress will be newly elected. As a consequence of the political reform of 2014, the members of the legislature elected in this election will be the first allowed to run for reelection in subsequent elections. The [[National Electoral Institute]] (INE) officially declared the new process underway on 8 September 2017.

The presidential election was won by [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] of the [[National Regeneration Movement]] (MORENA), running as the candidate of the ''[[Juntos Haremos Historia]]'' alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico election: López Obrador vows profound change after win |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44677829 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |agency=BBC News |date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first time a candidate won an outright majority (according to official vote counts) since [[Mexican general election, 1988|1988]],&lt;ref name="ReutersMurray"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexican Lopez Obrador wins historic election landslide for left|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-election/mexican-lopez-obrador-wins-historic-election-landslide-for-left-idUSKBN1JR15F|agency=Reuters|first=Christine|last=Murray|first2=Diego|last2=Oré|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first time that a candidate not from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) or its predecessors has done so since the [[Mexican Revolution]]. This election also marked both the worst electoral defeat suffered by the PRI and the worst electoral defeat for a sitting Mexican government since [[universal suffrage]] was adopted in the country in 1917.{{efn|Universal male suffrage was adopted in 1917, while women acquired the right to vote in Federal elections in 1953.}}

The 128 members of the Senate are elected to six-year terms, concurrent with the president, and also elected by two methods, with 96 elected in 32 three-member constituencies based on the [[States of Mexico|states]] and 32 elected in a single nationwide constituency by [[proportional representation]].

On 9 August 2017, the PRI revised its requirements for presidential candidates, eliminating the requirement that candidates must have 10 years of party membership, and allowing non-party members to lead the party.&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stargardter|first=Gabriel|title=Mexico ruling party's reform strengthens president ahead of 2018 vote|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-politics-analysis/mexico-ruling-partys-reform-strengthens-president-ahead-of-2018-vote-idUSKBN1AR04T|date=10 August 2017|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This move benefited finance secretary [[José Antonio Meade Kuribreña]], who is not a member of the PRI,&lt;ref&gt;

On 27 November, Meade resigned from cabinet and announced his intention to be the PRI's candidate in the upcoming election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevenson |first=Mark |title=Mexico Treasury Secretary announces presidential bid |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-bc-lt--mexico-politics-20171127-story.html |website=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=8 June 2018 |date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly received the support of President Peña Nieto and PRI-linked institutions such as the CTM union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Agren |first=David |title=Mexico is a democracy, but the ghosts of one-party rule live on |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/27/mexico-is-a-democracy-but-the-ghosts-of-one-party-rule-live-on/?noredirect=on |date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no challengers, Meade became the presumptive nominee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miranda|first=Kevin|title=José Antonio Meade, oficial precandidato del PRI para 2018|url=https://www.debate.com.mx/politica/Jose-Antonio-Meade-oficial-precandidato-del-PRI-para-2018-20171203-0047.html|website=El Debate|date=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February 2018, the PRI held its convention of delegates, where Meade was formally selected as the party's presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico Picks its Presidential Candidates, AMLO in the Lead |url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Mexico-Picks-its-Presidential-Candidates-AMLO-in-the-Lead-20180218-0018.html|website=Telesur|date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meade is the PRI's first presidential candidate in its almost 90-year history not to be a member of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico's presidential campaign takes shape, with 3 candidates formally accepting party nominations |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-mexico-candidates-20180218-story.html |agency=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=¿Quién es José Antonio Meade?

Due to the circumstances of Meade's candidacy, critics compared his selection to the PRI's historical practice of ''dedazo'' ("tap of the finger"), where presidents hand-picked their successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/11/30/jose-antonio-meade-is-the-pris-candidate-for-mexicos-presidency |title= José Antonio Meade is the PRI’s candidate for Mexico’s presidency |work= [[The Economist]] |date= 30 November 2017 |accessdate= 7 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramos |first=Jorge |url= https://splinternews.com/el-dedazo-makes-a-comeback-in-mexico-1821012490 |title= ‘El Dedazo’ Makes a Comeback in Mexico |work= Splinter |date= 5 December 2017 |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coalition was initially named ''Meade Ciudadano por México'' (English: Citizen Meade for Mexico), until the INE deemed it unconstitutional to include a candidate's name within the coalition's name, on the grounds that the presidential candidate would receive advertising from every piece of campaign advertising of the coalition used for local candidates. The coalition subsequently changed its name to ''Todos por México'' (Everyone for Mexico).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/avanza-en-ine-reves-al-nombre-de-coalicion-de-meade.html|title=INE perfila quitar el nombre de Meade a la coalición del PRI|website=www.elfinanciero.com.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] registered as the presumptive nominee for MORENA and submitted his resignation as party president. This is López Obrador's third presidential bid; the previous two attempts were with the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution|PRD]]. After the 2012 presidential election, López Obrador left the PRD to found MORENA. This is MORENA's first presidential election. Joining MORENA in the ''Juntos Haremos Historia'' coalition is the left-wing Labor Party and the right-wing Social Encounter Party.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Margarita Zavala]], a lawyer, former deputy and wife of former president [[Felipe Calderón]], had originally intended to run as the PAN nominee; however, on 6 October, she left the party and launched an independent bid. Explaining her decision, she said that the formation of ''Por México al Frente'' meant there would be no internal PAN selection, denying her a chance to be a candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-politics/mexico-ex-first-lady-leaves-opposition-party-for-presidency-bid-idUSKBN1CB2W3|first=Dave|last=Graham|date=6 October 2017|title=Mexico ex-first lady leaves opposition party for presidency bid|agency=Reuters|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jaime Rodríguez Calderón]], the independent governor of [[Nuevo León]], also announced his candidacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/19/el-bronco-mexicos-most-successful-independent-sets-sights-on-2018-presidency.html|first=Jan-Albert|last=Hootsen|date=16 October 2016|title='El Bronco,' Mexico’s most successful independent, sets sight on 2018 presidency|work=Fox News|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did Senator [[Armando Ríos Piter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/Voy-independiente-pero-no-solo-Rios-Piter-20170521-0061.html|first=Diego|last=Badillo|date=21 May 2017|title=Voy independiente pero no solo: Ríos Piter|work=El Economista|accessdate=8 February 2018 |deadurl=no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063719/https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/Voy-independiente-pero-no-solo-Rios-Piter-20170521-0061.html| archivedate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
===Timeline===

====January====
As in the [[Mexican general election, 2006|2006]] and [[Mexican general election, 2012|2012]] federal elections, the 2018 campaign featured numerous accusations and [[attack ad]]vertisements directed at the leftist frontrunner candidate [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]], who contested the elections with the support of his party [[National Regeneration Movement|MORENA]]. A [[Red Scare]]-like campaign was used by the PRI and PAN candidates to convince voters that a López Obrador victory would turn Mexico into "another Venezuela".&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news|url=https://www.periodismonegro.mx/2018/01/19/la-campana-del-miedo-contra-amlo/|work=Periodismo Negro|date=19 January 2018|title=La campaña del miedo contra López Obrador|language=Spanish|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yucatan.com.mx/editorial/las-campanas-del-miedo|work=Diario de Yucatán|date=11 January 2018|title=Las Campañas del miedo|language=Spanish|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech, PRI president {{ill|Enrique Ochoa Reza|es}} said that "if the people from MORENA like Venezuela so much, they should just go and live there".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/si-a-los-de-morena-les-gusta-venezuela-que-se-vayan-a-vivir-alla-ochoa.html|work=Periodismo Negro|date=15 November 2017|title=Si a los de Morena les gusta Venezuela, que se vayan a vivir allá: Ochoa|language=Spanish|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRI was believed to have hired [[Venezuela]]n [[right-wing]] political strategist [[JJ Rendón]] to work in their campaign, as he stated in January that he would do "everything within the law to prevent López Obrador from becoming President"; Rendón had previously worked for the PRI during [[Enrique Peña Nieto|Peña Nieto's]] 2012 presidential campaign.&lt;ref name="Aristegui Noticias"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aristeguinoticias.com/1401/mexico/pri-se-desmarca-del-publicista-jj-rendon-amlo-pide-evitar-violencia-politica/|work=Aristegui Noticias|date=14 January 2018|title=PRI se desmarca del publicista JJ Rendón; López Obrador pide evitar violencia política|language=Spanish|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, former president [[Felipe Calderón]] shared a video on via social media, in which a Venezuelan citizen living in Mexico warned voters not to vote for López Obrador, as he would put Mexico in the "path to ruin" like [[Chavismo]] had done in her country. It later surfaced that the woman, whose name is Carmen Martilez, is an actress who previously had uploaded a video in which she asked for street vendors to be "exterminated".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/19-01-2018/3375593|work=Sin Embargo|date=19 January 2018|title="Venezolana" que llora y pide no votar por López Obrador, también quiere exterminar vendedores en CdMx|language=Spanish|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, the PRI began to claim that López Obrador's campaign was supported by "Venezuelan and Russian interests". López Obrador dismissed the accusations and later joked about them, calling himself "Andrés Manuelovich".&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-politics/andres-manuelovich-mexican-leftist-laughs-off-russia-election-jabs-idUSKBN1F735X|title='Andres Manuelovich': Mexican leftist laughs off Russia election jabs|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|agency=Reuters|accessdate=9 April 2018}}

Later in January, citizens across the country received phone calls originating in the city of [[Puebla City|Puebla]], in which a recorded message warned them not to vote for López Obrador because he supposedly agreed to sell Mexico's oil to "the Russians". The [[Movimiento de Regeneración Nacional|MORENA]] representative in Puebla asked for an investigation into the phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/520563/arman-campana-contra-amlo-en-puebla-los-rusos-vienen-quitarnos-nuestro-petroleo-dicen-en-llamadas|work=Proceso|date=31 January 2018|title=Arman campaña contra López Obrador en Puebla; "los rusos vienen a quitarnos nuestro petróleo", dicen en llamadas|language=Spanish|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elsoldepuebla.com.mx/local/pediran-que-se-investiguen-llamadas-telefonicas-contra-amlo|work=El Sol de Puebla|date=31 January 2018|title=Pedirán que se investiguen llamadas telefónicas contra López Obrador|language=Spanish|accessdate=31 January 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In March, telephone company [[Axtel]] traced the number that made the calls, revealing it was a number that the government of Puebla (whose governor is from the PAN) controlled. Puebla's government denied the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aristeguinoticias.com/1303/mexico/gobierno-de-puebla-contrato-linea-telefonica-desde-donde-se-ataco-a-amlo-contrato-ya-vencio-responde/|title=Gobierno de Puebla contrató línea telefónica desde donde se atacó a López Obrador; contrato ya venció, responde - Aristegui Noticias|website=aristeguinoticias.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Also in January, López Obrador uploaded a video via social media asking president Peña Nieto and PRI president Ochoa Reza to "calm down", and advised them to take some "[[Amlodipine|López Obradordipine]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news|url=https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/amlodipino-is-for-whatever-ails-epn/|work=Mexico News Daily|date=18 January 2018|title=Amlodipino is for whatever ails Peña Nieto|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[jingle]] entitled ''Movimiento Naranja'', which was recorded for the political party [[Movimiento Ciudadano|''Movimiento Ciudadano'']] (which is part of the ''Por México al Frente'' coalition, along with the PAN and the PRD) and performed by an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] child called Yuawi, became [[Viral video|viral]] and Yuawi turned into a celebrity overnight.&lt;ref&gt;

Drawing on its success, the pre-candidate for the Frente, [[Ricardo Anaya Cortés|Ricardo Anaya]] recorded a video in which he performed the song with Yuawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.milenio.com/elecciones-mexico-2018/yuawi-ricardo-anaya-presidente-pan-por-mexico-al-frente-movimiento-ciudadano_0_1108689458.html|work=Milenio|date=23 January 2018|title=Yuawi y Anaya se avientan un "palomazo"|language=Spanish|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PRI candidate [[José Antonio Meade Kuribreña|José Antonio Meade]] was accused of [[plagiarism]] when it was noted that one of his ads, in which he criticized a "populist" speech on TV, was identical to an ad that was used by [[Justin Trudeau]] when he became leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sdpnoticias.com/nacional/2018/01/18/destacan-parecido-estilo-en-spot-de-meade-a-uno-de-trudeau|work=SDP Noticias|date=18 January 2018|title=Destacan parecido estilo en spot de Meade a uno de Trudeau|language=Spanish|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====February====
Later in February, the PRI's [[Enrique Ochoa Reza]] tweeted that PRI politicians who defected to MORENA as ''Prietos que no aprietan'' (Dark-skinned people who can't get a hold) while trying to make a pun on the word PRI-etos (because ''morena'' is a synonym for ''prieto'').  The expression was criticized, and Ochoa Reza quickly deleted the tweet as it was interpreted to be racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://regeneracion.mx/otra-de-ochoa-reza-llama-prietos-a-seguidores-de-amlo-lo-acusan-de-racista/|title=Otra de Ochoa Reza: llama 'prietos' a seguidores de López Obrador; lo acusan de racista|date=10 February 2018|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aristegui Noticias'' published that Ochoa Reza apologized, and also criticized the insensitive expression, additionally commenting that the part ''que ya no aprietan'' (who cannot hold) could also be interpreted as misogynistic due to being a [[double entendre]] referring to women in relation to the number of sexual relations they have had in their lifetime. Ochoa Reza's tweet apologized to dark-skinned people but not to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aristeguinoticias.com/1102/mexico/ochoa-reza-arremete-contra-prietos-que-dejan-el-pri-lo-llaman-racista-y-se-disculpa/|title=Ochoa Reza arremete contra "prietos" que dejan el PRI; lo tachan de racista y se disculpa - Aristegui Noticias|website=aristeguinoticias.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later ''Sinembargo.mx'' revealed that José Antonio Meade justified Enrique Ochoa's usage of the expression, by saying: ''uno se excede y es natural'' (English: one gets-ahead-of-themselves and it is natural) and saying that his quick apology talked positively about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/12-02-2018/3384628|title=Meade justifica a Ochoa Reza: el comentario fue “un exceso”, dice, pero “uno se excede y es natural”|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====March====
In March, the [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General of the Republic]] (PGR) started an official investigation into money-laundering  allegations against Ricardo Anaya.  During the investigation, Santiago Nieto, the ex-chief of FEPADE (the prosecutor's office that focuses on electoral violations) was controversially removed from his job in October 2017, coincidentally right after starting an investigation regarding illicit campaign money from the 2012 presidential campaign that allegedly was received by Peña Nieto and by the future president of [[Pemex]], [[Emilio Lozoya]], from the Brazilian conglomerate [[Odebrecht]].  
The ex-chief of FEPADE said that the accusations against Anaya were minor in comparison to Odebretch and Peña Nieto scandal, adding also the same opinion about the money lost by [[Secretariat of Social Development]], to corrupt governors from the PRI such as [[Javier Duarte]], all while José Antonio Meade was the man in charge of the Secretariat of Social Development. The scandal is known as ''La Estafa Maestra'' (The Master Robbery), and about 435 million pesos were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/01/robles-meade-estafa-maestra-sedesol/|title=Con Robles y Meade hubo desvíos al estilo Estafa Maestra por 540 mdp en Sedesol, revela Auditoría|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same week the PRI legislators were criticized for voting for stopping the investigation of Odebretch against the wishes of Mexican people and organizations campaigning against corruption such as ''Mexicanos contra la corrupción'' (Mexicans against corruption).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/internacional/2018/03/07/actualidad/1520390316_791182.html|title=El PRI bloquea en el Congreso una investigación del ‘caso Odebrecht’|first=D. M.|last=Pérez|date=8 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2018|via=elpais.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation about Odebretch against the  [[Pemex]] leader at the time, Lozoya, was legally stopped after a judge controversially ordered it days after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.culturacolectiva.com/noticias/jueza-suspende-investigacion-contra-lozoya-por-tiempo-indefinido/|title=Caso Odebrecht deja detenidos en todo el mundo, menos en México|date=2 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santiago Nieto said that the PGR was being used by Peña Nieto's government to tamper with elections and benefit Meade by removing Anaya from the race, complaining that it was a politically motivated use of  law-enforcement agencies, which had made more efforts to investigate Anaya in a month than towards investigating Peña Nieto's Odebretch money and Meade's lost Secretariat of Social Development funds over the last six years.  Santiago Nieto said the PGR and FEPADE were only attacking the rivals of the PRI, and  the investigating organizations were not being neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aristeguinoticias.com/0203/mexico/por-menos-que-lo-que-ha-hecho-la-pgr-contra-anaya-me-removieron-a-mi-santiago-nieto/|title=Por menos que lo que ha hecho la PGR contra Anaya, me removieron a mí: Santiago Nieto - Aristegui Noticias|website=aristeguinoticias.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Santiago Nieto would later reveal that Peña Nieto's government tried to bribe him to keep him silent, which he refused saying, "Sorry, but I can't receive any money from Peña Nieto." He received menacing phone messages stating: "Death follows you" and "Words of advice: stay out of Trouble", and as a consequence, he  feared for the safety of his, and his family's lives.&lt;ref&gt;

Additionally as of 2018, it should be noted, that many of the politicians of the PRI political party who supported Peña Nieto during his presidential campaign would be later declared criminals by the Mexican government (some already elected, while others were campaigning concurrently with Peña Nieto, and would be elected),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2017/04/17/1158092|title=Corrupción envuelve a 11 exgobernadores|date=17 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/world/americas/in-mexico-mounting-misdeeds-but-governors-escape-justice.html|title=En México se acumulan los gobernadores corruptos, e impunes|first=Elisabeth|last=Malkin|date=19 April 2017|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A total of 22 state ex-governors, all members from the PRI, were accused of misuse of public funds and misdirection of money (with some money speculated to have been directed to the PRI); only five were sent to jail, with PGR receiving criticism for not investigating further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/22-04-2017/3196138|title=Son 22 gobernadores del PRI los acusados de desvíos con EPN; el monto en duda: 258 mil millones|first=Dulce|last=Olvera|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most prominent criminals were: [[Tomás Yarrington]] from [[Tamaulipas]] (along his predecessor [[Eugenio Hernández Flores]]), [[Javier Duarte]] from [[Veracruz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-duarte-20170717-story.html|title=Former governor of Mexico's Veracruz state extradited from Guatemala to face corruption charges|first=Patrick J.|last=McDonnell|date=17 July 2017|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[César Duarte Jáquez]] from [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/mexico/2017/03/30/mexico-ex-gov-flees-texas-evade-corruption-allegations|title=Mexico: Ex-governor flees to Texas to evade corruption allegations | work = Dallas News |date=30 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (no family relation between the two Duartes), and [[Roberto Borge]] from [[Quintana Roo]], along their unknown multiple allies who enabled their corruption.  Although Peña Nieto was not found to be their ally, by being part of the same political party, there were severely negative consequences to Peña Nieto's image as president, as well as  of the PRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/nacion/seguridad/2017/06/5/pgr-e-interpol-capturan-roberto-borge-en-panama|title=PGR e Interpol capturan a Roberto Borge en Panamá|date=5 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, while not a member of the PRI at the time, Meade's image also received damage, because much of the money was lost while he was in charge of the Secretariat of Social Development, the government ministry that supervises the resources received by each state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/523906/los-desvios-que-meade-no-vio-en-sedesol|title=Los desvíos que Meade no vio en Sedesol - Proceso|date=24 February 2018|website=Proceso.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the overwhelming evidence against César Duarte, in March 2018 the PGR found him innocent of any crime. The successor governor Javier Corral from the PAN, who previously fought against the [[Televisa|Televisa law]], gave a similar opinion to Santiago Nieto, saying the PGR was being used to protect the allies of Peña Nieto and the PRI, and attack their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/articulo/default.aspx?id=1346330&amp;v=5&amp;md5=2f59936ad96e8f39cfeaa31398842aa7&amp;ta=0dfdbac11765226904c16cb9ad1b2efe | title=Perdonan a Duarte; es cinismo.- Corral|website=Reforma.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
López Obrador said that failure to take action against Duarte was one of the main reasons why Mexicans had lost their faith in the PRI, saying the few ex-governors that were declared criminals were only to a pretense of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/526180/por-acciones-como-no-proceder-contra-cesar-duarte-la-gente-ya-no-le-cree-al-pri-amlo|title=Por acciones como no proceder contra César Duarte, la gente ya no le cree al PRI: López Obrador - Proceso|date=14 March 2018|website=Proceso.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====April and May====
After, Meade decided to change his strategy; and due to his poor reception, Ochoa Reza left his position as president of the PRI on 2 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.proceso.com.mx/532502/con-meade-en-la-lona-ochoa-reza-deja-la-presidencia-del-pri-entra-al-relevo-juarez-cisneros|title=Con Meade en la lona, Ochoa Reza deja la presidencia del PRI; entra al relevo Juárez Cisneros - Proceso|date=2 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 16 May, Margarita Zavala suspended her presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://expansion.mx/nacional/2018/05/16/margarita-zavala-renuncia-a-su-candidatura |title=Margarita Zavala renuncia a su candidatura |language=Spanish |date=16 May 2018 |accessdate=16 May 2018 |newspaper=Expansión}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Santiago Nieto]] decided to join AMLO's campaign, with both promising to continue the investigation into the alleged scandal involving Peña Nieto, the PRI and Odebretch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/santiago-nieto-se-suma-a-campana-de-amlo/1240456|title=Santiago Nieto se suma a campaña de AMLO|date=22 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, [[César Duarte]] disappeared before being incarcerated, and was subsequently declared a fugitive from justice by the PGR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/aseguran-4-ranchos-a-cesar-duarte-en-belleza-chihuahua/1241605|title=Aseguran 4 ranchos a César Duarte en Belleza, Chihuahua|date=28 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 130 political figures were killed from when the campaign began in September 2017 until July 2018.&lt;ref name = "ABC-Sveen-2018-07-02"&gt; {{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-02/mexico-elections-what-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-victory-means/9932218 | work = ABC News (Australia) | date = 2 July 2018 | title =  Mexico's new president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is the result of political upheaval | author =  Benjamin Sveen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promises and proposals===
López Obrador promised to end many of the benefits received by ex-presidents, particularly the lifelong pension they receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2018/03/09/1225293|title=López Obrador se pronuncia por gobierno austero y sin privilegios|date=9 March 2018|website=Excelsior.com.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that he would redirect the money saved to be used to help senior citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/08-01-2018/3371553|title=AMLO dice que en caso de ganar las elecciones eliminará pensiones millonarias a ex presidentes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zavala said she would also attempt to end the practice, though she had not decided how to use the money saved, while Meade and Anaya said they would keep the practice going.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/08-04-2018/3405716|title=Margarita Zavala ofrece quitarle la pensión a los ex Presidentes, entre ellos su marido|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaya promised to implement a [[basic income]] for Mexican citizens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/elecciones-2018/ingreso-basico-universal-principal-propuesta-social-del-frente-pan|title=Ingreso básico universal, principal propuesta social del Frente: PAN|date=26 November 2017|website=Eluniversal.com.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anaya said [[Nobel prize]]-winning economist [[Milton Friedman]] supported the idea. While well received, ''[[El Economista (Mexico)|El Economista]]'' criticized how Anaya announced it, and called the idea [[populist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/opinion/Desmintiendo-a-Ricardo-Anaya-20171129-0034.html|title=Desmintiendo a Ricardo Anaya|first=Armando Regil|last=Velasco|website=Eleconomista.com.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meade proposed to create an office that would track the unique needs of each individual citizen, in what he would call ''Registro Único de Necesidades de Cada Persona'' (Unique Register of the Necessities of Each Person). Citizens on social media mocked the idea as absurd and impossible to develop, comparing it to writing letters to [[Santa Claus]] or just plainly asking for miracles.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://regeneracion.mx/meade-propone-un-registro-nacional-de-necesidades-de-cada-persona-lo-tunden-en-redes/|title=Meade propone un 'Registro Nacional de Necesidades de Cada Persona'; lo tunden en redes|date=18 February 2018|website=Regeneracion.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}

Meade has supported Peña Nieto's energy reforms, saying that "everyone wins with the ''gasolinazo''", and announcing that if he won he intended to continue it.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/negocios/gasolinazo-ganan_nuestros_hijos-meade-alzas_combustibles-gasolinas-economia-milenio_0_875312478.html|title=Con 'gasolinazo' ganan nuestros hijos: Meade|first=Silvia|last=Rodríguez|website=Milenio.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
López Obrador promised to end the ''gasolinazos'' by building two new fuel refineries, which would allow more petroleum to be processed into gasoline domestically, thus lowering the price by not outsourcing the refining to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/politica/amlo-morena-gasolinas-2018-refinerias-gasolinazo-combustibles-milenio-noticias_0_898110406.html|title=Si triunfa Morena bajarán los costos de la gasolina: López Obrador|website=Milenio.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaya promised to investigate and do everything to make sure President Peña Nieto is sent to jail for his aforementioned multiple presidential scandals, with López Obrador agreeing and suggesting to up the ante by also investigating every living former president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2018/03/10/1225497|title=Pide López Obrador a Ricardo Anaya extender denuncia a expresidentes|date=10 March 2018|website=Excelsior.com.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January, López Obrador accused the [[International Monetary Fund]] of being an accomplice to corruption in Mexican politics and claimed that its policies are in part responsible for poverty, unemployment, and violence in the country. López Obrador promised that if he won the presidency, Mexico will follow "its own agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =El FMI es cómplice de la corrupción en el país: López Obrador|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2018/01/26/1216038|publisher =Excélsior|language=Spanish|date = 26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

López Obrador called for a change in security strategy and offered the controversial proposal of giving [[amnesty]] for drug dealers as a way to combat the drug cartels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/03/mexico-candidate-amnesty-drug-dealers/570533002/|title=Amnesty for drug dealers? This Mexico presidential candidate is pushing for forgiveness|publisher=USA Today|author=David Agren|date=3 May 2018|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a debate in April, Rodríguez Calderón said "We have to cut off the hands of those who rob (in public service). It's that simple." He later explained that it was intended to be applied to both criminals and government functionaries involved in acts of corruption citing the application of this measure in [[Saudi Arabia]] as an example to reduce corruption and violence. Rodríguez Calderón was trending ahead of the other candidates on Twitter during the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/cut-off-hands-mexican-presidential-candidates-plan-to-deter-thieves-40028884.html|title='Cut off hands': Mexican presidential candidate's plan to deter thieves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodríguez Calderón later proposed to bring back the [[death penalty]] (currently constitutionally abolished in Mexico and enforced for the last time in 1961) for [[drug traffickers]], [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]], [[infanticide]]s and [[serial killer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Ciudadanos quieren pena de muerte para narcos y asesinos, asegura ‘El Bronco’|url= https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/ciudadanos-quieren-pena-muerte-narcos-asesinos-asegura-bronco-video/|website=Reporte Indigo|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Ballot access requirements===
The candidate put forward by the [[National Indigenous Congress]] and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]], [[María de Jesús Patricio Martínez]] (Marichuy), alleged that the process for collecting signatures to attain ballot access unfairly benefits the rich. Marichuy said, "the INE made a list of telephone makes and models so that you must have at a minimum an Android 5.0 operating system or higher and so many hours to begin with the download of the applications in the devices, we find that the list is not true; we find brands that are not included in the list and of those that are included they don’t all work. The download is tedious and can take hours." The INE declared each signature registration would take 4.3 minutes, but each actual signature registration has taken up to 16 hours, or more. 'With these "classist, racist and excluding measures," Marichuy said, you realize "that this electoral system is not made for those peoples below that govern ourselves and that the laws and institutions of the State are made for those above, for the capitalists and their corrupt political class, resulting in a big simulation." Ultimately she was not able to obtain ballot access. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chiapas-support.org/2017/10/23/marichuy-denounces-ines-system-for-collecting-signatures-via-cell-phone/|title=Marichuy denounces INE’s system for collecting signatures via cell phone|date=22 March 2018|accessdate=23 October 2017|website=chiapas-support.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PRI payments to Cambridge Analytica===
After the [[Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal]], in April 2018, Forbes published information from the British news program [[Channel 4 News]] that had mentioned the existence  of proof revealing ties between the PRI and Cambridge Analytica, suggesting a ''modus operandi'' similar to the one in the [[United States]]. The info said they worked together at least until January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com.mx/cambridge-analytica-mexico-pri-enero-2018-channel-4-news/|title=Cambridge Analytica trabajó con el PRI: Channel 4 News • Forbes México|first=Forbes|last=Staff|date=30 March 2018|website=Forbes.com.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}

An investigation was requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.proceso.com.mx/528182/exigen-al-inai-investigar-a-cambridge-analytica-facebook-y-desarrolladoras-de-apps-en-mexico|title=Exigen al INAI investigar a Cambridge Analytica, Facebook y desarrolladoras de Apps en México - Proceso|date=2 April 2018|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[The New York Times]] obtained the 57 page proposal of Cambridge Analytica's proposed collaboration strategy to benefit the PRI by hurting MORENA's candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador; the political party rejected the offer but still paid Cambridge Analytica to not help the other candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/world/americas/mexico-election-cambridge-analytica.html|title=Mexico’s Hardball Politics Get Even Harder as PRI Fights to Hold On to Power|publisher=New York Times|date=24 June 2018|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of foreign intervention===
In April 2017, the [[US Secretary of Homeland Security]], [[John F. Kelly]], stated that the election of a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] president in Mexico "would not be good for America or Mexico". The statement was widely believed to be a reference to López Obrador, the leftist, frontrunner candidate, and created controversy in Mexico, as it seemed to be an attempt to influence the election against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/5/trump-administration-wades-mexican-election/|work=The Washington Times|date=5 April 2017|first=Stephen|last=Dinan|title=Trump administration wades into Mexican election, warns against left-wing candidate|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mexico-election/mexico-urges-respect-from-u-s-for-2018-presidential-election-idUSKBN1782O1|agency=Reuters|date=6 April 2017|title=Mexico urges respect from U.S. for 2018 presidential election|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-protest-john-kelly-john-mccain-comments-about-leftist-election-2017-4|work=Business Insider|date=17 April 2017|title=Mexico wants John Kelly and John McCain to butt out of its election|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, [[National Security Advisor (United States)|US National Security Advisor]] [[H. R. McMaster]] claimed that [[Russia]] had launched a campaign to "influence Mexico’s 2018 presidential election and stir up division", without defining the methods of the supposed meddling, or indicating which would be the candidate favored by the Kremlin. The Russian government has denied the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-russia-usa/russia-meddling-in-mexican-election-white-house-aide-mcmaster-idUSKBN1EW0UD|agency=Reuters|date=7 January 2018|title=Russia meddling in Mexican election: White House aide McMaster|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] president [[:es:Enrique Ochoa Reza|Enrique Ochoa Reza]] claimed that "Russian and Venezuelan interests" are supporting López Obrador's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/518252/intereses-de-rusia-y-venezuela-apoyan-lopez-pri|work=Proceso|date=12 January 2018|title=Intereses de Rusia y Venezuela apoyan a "López": PRI|language=Spanish|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

López Obrador responded that Ochoa's declarations are part of a [[smear campaign]] against him,&lt;ref name="Aristegui Noticias"/&gt; and later posted a video via social media, where he joked about the claims and called himself "Andres Manuelovich".&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aristeguinoticias.com"/&gt;

[[Guatemala]]n right-wing commentator [[Gloria Álvarez]] embarked on a tour through Mexico, calling López Obrador a "dangerous populist" and urging citizens not to vote for him. She was invited to a PAN legislators assembly on 31 January, where she criticized the alliance with the PRD, which she called "a party just like MORENA".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.milenio.com/politica/populismo-partidos_politicos-prd-amlo-politologa-milenio-noticias_0_1039696255.html|work=Milenio|date=31 January 2018|title=Preparación académica, la mejor arma contra el populismo: politóloga|language=Spanish|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/elecciones-2018/critican-en-plenaria-panistas-por-aliarse-al-prd|work=El Universal|date=31 January 2018|title=Critican en plenaria a panistas por aliarse al PRD|language=Spanish|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[US Senator]]s [[Bob Menendez]] and [[Marco Rubio]] asked [[US Secretary of State]] [[Rex Tillerson]] to "fight Russian meddling" in the Mexican elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/371583-senators-ask-tillerson-to-fight-russian-interference-in-mexico-election|work=TheHill|date=31 January 2018|title=Senators ask Tillerson to fight Russian interference in Mexico election: report|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February during a summit in Mexico, Tillerson stated that Mexico should "beware the Russian interference".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-tillerson-warns-mexico-to-watch-russian-election-meddling-2018-2|work=Business Insider|date=2 February 2018|title=Tillerson warns Mexico to watch Russian election meddling|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at [[Rice University]] noted that there was no evidence of actual Russian tampering in the Mexican electoral process, and considered the accusations "absurd" given that the Trump administration "will not admit Russia interfered in the US election".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/russia-meddling-mexico-election-rex-tillerson-marco-rubio-bob-menendez-senators-a8188286.html|work=The Independent|date=2 February 2018|title=Rex Tillerson urged to raise Russian meddling in Mexico election on upcoming trip to region|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of election tampering===
[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] warned about the possibility of the PRI committing [[electoral fraud]], with Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at [[Rice University]]’s Baker Institute in [[Houston]], United States, suggesting that both vote buyout and computer hackings were possible and citing irregularities in the 1988 electoral process. Bloomberg's article also suggested Meade could be receiving unfair help from the over-budget amounts of money spent on publicity by incumbent president [[Enrique Peña Nieto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-18/mexico-s-biggest-election-could-turn-dirty-it-s-happened-before|title=Mexico’s Presidential Election Could Get Really Dirty|date=18 December 2017|accessdate=9 April 2018|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Meade spent more money on pre-campaign efforts than López Obrador and Anaya together, while failing to report where his funds came from; in contrast, López Obrador has attended the most events while spending the least money and successfully reported better than his rivals where he obtained the resources to pay for those events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aristeguinoticias.com/0301/mexico/meade-no-reporta-ingresos-ante-ine-y-gasta-mas-del-doble-que-anaya-y-amlo-juntos/|title=Meade reporta más del doble de gastos que Anaya y López Obrador en precampañas - Aristegui Noticias|website=aristeguinoticias.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prior PRI election tampering controversies in 2017====
During 2017, the PRI had faced allegations of electoral fraud concerning the election of Peña Nieto's cousin [[Alfredo del Mazo Maza]] as Governor of the [[state of Mexico]]. Despite the official vote results given by the INE (Electoral National Institute) giving the win to del Mazo, the election was marred by irregularities including reports of vote-buying,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/sociedad/2017/06/04/denuncian-compra-votos-favor-alfredo-mazo|work=El Economista|date=4 June 2017|first=Leopoldo|last=Hernández|title=Denuncian compra de votos a favor de Alfredo del Mazo|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending beyond legal campaign finance limits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/08-06-2017/3236142|work=SinEmbargo|date=8 June 2017|first=Dulce|last=Olvera|title=Del Mazo gastó 412 millones 225 mil en Edomex, cuando sólo podía disponer de 285 millones: Morena|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and electoral counts that gave del Mazo extra votes that awarded the election to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/07-06-2017/3235335|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=9 June 2017|title=El PREP sumó al PRI 238 mil 145 votos de más en el Edomex, con los que da ventaja a Del Mazo|work=SinEmbargo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, left-wing magazine ''[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]]'' published an article accusing the PRI of breaking at least 16 state laws during the elections, which were denounced 619 times. They said that all of them were broken in order to favor del Mazo during the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/511392/ni-libre-ni-autentica-la-eleccion-en-edomex-ni-fraude|title="Ni libre, ni auténtica”, la elección en Edomex: Ni un Fraude Más - Proceso|date=16 November 2017|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

===President===
López Obrador won the election on 1 July 2018 with over 50% of the popular vote. In terms of states won, López Obrador won in a landslide, carrying 31 out of 32 of [[States of Mexico|the country's states]],&lt;ref name="ReutersMurray" /&gt; the most states won by a candidate since [[Ernesto Zedillo]] won every state in the [[Mexican general election, 1994|1994 election]].

Around 30 minutes after polls closed in the country's north-west, José Antonio Meade, speaking at a news conference from PRI headquarters, conceded defeat and wished López Obrador "every success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jose Antonio Meade of Mexico's ruling party concedes defeat to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in presidential vote |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/jose-antonio-meade-mexicos-ruling-party-concedes-defeat-56306465 |accessdate=1 July 2018 |agency=ABC News (USA) |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Le deseo el mayor de los éxitos a AMLO: Meade |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/le-deseo-el-mayor-de-los-exitos-a-amlo-meade/1249456 |accessdate=1 July 2018 |publisher=''[[Excélsior]]'' |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricardo Anaya also conceded defeat within an hour of the polls closing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anaya reconoce victoria de AMLO |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/elecciones-2018/ricardo-anaya-reconoce-victoria-de-amlo |accessdate=1 July 2018 |publisher=''[[El Universal (Mexico City)]]'' |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico election: Exit polls put López Obrador in front |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44677829 |accessdate=1 July 2018 |agency=BBC News |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and independent candidate Jaime Rodríguez Calderón recognized López Obrador's victory shortly afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=García |first1=Aracely |title=‘El Bronco’ reconoce triunfo de López Obrador |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/el-bronco-reconoce-triunfo-de-lopez-obrador/1249467 |accessdate=1 July 2018 |publisher=''[[Excélsior]]'' |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the INE's official [[quick count]] were announced around midnight Mexico City time. It reported a turnout of around 63%, with the following approximate results for the candidates: López Obrador, 53%; Anaya, 22%; Meade, 16%; and Rodríguez Calderón, 5%. This is the first time since [[Mexican general election, 1988|the (controversial) 1988 election]] that a presidential candidate was elected with an absolute majority (50%+1) of the votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Conteo rápido del INE da victoria a Andrés Manuel López Obrador |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/elecciones-2018/conteo-rapido-del-ine-da-victoria-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador |accessdate=1 July 2018 |publisher=''[[El Universal (Mexico City)]]'' |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China''' ('''MND'''; {{zh |t = 中華民國國防部 |p = Zhōnghuá Mínguó Guófángbù |poj=Tiong-hoâ Bîn-kok Kok-hông-pō͘}}) is a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]-level agency under the [[Executive Yuan]] responsible for all [[National security|defense]] and [[military]] affairs of Taiwan. The MND is headed by Minister [[Yen Teh-fa]].

== History ==
[[File:ROC-MND Boai Building 20100101.jpg|thumb|ROC Ministry of National Defense former headquarters]]

The MND was originally established as '''Ministry of War''' in 1912 at the creation of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. It was changed to the '''Ministry of National Defense''' in 1946. The Law of National Defense and the Organic Law of the ministry were officially promulgated for implementation on 1 March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/taiwan/mnd.htm|title=Ministry of National Defense |author=John Pike |website = globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2014, the ministry moved out from its building from the previous one at Boai Building in [[Zhongzheng District]] to the current one in Dazhi area at [[Zhongshan District, Taipei|Zhongshan District]], where it houses the Air Force Command Headquarters, Navy Command Headquarters and Hengshan Military Command Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201412050031.aspx |title = Defense Ministry's new compound to be officially opened Dec. 8 |website = focustaiwan.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completion of the building had been delayed for nearly two decades due to the compound original architecture and the bankruptcy of the project's original contractor. The planning for the new building and relocation had been done since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201412080026.aspx|title=Defense minister raises flag at new ministry compound|work=focustaiwan.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on 27 December 2014.&lt;ref name="cna.com.tw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.cna.com.tw/news/aipl/201412270020.aspx|title=Defense Ministry's new headquarters officially opens|work=cna.com.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Headquarters==
[[File:Ministry of National Defence Dazhi New Site Front View 20120930.jpg|thumb|ROC Ministry of National Defense headquarters]]
The headquarters of the military was originally in eastern [[Nanjing]] near [[Ming Palace]].
Today it is located in Dazhi area of [[Zhongshan District, Taipei|Zhongshan District]] in [[Taipei]]. The 8-story main building was constructed at a cost of NT$15.8 billion, spreading over 19.5 hectares of area, which houses office buildings, dormitories and other facilities, such as post office, barbershop, sports center, conference hall and sport center to accommodate its 3,000 military personnel stationed there. It also includes several annex buildings around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/12/28/2003607766 |title = Taipei military complex opened |website = taipeitimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security features of the building include fingerprint and eye scanners that restrict access to certain areas, sensors that can detect vehicles in the unauthorized areas and that may carry explosives and [[bollards]] on the compound to block unauthorized vehicles. The compound also has eco-friendly features, such as stone walls, aluminum and low-emission exterior glass panels. The central [[air conditioning]] system is provided by [[Ice storage air conditioning|ice storage system]] to reduce peak load electricity demand. The building also has rainwater collecting facilities which can store up to 1,000 tons of water, complete with its waste water treatment and filtering systems.&lt;ref name="cna.com.tw" /&gt;

==Budget==
The current annual defense budget for Taiwan is NT$320 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201606070027.aspx|title=Difficult to set defense budget at 3% of GDP: premier - Politics - FOCUS TAIWAN - CNA ENGLISH NEWS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monetary policy''' is the process by which the monetary authority of a country, typically the [[central bank]]  or [[currency board]], controls either the [[federal funds|cost of very short-term borrowing]] or the [[monetary base]], often targeting an [[Inflation#Measures|inflation rate]] or [[interest rate]] to ensure [[price stability]] and general trust in the currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/target.htm |title=Inflation Targeting: Holding the Line |last=Jahan |first=Sarwat |publisher=International Monetary Funds, Finance &amp; Development |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "fed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/policy.htm|publisher=Federal Reserve Board|title=Monetary Policy|date=January 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Handbook of Development Economics, vol. 5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444529442000021|publisher= Handbook of Development Economics, Elsevier|title=Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further goals of a monetary policy are usually to contribute to the stability of [[gross domestic product]], to achieve and maintain low [[unemployment]], and to maintain predictable [[exchange rates]] with other [[currencies]].

[[Monetary economics]] provides insight into how to craft an optimal monetary policy. In [[developed economy|developed countries]], monetary policy has generally been formed separately from [[fiscal policy]], which refers to [[tax]]ation, [[government spending]], and [[Government borrowing|associated borrowing]].&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = B.M.

Monetary policy is referred to as being either expansionary or contractionary. Expansionary policy is when a monetary authority uses its tools to stimulate the economy. An expansionary policy maintains short-term interest rates at a lower than usual rate or increases the total supply of money in the economy more rapidly than usual. It is traditionally used to try to combat [[unemployment]] in a [[recession]] by lowering [[interest rate targeting|interest rates]] in the hope that less expensive credit will entice businesses into expanding. This increases [[aggregate demand]] (the overall demand for all goods and services in an economy), which boosts short-term growth as measured by [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth. Expansionary monetary policy usually diminishes the value of the currency relative to other currencies (the [[exchange rate]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thebalance.com/expansionary-monetary-policy-definition-purpose-tools-3305837 Expansionary Monetary Policy: Definition, Purpose, Tools]. The Balance. &lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of expansionary monetary policy is contractionary monetary policy, which maintains short-term interest rates higher than usual or which slows the rate of growth in the money supply or even shrinks it. This slows short-term economic growth and lessens [[inflation]]. Contractionary monetary policy can lead to increased unemployment and depressed borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses, which can eventually result in an economic recession if implemented too vigorously.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thebalance.com/contractionary-monetary-policy-definition-examples-3305829 Contractionary Monetary Policy: Definition, Examples].

==History==
Monetary policy is associated with [[interest rate]]s and availability of [[credit (finance)|credit]]. Instruments of monetary policy have included short-term interest rates and bank reserves through the [[monetary base]].&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Michael D., 2008. "monetary policy, history of," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_H000180&amp;edition=current&amp;q=real%20%20nominal&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=40 Abstract] and [http://michael.bordo.googlepages.com/TheHistoryofMonetaryPolicy.pdf pre-publication copy.]
&lt;/ref&gt;
For many centuries there were only two forms of monetary policy: (i) Decisions about coinage; (ii) Decisions to print [[paper money]] to create [[credit]]. [[Interest rates]], while now thought of as part of monetary authority, were not generally coordinated with the other forms of monetary policy during this time. Monetary policy was seen as an executive decision, and was generally in the hands of the authority with [[seigniorage]], or the power to coin. With the advent of larger trading networks came the ability to set the price between gold and silver, and the price of the local currency to foreign currencies. This official price could be enforced by law, even if it varied from the market price.

Paper money originated from [[promissory notes]] called "[[Jiaozi (currency)|jiaozi]]" in 7th century [[China]]. Jiaozi did not replace metallic currency, and were used alongside the copper coins. The successive [[Yuan Dynasty]] was the first government to use paper currency as the predominant circulating medium. In the later course of the dynasty, facing massive shortages of specie to fund war and their rule in China, they began printing paper money without restrictions, resulting in [[hyperinflation]].

With the creation of the [[Bank of England]] in 1694,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/pages/history/|title=History of the Bank of England - Bank of England|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which acquired the responsibility to print notes and back them with gold, the idea of monetary policy as independent of executive action began to be established.&lt;ref name = "bank_england"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/timelines/britain/stu_eng_bank.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=Bank of England founded 1694|date=March 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of monetary policy was to maintain the value of the coinage, print notes which would trade at par to specie, and prevent coins from leaving circulation. The establishment of central banks by industrializing nations was associated then with the desire to maintain the nation's peg to the [[gold standard]], and to trade in a narrow [[currency band|band]] with other gold-backed currencies. To accomplish this end, central banks as part of the gold standard began setting the interest rates that they charged, both their own borrowers, and other banks who required liquidity. The maintenance of a gold standard required almost monthly adjustments of interest rates.
The [[gold standard]] is a system under which the price of the national currency is measured in units of gold bars and is kept constant by the government's promise to buy or sell gold at a fixed price in terms of the base currency. The gold standard might be regarded as a special case of "fixed exchange rate" policy, or as a special type of commodity price level targeting.
Nowadays this type of monetary policy is no longer used by any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Abdel-Monem |first=Tarik |title=What is The Gold Standard? |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/faq/faq_docs/gold_standard.shtml |publisher=University of Iowa Center for The Center for International Finance and Development |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121143147/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/faq/faq_docs/gold_standard.shtml |archivedate=2009-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period 1870–1920, the industrialized nations set up central banking systems, with one of the last being the [[Federal Reserve]] in 1913.&lt;ref name = "fedact"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/fract/|publisher=Federal Reserve Board|title=Federal Reserve Act|date=May 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point the role of the central bank as the "lender of last resort" was understood. It was also increasingly understood that interest rates had an effect on the entire economy, in no small part because of the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]] in economics, which demonstrated how people would change a decision based on a change in the economic trade-offs.

[[Monetarist]] economists long contended that the money-supply growth could affect the macroeconomy. These included [[Milton Friedman]] who early in his career advocated that [[government budget deficit]]s during recessions be financed in equal amount by [[money creation]] to help to stimulate [[aggregate demand]] for output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Milton |year=1948 |title=A Monetary and Fiscal Framework for Economic Stability |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=38 |issue=3 |url=http://www.hilbertcorporation.com.ar/amonetaryandfiscaleconomicstability.pdf |pages=245–264 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007091741/http://www.hilbertcorporation.com.ar/amonetaryandfiscaleconomicstability.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he advocated simply increasing the monetary supply at a low, constant rate, as the best way of maintaining low inflation and stable output growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Milton | last = Friedman | authorlink = Milton Friedman | title = A Program for Monetary Stability | publisher = Fordham University Press | year = 1960 | location =  | pages =  | id =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Paul Volcker]] tried this policy, starting in October 1979, it was found to be impractical, because of the highly unstable relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first = Ben | last = Bernanke | authorlink = Ben Bernanke | title = Monetary Aggregates and Monetary Policy at the Federal Reserve: A Historical Perspective | website =  | publisher = Federal Reserve | year = 2006 | url = http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20061110a.htm | doi =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Milton Friedman]] later acknowledged that direct money supply targeting was less successful than he had hoped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Therefore, monetary decisions today take into account a wider range of factors, such as:
* short-term interest rates;
* long-term interest rates;
* velocity of money through the economy;
* [[exchange rate]]s;
* [[credit quality]];
* [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[equities]] (debt and corporate ownership);
* government versus private sector spending/savings;
* international [[capital flow]]s of money on large scales;
* financial [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] such as [[option (finance)|options]], [[Swap (finance)|swaps]], [[futures contract]]s, etc.

== Monetary policy instruments ==
{{Main|Central bank#Policy instruments}}

=== Conventional instrument ===
The [[central bank]] influences [[Interest rate|interest rates]] by expanding or contracting the monetary base, which consists of currency in circulation and banks' reserves on deposit at the central bank. 
Central banks have three main tools of monetary policy: [[Open market operation|open market operations]], the [[Discount window|discount rate]] and the [[Reserve requirement|reserve requirements]]. 

An important tool with which a [[central bank]] can affect the monetary base is '''[[open market operations]]''', if its country has a well developed market for its government bonds. This entails managing the quantity of money in circulation through the buying and selling of various financial instruments, such as treasury bills, company bonds, or foreign currencies, in exchange for money on deposit at the central bank. Those deposits are convertible to currency, so all of these purchases or sales result in more or less base currency entering or leaving market circulation. 
For example, if the central bank wishes to lower interest rates (executing expansionary monetary policy), it purchases government debt, thereby increasing the amount of cash in circulation or crediting [[banks' reserve accounts]]. Commercial banks then have more money to lend, so they reduce lending rates, making loans less expensive. Cheaper credit card interest rates boost consumer spending. Additionally, when business loans are more affordable, companies can expand to keep up with consumer demand. They ultimately hire more workers, whose incomes rise, which in its turn also increases the demand. This tool is usually enough to stimulate demand and drive economic growth to a healthy rate. 
Usually, the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target. In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For example, in the case of the United States the [[Federal Reserve]] targets the [[federal funds rate]], the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight; however, the [[monetary policy of China]] is to target the exchange rate between the Chinese renminbi and a basket of foreign currencies.

If the open market operations do not lead to the desired effects, a second tool can be used: the central bank can '''increase or decrease the interest rate''' it charges on discounts or overdrafts (loans from the central bank to commercial banks, see [[discount window]]). If the interest rate on such transactions is sufficiently low, commercial banks can borrow from the central bank to meet reserve requirements and use the additional liquidity to expand their balance sheets, increasing the credit available to the economy. 

A third alternative is to change the [[reserve requirements]]. The reserve requirement refers to the proportion of total liabilities that banks must keep on hand overnight, either in its vaults or at the central bank. Banks only maintain a small portion of their assets as cash available for immediate withdrawal; the rest is invested in illiquid assets like mortgages and loans. Lowering the reserve requirement frees up funds for banks to increase loans or buy other profitable assets. This is expansionary because it creates credit. However, even though this tool immediately increases liquidity, central banks rarely change the reserve requirement because doing so frequently adds uncertainty to banks’ planning. The use of open market operations is therefore preferred.

===Unconventional monetary policy at the zero bound===
Other forms of monetary policy, particularly used when interest rates are at or near 0% and there are concerns about deflation or deflation is occurring, are referred to as '''unconventional monetary policy'''. These include [[Quantitative easing#Credit easing|credit easing]], [[quantitative easing]], [[forward guidance]], and [[Signalling (economics)|signaling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roubini|first1=Nouriel|title=Troubled Global Economy|url=http://time.com/4180698/nouriel-roubini-global-economy/|website=[[Time Magazine]]|publisher=time.com|accessdate=5 February 2016|date=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In credit easing, a central bank purchases private sector assets to improve liquidity and improve access to credit. Signaling can be used to lower market expectations for lower interest rates in the future. For example, during the credit crisis of 2008, the US Federal Reserve indicated rates would be low for an "extended period", and the [[Bank of Canada]] made a "conditional commitment" to keep rates at the lower bound of 25 basis points (0.25%) until the end of the second quarter of 2010.

Further heterodox monetary policy proposals include the idea of [[helicopter money]] whereby central banks would create money without assets as counterpart in their balance sheet. The money created could be distributed directly to the population as a citizen's dividend. This option has been increasingly discussed since March 2016 after the ECB's president [[Mario Draghi]] said he found the concept "very interesting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2015/01/permanent-qe-and-helicopter-money/|title=Permanent QE and helicopter money {{!}} Bruegel|website=bruegel.org|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominal anchors==
A nominal anchor for monetary policy is a single variable or device which the central bank uses to pin down expectations of private agents about the nominal price level or its path or about what the central bank might do with respect to achieving that path. Monetary regimes combine long-run nominal anchoring with flexibility in the short run. Nominal variables used as anchors primarily include exchange rate targets, money supply targets, and inflation targets with interest rate policy.&lt;ref name="Feenstra, Robert C. 2012"&gt;Feenstra, Robert C., and Alan M. Taylor. International Macroeconomics. New York: Worth, 2012. 100-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
In practice, to implement any type of monetary policy the main tool used is modifying the amount of [[base money]] in circulation. The monetary authority does this by buying or selling financial assets (usually government obligations). These [[open market operations]] change either the amount of money or its liquidity (if less liquid forms of money are bought or sold). The [[multiplier effect]] of [[fractional reserve banking]] amplifies the effects of these actions.

Constant market transactions by the monetary authority modify the supply of currency and this impacts other market variables such as [[STIRT|short-term interest rates]] and the exchange rate.

The distinction between the various types of monetary policy lies primarily with the set of instruments and target variables that are used by the monetary authority to achieve their goals.
&lt;br /&gt;

The different types of policy are also called '''monetary regimes''', in parallel to [[exchange-rate regime]]s. A fixed exchange rate is also an exchange-rate regime; The gold standard results in a relatively fixed regime towards the currency of other countries on the gold standard and a floating regime towards those that are not. Targeting inflation, the price level or other monetary aggregates implies floating the exchange rate unless the management of the relevant foreign currencies is tracking exactly the same variables (such as a harmonized consumer price index).

==== Inflation targeting ====
{{Main article|Inflation targeting}}
{{See also|Monetary policy reaction function}}

Under this policy approach the target is to keep [[inflation]], under a particular definition such as the [[Consumer Price Index]], within a desired range.

The inflation target is achieved through periodic adjustments to the central bank [[interest rate]] target. The interest rate used is generally the [[overnight rate]] at which banks lend to each other overnight for cash flow purposes. Depending on the country this particular interest rate might be called the cash rate or something similar.

As the [[Fisher hypothesis|Fisher effect]] model explains, the equation linking inflation with interest rates is the following:

:π = ''i - r''

where π is the inflation rate, ''i'' is the home nominal interest rate set by the central bank, and ''r'' is the real interest rate. Using ''i'' as an anchor, central banks can influence π. 
Central banks can choose to maintain a fixed interest rate at all times, or just temporarily. The duration of this policy varies, because of the simplicity associated with changing the nominal interest rate.

The interest rate target is maintained for a specific duration using open market operations. Typically the duration that the interest rate target is kept constant will vary between months and years. This interest rate target is usually reviewed on a monthly or quarterly basis by a policy committee.&lt;ref name="Feenstra, Robert C. 2012"/&gt;

Changes to the interest rate target are made in response to various market indicators in an attempt to forecast economic trends and in so doing keep the market on track towards achieving the defined inflation target. For example, one simple method of inflation targeting called the [[Taylor rule]] adjusts the interest rate in response to changes in the inflation rate and the [[output gap]]. The rule was proposed by [[John B. Taylor]] of [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Athanasios  | last = Orphanides | authorlink = Athanasios Orphanides  | title = Taylor rules (Abstract)  | publisher = [[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]], 2nd Edition. v. 8 | location =  | pages = 200–04 | url = http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_T000215&amp;q=taylor%20rules&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 | id =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inflation targeting approach to monetary policy approach was pioneered in New Zealand. It has been used in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

====Price level targeting====
Price level targeting is a monetary policy that is similar to inflation targeting except that CPI growth in one year over or under the long term price level target is offset in subsequent years such that a targeted price-level is reached over time, e.g. five years, giving more certainty about future price increases to consumers. Under inflation targeting what happened in the immediate past years is not taken into account or adjusted for in the current and future years.

Uncertainty in price levels can create uncertainty around [[price]] and [[wage]] setting activity for firms and workers, and undermines any [[information]] that can be gained from [[relative price]]s, as it is more difficult for firms to determine if a change in the [[price]] of a [[good (economics)|good]] or [[service (economics)|service]] is because of [[inflation]] or other factors, such as an increase in the [[efficiency]] of [[factors of production]], if [[inflation]] is high and [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]]. An increase in [[inflation]] also leads to a decrease in the [[demand for money]], as it reduces the [[incentive]] to hold money and increases [[transaction cost]]s and [[shoe leather cost]]s.

====Monetary aggregates/money supply targeting====
In the 1980s, several countries used an approach based on a constant growth in the money supply. This approach was refined to include different classes of money and credit (M0, M1 etc.). In the US this approach to monetary policy was discontinued with the selection of [[Alan Greenspan]] as Fed Chairman.

This approach is also sometimes called [[monetarism]].

Central banks might choose to set a money supply growth target as a nominal anchor to keep prices stable in the long term. The quantity theory, is a long run model, which links price levels to money supply and demand. Using this equation, we can rearrange to see the following:

:π = μ − g,

where π is the inflation rate, μ is the money supply growth rate and g is the real output growth rate. This equation suggests that controlling the money supply’s growth rate can ultimately lead to price stability in the long run. To use this nominal anchor, a central bank would need to set μ equal to a constant and commit to maintaining this target.

However, the money supply growth rate is considered a weak policy, because it is not stably related to the real output growth, As a result, a higher output growth rate will result in a too low level of inflation. A low output growth rate will result in inflation that would be higher than the desired level.&lt;ref name="Feenstra, Robert C. 2012"/&gt;

While monetary policy typically focuses on a [[price signal]] of one form or another, this approach is focused on monetary quantities. As these quantities could have a role on the economy and business cycles depending on the households' risk aversion level, money is sometimes explicitly added in the central bank's reaction function.&lt;ref&gt;Benchimol, J., Fourçans, A. (2012), [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jmacro/v34y2012i1p95-111.html Money and risk in a DSGE framework: A Bayesian application to the Eurozone], [[Journal of Macroeconomics]], vol. 34, pp. 95–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, central banks are shifting away from policies that focus on money supply targeting, because of the uncertainty that real output growth introduces. Some central banks, like the ECB, are choosing to combine money supply anchor with other targets.

====Nominal income/NGDP targeting====
{{Main article|Nominal income target}}
Related to money targeting, [[Nominal income target|nominal income targeting]] (also called Nominal GDP or NGDP targeting), originally proposed by [[James Meade]] (1978) and [[James Tobin]] (1980), was advocated by [[Scott Sumner]] and reinforced by the [[market monetarist]] school of thought.

Central banks do not implement this monetary policy explicitly. However, numerous studies shown that such a monetary policy targeting better matches welfare optimizing monetary policy compared to more standard monetary policy targeting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www3.nd.edu/~esims1/GLS_JEDC_WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fixed exchange rate targeting====
This policy is based on maintaining a [[fixed exchange rate]] with a foreign currency. There are varying degrees of fixed exchange rates, which can be ranked in relation to how rigid the fixed exchange rate is with the anchor nation.

Under a system of fiat fixed rates, the local government or monetary authority declares a fixed exchange rate but does not actively buy or sell currency to maintain the rate. Instead, the rate is enforced by non-convertibility measures (e.g. [[capital control]]s, import/export licenses, etc.). In this case there is a black market exchange rate where the currency trades at its market/unofficial rate.

Under a system of fixed-convertibility, currency is bought and sold by the central bank or monetary authority on a daily basis to achieve the target exchange rate. This target rate may be a fixed level or a fixed band within which the exchange rate may fluctuate until the monetary authority intervenes to buy or sell as necessary to maintain the exchange rate within the band. (In this case, the fixed exchange rate with a fixed level can be seen as a special case of the fixed exchange rate with bands where the bands are set to zero.)

Under a system of fixed exchange rates maintained by a currency board every unit of local currency must be backed by a unit of foreign currency (correcting for the exchange rate). This ensures that the local monetary base does not inflate without being backed by hard currency and eliminates any worries about a run on the local currency by those wishing to convert the local currency to the hard (anchor) currency.

Under [[dollarization]], foreign currency (usually the US dollar, hence the term "dollarization") is used freely as the medium of exchange either exclusively or in parallel with local currency. This outcome can come about because the local population has lost all faith in the local currency, or it may also be a policy of the government (usually to rein in inflation and import credible monetary policy).

Theoretically, using [[relative purchasing power parity]] (PPP), the rate of depreciation of the home country’s currency must equal the inflation differential:

:rate of depreciation = home inflation rate – foreign inflation rate,

which implies that

:home inflation rate = foreign inflation rate + rate of depreciation.

The anchor variable is the rate of depreciation. Therefore, the rate of inflation at home must equal the rate of inflation in the foreign country plus the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate of the home country currency, relative to the other.

With a strict fixed exchange rate or a peg, the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate is set equal to zero. In the case of a [[crawling peg]], the rate of depreciation is set equal to a constant. With a limited flexible band, the rate of depreciation is allowed to fluctuate within a given range.

By fixing the rate of depreciation, PPP theory concludes that the home country’s inflation rate must depend on the foreign country‘s. 
 
Countries may decide to use a fixed exchange rate monetary regime in order to take advantage of price stability and control inflation. In practice, more than half of nation’s monetary regimes use fixed exchange rate anchoring.&lt;ref name="Feenstra, Robert C. 2012"/&gt;

These policies often abdicate monetary policy to the foreign monetary authority or government as monetary policy in the pegging nation must align with monetary policy in the anchor nation to maintain the exchange rate. The degree to which local monetary policy becomes dependent on the anchor nation depends on factors such as capital mobility, openness, [[Credit Channel|credit channels]] and other economic factors.

===In practice===
Nominal anchors are possible with various exchange rate regimes.

{| class="wikitable"

! Type of Nominal Anchor !! Compatible Exchange Rate Regimes

|}

Following the collapse of Bretton Woods, nominal anchoring has grown in importance for monetary policy makers and inflation reduction. Particularly, governments sought to use anchoring in order to curtail rapid and high inflation during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, countries began to explicitly set credible nominal anchors. In addition, many countries chose a mix of more than one target, as well as implicit targets. As a result, global inflation rates have, on average, decreased gradually since the 1970s and central banks have gained credibility and increasing independence.

The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 has sparked controversy over the use and flexibility of inflation nominal anchoring. Many economists argue that inflation targets are currently set too low by many monetary regimes. During the crisis, many inflation anchoring countries reached the lower bound of zero rates, resulting in inflation rates decreasing to almost zero or even deflation.&lt;ref name="Feenstra, Robert C. 2012"/&gt;

===Implications===
The anchors discussed in this article suggest that keeping inflation at the desired level is feasible by setting a target interest rate, money supply growth rate, price level, or rate of depreciation. However, these anchors are only valid if a central bank commits to maintaining them. This, in turn, requires that the central bank abandons their monetary policy autonomy in the long run. Should a central bank use one of these anchors to maintain a target inflation rate, they would have to forfeit using other policies. Using these anchors may prove more complicated for certain exchange rate regimes. Freely floating or managed floating regimes, have more options to affect their inflation, because they enjoy more flexibility than a pegged currency or a country without a currency. The latter regimes would have to implement an exchange rate target to influence their inflation, as none of the other instruments are available to them.

==Credibility==

The short-term effects of monetary policy can be influenced by the degree to which announcements of new policy are deemed [[credibility|credible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = [[Finn E. Kydland]] | author2= [[Edward C. Prescott]] |title=Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans |journal= [[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |date = June 1977 |pages=473–492 |jstor=1830193 | url = https://www.sfu.ca/~kkasa/prescott_77.pdf |doi=10.1086/260580| citeseerx= 10.1.1.603.6853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, when an anti-inflation policy is announced by a central bank, in the absence of credibility in the eyes of the public [[expected inflation|inflationary expectations]] will not drop, and the short-run effect of the announcement and a subsequent sustained anti-inflation policy is likely to be a combination of somewhat lower inflation and higher unemployment (see [[Phillips curve#NAIRU and rational expectations]]). But if the policy announcement is deemed credible, inflationary expectations will drop commensurately with the announced policy intent, and inflation is likely to come down more quickly and without so much of a cost in terms of unemployment. 

Thus there can be an advantage to having the central bank be independent of the political authority, to shield it from the prospect of political pressure to reverse the direction of the policy. But even with a seemingly independent central bank, a central bank whose hands are not tied to the anti-inflation policy might be deemed as not fully credible; in this case there is an advantage to be had by the central bank being in some way bound to follow through on its policy pronouncements, lending it credibility.

==Contexts==

===In international economics===
Optimal monetary policy in international economics is concerned with the question of how monetary policy should be conducted in interdependent open economies. The [[neoclassical economics|classical view]] holds that international macroeconomic interdependence is only relevant if it affects domestic output gaps and inflation, and monetary policy prescriptions can abstract from openness without harm.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Clarida, R., Galí, J., Gertler, M. (2002). A simple framework for international policy analysis. ''Journal of Monetary Economics'', 49(4), pp. 879–904.&lt;/ref&gt; This view rests on two implicit assumptions: a high responsiveness of import prices to the exchange rate, i.e. producer currency pricing (PCP), and frictionless international financial markets supporting the efficiency of flexible price allocation.&lt;ref name="Corsetti, G. 2005 pp. 281-305"&gt;Corsetti, G., Pesenti, P. (2005). International dimensions of optimal monetary policy. ''Journal of Monetary Economics'', 52(2), pp. 281–305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, M.B., Engel, C. (2003). Monetary policy in the open economy revisited: Price setting and exchange rate flexibility. ''Review of Economic Studies'', 70(4), pp. 765–783.&lt;/ref&gt; The violation or distortion of these assumptions found in empirical research is the subject of a substantial part of the international optimal monetary policy literature. The policy trade-offs specific to this international perspective are threefold:&lt;ref name="corsettidedolaleduc"&gt;Cf. Corsetti, G., Dedola, L., Leduc, S. (2011). Optimal Monetary Policy in Open Economies. In B.M. Friedman and M. Woodford (Eds.). ''Handbook of Monetary Economics, vol. III. Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

First, research suggests only a weak reflection of exchange rate movements in import prices, lending credibility to the opposed theory of local currency pricing (LCP).&lt;ref&gt;Gopinath, G., Rigobon, R. (2008). Sticky borders. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 123(2), pp. 531–575.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence is a departure from the classical view in the form of a trade-off between output gaps and misalignments in international relative prices, shifting monetary policy to CPI inflation control and real exchange rate stabilization.

Second, another specificity of international optimal monetary policy is the issue of strategic interactions and competitive devaluations, which is due to cross-border spillovers in quantities and prices.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Persson, T., Tabellini, G. (1995). Double-edged incentives: Institutions and policy coordination. In G. Grossman and K. Rogoff. ''Handbook of International Economics, vol. III''. Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Therein, the national authorities of different countries face incentives to manipulate the [[terms of trade]] to increase national welfare in the absence of international policy coordination. Even though the gains of international policy coordination might be small, such gains may become very relevant if balanced against incentives for international noncooperation.&lt;ref name="Corsetti, G. 2005 pp. 281-305"/&gt;

Third, open economies face policy trade-offs if asset market distortions prevent global efficient allocation. Even though the real exchange rate absorbs shocks in current and expected fundamentals, its adjustment does not necessarily result in a desirable allocation and may even exacerbate the misallocation of consumption and employment at both the domestic and global level. This is because, relative to the case of complete markets, both the Phillips curve and the loss function include a welfare-relevant measure of cross-country imbalances. Consequently, this results in domestic goals, e.g. [[output gap]]s or inflation, being traded-off against the stabilization of external variables such as the terms of trade or the demand gap. Hence, the optimal monetary policy in this case consists of redressing demand imbalances and/or correcting international relative prices at the cost of some inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/econ/workshop/Spring%202012/Dedola-imbalances-madison.pdf|title=Cf. Corsetti, G., Dedola, L., Leduc, S. (2011). Demand imbalances, real exchange rate misalignments and monetary policy. Draft version, December 2011|author=|date=|website=wisc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corsetti, Dedola and Leduc (2011)&lt;ref name="corsettidedolaleduc"/&gt; summarize the status quo of research on international monetary policy prescriptions: "Optimal monetary policy thus should target a combination of inward-looking variables such as output gap and inflation, with currency misalignment and cross-country demand misallocation, by leaning against the wind of misaligned exchange rates and international imbalances." This is main factor in country money status.

===In developing countries===
Developing countries may have problems establishing an effective operating monetary policy. The primary difficulty is that few developing countries have deep markets in government debt. The matter is further complicated by the difficulties in forecasting money demand and fiscal pressure to levy the inflation tax by expanding the base rapidly. In general, the central banks in many developing countries have poor records in managing monetary policy. This is often because the monetary authority in developing countries are mostly not independent of the government, so good monetary policy takes a backseat to the political desires of the government or are used to pursue other non-monetary goals. For this and other reasons, developing countries that want to establish credible monetary policy may institute a currency board or adopt [[dollarization]]. This can avoid interference from the government and may lead to the adoption of monetary policy as carried out in the anchor nation. Recent attempts at liberalizing and reform of financial markets (particularly the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions in Nigeria and elsewhere) are gradually providing the latitude required to implement monetary policy frameworks by the relevant central banks.

==Trends==

===Transparency===
Beginning with New Zealand in 1990, central banks began adopting formal, public [[inflation targeting|inflation targets]] with the goal of making the outcomes, if not the process, of monetary policy more transparent. In other words, a central bank may have an inflation target of 2% for a given year, and if inflation turns out to be 5%, then the central bank will typically have to submit an explanation. The [[Bank of England]] exemplifies both these trends. It became independent of government through the Bank of England Act 1998 and adopted an inflation target of 2.5% RPI, revised to 2% of CPI in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monetary Policy Framework|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pages/framework/framework.aspx|publisher=Bank of England|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of inflation targeting in the United Kingdom has been attributed to the Bank of England's focus on transparency.&lt;ref name=IMF01&gt;{{cite web|title=Targeting Inflation: The United Kingdom in Retrospect|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000/targets/strach7.pdf|publisher=IMF|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bank of England has been a leader in producing innovative ways of communicating information to the public, especially through its Inflation Report, which have been emulated by many other central banks.&lt;ref name=NBER01&gt;{{cite web|title=Inflation Targeting Has Been A Successful Monetary Policy Strategy|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/apr98/w6126.html|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]]|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Central Bank]] adopted, in 1998, a definition of [[price stability]] within the [[Eurozone]] as inflation of under 2% [[Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices|HICP]]. In 2003, this was revised to inflation below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Since then, the target of 2% has become common for other major central banks, including the [[Federal Reserve]] (since January 2012) and [[Bank of Japan]] (since January 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noyer|first1=Christian|title=Thoughts on the zero lower bound in relation with monetary and financial stability|url=https://www.bis.org/review/r160115c.htm?ql=1|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|accessdate=18 January 2016|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on business cycles===
There continues to be some debate about whether monetary policy can (or should) smooth [[business cycles]]. A central conjecture of [[Keynesian economics]] is that the central bank can stimulate [[aggregate demand]] in the short run, because a significant number of prices in the economy are fixed in the short run and firms will produce as many goods and services as are demanded (in the long run, however, money is neutral, as in the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical model]]). However, some economists from the [[new classical macroeconomics|new classical school]] contend that central banks cannot affect business cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seidman |first=Laurence |title=Reply to: "The New Classical Counter-Revolution: False Path or Illuminating Complement?" |journal=Eastern Economic Journal |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=563–565 |jstor=20642378 |date=Fall 2007|subscription=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral monetary policy===
Conventional macroeconomic models assume that all agents in an economy are fully rational. A [[rational agent]] has clear preferences, models uncertainty via expected values of variables or functions of variables, and always chooses to perform the action with the optimal expected outcome for itself among all feasible actions – they maximize their [[utility]]. Monetary policy analysis and decisions hence traditionally rely on this [[New Classical]] approach.&lt;ref name="Cuthbertson"&gt;Cuthbertson, K., Nitzsche, D. and Hyde, S.(2008). Monetary policy and behavioral finance. Journal of Economic Surveys, 21(5), pp. 935-969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Favaretto &amp; Masciandaro, 2016"&gt;Favaretto, F. and Masciandaro, D. (2016). Doves, hawks and pigeons: Behavioral monetary policy and interest rate inertia. Journal of Financial Stability, 27, pp. 50-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hommes"&gt;Hommes, C., Massaro, D. and Weber, M. (2015). Monetary Policy under Behavioral Expectations: Theory and Experiment. Tinbergen Institute Discussion Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Rustamli &amp; Abbas, 2014"&gt;Rustamli, N. and Abbas, G. (2014). Monetary policy: psychology and expectations. Academic Views, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, as studied by the field of [[behavioral economics]] that takes into account the concept of [[bounded rationality]], people often deviate from the way that these neoclassical theories assume.&lt;ref name="Rustamli &amp; Abbas, 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen, 2007"&gt; Yellen, J.L. (2007). Implications of Behavioral Economics for Monetary Policy.  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Conference: "Implications of Behavioral Economics for Economic Policy".&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are generally not able to react fully rational to the world around them&lt;ref name="Hommes"/&gt; – they do not make decisions in the rational way commonly envisioned in standard macroeconomic models. People have time limitations, [[cognitive biases]], care about issues like fairness and equity and follow rules of thumb ([[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name="Yellen, 2007"/&gt;

This has implications for the conduct of monetary policy. Monetary policy is the final outcome of a complex interaction between monetary institutions, central banker preferences and policy rules, and hence human decision-making plays an important role.&lt;ref name="Favaretto &amp; Masciandaro, 2016"/&gt; It is more and more recognized that the standard rational approach does not provide an optimal foundation for monetary policy actions. These models fail to address important human anomalies and behavioral drivers that explain monetary policy decisions.&lt;ref name="Calabria, 2016"&gt;Calabria, M. (2016). Behavioral Economics and Fed Policymaking. Cato Journal, 36(3), pp. 573-587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Favaretto &amp; Masciandaro, 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hommes"/&gt;

An example of a behavioral bias that characterizes the behavior of central bankers is [[loss aversion]]: for every monetary policy choice, losses loom larger than gains, and both are evaluated with respect to the status quo.&lt;ref name="Favaretto &amp; Masciandaro, 2016"/&gt; One result of loss aversion is that when gains and losses are symmetric or nearly so, risk aversion may set in. Loss aversion can be found in multiple contexts in monetary policy. The "hard fought" battle against the Great Inflation, for instance, might cause a bias against policies that risk greater inflation.&lt;ref name="Calabria, 2016"/&gt; 
Another common finding in behavioral studies is that individuals regularly offer estimates of their own ability, competence, or judgments that far exceed an objective assessment: they are overconfident. Central bank policymakers may fall victim to 
[[overconfidence]] in managing the macroeconomy in terms of timing, magnitude, and even the qualitative impact of interventions. Overconfidence can result in actions of the central bank that are either "too little" or "too much". When policymakers believe their actions will have larger effects than objective analysis would indicate, this results in too little intervention. Overconfidence can, for instance, cause problems when relying on interest rates to gauge the stance of monetary policy: low rates might mean that policy is easy, but they could also signal a weak economy.&lt;ref name="Calabria, 2016"/&gt;

These are examples of how behavioral phenomena may have a substantial influence on monetary policy.&lt;ref name="Rustamli &amp; Abbas, 2014"/&gt; Monetary policy analyses should thus account for the fact that policymakers (or central bankers) are individuals and prone to biases and temptations that can sensibly influence their ultimate choices in the setting of macroeconomic and/or interest rate targets.&lt;ref name="Favaretto &amp; Masciandaro, 2016"/&gt;

The '''National Union for the Progress of Romania''' ({{lang-ro|Uniunea Națională pentru Progresul României}}, '''UNPR''') was a political party of [[Romania]]. The party was formed in March 2010 by independents who had broken away from the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) to support President [[Traian Băsescu]]. Tension began soon after the party's formation between former PSD and PNL members over the distribution of leadership positions and the political direction of the new party, with former PSD members dominating. The first party congress to elect its leaders was on 1 May 2010.&lt;ref name="SETimes"&gt;{{Citation |title=New Romanian party elects leaders |newspaper=SETimes |date=2 May 2010 |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2010/05/02/nb-13 |accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2016, former President [[Traian Băsescu]] announced that UNPR would merge with his [[People's Movement Party]] on 20 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/unpr-fuzioneaza-prin-absorbtie-cu-pmp-basescu-gabriel-oprea-ramane-doar-cu-onoarea-partidul-nu-mai-e-dupa-fuziune-partidul-se-va-numi-partidul-miscarea-populara-15525263|title=UNPR fuzionează prin absorbţie cu PMP/ Băsescu: Gabriel Oprea rămâne doar cu onoarea, partidul nu mai e după fuziune.

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

In 2009, parliamentarians from PSD, PNL, and other organizations left their political parties to support President [[Traian Băsescu]]. They formed the parliamentary group of independents, led by Senator [[Gabriel Oprea]]. Afterward, Oprea was named [[Minister of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Minister of Administration and Interior]].

In 2010, the majority of the group formed UNPR. On 1 May 2010, the new party elected its leaders, by Congress. Allied with the PDL and UDMR, UNPR participated in government until 2012. At the first party congress held in May 2010, [[Marian Sârbu]] was elected president. In 2011, the [[National Initiative Party]] (PIN) merged into the Union. PIN's president, [[Lavinia Șandru]], became UNPR's vice-president but later resigned from the party citing its lack of support for her ecologist policies.

In 2012, the government led by [[Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu]] was dismissed by [[motion of censure]] and UNPR passed in opposition. On 28 May 2012, Sârbu stepped down as party leader. Following Sârbu's resignation, Gabriel Oprea was elected UNPR president.  UNPR later formed with PSD, with the [[Centre Left Alliance|Center-Left Alliance]] (ACS) included in the [[Social Liberal Union]].

[[Cristian Diaconescu]], a founding member of UNPR, honorary president and former Minister of External Affairs, resigned from the union after the party changed sides and entered the Social Liberal Union. He is an independent with close ties to the right-wing conservative former President of Romania, [[Traian Băsescu]], who appointed him as leader of the Presidential Chancellery in March 2012.

In the Romanian Parliamentary elections of December 2012, UNPR won in alliance with PSD, PNL, and PC with 10 seats in the House of Deputies and five in the Senate. Because the party lacks the necessary number of seats to form a distinct parliamentary group (12 deputies, seven senators), their parliamentarians joined the group of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). They voted for the government led by Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]]. Oprea has served as deputy prime minister since 2013.

On 29 June 2015, the party absorbed the [[People's Party – Dan Diaconescu]] (PP-DD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/oprea-am-incheiat-o-fuziune-prin-absobtie-cu-pp-dd-suntem-un-partid-al-usilor-deschise-14516518|title=Oprea: Am încheiat o fuziune prin absobţie cu PP-DD.

== Doctrine ==
UNPR's doctrine is [[Social-democracy|social-democratic]] with shades of [[progressivism]]. The union is against [[right wing]] policies, [[Conservatism|conservative]] and net-conservative.  The union's self reported doctrine is "progressive left-wing" with social-democratic orientation.  UNPR believes in a new political and economic order, based on consolidation of the [[market economy]], in an "active state" that protects [[citizen]]s and [[human rights]]. The union considers itself a progressive party. UNPR strongly supports significant wealth tax and fair taxes. UNPR's platform also includes the [[decentralization]] of Romania. The union supports public order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Structure ==
The president acts as the union's governing body; he represents the party in political conversations and parliament. The president has large powers in the union and is helped by the standing Bureau of the Union.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[File:Aerial view of the new Bagram Theater Internment Facility.jpg|thumb|500px|Aerial view of the Parwan Detention Facility during its completion in 2009.]]
The '''Parwan Detention Facility''' (also called '''Detention Facility in Parwan''') is [[Afghanistan]]'s main [[military prison]]. Situated next to the [[Bagram Air Base]] in the [[Parwan Province]] of Afghanistan, the prison was built by the United States during the Bush Administration. The Parwan Detention Facility, which houses foreign and local [[Unlawful combatant|combatants]] ([[terrorism|terrorists]]), is maintained by the [[Afghan National Army]].

It was formerly known by the United States as the Bagram Collection Point. While initially intended as a temporary facility, it has been used longer and handled more detainees than the US [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bagram-detention-centre-now-twice-the-size-of-guantanamo-768803.html|title=Bagram detention centre now twice the size of Guantanamo|date=January 8, 2008|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2011, the Parwan detention facility held 1,700 prisoners; there had been 600 prisoners under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. None of the prisoners has received [[POW]] status.&lt;ref name="bush"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2008/07/03/afghanistan/|title=Bush vows more troops for Afghanistan, but Mullen doesn't have them|first=Steve|last=Benen|website=Salon|accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of inmates at the facility has been under scrutiny since two Afghan detainees died in the 2002 [[Bagram torture and prisoner abuse]] case. Their deaths were classified as homicides and prisoner abuse charges were made against seven American soldiers. Concerns about lengthy detentions here have prompted comparisons to U.S. detention centers in [[Guantanamo Bay]] on Cuba and [[Abu Graib]] in Iraq. Part of the internment facility is called the [[Black jail]].&lt;ref name="salon1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChurchReport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Mar2005/d20050310exe.pdf|title=ISTF Final Report|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]|author=[[Vice Admiral]] [[Albert T.

After the removal of the Taliban and the formation of the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]], the United States took control of the base. It did not need the volume of hangar space, so it built a detention facility inside the large unused hangars. Like the first facilities later built at Guantanamo's [[Camp X-Ray]], the cells were built of [[wire mesh]]. Only captives held in [[solitary confinement]] have individual cells.&lt;ref name=RadioFreeEurope20061005/&gt; The other captives share larger open cells with other captives.

According to some accounts, captives were provided with shared buckets to use as toilets, and did not have access to running water.&lt;ref name=MoazzamBeggBBush&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/csrt_arb/publicly_filed_CSRT_records_2869-2990.pdf#62|title=Moazzqam Begg v.

During an interview on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], Chris Hogan, a former interrogator at Bagram, described the prisoners' cells as they were in early 2002.&lt;ref name=NowPbs20060728&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/230/detention-facilities.html|title=Interview: Chris Hogan on U.S. Detention Facilities|date=July 28, 2006|publisher=[[NOW (PBS)|NOW]]|accessdate=September 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I can't speak to what the conditions may be like now. But in my tenure, the prison population lived in an abandoned Soviet warehouse. The warehouse had a cement floor and it was a huge square-footage area.

On the floor of that, what must have been some sort of an airplane hangar, six prison cages were erected, which were divided by [[concertina wire]]&amp;nbsp;... Those prison cages had a wooden floor, a platform built above the cement floor of the hangar. Each prisoner had a bunch of blankets, a small mat, and in the back of each one of those cages was a makeshift toilet, the same type of toilet that the soldiers used, which was a 50-gallon drum, halved with diesel fuel put in the bottom of it and a wooden kind of seat to that platform&amp;nbsp;... It's very similar, incidentally, to the conditions that the soldiers lived in; almost identical.}}

According to an article by [[Tim Golden (journalist)|Tim Golden]], published in the January 7, 2008 issue of the ''[[New York Times]],'' captives in the Bagram facility were still being housed in large communal pens.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20080107&gt;

Permanent replacement facilities for the original temporary facilities of 2001 were completed in September 2009.&lt;ref name=TheNation2009-11-16&gt;

[[Brigadier General]] [[Mark Martins]], Bagram's commandant, told reporters that the facility had always met international and domestic standards.

Although the new facility is near the previous facility, DoD sources sometimes refer to it as the Parwan facility, rather than Bagram.&lt;ref name=Afps-2010-08-06&gt;

On December 11, 2014, the US Armed Forces transferred the facility to the Afghan government.

==Torture and prisoner abuse==
{{Main|Bagram torture and prisoner abuse}}
At least two deaths have been verified in the last decade: captives are known to have been [[beaten]] to death by [[G.I. (military)|GI]]s manning the facility, in December 2002.&lt;ref name=DoD20041014&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=6450|title=Army completes investigations of deaths at Bagram and forwards to respective commanders for action|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|date=October 14, 2004|accessdate=September 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224110128/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=6450 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captives who were confined to both Bagram and the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] have recounted that, while in Bagram, they were warned that if they did not cooperate more fully, they would be sent to a worse site in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=CsrtAbdullahKhan1&gt;[{{DoD detainees ARB|Set_52_3643-3869.pdf}} Allegations and response (.pdf)], from

Captives who have compared the two camps have said that conditions were far worse in Bagram.&lt;ref name=NyTimes050520&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/20/international/asia/20abuse.html?ei=5088&amp;en=4579c146cb14cfd6&amp;ex=1274241600&amp;pagewanted=all|title=In U.S. Report, Brutal Details of 2 Afghan Inmates' Deaths|author=[[Tim Golden (journalist)|Tim Golden]]|publisher=New York Times|date=May 20, 2005|accessdate=March 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, nine Afghan former detainees reported to the ICRC that they had been held in a separate facility (known as the [[black jail]]) where they had been subject to isolation in cold cells, sleep deprivation, and other forms of [[torture]]. The U.S. military denies there is a separate facility for detainees.&lt;ref name="BBC20100511Andersson"/&gt;

In early 2012, Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]] ordered that control of the Parwan Detention Facility be handed over to Afghan authorities after some inmates complained of being [[strip search]]ed and put in [[solitary confinement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/karzai-demands-us-hand-over-bagram-prison-133056568.html Karzai demands US hand over Bagram prison] January 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/karzai-demands-us-hand-over-prison-to-afghans-20120106-1pohr.html|title=Karzai demands US hand over prison to Afghans|first1=Jon|last1=Boone|first2=|last2=Kabul|date=January 7, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=July 24, 2017|via=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/war-zones/karzai-demands-transfer-of-us-military-prison-to-afghan-control/2012/01/05/gIQAm5b9cP_story.html|title=Karzai demands transfer of U.S. military prison near Bagram to Afghan control|first=|last=https://www.facebook.com/kevin.sieff|website=Washington Post|accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High profile escapes==
When the GIs implicated in the December 2002 homicides were about to face [[court martial]], four prisoners escaped from Bagram.  At least one of these was a prosecution witness, and was thus unable to testify.&lt;ref name="Bbc20070227"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl"&gt;{{Cite news|first=|last=|authorlink=|author=|title=Afghanistan: Manhunt Continues For Four Suspected Al-Qaeda Fighters|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/07/a6ae2509-293d-4750-b82b-b459ac860440.html|work=|publisher=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty|id=|pages=|page=|date=July 12, 2005|accessdate=|language=|quote=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status of detainees==
The [[George W. Bush administration]] avoided using the label "[[prisoner of war]]" when discussing the detainees held at Bagram, preferring to immediately classify them as "[[unlawful enemy combatants]]".  This way, it is not necessary under the [[Geneva Conventions]] to have a [[competent tribunal]] determine their classification.  (In previous conflicts such as the [[Vietnam War]], [[Army Regulation 190-8 Tribunal]]s determined the status of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].)

The administration also initially argued that these detainees could not access the US legal system.  However, the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' confirmed that captives in US jurisdiction did indeed have the right to access US courts. ''Rasul v. Bush'' determined that the [[Executive Branch]] did not have the authority, under the [[United States Constitution]], to suspend the right for detainees to submit [[habeas corpus|writs of habeas corpus]].

Another consequence of the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Rasul v. Bush'' was the establishment of [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s to review and confirm the information that initially led each captive to be classified as an enemy combatant.  The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) convened these tribunals for every captive in Guantanamo Bay, but they did not apply to Bagram. The current legal process governing the status of Bagram captives is the Enemy Combatant Review Board, described by [[Eliza Griswold]] in ''[[The New Republic]]'':

{{Quote|Prisoners don't even have the limited access to lawyers available to prisoners in Guantánamo. Nor do they have the right to Combatant Status Review Tribunals, which Guantánamo detainees won in the 2004 Supreme Court ruling in ''Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.'' Instead, if a combat commander chooses, he can convene an Enemy Combatant Review Board (ECRB), at which the detainee has no right to a personal advocate, no chance to speak in his own defense, and no opportunity to review the evidence against him. The detainee isn't even allowed to attend. And, thanks to such limited access to justice, many former detainees say they have no idea why they were either detained or released.}}

On February 20, 2009, the Department of Justice under President [[Barack Obama]] announced it would continue the policy that detainees in Afghanistan could not challenge their detention in US courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/obama-administration-backs-bush-grants-no-rights-to-bagram-prisoners-1.860853|title=Obama administration backs Bush, grants no rights to Bagram prisoners|newspaper=CBC News|language=en|access-date=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2009 [[US District Court Judge]] [[John D. Bates]] ruled that those Bagram captives who had been transferred from outside Afghanistan could use habeas corpus.&lt;ref name=Bbc2009-04-02&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7979885.stm|title=Foreign detainees 'have US right'|publisher=BBC News|date=April 2, 2009|accessdate=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[BBC]]'' quoted Ramzi Kassem, lawyer for one of the men:

{{quote|Today, a US federal judge ruled that our government cannot simply kidnap people and hold them beyond the law.}}

The [[Obama administration]] appealed the ruling.  A former [[Guantanamo Bay attorneys|Guantanamo Bay defense attorney]], [[Neal Katyal]], led the government's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112861671|author=Shapiro, Ari|title=Rights Groups Decry U.S. Stand on Bagram Detainees|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=September 15, 2009|accessdate=March 8, 2010|authorlink=Ari Shapiro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0110/A_Gitmo_bar_turncoat.html|author=Gerstein, Josh|title=A Gitmo bar turncoat?|publisher=[[The Politico]]|date=January 5, 2010|accessdate=March 8, 2010|authorlink=Josh Gerstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was reversed on May 21, 2010, the appeals court unanimously ruling that Bagram detainees have no right to habeas corpus hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/world/asia/22detain.html|author=Savage, Charlie|title=Detainees Barred From Access to U.S. Courts|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|There is a reason we have never allowed enemy prisoners detained overseas in an active war zone to sue in federal court for their release. It simply makes no sense and would be the ultimate act of turning the war into a crime.|Senator [[Lindsey Graham]]}}

==Captives access to video link==
On January 15, 2008 the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and the US military set up a pilot project to allow certain well behaved prisoners not in solitary confinement in Bagram to communicate with visitors over a videolink.&lt;ref name=IcrcVideoLink20080115&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://southasia.oneworld.net/article/view/156921/1/1893|title=Visual chat facility for Afghan prisoners|publisher=[[One World South Asia]]|date=January 15, 2008|accessdate=January 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118200650/http://southasia.oneworld.net/article/view/156921/1/1893|archive-date=January 18, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ICRC will provide captives' families with a subsidy to cover their travel expenses to the video-link's studio.

==General Douglas Stone's report on the Bagram captives==

According to senior officials who have been briefed by [[Major General]] [[Douglas M. Stone (general)|Douglas Stone]], he reports, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;up to 400 of the 600 prisoners at the U.S.-run prison at the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan have done nothing wrong and should be released.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Daphne Eviatar, writing in the ''[[Washington Independent]]'', Stone recommended that the USA should try to rehabilitate any genuine enemies it holds, rather than simply imprisoning them.

==General Stanley McChrystal's assessment==
According to Chris Sands, writing in ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'', in a leaked report General [[Stanley McChrystal]] wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Committed Islamists are indiscriminately mixed with petty criminals and sex offenders, and they are using the opportunity to radicalise and indoctrinate them&amp;nbsp;... hundreds are held without charge or without a defined way ahead.&lt;ref name=TheNational2009-10-15&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are more insurgents per square foot in corrections facilities than anywhere else in Afghanistan. Unchecked, Taliban/al-Qaida leaders patiently co-ordinate and plan, unconcerned with interference from prison personnel or the military.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Detainees==
{{main|Detainees held in the Bagram Theater Internment Facility}}

Josh Gerstein, of [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]], reported [[Tina Foster]], director of the [[International Justice Network]], and a lawyer who represents four Bagram captives, was critical of the new rules:

The Americans say it is impossible to build legal cases against all prisoners arrested in battlefield conditions. Afghan news media reported that a dispute over this practice led to a falling-out between Karzai and General John R. Allen, the American military commander in Afghanistan, over the weekend and apparently prompted the downgraded American presence at the ceremony.&lt;ref name="NYT20120910" /&gt;

The transition of prisons from American to Afghanistan control means prisoners leave their cells in one of the remaining American-controlled buildings and are taken to new cells in a building controlled by Afghans, but where American personnel will still be present in an advisory role until at least March 2013 under the March 9, 2012 agreement. An Afghan committee sorts the detainees into two groups: One group awaits criminal prosecution, and the other will be referred to a review board, which evaluates them and recommends whether to keep holding them without trial as wartime detainees. As of September 5, 2012 638 detaines have been approved for criminal prosecution, and 963 have been referred to the review board.&lt;ref name="NYT20120905"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. to Retain Role as a Jailer in Afghanistan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/world/asia/us-will-hold-part-of-afghan-prison-after-handover.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=September 13, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 5, 2012|author=Charlie Savage and Graham Bowley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States military will maintain control over dozens of foreign detainees in Bagram for the indefinite future.&lt;ref name="NYT20120905" /&gt; "If we keep these people with us in this current situation and deal with them, this will create more problems for us," General Ghulam Farouk, the Afghan official who runs the Afghan-controlled portions of Parwan, said. "Therefore it is better for the Americans to keep them."&lt;ref name="NYT20120905" /&gt; Further, although thousands of Afghan detainees have already been turned over, the United States will continue to hold and screen newly captured Afghans for a time, ensuring continued American involvement in detention and interrogation activities.&lt;ref name="NYT20120905" /&gt;

Since the Memorandum's signing the U.S. has transferred 3,082 detainees&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120910" /&gt; to Afghan control according to Afghan Army General Ghulam Farouk. He said on September 10, 2012 that the U.S. was in the process of transferring the remaining 30 inmates picked up before the memorandum was signed plus another 600 captured after the signing. But a few weeks ago, the U.S. stopped all transfers.&lt;ref name="APHP20120910" /&gt; A coalition official told CNN the United States is holding on to several Afghan detainees because of concerns about whether Afghan authorities will properly handle their cases and under what circumstances they might be released. The U.S. also is keeping several prisoners of other nationalities who were not part of the agreement the source said.&lt;ref name="CNN20120911" /&gt; "Some 99 percent of the detainees captured before 9 March have already been transferred to Afghan authority, but we have paused the transfer of the remaining detainees until our concerns are met," said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition.&lt;ref name="APHP20120910" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20120910" /&gt; Graybeal would not describe the concerns, but a report released in early September 2012 by the New York-based Open Society Foundations said the rift was over whether the Afghans will have a so-called "internment" system that allows some detainees to be held without charge or trial. The U.S. has been holding detainees in internment at Bagram for years. Although the Afghan government agreed to embrace an internment system by signing the accord in March, some top Afghan officials and legal experts contend it violates the Afghan constitution, the report said. Moreover, Karzai himself is opposed to administrative detention (Detaines are held without access to lawyers, public trials or other legal rights&lt;ref name="NYT20120330"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nordland|first=Rob|title=Detainees Are Handed Over to Afghans, but Not Out of Americans' Reach|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/world/asia/in-afghanistan-as-bagram-detainees-are-transferred-united-states-keeps-its-grip.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=September 13, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), according to the report. The U.S. is now worried that the Afghan government will discontinue internment and either release dangerous detainees or forward their cases to the loosely run Afghan judicial system, which is tainted by corruption and secrecy, the group said.&lt;ref name="APHP20120910" /&gt; "There are concerns on the U.S. side about division in the Afghan government over internment and that it is not constitutional," said Rachel Reid, a senior policy adviser on Afghanistan for the Open Society Foundations. "The basic concern is that if they don't have internment, they will be released."&lt;ref name="APHP20120910" /&gt; On the flip side of the legal issue, some Afghan legal experts are worried about Afghan officials abusing any authority to hold detainees without trial. "Consider the fact that even our regular laws are ignored by powerful people," said Abdul Qawi Afzali of the Legal Aid Organization Afghanistan. "What will happen when you give them the actual, legal power to detain people like this law does?"&lt;ref name="APHP20120910" /&gt;

The US military still wants to run a section of the jail and is not handing over hundreds of detainees, saying it has the right to hold insurgents caught on the battlefield said the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Kabul.&lt;ref name="BBCNews20120910" /&gt; They include individuals from Pakistan, Tunisia, Yemen and detainees transferred to Bagram from other wars, such as Iraq.

In a statement it was said that the hand-over followed after a week of negotiations between US and Afghan officials "which includes assurances that inmates who "pose a danger" to Afghans and international forces will continue to be detained under Afghan law".&lt;ref&gt;Aljazeera news: [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/03/201332534437116216.html US hands over Bagram prison to Afghanistan], March 25, 2013. visited: March 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Segregation by health===
In 1894, the deadly [[Third plague pandemic|Third Pandemic]] of [[Bubonic plague]] spread from China to Hong Kong, causing 100,000 deaths in [[Guangdong|Canton]] alone within two months.&lt;ref name="Cohn 2003 336"/&gt; Dr. Gomes da Silva, the Principal Medical Officer of [[Macao]], in recording the sanitary condition of the Chinese population, observed that they usually threw house refuse into the street, where it accumulated until such time as the torrential summer rains and the overflow of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] cleared it away.  A study by [[City University of Hong Kong]] also attributes the spread of plague to the hygiene and sanitary condition among local population at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cciv.cityu.edu.hk/website/?redirect=/field/2000-2001-b/0224B/index.php Early history of medical service in Hong Kong(香港早期醫療服務)], City University of Hong Kong. Retrieved 8 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor of Hong Kong]] [[William Robinson (Governor of Hong Kong)|Sir William Robinson]] reported to the British Government that "the filthy habits of life amongst the 210,000 Chinese who reside here have rendered Hong Kong liable to the invasion and development of the germ of the bubonic plague".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In the late 1890s, Europeans who resided in the [[Victoria, Hong Kong|City of Victoria]] gradually moved to places of higher altitude to evade such living conditions. But as the Chinese population continued to increase in the city, and the Europeans were reaching [[Victoria Peak]] thus could not move any higher, the [[Hong Kong Government]] decided to reserve the Peak for Europeans and other non-Chinese. The 1904 Government Gazette explained that such reservation of the district was to address such concerns over the health of European people.&lt;ref name="Jason" /&gt;
Between 1894 and 1929, the plague caused 24,000 case of infection in Hong Kong, of which 90% were fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the plague was eradicated and the law was repealed in 1930.

===Segregation by social status===
Some historians believe the Hill District Reservation Ordinance is a law based on social segregation as its goal.  At the time one's social status was measured by the altitude of one's residence.&lt;ref name="Wilt" /&gt; One incidental benefit that came with the law included the reservation of the [[Peak Tram]] at certain hours of the day.&lt;ref name="Wilt" /&gt; From 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;am, the tram service was for top officials, first class passengers only, thus guaranteed good commute time.&lt;ref name="Wilt" /&gt; The front seat of the tram was always reserved for the governor, who further accorded its desirable social status by building a summer retreat, the [[Mountain Lodge]].&lt;ref name="Wilt" /&gt; The Peak at the time was referred to by the British as "Little England".&lt;ref name="HKstory"&gt;Courtauld, Caroline. Holdsworth, May. The Hong Kong Story. Hong Kong publishing, Oxford university press. {{ISBN|0-19-590353-6}}. pg 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the upper-middle class household members would have a dozen to 20 Chinese servants.&lt;ref name="HKstory" /&gt;

**It applied to parts of the City of Victoria that already had European-style [[Single-family detached house]]s. The Ordinance was classified as a town planning and rent control law under [[william Des Vœux|Governor Des Vœux]]'s administration. It required buildings in certain areas of Hong Kong to comply with the [[single-family detached home]] model, rather than the native, extremely crowded, Chinese model that land owners usually offered, which maximised profits. There was no exclusion by race, only by the type of buildings that could be built and a limit on the number of occupants.&lt;ref name="Tubbs"&gt;{{Cite book

==Exemption==
The ordinance stated that "It shall be lawful for the [[Governor-in-Council]] to exempt any Chinese from the operation of this Ordinance on such terms as the Governor-in-Council shall think fit". Such exemptions were invoked for such personalities as First Lady of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]]&lt;ref name="Jason"/&gt; and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] millionaire [[Robert Hotung|Sir Robert Ho-Tung]] and his family.&lt;ref name="Wilt" /&gt;

The complex '''politics of [[global warming]]''' results from numerous cofactors arising from the global economy's interdependence on carbon dioxide ({{CO2|link=yes}}) emitting [[hydrocarbon]] energy sources and because {{CO2}} is directly implicated in global warming&lt;ref name="AP-20151129"&gt;{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |title=Earth is a wilder, warmer place since last climate deal made |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151129/eu-climate-countdown-since-1997-edf9d62e51.html |date=29 November 2015 |accessdate=29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20151128"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=What the Paris Climate Meeting Must Do |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/opinion/sunday/what-the-paris-climate-meeting-must-do.html |date=28 November 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=28 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150525"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rudd |first=Kevin |title=Paris Can't Be Another Copenhagen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/opinion/kevin-rudd-paris-cant-be-another-copenhagen.html |date=25 May 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=26 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20151128-jg"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gillis |first=Justin |title=Short Answers to Hard Questions About Climate Change |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/28/science/what-is-climate-change.html |date=28 November 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—making global warming a non-traditional environmental challenge.

==Overview==
# '''Implications to all aspects of a nation-state's economy''': The vast majority of the world economy relies on energy sources or manufacturing techniques that release [[greenhouse gas]]es at almost every stage of production, transportation, storage, delivery &amp; disposal while a [[Scientific opinion on climate change|consensus of the world's scientists]] attribute [[global warming]] to the release of {{CO2}} and other [[greenhouse gas]]es.  This intimate linkage between global warming and economic vitality implicates almost every aspect of a nation-state's economy;&lt;ref name="The Dartmouth"&gt;{{cite web|title="Voices" speaker talks climate change |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2012/08/03/news/climate|publisher=The Dartmouth|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Perceived lack of adequate advanced energy technologies''': Fossil fuel abundance and low prices continue to put pressure on the development of adequate advanced energy technologies that can realistically [[Fossil fuel phase-out|replace the role of fossil fuels]]—{{as of|2010|lc=y}}, over 91% of the world's energy is derived from fossil fuels and non-carbon-neutral technologies.&lt;ref name="Mary S.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing countries do not have cost effective access to [[Renewable energy in developing countries|the advanced energy technologies that they need for development]] (most advanced technologies has been developed by and exist in the developed world).  Without adequate and cost effective post-hydrocarbon energy sources, it is unlikely the countries of the developed or developing world would accept policies that would materially affect their economic vitality or economic development prospects;
# '''Industrialization of the developing world''': As developing nations industrialize their energy needs increase and since conventional energy sources produce {{CO2}}, the {{CO2}} emissions of developing countries are beginning to rise at a time when the scientific community, global governance institutions and advocacy groups are telling the world that {{CO2}} emissions should be decreasing.  Without access to cost effective and abundant energy sources many developing countries see climate change as a hindrance to their unfettered economic development;
# '''Metric selection (transparency) and perceived responsibility / ability to respond''': Among the countries of the world, disagreements exist over which greenhouse gas emission metrics should be used like total emissions per year, per capita emissions per year, CO2 emissions only, deforestation emissions, livestock emissions or even total historical emissions. Historically, the release of {{CO2}} has not been historically even among all nation-states and nation-states have challenges with determining who should restrict emissions and at what point of their industrial development they should be subject to such commitments;
# '''Vulnerable developing countries and developed country legacy emissions''': Some developing nations blame the developed world for having created the global warming crisis because it was the developed countries that emitted most of the {{CO2}} over the twentieth century and vulnerable countries perceive that it should be the developed countries that should pay to address the challenge;
# '''Consensus-driven global governance models''': The global governance institutions that evolved during the 20th century are all consensus driven deliberative forums where agreement is difficult to achieve and even when agreement is achieved it is almost impossible to enforce;
# '''Well organized and funded special-interest lobbying bodies''': Special interest lobbying by well organized groups distort and amplify aspects of the challenge (environmental lobbying, [[fossil fuels lobby|energy industry lobbying]], other special interest lobbying);
# '''Politicization of climate science''': Although there is a consensus on the science of global warming and its likely effects—some special interests groups [[climate change denial|work to suppress the consensus]] while others work to amplify the alarm of global warming.  All parties that engage in such acts add to the politicization of the science of global warming.  The result is a clouding of the reality of the global warming problem.

The focus areas for global warming politics are [[Adaptation to global warming|Adaptation]], [[Mitigation of global warming|Mitigation]], Finance, Technology and Losses which are well quantified and studied but the urgency of the global warming challenge combined with the implication to almost every facet of a nation-state's economic interests places significant burdens on the established largely-voluntary global institutions that have developed over the last century; institutions that have been unable to effectively reshape themselves and move fast enough to deal with this unique challenge.  Rapidly developing countries who see traditional energy sources as a means to fuel their development, well funded aggressive environmental lobbying groups and an established fossil fuel energy paradigm boasting a mature and sophisticated political lobbying infrastructure all combine to make global warming politics extremely polarized.  Distrust between developed and developing countries at most international conferences that seek to address the topic add to the challenges.  Further adding to the complexity is the advent of the Internet and the development of media technologies like blogs and other mechanisms for disseminating information that enable the exponential growth in production and dissemination of competing points of view which make it nearly impossible for the development and dissemination of an objective view into the enormity of the subject matter and its politics.

==Nontraditional environmental challenge==
Traditional environmental challenges generally involve behavior by a small group of industries who create products or services for a limited set of consumers in a manner that causes some form of damage to the environment which is clear.  As an example, a gold mine might release a dangerous chemical byproduct into a waterway that kills the fish in the waterway: a clear environmental damage.&lt;ref name=arsenic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scidev.net/en/south-asia/news/arsenic-poisoning-stalks-india-s-gold-mines.html|title=Arsenic poisoning stalks India's gold mines |website=SciDev}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, {{CO2|link=yes}} is a naturally occurring colorless odorless trace gas that is essential to the biosphere.  Carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) is produced by all animals and utilized by plants and algae to build their body structures.  Plant structures buried for tens of millions of years sequester carbon to form coal, oil and gas which modern industrial societies find essential to economic vitality. Over 80% of the worlds energy is derived from {{CO2}} emitting fossil fuels and over 91% of the world's energy is derived from non [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] energy sources. Scientists attribute the increases of {{CO2}} in the atmosphere to industrial emissions and scientists have linked {{CO2}} to global warming.  However, the scientific consensus is difficult for the average individual layperson to readily see and grasp. This essential nature to the world's economies combined with the complexity of the science and the interests of countless interested parties make climate change a non-traditional environmental challenge.

{{Main|World energy consumption}}

The vast majority of developed countries rely on {{CO2}} emitting energy sources for large components of their economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/publications/world-energy-statistics-supply-and-demand.php Global Energy Review in 2011, Enerdata Publication]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fossil fuel energy generally dominates the following areas of an OECD economy:
* agriculture (fertilizers, irrigation, plowing, planting, harvesting, pesticides)
* transportation &amp; distribution (automobiles, shipping, trains, airplanes)
* storage (refrigeration, warehousing)
* national defense (armies, tanks, military aircraft, manufacture of munitions)

In addition, {{CO2}} emitting fossil fuels many times dominate the utilities aspect of an economy that provide electricity for:
* lighting
* heating &amp; cooling
* refrigeration
* production of products
* computing and telecommunications

Also, activities like cement production, deforestation, brick production, livestock raising, refrigeration and other industrial activity contributes greenhouse gases that together are believed to account for 1/3 of global warming.

Because {{CO2}} emitting fossil fuels are intrinsically connected to a developed nation-state's economy, the taxation of fossil fuels or policies that decrease the availability of cost-effective fossil fuels is a significant political matter for fear that those taxes might precipitate a decrease in economic vitality.  The replacement of cost-effective fossil fuels with more expensive renewable energy sources are seen by many as a hidden tax that would achieve the same result of depressing economic vitality and lead to impoverishment.  Beyond the economic vitality of a single nation, some are concerned that taxation would depress economic activity in a manner that could affect the geopolitical order by providing incentives to one set of countries over another.

In developing countries the challenges are slightly different.  Developing countries see {{CO2}} emitting fossil fuels as a cost effective and proven energy source to fuel their growing economies.  Sometimes renewable energy technologies are not readily available to developing countries because of cost or due to export restrictions from developed countries who own those technologies.

===Perceived lack of adequate advanced energy technologies===
[[Image:Total World Energy Consumption by Source 2010.png|400px|Right|thumb|In 2010, renewable energy accounted for 16.7% of total [[energy consumption]] but [[Biomass heating system|Biomass energy]] which releases {{CO2}} and is not carbon-neutral accounted for 11.4%, leaving only 4.9% for carbon-neutral renewables ([[hydropower]] 3.3% and 1.56% for all others).]]

{{See also|Peak Oil|Fossil Fuels|Solar Energy|Wind Energy|Renewable Energy}}
Carbon dioxide emitting fossil fuels continue to be abundant and their prices are consequently low accounting in 2010 for over 80% of the world's energy needs.&lt;ref name="Mary S. Booth"/&gt; Advanced recovery technologies like horizontal drilling, offshore oil production, and oil sand recovery technologies continue to push back the threshold of [[Peak Oil]] and with it the high prices seen necessary to foster the development of viable alternative energy technologies that can replace fossil fuels in a post-hydrocarbon economy. Renewables in 2010 accounted for 16.7% of the world's energy, however [[Biomass heating system|Biomass energy]] accounted for 11.4% meaning that non-carbon dioxide producing renewables accounted for only 4.9% of the world's energy use with the vast majority of that renewable energy coming from hydroelectric production at 3.34% further leaving 1.56% of renewable energy derived from newer advanced technologies like ethanol, biodiesel, wind, solar, ocean power and geothermal (see graph to right).

The biomass-is-carbon-neutral proposal put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree's carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades.&lt;ref name="Mary S. Booth"/&gt; Current studies indicate that "even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage" and "the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest".&lt;ref name="cc-fffce"&gt;Edmunds, Joe; Richard Richets; Marshall Wise, "Future Fossil Fuel Carbon Emissions without Policy Intervention: A Review". In T. M. L. Wigley, David Steven Schimel, ''The carbon cycle''. Cambridge University Press, 2000, pp.171–189&lt;/ref&gt;

After adjustment, carbon neutral renewables account for 4.9% of the world's energy needs in 2010 with solar accounting for .23% and wind for 0.51% of total world energy need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent optimistic projections from the EIA and the IEA show that renewables will account for one sixth of global energy production in the next few decades (which includes [[Biomass heating system|Biomass energy]]), substantially below what is needed to significantly curtail {{CO2}} emissions.

Without help developing countries usually do not have access to the advanced energy technologies like wind and solar that they require for development forcing them to rely on hydrocarbon energy sources like fossil fuels and biomass. Without adequate and cost effective post-hydrocarbon energy sources, it is very unlikely the countries in developed or developing world would accept policies that would materially affect their economic vitality or economic development prospects.  To date, developing countries have resisted adopting verifiable {{CO2}} targets for fear of impacts to their economies and the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Belarus and Ukraine have either not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol or have chosen to not accept a second commitment period leaving the Kyoto Protocol extension covering only 15% of global {{CO2}} emissions.  A strong contributor to these decisions is that the existing technologies are not yet adequate to replace the role of fossil hydrocarbon fuels.

Arguments have been made that [[energy subsidies|fostering renewable energy through subsidies]] and other adoption-mechanisms are the path towards increasing the percentage of carbon-neutral renewable technologies that are used. According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] (2011) energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers, raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production. "Fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits. Subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits".&lt;ref name=IEA-FS2011&gt;[http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf World Energy Outlook 2011 Factsheet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204112700/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }} How will global energy markets evolve to 2035? IEA November 2011 6 pages&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, an IEA report entitled ''Deploying Renewables 2011'' said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand. "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," the IEA said, and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=Nov 23, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Fossil-fuel consumption subsidies]] were $409 billion in 2010, oil products ca half of it. Renewable-energy subsidies were $66 billion in 2010 and will reach according to IEA $250 billion by 2035. Renewable energy is subsidized in order to compete in the market, increase their volume and develop the technology so that the subsidies become unnecessary with the development. Eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies could bring economic and environmental benefits. Phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies by 2020 would cut primary energy demand 5%. Since the start of 2010, ''at least 15 countries have taken steps to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies. '' According to IEA onshore wind may become competitive around 2020 in the European Union.&lt;ref name="IEA-FS2011"/&gt;

{{main|Developing world|Newly industrialized country}}

The developing world sees economic and industrial development as a natural right and the evidence shows that the developing world is industrializing.  The developing world is leveraging the use of {{CO2}} emitting fossil fuels as one of the primary energy sources to fuel their development.  At the same time the scientific consensus on climate change and the existing global governance bodies like the United Nations are urging all countries to decrease their {{CO2}} emissions.  Developing countries logically resist this lobbying to decrease their use of fossil fuels without significant concessions like:
* advanced energy technologies
* advanced adaptation technologies
* monies to adapt to climate change.

===Metric selection and perceived  responsibility / ability to respond===
{{main|Political economy of climate change}}

There are significant disagreements over which metrics to use when tracking global warming and there are also disagreements over which countries should be subject to emissions restrictions.

While the biosphere is indifferent to whether the greenhouse gases are produced by one country or by a multitude, the countries of the world do express an interest in such matters.  As such disagreements arise on whether per capita emissions should be used or whether total emissions should be used as a metric for each individual country.  Countries also disagree over whether a developing country should share the same commitment as a developed country that has been emitting {{CO2}} and other greenhouse gases for close to a century.

Some developing countries expressly state that they require assistance if they are to develop, which is seen as a right, in a fashion that does not contribute {{CO2}} or other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.  Many times, these needs materialize as profound differences in global conferences by countries on the subject and the debates quickly turn to pecuniary matters.

Most developing countries are unwilling to accept limits on their {{CO2}} and other greenhouse gas emissions while most developed countries place very modest limits on their willingness to assist developing countries.  In addition, most developed countries would rather not participate in greenhouse gas reduction treaties if those would lead to decreased economic activity, transfers of wealth to developing countries, or significant shifts in the geopolitical balance of power of the world.

===Vulnerable developing countries and developed country legacy emissions===
{{See also| Political economy of climate change|Climate Vulnerable Forum}}
Some developing countries fall under the category of vulnerable to climate change.  These countries involve small, sometimes isolated, island nations, low lying nations, nations who rely on drinking water from shrinking glaciers etc.  These vulnerable countries see themselves as the victims of climate change and some have organized themselves under groups like the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]].  These countries seek mitigation monies from the developed and the industrializing countries to help them adapt to the impending catastrophes that they see climate change will bring upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Climate change compensation emerges as major issue at Doha talks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/dec/03/climate-change-compensation-doha-talks|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=3 December 2012|location=London|first=John|last=Vidal|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these countries climate change is seen as an existential threat and the politics of these countries is to seek reparation and adaptation monies from the developed world and some see it as their right.

==Governance==

===Global warming politics focus areas===
{{See also|Adaptation to global warming|Mitigation of global warming}}
Government politics regarding climate change and many official reports on the subject usually revolve around addressing one of the following topic areas:
* '''Adaptation''': social and other changes that must be undertaken to successfully [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt to climate change]].  Adaptation might encompass, but is not limited to, changes in agriculture and urban planning.
* '''Finance''': how countries will finance [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] to and [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] of climate change, whether from public or private sources or from wealth/technology transfers from developed countries to developing countries and the management mechanisms for those monies.
* '''Mitigation''': steps and actions that the countries of the world can take to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]]  the effects of climate change.
* '''Technology''': the technologies that are needed lower carbon emissions through increasing energy efficiency or replacement or {{CO2}} emitting technologies and technologies needed to adapt or mitigate climate change.  Also encompasses ways that developed countries can support developing countries in adopting new technologies or increasing efficiency.
* '''Loss and damage''': first articulated at the 2012 conference and in part based on the agreement that was signed at the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]]. It introduces the principle that countries vulnerable to the effects of climate change may be financially compensated in future by countries that fail to curb their carbon emissions.

===Consensus-driven global political institutions===
{{See also| United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change}}

The primary mechanism for the world to tackle global warming is through a process established under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) treaty. The current state of global warming politics is that there is frustration over a perceived lack of progress with the establish [[UNFCCC]] overall process which has progressed over eighteen years but which has been unable to curb global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.  Todd Stern—the US Climate Change envoy—has expressed the challenges with the UNFCCC process as follows, "Climate change is not a conventional environmental issue ... It implicates virtually every aspect of a state's economy, so it makes countries nervous about growth and development. This is an economic issue every bit as it is an environmental one."  He went on to explain that, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a multilateral body concerned with climate change and can be an inefficient system for enacting international policy. Because the framework system includes over 190 countries and because negotiations are governed by consensus, small groups of countries can often block progress.&lt;ref name="The Dartmouth"/&gt;

The eighteenth conference of the parties held in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], yielded minor to modest results.  At the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2012 Doha climate change talks]], Parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed to an extension of the Kyoto Protocol to 2020.&lt;ref name="ritter 2012 doha talks"&gt;

As a result, some have argued that perhaps the consensus driven model could be replaced with a majority vote model.  However, that model would likely drive disagreement at the country-level-ratification by countries who disagreed with any global treaties that might passed through a majority vote at such restructured institutions.

The perceived slow process of efforts for countries to agree to a comprehensive global level binding agreements has led some countries to seek independent/voluntary steps and focus on alternative high-value voluntary activities like the creation of the [[Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants]] by the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sweden]] which seeks to regulate short-lived pollutants such as methane, black carbon and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) which together are believed to account for up to 1/3 of current global warming but whose regulation is not as fraught with wide economic impacts and opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary Clinton To Announce a Climate and Clean Air Initiative To Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184011.htm|publisher= US Dept of State|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants]] (CCAC) was launched on February 16, 2012 to regulate short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) that together contribute up to 1/3 of global warming. The coalition's creation is seen as a necessary and pragmatic step given the slow pace of global climate change agreements under the UNFCCC.[1]

As part of the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2010 Cancún agreements]], 76 developed and developing countries have made voluntary pledges to control their emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="king 2011 cancun agreement"&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;  These voluntary steps are seen by some as a new model where countries pledge to voluntarily take action against global warming outside of international treaties or obligations to other parties.  This voluntary mechanism, while promising, does not address many of the challenges seen by the developing world in their efforts to mitigate global warming, adapt to global warming, and increasingly to deal with losses and damages that they directly attribute to global warming that they blame on the developed world's historical emissions.

==Special interests and lobbying by non-country interested parties==

[[File:BoiseDSAClimateChangeMarchers.jpg|thumb|right|Global warming has attracted the attention of [[far left]] groups, as here with the [[Democratic Socialists of America]].]]
There are numerous special interest groups, PACs, organizations, corporations who have public and private positions on the multifaceted topic of global warming.  The following is a partial list of the types of special interest parties that have demonstrated an interest in the politics of global warming:
* '''Financial Institutions''': Financial institutions generally support restrictive policies regarding global warming, particularly the implementation of carbon trading schemes and the creation of market mechanisms that associate a price with carbon.  These new markets would require trading infrastructures which banking institutions are well positioned to provide.  Financial institutions would also be positioned well to invest, trade and develop various financial instruments that they could profit from through speculative positions on carbon prices and the use of brokerage and other financial functions like insurance and derivative instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Banking on carbon trading: Can banks stop climate change?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/07/18/eco.carbontrading/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=22 February 2013|date=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Environmental groups''': Environmental groups generally take ideological positions on global warming and favor strict restrictions on {{CO2}} emissions.  Environmental groups, as activists, engage in raising awareness and attracting investment into the advocacy movement to further raise awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=The climate lobby from soup to nuts | url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/2009/12/27/5479/climate-lobby-soup-nuts | publisher=Center for Public Integrity| accessdate=23 February 2013| date=2009-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fossil fuel companies''': Traditional fossil fuel corporations could benefit or lose from stricter global warming regulations.  A reduction in the use of fossil fuels could negatively impact fossil fuel corporations.&lt;ref name="Michaels"&gt;David Michaels (2008) ''[[Doubt is Their Product]]: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoggan"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Cover-Up: The Crusade to Deny Global Warming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQYjQzOkYK0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Climate+Cover-Up:+The+Crusade+to+Deny+Global+Warming&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=|first1=James |last1=Hoggan |first2=Richard |last2=Littlemore |publisher=Greystone Books |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-1-55365-485-8 |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-03-19}} See, e.g., p31 ''ff'', describing industry-based advocacy strategies in the context of climate change denial, and p73 ''ff'', describing involvement of free-market think tanks in climate-change denial.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the fact that fossil fuel companies are a large source of energy, are also the primary source of {{CO2}}, and are engaged in energy trading might mean that their participation in trading schemes and other such mechanisms might give them a unique advantage and makes it unclear whether traditional fossil fuel companies would all and always be against stricter global warming policies.  As an example, Enron, a traditional gas pipeline company with a large trading desk heavily lobbied the government for the EPA to regulate CO2: they thought that they would dominate the energy industry if they could be at the center of energy trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enron Sought Global Warming Regulation, Not Free Markets |url=http://cei.org/op-eds-and-articles/enron-sought-global-warming-regulation-not-free-markets |publisher=Competitive Enterprise Institute |accessdate=4 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921200526/http://cei.org/op-eds-and-articles/enron-sought-global-warming-regulation-not-free-markets |archivedate=21 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Alternative energy companies''': alternative energy companies like wind and solar generally support stricter global warming policies.  They would expect their share of the energy market to expand as fossil fuels are made more expensive through trading schemes or taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Under Obama, Spain's Solar, Wind Energy Companies Invest Big In US|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/18/obama-spain-energy_n_2496471.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=22 February 2013|date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nuclear energy companies''': nuclear energy companies could see a renaissance in a world where fossil fuels are taxed directly or through a carbon trading mechanism.  For this reason, it is likely that nuclear energy companies would likely support stricter global warming policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pro-Nukes Environmental Movement |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/nuclear_power/2013/01/nuclear_energy_and_climate_change_environmentalists_debate_how_to_stop_global.html|publisher=Slate Institute|accessdate=22 February 2013|date=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Traditional retailers and marketers''': traditional retailers, marketers, and the general corporations respond  by adopting policies that resonate with their customers.  If "being green" helps a general corporation, then they could undertake modest programs to please and better align with their customers.  However, since the general corporation does not make a profit from their particular position, it is unlikely that they would strongly lobby either for or against a stricter global warming policy position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 25 Big Companies That Are Going Green|url=http://www.businesspundit.com/25-big-companies-that-are-going-green/|publisher=Business Pundit|accessdate=22 February 2013|date=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Governments''': On the Australian Sunday morning political discussion show ''[[The Bolt Report]]'', [[Richard Lindzen]] said in a 2011 interview that governments might use global warming as a rationale for additional taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 26 Interview with Richard Lindzen|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NDfwkr8hig/|publisher=Bolt|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various interested parties sometimes align with one another to reinforce their message.  Sometimes industries will fund specialty nonprofit organizations  to raise awareness and lobby on their behest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Climate change lobbying dominated by 10 firms|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0509/22723.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Greenpeace informal alliance with Wind and Solar|url=http://activistcash.com/organizations/131-greenpeace/|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The combinations and tactics that the various interested parties use are nuanced and sometimes unlimited in the variety of their approaches to promote their positions onto the general public.

== Interaction of climate science and actual policy ==
{{main|Global warming controversy| Politicization of science|Knowledge policy}}

In the [[scientific literature]], there is a [[scientific opinion on climate change|strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased]] in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="OreskesBeyondTheIvoryTower"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2010-SciPanel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USNAS-2008-ClimateChoices" /&gt; With regard to the global warming controversy, the scientific mainstream puts neither doubt on the existence of [[global warming]] nor on its causes and [[Effects of global warming|effects]].

The politicization of science in the sense of a manipulation of science for political gains is a part of the political process.

==History==
Historically, the politics of climate change dates back to several conferences in the late 1960s and the early 1970s under NATO and President Richard Nixon.  1979 saw the world's first [[World Climate Conference]].  1985 was the year that the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] was created and two years later in 1987 saw the signing of the [[Montreal Protocol]] under the Vienna convention.  This model of using a Framework conference followed by Protocols under the Framework was seen as a promising governing structure that could be used as a path towards a functional governance approach that could be used to tackle broad global multi-nation/state challenges like global warming.

One year later in 1988 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] was created by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] to assess the risk of human-induced climate change. [[Margaret Thatcher]] 1988 strongly supported IPCC and 1990 was instrumental to found the [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]] in Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/04/thatchers-climate-change-greatest-hits How Margaret Thatcher Made the Conservative Case for Climate Action], James West, [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]], Mon Apr. 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/04/08/margaret_thatcher_s_environmental_record_she_was_a_climate_hawk.html An Inconvenient Truth About Margaret Thatcher: She Was a Climate Hawk], Will Oremus, [[Slate (magazine)]] April 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the book [[The First Global Revolution]] was published by the [[Club of Rome]] report which sought to connect environment, water availability, food production, energy production, materials, population growth and other elements into a blueprint for the twenty-first century: political thinking was evolving to look at the world in terms of an integrated global system not just in terms of weather and climate but in terms of energy needs, food, population, etc.

1992 was the year that the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] ([[UNFCCC]]) was agreed at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the framework entered into force 21 March 1994.  The conference established a yearly meeting, a conference of the parties or COP meeting to be held to continue work on Protocols which would be enforceable treaties
[[File:CO2 emission pie chart.svg|thumb|Global [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|carbon dioxide emissions]] by country.]]

1995 saw the creation of the phrase "preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system" (also called ''[[avoiding dangerous climate change]]'') first appeared in a policy document of a governmental organization, the IPCC's Second Assessment Report: Climate Change 1995.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC 1995. [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/climate-changes-1995/ipcc-2nd-assessment/2nd-assessment-en.pdf Second Assessment Report: Climate change 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1996 the [[European Union]] adopt a goal of limiting temperature rises to a maximum 2&amp;nbsp;°C rise in average global temperature.

In 1997 the [[Kyoto Protocol]] was created under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] ([[UNFCCC]]) in a very similar structure as the [[Montreal Protocol]] was under the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] which would have yearly meetings of the members or CMP meetings.  However, in the same year, the [[US Senate]] passed [[Byrd–Hagel Resolution]] rejecting Kyoto without more commitments from developing countries.&lt;ref name="NatCent.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalcenter.org/KyotoSenate.html |title=Byrd-Hagel Resolution (S. Res. 98) Expressing the Sense of the Senate Regarding Conditions for the US Signing the Global Climate Change Treaty |publisher=Nationalcenter.org |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102063407/http://www.nationalcenter.org/KyotoSenate.html |archivedate=2 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1992 [[UNFCCC]] treaty, eighteen COP sessions and eight CMP sessions have been held under the existing structure.  In that time, global CO2 emissions have risen significantly and developing countries have grown significantly with [[China]] replacing the [[United States]] as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  To some, the UNFCCC has made significant progress in helping the world become aware of the perils of global warming and has moved the world forward in the addressing of the challenge. To others, the UNFCCC process has been a failure due to its inability to control the rise of greenhouse gas emissions.

A number of proposals for a [[Global Climate Regime]] are currently discussed, as the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference#Durban Platform|Durban Platform for Enhanced Action]] calls for a comprehensive new agreement in 2015 that includes both [[List of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Annex-I and Non-Annex-I parties]].

 |quote=(p1) ... there is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines of research, documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities. While much remains to be learned, the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. * * * (p21-22) Some scientific conclusions or theories have been so thoroughly examined and tested, and supported by so many independent observations and results, that their likelihood of subsequently being found to be wrong is vanishingly small. Such conclusions and theories are then regarded as settled facts. This is the case for the conclusions that the Earth system is warming and that much of this warming is very likely due to human activities.

'''Porglish''' or '''Portuglish''' (referred to in Portuguese as ''portinglês'' – &lt;small&gt;[[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian]]: &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|pɔʁtʃĩˈɡles|}}, &lt;small&gt;[[European Portuguese|European]]: &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|puɾtĩˈɡleʃ|}} – or ''portunglês'' – &lt;small&gt;pt-BR: &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|poʁtũˈɡles|}}, &lt;small&gt;pt-PT: &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|puɾtũˈɡleʃ|}}) refers to various types of [[language contact]] between [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[English language|English]] which have occurred in regions where the two languages coexist. These range from improvised [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] admixture of and [[code-switching]] between the languages by bilingual and partially bilingual users, to more-or-less stable patterns of usage.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The name is a [[portmanteau]] of the English words ''Portuguese'' and ''English'', while its Portuguese translation is a portmanteau of the Portuguese words ''português'' and ''inglês''.

This kind of [[pidgin]]{{dubious|date=February 2016|reason="Pidgin" has a precise linguistic definition, and it's highly unlikely this qualifies. This is a very bold claim and requires reliable sources.}} is rare but observable in [[Macau]] and other [[Portuguese language in Asia|Portuguese-speaking regions in Asia and Oceania]], among English-speaking expatriates and tourists in [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]], and Portuguese speakers in countries of the [[English-speaking world]], primarily in North America and Oceania, but also Africa, South America, Caribbean and Asia. The best-studied example of this is spoken in the Portuguese communities in [[California]], in [[Hawaii]] (pidgin contributions) and in the region between [[Fall River]] and [[New Bedford]] in Southeastern [[Massachusetts]].

==As code-switching==
It is the name often given to any unsystematic mixture of Portuguese with English ([[code-switching]]). This is sometimes used by speakers of the two languages to talk to each other.

Portuglish is similar to [[Spanglish]], and it is basically composed of combined English and Portuguese lexicon and a Portuguese grammar.

==Examples==

===Among [[Brazilian American]]s and others===
Many of these examples can also apply to other [[Lusophone]] diasporas as Portuguese speakers raised in an English-speaking environment, and English speakers learning Portuguese, or any otherwise native speakers of one language used to the other.

Note: Those with ** are generally accepted in colloquial Brazilian Portuguese as this language variety is more open to receive [[loanword]]s than its European standard counterpart. ''Deletar'', ''escanear'' and ''resetar'' are even very unlikely to be deemed as unacceptable words in the standard norm of Brazil as much more recently used ''bullying'', instead of pre-existing Portuguese words as ''bulimento'' ([[bullying]]), ''bulir'' (to bully) and ''bulidor'' (bully), has been promoted from [[slang]] and now it is accepted in the variety's educated norm, to the dismay of some [[Language purism|language purists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} ['Bullying' is a bullying to the Portuguese language – Estadão's general topics http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,bullying-e-bulir-com-a-lingua-portuguesa,726993,0.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Forms of government}}

A '''protectorate''', in its inception adopted by modern [[international law]], is a [[dependent territory]] that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the [[suzerainty]] of a greater [[sovereign state]]. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from [[colony|colonies]] as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of [[settler]]s from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a '''protected state''' and is different from protectorates.

==Rationale==

===Amical protection===
In amical protection, the terms are often very favorable for the protectorate. The political interest of the protector is frequently moral (a matter of accepted moral obligation, prestige, ideology, internal popularity, [[dynasty|dynastic]], historical, or ethno-cultural ties) or countering a rival or enemy power (e.g., preventing the rival from obtaining or maintaining control of areas of strategic importance). This may involve a very weak protectorate surrendering control of its external relations; this, however, may not constitute any real sacrifice, as the protectorate may not have been able to have similar use of them without the protector's strength.

Amical protection was frequently extended by the [[great power]]s to other Christian (generally European) states and to smaller states that had no significant importance{{Ambiguous|date=November 2011}}. In the post-1815 period, non-Christian states (such as [[#Chinese|China's Qing dynasty]]) also provided amical protection towards other much weaker states.

In modern times, a form of amical protection can be seen as an important or defining feature of [[microstate]]s. According to the definition proposed by Dumienski (2014): "microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Microstates_OccasionalPaper.pdf|title= Microstates as Modern Protected States: Towards a New Definition of Micro-Statehood|last= Dumieński|first= Zbigniew|date= 2014|journal= |access-date=20 August 2014|doi= |pmid= |publisher= Centre for Small State Studies|series= Occasional Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include [[Bhutan]],&lt;ref name="Bedjaoui1991"&gt;{{citation|last=Bedjaoui|first=Mohammed|title=International Law: Achievements and Prospects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrTsNTzcY7EC&amp;pg=PA51|year=1991|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=92-3-102716-6|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liechtenstein]], [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], [[Niue]], [[the Cook Islands]], and [[Palau]].

===Colonial protection of the International Law===
Conditions regarding protection are generally much less generous for areas of colonial protection. The protectorate was often reduced to a ''[[de facto]]'' condition similar to a colony, but using the pre-existing [[princely state|native state]] as an agent of [[indirect rule]]. Occasionally, a protectorate was established by or exercised by the other form of indirect rule: a [[chartered company]], which becomes a ''de facto'' state in its European home state (but geographically overseas), allowed to be an independent country which has its own foreign policy and generally its own armed forces.

In fact, protectorates were declared despite not being duly entered into by the traditional states supposedly being protected, or only by a party of dubious authority in those states. Colonial protectors frequently decided to reshuffle several protectorates into a new, artificial unit without consulting the protectorates, a logic disrespectful of the theoretical duty of a protector to help maintain its protectorates' status and integrity. The [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin agreement]] of February 26, 1885 allowed the colonial powers to establish protectorates in [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Black Africa]] (the last region to be divided among them) by diplomatic notification, even without actual possession on the ground. A similar case is the formal use of such terms as ''colony'' and ''protectorate'' for an amalgamation, convenient only for the colonizer or protector, of adjacent territories over which it held (''de facto'') sway by protective or "raw" colonial logic.

===Foreign relations===
In practice, a protectorate often has direct [[diplomacy|foreign relations]] only with the [[protecting power]], so other states must deal with it by approaching the protector. Similarly, the protectorate rarely takes military action on its own, but relies on the protector for its defence. This is distinct from [[annexation]], in that the protector has no formal power to control the internal affairs of the protectorate.

Protectorates differ from [[League of Nations mandate]]s and their successors, [[United Nations Trust Territories]], whose administration is supervised, in varying degrees, by the international community. A protectorate formally enters into the protection through a bilateral agreement with the protector, while international mandates are stewarded by the world community-representing body, with or without a ''de facto'' administering power.

==Belgian protectorates==
{{See also|Ruanda-Urundi}}
During the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] of World War I, the north-west part of [[German East Africa]], [[Ruanda-Urundi]], was invaded by Belgian and Congolese troops in 1916 and was still occupied by them at the end of the war in 1918. As part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] the major part of [[German East Africa]] was handed over to British control but Ruanda-Urundi, twice the size of Belgium but only about 2% of the size of the Congo, was confirmed as a Belgian protectorate by a [[League of Nations mandate]] in 1924, later renewed as a [[United Nations Trust Territory]]. The territory was granted independence in 1962 as the separate countries of [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]], bringing the Belgian colonial empire to an end.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
The legal regime of "protection" was the formal legal structure under which [[French colonial empire|French colonial forces]] expanded in Africa between the 1830s and 1900. Almost every pre-existing state in the area later covered by [[French West Africa]] was placed under protectorate status at some point, although [[wikt:direct rule|direct rule]] gradually replaced protectorate agreements. Formal ruling structures, or fictive recreations of them, were largely retained as the lowest level authority figure in the French [[Cercle (French colonial)|Cercles]], with leaders appointed and removed by French officials.&lt;ref&gt;See the classic account on this in Robert Delavignette.

==German protectorates==
The [[German Empire]] used the word ''{{lang|de|Schutzgebiet}}'', literally protectorate, for all of its colonial possessions until they were lost during World War I, regardless of the actual level of government control. Cases involving indirect rule included:
*[[German New Guinea]]
*[[Marshall Islands]]
*[[Nauru]], various officials posted with the Head Chiefs
*Northern [[Solomon islands]]
*[[Samoa]], formerly Western Samoa
*Sultanate of Witu, called [[Wituland]], in present-day Kenya
*[[German South-West Africa]] (later [[Namibia]])
*[[Togoland]]
*[[Rwanda]], a Resident with the native Mwami (king)
*[[Urundi]], a Resident with the native Mwami (king; 1908 Sultan)

During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] designated the rump of occupied [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Denmark]] as a protectorate:
*[[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], 1939–1945
*[[Denmark in World War II|Kingdom of Denmark]], 1940-1943

==Italian protectorates==
In Europe:
*[[Albania]] (1917–1920 and 1939–1940)
*[[Independent State of Croatia]] (1941–1943)
*[[Monaco]] under amical Protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia 20 November 1815 to 1860.

In the colonial empire:
*[[Ethiopia]]: 2 May 1889 [[Treaty of Wuchale]], in the [[Italian language]] version, stated that Ethiopia was to become an Italian protectorate, while the Ethiopian [[Amharic language]] version merely stated that the Emperor could, if he so chose, go through Italy to conduct foreign affairs. When the differences in the versions came to light, [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] abrogated first the article in question (XVII), and later the whole treaty. The event culminated in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]], in which Ethiopia was victorious and defended her sovereignty in 1896.
*[[Libya]]: on 15 October 1912 Italian protectorate declared over [[Cirenaica]] (Cyrenaica) until 17 May 1919.
*[[Somalia]]: 3 August 1889 [[Benadir Coast]] Italian protectorate (in the northeast; unoccupied until May 1893), until 16 March 1905 when it changed to [[Italian Somaliland]].
**[[Majerteen#The Majeerteen Sultanates|Majeerteen Sultanate]] since 7 April 1889 under Italian protectorate (renewed 7 April 1895), then in 1927 incorporated into the Italian colony.
**[[Sultanate of Hobyo]] since December 1888 under Italian protectorate (renewed 11 April 1895), then in October 1925 incorporated into the Italian colony (known as ''Obbia'').

===Contemporary usage by the United States===
Some agencies of the [[United States government]], such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], still use the term protectorate to refer to [[insular area]]s of the United States such as [[Guam]], [[the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]. This was also the case with the [[Philippines]] and (it can be argued via the [[Platt Amendment]]) Cuba at the end of Spanish [[colonialism|colonial rule]]. [[Liberia]] was the only African nation that was a colony for the [[United States]] but the government had no control over the land as it was controlled by the privately owned American Colonization Society. It was, however, a protectorate from January 7, 1822 until the [[Liberian Declaration of Independence]] from the American Colonization Society in July 26, 1847. Liberia was founded and established as a homeland for freed [[African-Americans]] and ex-Caribbean slaves who left the [[United States]] and the Caribbean islands with help and support from the [[American Colonization Society]]. However, the agency responsible for the administration of those areas, the [[Office of Insular Affairs]] (OIA) within the [[United States Department of Interior]], uses only the term "insular area" rather than protectorate.

==United Nations protectorates==
*[[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] (then known as West New Guinea or West Irian): [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]] (1962–1963)
*[[Cambodia]]: [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (1992–1993)

*[[East Timor]]: [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (1999–2002)
*[[Kosovo]]: [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (since 1999)

==Joint protectorates==
{{Further|Condominium (international law)}}
*The Adriatic [[Republic of Ragusa]] (present-day Dubrovnik in Croatian Dalmatia) was a joint Habsburg Austrian–[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] protectorate from 20 August 1684 to 24 August 1798 (exceptionally both a Catholic and a Muslim protector).
*The [[United States of the Ionian Islands]] were a federal [[Septinsular Republic]] of seven formerly Venetian (see [[Provveditore]]) Ionian islands ([[Corfu]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Zante]], [[Santa Maura]], [[Ithaca]], [[Cerigo]], and [[Paxos]]), officially under joint protectorate of the Allied Christian Powers, de facto a UK amical protectorate from 1815 to 1864.
*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were a joint Austrian and Hungarian protectorate since 1878 which formally still belonged to the Ottoman Empire until 1908 when it was annexed by Austria-Hungary (see [[Bosnian crisis]]). Since the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]], Bosnia and Herzegovina is again sometimes described as a ''de facto'' international protectorate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6159">'''Quautlatas''' (Northern Tepehuán pronunciation: /quäutlˈätäs/) was a [[Tepehuán]] religious leader who inspired the bloody [[Tepehuán Revolt]] against the [[Spanish empire|Spanish]] in [[Mexico]] in 1616. Quautlatas was known as "The Tepehuán Prophet".

==The Tepehuán and the Spanish==

The Tepehuán were an agricultural people who lived primarily in the future Mexican state of [[Durango]] on the eastern slopes of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]].  Early Spanish explorers described them as numerous but, apparently, a series of epidemics of introduced European diseases reduced their numbers by more than 80 percent.  By the time of the revolt their numbers may have been only about 10,000&lt;ref&gt;Gradie, Charlotte M. ''The Tepehuan Revolt of 1616.'' Salt Lake City: U of UT Press, 2000, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;   
Spanish silver miners and ranchers began settling in the Tepehuán lands in the 1570s and [[Jesuit]] missionaries began work among them in 1596.  The Tepehuán seemed relatively receptive to the missionaries and by 1615  a Jesuit could declare that the Tepehuán “showed great progress and were in the things of our holy faith very Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;Gradie, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;  

What the Jesuits and other Spaniards did not fully comprehend was that the Tepehuán were a people under enormous stress. The recurrent epidemics impoverished them and destroyed their faith in their traditional culture.  The missionaries tried to convert them to Christianity by abolishing their religious practices, replacing their leaders with Christians, and introducing Spanish customs.  Both missionaries and [[encomenderos]] demanded their labor in the mines and the missions and on the ranches.  The missionaries perceived they were doing God’s work by baptizing Indians dying of disease; the Indians equated baptism with death.&lt;ref&gt;Gradie, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==The prophet==

In early 1616, an elderly traditional religious leader, Quautlatas, rose to leadership among the Tepehuán and promised to lead them out of bondage.  Quautlatas had been baptized a Christian and his message to his people had Christian elements in it.  He called himself a bishop and carried a broken cross as his idol.  To placate the gods, he said, the Tepehuán “would have to cut the throats” of all Christians.  “It they did not do this they would receive a terrible punishment in the form of illnesses, plagues, and famine.  But if they obeyed him, he promised them…victory over the Spaniards.  Even if some of them should die in battle, he promised them that within seven days they would be resurrected….God would create storms at seas, sinking the Spanish ships and thus preventing additional Spaniards from reaching these lands.”&lt;ref&gt;Perez de Ribas, tr. Reff, Daniel T.  ''History of the Triumphs of our Holy Faith amongst the most Barbarous and Fierce Peoples of the New World''.  Tucson: U of AZ Press, 1999, pp. 594-595&lt;/ref&gt;      

Quautlatas message was typical of [[millenarianism|millennial]] movements such as the [[Pueblo Revolt]] led by another messianic figure, [[Popé]], in the same century, and much later events such as the [[Ghost Dance]] in the U.S. and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in [[China]].  Quautlatas promised divine intervention to return to an idealized past in which the plagues and suffering brought upon the Tepehuán by the Spanish would disappear.  

The principal chronicler of the [[Tepehuán Revolt]], the Jesuit priest [[Andres Perez de Ribas]], cited the [[devil]] as causing the revolt.  It was not mistreatment by the Spanish which caused the revolt but rather “[[Satan]] who intervened here, with a pure scheme and design, which was received by these blind people.  It enraged their spirit to take up arms against the faith of Christ and all that was Christianity…..This was most clearly demonstrated by the diabolical shamans who had intimate dealings with the Devil and were the main force and instigators of the uprising.”  Perez de Ribas compared Quautlatas with the [[antiChrist]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Reff, Daniel T. “The ‘Predicament of Culture’ and Spanish Missionary Accounts of the Tepehuán and Pueblo Revolts.” ''Ethnohistory'' 42:1 (winter 1995), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Revolt==

Quautlatas did not lead the Tepehuán in the revolt which began in November 1616.  Six war leaders carried out a series of coordinated attacks that left hundreds of Spaniards, including ten priests, and their Indian allies and African slaves dead.  (See [[Tepehuán Revolt]])  The Spanish counterattack in 1617 and 1618 was brutal.  Many Tepehuán who were not killed or enslaved fled to the remotest part of the mountains where they avoided contact with the Spanish for more than 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Schmal, John P. “The History of Indigenous Durango.” http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/durango.html, accessed Jan 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;   Quautlatas was apparently killed by the Spanish or died shortly after the war began.  
The revolt left the province “destroyed and devastated, almost depopulated of Spaniards. It was one of the three bloodiest and most destructive Indian attempts to throw off Spanish control in northwestern New Spain." (the other two being the [[Mixton War]] and the [[Chichimeca War]]).&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Schmal, John P.  http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/durango.html, accessed Jan 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rashtra Sevika Samiti''' (''National Women Volunteers Committee'') is a [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] women's organisation that parallels the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) for men.  Even though it is often referred to as the "women's wing" of the RSS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rashtra-Sevika-Samiti-to-open-hostel-for-women-in-Dehradun/articleshow/24297757.cms|title=Rashtra Sevika Samiti to open hostel for women in Dehradun|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; the organisation claims that it is independent of the RSS while sharing its ideology. Membership and leadership is restricted to women and its activities are directed to nationalist devotion and mobilisation of Hindu women.

The current Chief ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Pramukh Sanchalika'') of the Samiti is  V. Shantha Kumari (referred to informally as "Shanthakka") and its General Secretary (''Pramukh Karyavahika'') is Sita Annadanam.&lt;ref name=Shanthakka&gt;{{cite web |url=http://samvada.org/2012/news/vandaneeya-shanthakka-will-be-the-new-pramukh-sanchalika-of-rashtra-sevika-samiti/ |title=Vandaneeya Shanthakka will be the new Pramukh Sanchalika of Rashtra Sevika Samiti |publisher=Samvada |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Laxmibai Kelkar was the founder of the Rashtra Sevika Samiti. Before establishing the organization, Kelkar visited Dr. [[K.B. Hedgewar]], the founder of the RSS, in 1936 and had a long discussion to persuade him regarding the need for starting a women's wing in the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] itself. Hedgewar, though, continued to restrict membership of the RSS to men. However, Hedgewar advised Laxmibai Kelkar to establish an entirely separate organization that would be autonomous and independent of the RSS, as both groups were ideologically identical. Hedgewar promised Kelkar unconditional solidarity, support and guidance for the Samithi. Following this, Kelkar established the Rashtra Sevika Samiti at [[Wardha]] on 25 October 1936.&lt;ref name="hindubooks"/&gt;

==Activities==
Rashtra Sevika Samiti is today the largest Hindu women's organization working to uphold Indian culture and traditions. RSS women are actively involved in socio-cultural activities. Samiti inculcates a sense of patriotism and social awareness in people. Various types of training camps at different levels in all parts of India are conducted periodically.&lt;ref name="hindubooks"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1435">The term '''regulatory state''' refers to the expansion in the use of rule making, monitoring and enforcement techniques and institutions by the state and to a parallel change in the way its positive functions in society are being carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Faur, David, [http://regulation.huji.ac.il/papers/jp39.pdf "The Odyssey of the Regulatory State – Episode One: The Rescue of the Welfare State"], Jerusalem Papers in Regulation &amp; Governance, Paper No. 39, November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the state nowadays is generally via [[regulation]] and less via taxing and spending.&lt;ref&gt;Giandomenico Majone (1997).

The co-expansion of state, civil and business regulation at the domestic and the transnational arenas suggests that the notions of regulatory [[governance]] and [[regulatory capitalism]] are as usefully theoretically as the notion of regulatory state.

The '''Socialist Party of Canada''' ('''SPC''') is a [[Socialism|socialist]] [[List of political parties in Canada|political party in Canada]].

Founded in June 1931 in Winnipeg, Manitoba by several former members of the [[Socialist Party of Canada]], these included [[George Armstrong (Manitoba politician)|George Armstrong]] and Jim Milne, author of a history of the party and its predecessor. While Jim Brownrigg claimed continuity with the original party, this claim was disputed by various members of both the original party and the new party (Harry Morrison, Isaac Rab, Jack McDonald, Bill Pritchard and R. M. Roddy).

The new party adopted the policies of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (SPGB) which rejected [[Leninism]], [[social democracy]] and [[trade unionism]] in favour of a belief in "revolutionary [[Marxism]] and democratic revolution".

== History ==
{{socialism sidebar}}
As the fractured groups of the left coalesced to form the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), the SPC did not make great headway. The Winnipeg-based Socialist Party of Canada remained outside of the CCF (and its successor, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]), rejecting its [[evolutionary socialism|evolutionary socialist]] approach as being "[[reformism|reformist]]". The [[Socialist Party of Canada (British Columbia)]], which was founded in 1932 by [[Ernest Winch]] independently of the Socialist Party of Canada founded in Winnipeg,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/history/canada/socialisthistory/Docs/SocialistParty/A%20False%20Report.htm Socialist History Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; joined and eventually merged with the CCF to form the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|British Columbia CCF]], the Socialist Party of Canada remained independent of the broader socialist movement and spread its message by holding town hall meetings, open air rallies and distributing literature at farmers markets and street corners.

In October 1933, the party launched the ''New Western Socialist Journal'' to help bring publicity to the party. The first two issues criticized the CCF and the [[Communist Party of Canada]] for allegedly compromising with capitalism. The SPC never found a reason to change its attitude towards the two parties.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, the SPC campaigned against the war, stating that working class blood should not be shed. During the war, the Communist Party was outlawed, but the SPC continued to hold anti-war demonstrations and rallies. The party was investigated by the [[Government of Canada]], but was never taken as a serious threat: {{quote|1939 was the year when The Western Socialist, the journal of the Socialist Party of Canada, moved to Boston and became a joint organ of the SPC and the [[World Socialist Party of the United States]]. [...] There were enough active Local Boston comrades to assure getting out a publication on a consistent basis (which they did from 1939 until 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Rab, Karla, Role-Modeling Socialist Behavior&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The party continued to publish socialist manifesto leaflets through the years. When funds permitted, it ran candidates in elections. In the late 1970s, the head office was moved from Winnipeg to Victoria, British Columbia. The membership of the Socialist Party continued to decline and the party admits that it never managed to live up to the "success and glamour" of the old party. The party has not wavered from the original policies that it adopted seventy years ago.

== Present activity ==
The party promotes a [[Post-capitalism|post-capitalist]] socialist society. It seeks to achieve this by distributing socialist material around the world and raising class consciousness. The party believes that socialism must be implemented everywhere at the same time in order to work. 

The bulk of current party members are in British Columbia and Ontario. It publishes a journal titled ''Imagine'' and distributes the literature of the SPGB. 

The party is a member of the [[World Socialist Movement]] along with its "companion parties", the SPGB, the [[World Socialist Party (New Zealand)]] and the [[World Socialist Party of the United States]].

The '''Society of the Friends of the Blacks''' ('''''Société des amis des Noirs''''' or '''''Amis des noirs''''') was a group of French men and women, mostly [[White (people)|white]], who were [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionists]]. They opposed slavery, which was institutionalized in the French colonies of the Caribbean and North America, and the [[African slave trade]]. The Society was created in Paris in 1788, and operated until 1793, during years of the [[French Revolution]]. It was led by [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], with advice from British [[Thomas Clarkson]], who led the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. At the beginning of 1789, the Society had 141 members.

During the five-year period that it operated, it published anti-slavery literature and frequently addressed its concerns on a substantive political level in the [[National Assembly of France]]. In February 1794, the National Assembly passed the Universal Emancipation decree, which effectively freed all colonial slaves and gave them equal rights. This decision was later reversed under [[Napoleon]], who tried unsuccessfully to reinstitute slavery in the colonies and to regain control of [[Saint-Domingue]], where a slave rebellion was underway.

Several articles and [[monograph]]s have explored the question of how influential the Society was in bringing about the abolition of slavery. Historians disagree about their influence, with some crediting the Amis des Noirs as instrumental in abolition, to others who say the Society was nothing more than a "société de pensée" (philosophical society).&lt;ref name="Resnick_562"&gt;{{harvp|Resnick|1972|p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[economy of France]] was dependent upon revenues from the [[French colonies|colonies]], which were slave societies based largely on production of sugar from cane [[plantations]]. The French economy thrived due to the lucrative [[triangular trade|triangle trade]]. Demand for sugar was high in Europe. Conditions on the sugar plantations on the islands of Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe and Martinique, in the Caribbean, were so harsh that slave mortality was very high. This required steady importing of new slaves from Africa. In [[La Louisiane]], in the southern United States, slavery was also the basis of the economy in the New Orleans and Mobile regions. Southern Louisiana had numerous sugar plantations.

Figures indicate that slave-trade activity alone during the years leading up to the [[French Revolution]] resulted in some profit percentages exceeding 100 percent. In 1784, for example, the outfitter Chaurands realized a profit of 110 percent through the use of a single ship, the ''Brune''. In 1789, one outfitter reached 120 per cent profit on his voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stein|1975|p=782}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This is further corroborated by Atlantic slave ship tonnage statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Viles|1972|pp=530–531}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] organized the ''Société des amis des Noirs'' in February 1788. A follower of the [[Philosophes]], Brissot's anti-slavery efforts were also due to his exposure to humanitarian activities on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. In the United States, where he visited [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia's]] [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] following the American Revolution, he became absorbed by [Thomas Jefferson]'s humanitarian ideals as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.  In England, [[Thomas Clarkson]] invited Brissot to attend a meeting of the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]]. So enthused was Brissot that shortly thereafter he founded an abolitionist society in Paris. Its objectives were to suppress the slave trade and, at a later date, to attain equal rights for [[free persons of color]]. This was a class, generally in the French colonies, of persons of mixed French and African ancestry, generally born to French colonial fathers and mothers of African descent (some of whom were also of [[mixed-race]].) The French-born or French Creoles extended them some rights, although not full equality to those of "pure" French descent.

The ''Amis'' advocated freedom in the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], arguing that the ideas of the Revolution should extend to the colonies. The French concept of ''{{lang|fr|[[liberté, égalité, fraternité]]}}'' did not include the liberation of slaves, because the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] argued that such abolition would be detrimental to the economy. The Amis des Noirs pushed for the abolition of slavery, although Clarkson recommended they reduce their demands to ending the Atlantic slave trade (which Great Britain and the United States did in 1808.)

==Activities==

===Abolitionist literature===
Brissot decided at the outset that he would publish written works to influence the public and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Seeber|1937|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this he did in profusion. The Society published French translations of British abolitionist literature, and also works written by Brissot ("Mémoire sur les Noirs de l'Amerique septentrionale"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brissot|1789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]]&lt;/ref&gt;), written in the midst of the French Revolution. It also published work by other members of the Amis des Noirs, such as [[Étienne Clavière]] ("De la France et des Etats-Unis" – co-written with Brissot&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Seeber|1937|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Condorcet]] ("Réflexions sur l'esclavage des negres"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Condorcet|1788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''6''', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;). Members gave lectures to other societies as well, such as the Amis de l'humanité,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1790b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''8''', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Société des Amis de la Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brissot|1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''8, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a reflection of not only the "Philosophe upbringing" of the Society members, but also of their efforts to be active participants in the moulding of the revolutionary government.

La Société des Amis des Noirs was most active distributing its anti-slavery literature in and around Paris, due to the lack of a stable and reliable communications network, particularly as the French Revolution proceeded. The Society did make attempts to convey its message to those living outside Paris. For instance, in 1791, the society gained assistance from its [[Jacobin]] friends: "The Friends of the Blacks had several meetings with their friends in Jacobin clubs in provincial cities and sent to every city government a lengthy pamphlet exposing the injustices done to people of colour."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political activities===
[[File:Les Mortels sont égaux, ce n'est pas la naissance c'est la seule vertu qui fait la différence.jpg|thumb|"Mortals are equal, it is not birth, but virtue alone that makes the difference".]]
The political activities of the Friends of the Blacks included addresses to the National Assembly, for instance, speeches promoting the abolition of the slave trade were made in February and April 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1790a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another address was delivered a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brissot|1790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''7''', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, a discourse was presented concerning the violence in Saint Domingue, which had broken out in a struggle for rights by free people of color and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1790c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''8''', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1791, Clavière addressed the National Assembly's commercial interests, discussing trade relations between France and its colonies.&lt;ref&gt;"A toutes les Villes de Commerce, a toutes les Manufactures, aux Colonies, a toutes les Sociétés des Amis de la Constitution; Addresse dans laquelle on approfondit les relations politiques et commerciales entre la Métropole et les Colonies, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''9''', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society also directly appealed to government individuals such as [[Antoine Barnave]], a member of the Committee on Colonies, and [[Jacques Necker]], France's Controller-General Of Finance. Although Necker acknowledged that slavery was inhumane, he would not sanction emancipation in French colonies unless the practice of slavery and the slave trade were halted simultaneously in every country. He believed that this was needed to maintain the existing economic balance among nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lokke|1968|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1789 letter the Society urged Necker to form a committee similar to the one in England, and expressed hopes that the actions of the English parliament might have a positive effect on the Estates-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1789c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''7''', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Society addresses denounced individuals in the colonies. One such incident occurred in 1791, when the Amis des Noirs responded to criticism written by pro-slaver [[Arthur Dillon (1750–1794)|Arthur Dillon]], Député de la Martinique,&lt;ref&gt;"La Société des Amis des Noirs a Arthur Dillon, Député de la Martinique a l'Assemblée Nationale"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''8''', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; and owner of a large plantation.

In 1789, the royal government had requested petitions of grievances from all parts of the country. During the election of representatives to the Estates-General, Condorcet asked for a demand for abolition of the slave trade to be included in these [[cahiers de doléances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cahen|1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the 600 cahiers assembled, fewer than 50 called for an end to the slave trade and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McCloy|1954|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society member [[Henri Grégoire|Abbé Grégoire]] recommended in the fall of 1789 that two deputies to the Assembly be chosen from the population of [[free persons of colour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garrett|1916|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was accepted by the Committee on Verification of Credentials in the National Assembly. Gregoire's was unable to present his proposal to the National Assembly because every time he rose to speak, he was shouted down by the colonists (usually planters) in the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Necheles|1971|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1790, Grégoire questioned the article on voting rights in the National Assembly, urging that free men of colour be given the franchise. The colonial deputies persuaded the National Assembly to close discussion of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that same month Barnave, a pro-slavery advocate, delivered his report on maintaining the slave trade. When Mirabeau, a member of the Society, advanced to the rostrum to protest, he was drowned out by cries of the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on the rights of free men of colour, Grégoire and [[Alexandre Pétion]] (another member of the Society) warned the Assembly on 15 May 1791 that if these people were not given their rights, violence would ensue in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the increasing conflict in the colonies, as well as the growing influence of free men of colour with some deputies, Barnave felt that the members of the Society could not be ignored: "We can't win against the influence of the Friends of the Blacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15 the Assembly decreed that all men of colour would be granted equal rights if they were born of free parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cochin|1979|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further legislation passed on 4 April 1792 (with influence from La Société des Amis des Noirs), stated that every free man of colour now enjoyed equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gaston-Martin|1948|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Colonies was formed in March 1790 to deal with escalating problems arising from slavery unrest in the colonies. Its resolution of the problem leaned heavily in favour of the colonists, and its membership generally had little sympathy for conditions of slaves. The members of the committee included colonial landowners (who were usually slaveholders), other slave owners, lawyers and merchants, and all were advocates of French commercial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report of the Committee did not alleviate any of the problems relating to slavery. It stressed that it did not wish to interfere in the commercial interests of the colonies: "The National Assembly declares that it had not intended to innovate in any branch of commerce direct or indirect of France with its colonies..."&lt;ref name="Quinney, V p. 547"&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of National Assembly deputies who were either colonists or slave trade merchants lobbied the French chambers of commerce and city governments to maintain the slave trade and slavery, proclaiming that economic disaster would result from its abolition. The deputies argued their point so effectively that members of La Société des Amis des Noirs feared abolition would cause chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such pro-slavery group was composed of the lobbyists for the French chambers of commerce, who designated themselves as the "Deputies Extraordinary of Manufactures and Commerce."&lt;ref name="Quinney, V p. 548"&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their main efforts focused on influencing the Committee on Agriculture and Commerce to maintain slavery and the slave trade. Since revenue from the colonies was collected mainly from the sale of slaves and crops, the Committee was investigating the economic ramifications should this source of income cease to exist. Historian Quinney wrote in 1970 that Barnave's non-committal report to the National Assembly resulted from he learning that the Committee on Agriculture and Commerce "had already decided to advise the National Assembly to retain the trade and slavery."&lt;ref name="Quinney, V p. 547"/&gt;

===Massiac Club===
A pro-slavery organization called the Massiac Club, headquartered in Paris, was composed of colonial planters living in Paris and throughout France. The club had its main headquarters in Paris, with chapters located in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McCloy|1961|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that success related to political influence, the club proceeded to systematically contact government officials.{{efn|"Le club, en fait, forme avant tout un lobby. Il n'a pas de représentant en tant que tel B l'Assemblée nationale mais joue sur l'influence de certains élus, en tLte desquels l'avocat grenoblais Barnave, membre des Jacobins." Biondi, J.P. – Zuccarelli, F. 16 Pluviose An II, p. 42}}

The Massiac members opposed any type of abolition legislation, and communicated with each colonial deputy to ensure that pro-slavery interests were maintained. [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] stated that when he attempted to sway the deputies in favour of abolition, every official he spoke to had already been approached by a member of the Massiac club.&lt;ref name="Quinney, V p. 548"/&gt; The Massiac group published and distributed literature, responding ''in toto''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hazard|1873|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; to practically every idea the Amis des Noirs had put forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vidalenc|1957|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a leaflet distributed to members of the Comité de Commerce de l'Assemblée Nationale, the Massiac accused the Amis des Noirs of being involved in subversive activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Resnick|1972|p=564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Massiac Club published a handbill that said the abolitionists were not truly humanitarian philanthropists, but rather an organization attempting to subvert social order. They claimed the Amis des Noirs should be viewed as counter-revolutionaries, and pro-British.&lt;ref name="Cohen_139"/&gt; The pro-slavers also distributed leaflets specifically denouncing individuals: Brissot, Grégoire and Pétion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Benot|1988|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; They supported the slave trade in debates held in district assemblies within Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to influence voting in these districts when the question of the slave trade was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Organisational failings===
Historians have concluded that the Society was virtually impotent due to its organization, strategy, and membership criteria. In terms of organization, Quinney refers to the group's ineffective operations, stating that the government, which contained pro-slavery elements, had a nationwide propaganda network, while the Society was mainly Paris-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|pp=124, 126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resnick concurs when he states: "Both leadership and membership at large were drawn heavily from the Paris area, with no established network of regional filiations."&lt;ref name="Resnick_562"/&gt;

In addition, they held meetings irregularly, without full membership present. Even in 1789, Thomas Clarkson commented upon the poor attendance at the meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clarkson|1808|pp=381–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of organization and continuity was shown by the departure of Brissot in June 1789 for the United States to meet abolitionists, although he had organized the Society's first meeting in February 1789.&lt;ref name="Perroud_124"&gt;{{harvp|Perroud|1916|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not become active in the Society until the spring of 1790,&lt;ref name="Perroud_124"/&gt; when he again became the Society's president. The Society required presidents to serve only three months; they shared responsibility, but the short tenure hindered continuity of effort within the organization.&lt;ref name="reglemens"&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1789a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''6''', pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society decided that a  "General Assembly" would be elected from within. This body would not only represent the Society and make the rules, but would also hold exclusive voting rights in the election of the officials.&lt;ref name="reglemens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''6''', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, from the organization's inception, rank and file membership were excluded from participating in the Society's operations.

===Elitist membership policies===
Analysis of the membership list of the Society reveals a predominance of elite individuals. Although they possessed great influence, they had most of their power in Paris. There was a lack of popular participation, which reflected the structure of government and society. The founding members of the Society included such notables as Brissot, Condorcet, [[Jean François de Saint-Lambert|Saint-Lambert]], Lafayette, [[Dominique de La Rochefoucauld|La Rochefoucauld]], and Clavière.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Benot|1988|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society began with a handful of abolitionists, increased to ninety-five by 1789, and would swell to a maximum of 141&lt;ref name="Perroud_144"&gt;{{harvp|Perroud|1916|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; associates in later years.

Of the 141 members, twenty-five percent were government employees, twenty-nine percent were nobility, and thirty-eight were professionals; the total of elitist membership made up 92% of all members.&lt;ref&gt;There were two sources used to accumulate the names of the members: Tableau des Membres de la Société des Amis des Noirs. Année 1789 – S.I. (Paris), s.d. (1789) and {{harvp|Perroud|1916}} (A list of members is presented at the end of this article.)&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen observed: "It [the Society]... concentrated on having important, well-connected members, rather than large members&amp;nbsp;... The members [were] drawn from the French social elite&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Cohen_139"&gt;{{harvp|Cohen|1980|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society restricted members to those who could pay dues and be recommended by four other men. There were different fee scales: two Louis per year for those who lived in Paris, and 24 livres per year for those living in the provinces.&lt;ref name="reglemens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''6''', pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The membership practices of La Société des Amis des Noirs both hampered its attempt at increasing in size, and affected its ability to become a credible and effective entity.

===Relationship to English abolitionists===
Perroud states that Brissot's trip to London in November 1787 prompted him to form an identical chapter in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Perroud|1916|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English society had been formed only a few months earlier, in May 1787.&lt;ref name="Cohen_139"/&gt; A group of abolitionist friends in Paris discussed how the London society encouraged others to join its cause, and noted that France and England had a commonality  with respect to abolishing slavery.&lt;ref name="Londres, a l 1788, p. 16"&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1788|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1788|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society translated and published English anti-slavery literature. Brissot, shortly after founding the Society, wrote to [[Quaker]] James Philips, an original member of the English abolitionist society. Brissot stated his intention for the Amis des Noirs to translate and publish English anti-slavery works for distribution to the French public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Seeber|1937|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1788|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many French citizens believed that the Society was an offshoot of the English abolitionist society, and some suspected the English were paying them to promote their cause. rt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a loss of credibility in the eyes of the French populace. Britain and France had historically been antagonistic towards each other for decades. Britain had defeated France in the Seven Years War and taken over much of its territory in North America. Influences from England were seen as "dealing with the enemy." This view extended to encompass the activities of the Society. The perception that it was a vehicle for English infiltration into French matters overshadowed its intentions.

==Outcome==
The Society was rendered inactive by the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]], begun as a [[slave rebellion]], as well as by the major crisis of the [[First French Republic]] (with the start of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]). It remained active until 1793, publishing its calls in papers such as ''Patriote français'', ''L'Analyse des papiers anglais'', ''Le Courrier de Provence'', and ''La chronique de Paris''.

On 4 February 1794 (16 [[Pluviôse]] an II), approximately a year after the demise of the Amis des Noirs, the National Convention passed the Emancipation Declaration, abolishing slavery:

::''{{lang|fr|La Convention Nationale déclare que l'Esclavage des Negres dans toutes les Colonies est aboli: en conséquence elle décrete que tous les hommes, sans distinction de couleur, domiciliés dans les colonies, sont Citoyens Français, et jouiront de tous les droits assurés par la Constitution. Elle renvoie au comité de salut public, pour lui faire incessamment un rapport sur les mesures a prendre pour assurer l'exécution du présent décret.}}'' [The National Convention declares that slavery of Negroes in all the Colonies is abolished; consequently it decrees that all men, without distinction of color, domiciled in the colonies are French citizens, and shall enjoy all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The public safety committee was charged with regularly reporting on measures taken to ensure implementation of this Decree].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1794|pp=320–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert needed|date=May 2018}}

A '''special economic zone''' ('''SEZ''') is an area in which business and trade laws are different from the rest of the country. SEZs are located within a country's national borders, and their aims include: increased trade, increased investment, job creation and effective administration. To encourage businesses to set up in the zone, financial policies are introduced.      These policies typically regard investing, [[taxation]], trading, quotas, [[customs]] and [[labour regulations]]. Additionally, companies may be offered [[tax holiday]]s, where upon establishing in a zone they are granted a period of lower taxation.

The creation of special economic zones by the host country may be motivated by the desire to attract [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI).&lt;ref name="WorldBank2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tralac2013"/&gt;  The benefits a company gains by being in a special economic zone may mean that it can produce and trade [[Good (economics)|goods]] at a lower price, aimed at being globally competitive.&lt;ref name="WorldBank2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BusinessToday"/&gt; In some countries the zones have been criticized for being little more than [[labor camps]], with workers denied fundamental [[labor rights]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Peggy (July 23, 2012). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/23/sackings-poland-junk-jobs-chung-hong "Sackings expose the harsh reality of Poland's junk jobs"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Młodawska, Agata (March 8, 2012).

==Definition==
The operating definition of a SEZ is determined individually by each country. According to the [[World Bank]] in 2008, the modern day special economic zone typically includes a "geographically limited area, usually physically secured (fenced-in); single management/administration; eligibility for benefits based upon physical location within the zone; separate customs area (duty-free benefits) and streamlined procedures."&lt;ref name=WorldBank2008&gt;{{citation |title=Special Economic Zone: Performance, Lessons Learned, and Implication for Zone Development |publisher=World Bank |location=Washington DC |year=2008 |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/343901468330977533/Special-economic-zone-performance-lessons-learned-and-implication-for-zone-development |chapter=Zone Definition |pages=9–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Free zones and [[Entrepôts]] have been used for centuries to guarantee free storage and exchange along trade routes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Modern SEZs appeared from the late 1950s in industrial countries. The first was in [[Shannon Airport]] in [[County Clare|Clare]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21647630-free-trade-zones-are-more-popular-everwith-politicians-if-not "Political priority, economic gamble"]. ''[[The Economist]]''. April 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 
From the 1970s onward, zones providing labour-intensive manufacturing have been established, starting in Latin America and East Asia. The first in China following the opening of China in 1979 by [[Deng Xiaoping]] was the [[Shenzhen Special Economic Zone]], which encouraged foreign investment and simultaneously accelerated industrialization in this region. These zones attracted investment from multinational corporations.&lt;ref name="WorldBank2011"/&gt;

A recent trend has been for African countries to set up SEZs in partnership with China.&lt;ref name=Tralac2013 /&gt;

==Types==
The term special economic zone can include:&lt;ref name="WorldBank2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Economic Zones in the ASEAN |publisher= [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] |url=https://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media_upgrade/Resources/Publications/UCO_Viet_Nam_Study_FINAL.pdf |year=2015 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SEZs were introduced to [[India]] in 2000, following the already successful SEZ model used in China. Prior to their introduction, India relied on [[export processing zones]] (EPZs) which failed to make an impact on foreign investors. By 2005, all EPZs had been converted to SEZs. As of 2017, there are 221 SEZs in operation, with a further 194 approved for 2018. For developers to establish an SEZ in India, applications can be made to the Indian Board of Approval. Companies, partner firms and individuals may also apply by completing Form-A which is available on the Department of Commerce's website. There are four types of SEZs in India, which are categorised according to size: Multi-sector (1,000+ hectares); Sector-specific (100+ hectares); Free Trade &amp; Warehousing Zone (FTWZ) (40+ hectares); and Tech, handicraft, non-conventional energy, gems &amp; jewellery (10+ hectares).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=India’s Special Economic Zones: A Primer |url=https://www.india-briefing.com/news/guide-indias-special-economic-zones-9162.html/?hilite=%27special%27%2C%27economic%27%2C%27zones%27 |work=india-briefing.com |date=25 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Silvio Berlusconi}}
'''Trials and allegations involving Silvio Berlusconi''' have been extensive and include [[abuse of office]], [[defamation]], [[extortion]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[perjury]], [[Italian Mafia|mafia]] [[collusion]], [[false accounting]], [[embezzlement]], [[money laundering]], [[tax evasion|tax fraud]], [[witness tampering]], [[corruption]] and [[bribery]] of police officers, judges and politicians.

==Allegations==

===Propaganda Due (P2) trial: False testimony (1989)===
[[File:Ricevuta di pagamento per l'iscrizione del dott. Silvio Berlusconi alla loggia massonica P2.gif|thumb|Receipt for membership of Silvio Berlusconi to "[[Propaganda Due|Propaganda 2]]" (P2) masonic lodge]]
In 1981, a scandal arose after the police discovery of [[Licio Gelli]]'s secret quasi-Masonic (freemason) lodge [[Propaganda Due|Propaganda 2]] (P2), which aimed to change the Italian political system to a more [[authoritarian]] regime. The list of people involved in P2 included members of the secret services and some prominent characters from political arena, business, military and media. Silvio Berlusconi, who was then just starting to gain popularity as the founder and owner of [[Canale 5]] TV channel, was listed as a member of P2.&lt;ref name=vf0706&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/07/yellowcake200607?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all |title=The War They Wanted, the Lies They Needed |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=July 2006 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120529/http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/07/yellowcake200607?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all |archivedate=29 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=commission&gt;Proceedings of the parliamentary inquiry commission headed by [[Tina Anselmi]]&lt;/ref&gt; The P2 lodge was dissolved by the Italian Parliament in December 1981 and a law was passed declaring similar organisations illegal, but no specific crimes were alleged against individual members of the P2 lodge. While the Italian Constitution had forbidden secret associations since 1948, 
Berlusconi later (in 1989) sued three journalists for libel for writing articles hinting at his involvement in financial crimes. In court, he declared that he had joined the P2 lodge "only for a very short time before the scandal broke" and "he had not even paid the entry fee". Such statements conflicted with the findings of the parliamentary inquiry commission appointed to investigate the lodge's activity, with material evidence, and even with previous testimony of Berlusconi, all of which proved that he had actually been a member of P2 since 1978 and had indeed paid 100,000 Italian liras (approximately equivalent to €300 today){{citation needed|date=January 2013}} as an entry fee. In 1990, the [[Court of Appeals|court of appeal]] of Venice found Berlusconi guilty of [[false testimony]] in front of the Court of Verona, however the court could not pass sentence as the offense had been pardoned by an [[amnesty]] passed in 1989.&lt;ref name="P2 lodge perjury (Appeals Court ruling)"/&gt;

Some political commentators claim that Berlusconi's electoral programme followed the P2 plan.&lt;ref name="Ref_1995"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/01/10/bettazzi-berlusconi-realizza-il-piano-di.html |title=Bettazzi: 'Berlusconi Realizza Il Piano Di Rinascita Della P2' |language=Italian |work=la Repubblica |date=10 January 1995 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120920/http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/01/10/bettazzi-berlusconi-realizza-il-piano-di.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bribery of lawyer David Mills (1999)===
{{Main article|David Mills financial allegations}}
[[David Mills (lawyer)|David Mills]], lawyer husband of the former British cabinet minister [[Tessa Jowell]], acted for Berlusconi in the early 1990s, and was later accused by Italian prosecutors of [[money laundering]] and of accepting a gift from Berlusconi in return for witness evidence favourable to Berlusconi given in court. Mills claimed that the money in question came not from Berlusconi but from another client. Tessa Jowell then announced her separation from Mills, which some of the [[Media of the United Kingdom|UK media]] suggested was an attempt to distance herself from a potential scandal. She also denied having discussed the money with her husband; ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine published a satirical front cover of Jowell with a speech bubble stating: "I have never met my husband". In December 2010, information obtained by the Wikileaks website revealed Mr Berlusconi had become very fond of Ms Jowell, referring to her in private company as 'piccolo puntaspilli' (the little pincushion).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

On 17 February 2009, Mills was found guilty of accepting a bribe of about 400,000 [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]], allegedly from Silvio Berlusconi, and was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison.&lt;ref name="bbcfeb09"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7894766.stm |title=UK lawyer guilty in bribery case |date=17 February 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=10 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120920/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7894766.stm |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 2010, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] gave a verdict towards David Mills of not guilty because the [[statute of limitations]] expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8535837.stm |title=David Mills bribery conviction quashed by appeals court |publisher=BBC |date=25 February 2010 |accessdate=27 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8535837.stm |archivedate=13 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0227/1224265274391.html |title=Mills decision a boost for Berlusconi&amp;nbsp;– The Irish Times – Sat, Feb&amp;nbsp;27, 2010 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=27 February 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120920/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0227/1224265274391.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals court ruled on 25 February 2012, in a separate case against Silvio Berlusconi, that the crime should be dated on the exact day when the bribery transfer took place in November 1999, and not at the time of the counter service delivered in 2000, as prosecutors had previously argued, and on that ground Berlusconi was also awarded a Statute of limitation acquittal.&lt;ref name="Corriere della Sera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="archiviostorico.corriere.it"/&gt;

Nine years later the trial ended with a sentence of 9 years imposed on Marcello Dell'Utri and the acquittal of Silvio Berlusconi.

===Massacres of 1992–1993===
The Court of Florence and Caltanissetta investigated Silvio Berlusconi's connection with the [[Sicilian Mafia]]. He was accused of connections with the people responsible for the massacres of 1992 (Capaci and via D'Amelio) where two prosecuting magistrates, involved in the Mafia trial known as "Maxi-processo" of the 1980s,  [[Giovanni Falcone]] and [[Paolo Borsellino]] were brutally murdered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.societacivile.it/memoria/articoli_memoria/archiviazione.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The case was archived due to insufficient amounts of evidence found at the expiry of the investigative deadline.

===RAI-Fininvest advertising cartel===
Berlusconi was through his status as upcoming [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] accused of [[extortion]] towards [[RAI]] in September 1993, in the attempt of convincing them to sign a [[cartel]] agreement on the advertising shares between RAI and the Fininvest TV networks (45% each), for achievement of softer  competition and higher prices. The prosecutors investigation was launched in August 1994. The proposed agreement was never signed, because of being rejected by RAI. Through interrogation of [[Claudio Dematte]] (former RAI president), [[:it:Gianni Locatelli|Gianni Locatelli]] (former RAI general manager), and [[:it:Paolo Murialdi|Paolo Murialdi]] (former RAI administration director), it became clear that Locatelli had received oral "threats" from Berlusconi in September 1993, that if RAI rejected the proposed deal, then it would automatically also remove political goodwill by Berlusconi's political party to ever support potential future recurrence of any RAI saving decrees. The preliminary hearing judge ruled in April 1995 for the case to be archived, due to insufficient amounts of evidence to proof [[extortion]] or incitement to corruption.&lt;ref name="corr-7-4-95"/&gt;

===All Iberian 1 (Illegal financing of a political party in 1997)===
Conviction set aside because the statute of limitations expired before Berlusconi exhausted all appeals.

===Bribery of the Guardia di Finanza (Arces process)===
Silvio Berlusconi (owner of Fininvest) was accused of complicity in corruption. The crime was perpetrated by [[Fininvest]]'s payment of 380 million lira in bribes to three officers of the [[Guardia di Finanza]] engaged in tax audits, in the attempt of convincing them to "turn a blind eye" against [[tax fraud]]s committed by the four Fininvest owned companies (all with headquarters in Milan): [[:it:Videotime|Videotime]] (1989), [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore]] (1991), [[Mediolanum (company)|Mediolanum]] (1992) and [[:it:TELE+|TELE+]] (1994).&lt;ref name="Arces process (supreme court)"/&gt; The mix of interrogation by [[Paolo Berlusconi]] and [[:it:Salvatore Sciascia (politico)|Salvatore Sciascia]] (the former head of the tax office of Fininvest) made it clear, that the most important decisions were made by Silvio Berlusconi, who was aware of everything, and that sometimes the responsibility of managers were only a facade, because everything was decided by a very small group of people. Silvio Berlusconi was interrogated about his role in the case by the Milan prosecutor [[Antonio Di Pietro]] on 22 November 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/11/23/presidente-accusiamo.html|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;'Presidente, l'accusiamo...'&lt;/nowiki&gt;|language=Italian|publisher=La Repubblica|date=23 November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official indictment was launched against Silvio Berlusconi on 14 October 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/10/15/un-passo-indietro-obbligato.html|title=Un passo indietro obbligatorio|language=Italian|publisher=La Repubblica|date=15 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Court rulings
* First-instance Court (July 1998): sentenced Silvio Berlusconi to 2 years and 9 months imprisonment, for all four bribes.&lt;ref name="Arces process (first-instance)"/&gt;
* Court of Appeals (May 2000): For Silvio Berlusconi, the [[statute of limitations]] expired for the first three cases, and an [[acquittal]] was given on the fourth case, because the court gave him the benefit of the doubt ([[not proven]]).&lt;ref name="Arces process (appeal court)"/&gt; According to Italian law, the "statute of limitations" does not imply innocence but acquits the accused from any further legal proceeding; it may in fact indicate guilt if the statute of limitations is applied after conceding benefits for previous good conduct, since such benefits can only be granted after guilt is ascertained, as per [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Corte di Cassazione]], Sect. IV, Sentence no. 5069, 21 May 1996.
* Court of Cassation (October 2001): full acquittal for Silvio Berlusconi in all 4 cases. The other accused in the case were judged to:&lt;ref name="Arces process (supreme court)"/&gt;
** [[Paolo Berlusconi]]: full acquittal.
** Alfredo Zuccotti (former managing director of Fininvest): 1 year and 4 months imprisonment.
** [[:it:Salvatore Sciascia (politico)|Salvatore Sciascia]] (the former head of the tax office of Fininvest): 2 years and 6 months imprisonment.
** [[:it:Massimo Maria Berruti|Massimo Maria Berruti]] (the legal advisor to the group Segrate): 10 months imprisonment.
** Vincenzo Tripodi ([[colonel]] of Guardia di Finanza): full acquittal.
** Giovanni Arces (officer of Guardia di Finanza): 2 years imprisonment.
** Angelo Capone (officer of Guardia di Finanza): 3 years imprisonment.
** Francesco Nanocchio (officer of Guardia di Finanza): 2 years and 2 months imprisonment.
In April 2010, the supreme court noted through the published motivations of its ruling in the ''Bribery of lawyer [[David Mills (lawyer)|David Mills]] to commit perjury'' case, that his false testimony had resulted in an incorrect acquittal for the charges against Silvio Berlusconi in the ''Arces process''.&lt;ref name="mills reticente"/&gt; But when considering the statute of limitations now apply for all four charges in the case, the judicial system did not find it appropriate to reopen the case.

===Illegal financing of a political party on All Iberian 1: statute of limitations===
Court of First Instance: sentenced to jail (2 years and 4 months) for paying 21&amp;nbsp;billion lire (about 10&amp;nbsp;million euro) to [[Bettino Craxi]] via an [[offshore bank]] account codenamed "All Iberian".&lt;br&gt;
Court of Appeal: the [[statute of limitations]]&lt;ref name="statlim"&gt;
According to Italian law, the "statute of limitations" does not imply innocence but acquits the accused from any further legal proceeding; it may in fact indicate guilt if the statute of limitations is applied after conceding benefits for previous good conduct, since such benefits can only be granted after guilt is ascertained, as per: [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Corte di Cassazione]], Sect. IV, Sentence no. 5069, 21 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; expired before the appeal was completed so Silvio Berlusconi was [[Acquittal|acquitted]].

===Medusa Film company purchase===
In October 1995, Berlusconi received a "notice of investigation" from the prosecutor Margherita Taddei, on charges of false accounting and embezzlement connected to the purchase by [[:it:Reteitalia|Reteitalia]] (a subsidiary of [[Fininvest]] and the holding company of [[Canale 5]]) of the company [[:it:Medusa Film|Medusa Film]], back in 1988. According to the financial statements of Reteitalia the purchase had cost 28bn lira, but according to the owners of Medusa Film they only received 18bn lira for the sale. The difference on 10bn lira (equal to €5.2 million) had been silently transferred by Reteitalia in monthly tranches of 100 or 200 million lira at a time into five private bank accounts owned by Silvio Berlusconi. The initial response of Berlusconi, which came during a TV broadcast on 5 October 1995, was to say: "It' s absurd accusing me of embezzlement, since I own one hundred percent of Reteitalia". The prosecutor replied, that in Italy its a crime to make hidden (not accounted for) payments to shareholders. Subsequently Berlusconi declined to show up for interrogations with the prosecutor, referring to that he knew nothing about the money transfers to his five private bank accounts, and claimed it was so small amounts that he never himself had noticed/questioned why these extra amounts had been transferred. The prosecutor then instead interrogated four other business people from Reteitalia, and in November 1995 filed an indictment request for all five persons (including Silvio Berlusconi) for having committed false accounting and embezzlement. If the embezzlement charges would be proven by the court, this part of guilt would however be granted impunity due to a 1988 amnesty for the crime.&lt;ref name="Medusa Film indictment"/&gt;

;Court rulings
* First-instance court: 1 year and 4 months imprisonment for Silvio Berlusconi.&lt;ref name="Medusa Film (Appeals court ruling)"/&gt;
* Court of Appeals (February 2000): Full acquittal, since he was considered being too rich to be aware of such small amounts.&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; The four other Reteitalia managers charged in the case received: [[Adriano Galliani]] (acquittal), [[Livio Gironi]] (acquittal), [[Giancarlo Foscale]] (acquittal), and [[:it:Carlo Bernasconi|Carlo Bernasconi]] (conviction confirmed).&lt;ref name="Medusa Film (Appeals court ruling)"/&gt;
* Court of Cassation (October 2001): Full acquittal, since he was considered being too rich to be aware of such small amounts.&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; To be exact, the court ruled the previous Court of Appeals ruling to be upheld because: "re-examination of the same facts is not admissible to the Supreme Court".&lt;ref name="Medusa Film (supreme court ruling)"/&gt;

&lt;small&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Among the reasons for full acquittal were: (1) The 10bn transfers to Silvio's bank accounts were made by his father before he died, (2) As Reteitalia is managed independently from Fininvest managers, "one must also exclude a knowledge of the ex-post' enrichment and its causal" by Berlusconi, because it "would require the visibility of the 'increase of more than 10bn even after some months of using the bank accounts.", (3) But this visibility "is contradicted by reality," since "the multiplicity of bank accounts belonging to the family Berlusconi, the pulverization of the sum into five bank accounts and other large well-known heritage of Silvio Berlusconi in which the sums were widely divided to flow, postulate the impossibility of knowledge of both the extra saldo increases and especially the origin of the same.", (4) Without "knowledge and acceptance of the causal", there can be no "involvement of the defendant for the act of preparation false corporate communications.".&lt;ref name="Medusa Film: Reason for acquittal"/&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;

===Bribing a judge on Lodo Mondadori: statute of limitations===
First Court: A ''[[Prima facie]]'' case was issued, but the [[magistrate]] decided to drop the charges. The [[state attorney]] refused to file the case and appealed against the ruling.&lt;br&gt;
Appeal Court: [[statute of limitations]]&lt;ref name="statlim" /&gt; expired before the appeal was completed so Silvio Berlusconi was [[Acquittal|acquitted]].

===False accounting on All Iberian 2: not guilty (law changed)===
First Court: On 26 September 2005, Berlusconi was [[acquitted]] because the new law on false accounting makes false accounting illegal only if there is a specific damaged party reporting the fact to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/i/sezioni/cronaca/allibe/allibe/allibe.html |title=All Iberian, Berlusconi acquitted. "False accounting is not a wrongdoing anymore" |publisher=Repubblica.it |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new law was passed by Berlusconi's [[parliamentary majority]] after the beginning of the trial, and was claimed by the opposition to be an ''ad personam'' law, i.e. aimed at acquitting Berlusconi.

===False accounting on Fininvest Media Group Consolidated: statute of limitations===
Allegation: 750 million euro of illegal (black market) funds stored by [[Fininvest]] in 64 offshore companies. The [[statute of limitations]]&lt;ref name="statlim" /&gt; expired due to the new laws on false accounting approved by Berlusconi's government, therefore an [[acquittal]] was given because no specific damaged party reported it to the government.

===Embezzlement, tax fraud and false accounting on Macherio estates: 3 acquittals and 1 amnesty extinct crime===
First Court: [[acquittal|acquitted]] for embezzlement and tax fraud, the [[statute of limitations]]&lt;ref name="statlim" /&gt; expired before a verdict was reached on the two cases of false accounting.&lt;ref name="Macherio indictment"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Appeal Court: [[acquittal|acquitted]] for embezzlement, tax fraud and false accounting for the ''Idra'' company; while being guilty on false accounting for the ''Buonaparte'' company - a crime he however received amnesty for due to the 1992 fiscal remission law.&lt;ref name="Macherio ruling by Appeals Court"/&gt;

===False accounting on Lentini affair: not guilty (law changed)===
Allegation: 5 million euros paid secretly to [[Torino FC|Torino]] football club for buying the player [[Gianluigi Lentini]] bringing him to [[AC Milan]].&lt;br&gt;
First court: The [[statute of limitations]] expired due to the new laws on false accounting approved by Berlusconi's government, therefore the case was closed with an [[acquittal]] on 4 July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/07/05/caso-lentini-reati-prescritti.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===False accounting, embezzlement and tax fraud on Mediaset television and cinema rights: not proven===
Silvio Berlusconi was on trial in relation to transactions carried out by the Berlusconi family's media company [[Mediaset]] in the 1990s. Prosecutors suspected two offshore firms controlled by a Berlusconi family holding, [[Fininvest]], bought television and cinema rights from a US firm. The companies, it was alleged, then sold the rights on at inflated prices to Mediaset, also controlled by Fininvest, to avoid Italian taxes and create a slush fund. The trial started on 21 November 2006. The court [[acquitted]] Berlusconi, giving him the benefit of the doubt ([[not proven]]).

===Violation of antitrust law, money laundering, and tax fraud, through transactions by the Telecinco TV-channel (Spanish case): not proven===
In Spain, Silvio Berlusconi, along with other [[Fininvest]] managers, was charged with violation of antitrust law, money laundering, and tax fraud for 100bn lira,&lt;ref name="Telecinco tax fraud of 100bn lira"/&gt; for the TV-channel [[Telecinco]] he founded. The trial was suspended from 1999 to 2006 due to the immunity enjoyed by Berlusconi from being a leader of a foreign government. In April 2006, when [[Romano Prodi]] replaced Berlusconi as Italian prime minister, the Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón reopened the court procedure against him. In 2008, the lawyer [[Niccolo Ghedini]] announced the Spanish supreme court had ruled a complete acquittal towards Berlusconi and all other previously accused in the case.&lt;ref name="Telecinco acquittal"/&gt;

===Corrupting a judge and false accounting on SME-Ariosto: not guilty===
At its outset, the trial SME-Ariosto involved both [[Cesare Previti]] and Silvio Berlusconi. Subsequently, a bill was approved by the Italian parliament, the so-called "Lodo Maccanico" act (also known as "Lodo Schifani", after the name of [[Renato Schifani]], the lawyer of Berlusconi and now speaker of the Italian Senate who was also a member of parliament working on the law).  This law guaranteed [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] to the five highest officers of the state (premier, president of the Republic, Senate's speaker, Deputy Chamber's speaker, Constitutional Court's president) during their period in office. To avoid complete suspension of the trial, the Court of Milan split it into two parts, one regarding [[Cesare Previti]], the other [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. The Cesare Previti part of the trial resulted in a guilty verdict. In the other part (regarding Silvio Berlusconi) the Italian Prime Minister's innocence had still not been proven but the case had to be stopped because of the "Lodo Maccanico"' immunity act. On 16 April 2004, the Constitutional Court declared that the "Lodo Maccanico" violated articles n. 3 and 34 of the Italian Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ricercagiuridica.com/penale/visual.asp?num=2129 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018160637/http://www.ricercagiuridica.com/penale/visual.asp?num=2129 |archivedate=18 October 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore this immunity act was declared unconstitutional and the trial resumed.
After 12 years of trial, Silvio Berlusconi was [[acquitted]] on 27 April 2007, because of art.530 comma 2 ("He didn't commit the fact", [[i.e.]] full [[acquittal]]).

===Tax fraud on Telecinco: not guilty===
Silvio Berlusconi has been indicted in Spain for charges of tax fraud and violation of anti-trust laws regarding the private TV network [[Telecinco]]. All the accused have been [[acquitted]] by the Spanish "[[Court of Cassation (Spain)|Corte de Casacion]]" in July 2008.

===Country flights===
On 3 June 2009, Silvio Berlusconi was charged Roman prosecutor Giovanni Ferrara with abuse of office for using government-funded flights for personal use.

===Trani Episode===
Silvio Berlusconi has been signed in the register of suspects, for some telephone interceptions where "he forced the director of a tv channel, to close the tv political program Annozero" as said by the magistrate Michele Ruggiero.

===Investigation of Milan===
In October 2010, Silvio Berlusconi and his son Piersilvio were investigated in connection with false financial statements.

===Abuse of office in the Unipol case (2005)===
In February 2012, Milan prosecutors charged Berlusconi with abuse of office in 2005, in connection with the publication of wiretapped conversations in the Italian newspaper ''Il Giornale'', which is owned by Berlusconi's brother [[Paolo Berlusconi]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FT 07/02/12"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/33dac7ca-51a8-11e1-a30c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1lz9nZK2s | title=Berlusconi faces another court case | work=The Financial Times | date=7 February 2012 | accessdate=10 February 2012 | author=Sanderson, Rachel | location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the conversations between then Governor of the Bank of Italy [[Antonio Fazio]], senior management of [[Unipol]] and Italian centre-left politician [[Piero Fassino]] was a breach of secrecy rules and was seen at the time as an attempt to discredit Berlusconi's political rivals. Their publication also eventually led to the collapse of the proposed takeover of [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro]] by Unipol and the resignation of Fazio.&lt;ref name="FT 07/02/12" /&gt; The head of the company used by Italian prosecutors to record the conversations has been previously convicted of stealing the recordings and making them available to Berlusconi.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; On 7 February 2012, at an initial court hearing, Berlusconi denied he had listened to the tapes and ordered their publication.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; The first-instance ruling was issued 7 March 2013, and sentenced Berlusconi to a year in prison and the joint payment together with his also convicted brother, of 80,000 euro as compensatory damages in favor of [[Piero Fassino]] in addition to court litigation costs of €10,000.&lt;ref name="Unipol verdict (ilsole24ore)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unipol verdict (TM News)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unipol verdict (Reuters)"/&gt; On 31 March 2014, the Milan Court of Appeal ruled that the evidence did not clear Paolo and Silvio Berlusconi from guilt, but that the facts are now prescribed, which mean they were both acquitted due to the statutes of limitations. Although Paolo still had to pay €80,000 as compensatory damages to Fassino.&lt;ref name="Unipol appeal court verdict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unipol appeal court verdict (ref2)"/&gt;

==Convictions==

===Tax Fraud in the Mediaset trial===
The [[Mediaset]] trial was launched in April 2005, with indictment of 14 persons (incl. Silvio Berlusconi) for having committed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/cronaca/processome/processome/processome.html?ref=search|title=Milano, chiusa l'indagine Mediaset. Berlusconi verso il rinvio a giudizio|language=Italian|publisher=La Repubblica|date=19 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2005/04_Aprile/26/berlusconi.shtml|title=Chiesto il rinvio a giudizio per Berlusconi|language=Italian|publisher=Corriere della Sera|date=27 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(A) [[false accounting]] and [[embezzlement]] in order to mask payments of substantial "black funds", committed in 1988–94.&lt;br&gt;
(B) [[tax fraud]] equal in total to more than €62 million (120bn lira), committed in 1988–98.

Both indictments were related to achievement of personal [[tax evasion]], through illicit trade of [[film rights|movie rights]] between Mediaset and secret fictive foreign companies situated in [[tax haven]] nations, causing fictive losses for Mediaset, with the trade gains being accumulated by the foreign companies owned by the indicted tax fraudsters, who ultimately had the gains paid out as personal profit without paying tax in Italy. In 2007, the court case at first-instance had not yet been launched, and the prosecutors dropped the (A) charges against Berlusconi due to the statute of limitations, and for the same reason the (B) charges were narrowed down to the 1994-98 period, in which the prosecutor charged Berlusconi for having committed a personal tax evasion of €7.3 million.&lt;ref name="Mediaset trial 1+2"/&gt;

On 26 October 2012 Silvio Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in an Italian court and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/10/26/the-3-reasons-silvio-berlusconi-might-never-see-prison/| title=Three reasons Silvio Berlusconi might never see prison |work=Washington Post | date=26 October 2012 | accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also banned from running for public office for a five-year term. The sentence has been confirmed by the Court of Appeals in Milan on 8 May 2013.

The [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] decided to deal with the appeal to the sentence of the Court of Appeals on 30 July because for some parts of the verdict the statute of limitations would come into force at 1 August 2013. This caused the political party [[The People of Freedom]] with support of a part of their coalition partners to suspend the activities of the National Assembly and the Senate for one day. The Court of Cassation confirmed on 1 August the sentence of four years imprisonment (of which the last three years are automatically [[pardon]]ed),&lt;ref name="4 year imprisonment"/&gt; and shortly afterwards the related additional court imposed public office ban was recalculated from five to two years by the Appeals Court;&lt;ref name="2-year public office ban"/&gt; which subsequently also was confirmed on last instance by the Court of Cassation.&lt;ref name="Court of Cassation confirmed the 2 year public office ban"/&gt;

On 27 November 2013, the Italian Senate voted to expel Berlusconi from his seat in parliament due to his final court conviction, and bar him from taking any public office for an extended period of six years, based on the Severino law. While the court had already declared Berlusconi unfit for public office, the Italian Senate also had to confirm the expulsion in a full vote, before it took effect. The Senate vote came after Berlusconi no longer commanded enough support in parliament to bring down the government, which had previously been an issue. In its article about the expulsion, Reuters reported that Berlusconi is preparing his media empire to attack the Enrico Letta's coalition government. With his expulsion from Parliament, Berlusconi lost his parliamentary immunity, which can have consequences in other active court cases against Berlusconi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/27/us-italy-berlusconi-idUSBRE9AQ0P220131127|title=Berlusconi expelled from Italian parliament over tax fraud|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi began serving his community service at a catholic care home center on 9 May 2014, where he is required to work four hours a week for a year with elderly dementia patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27336754|title=Berlusconi begins one-year community sentence|publisher=BBC|date=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ongoing proceedings==

===Bribery of senators supporting the Prodi-government (2006)===
In February 2013, Silvio Berlusconi is under investigation for corruption and illegal financing of political parties from the public prosecutor of [[Naples]], in the figures of Vincenzo Piscitelli, [[John Woodcock (magistrate)|Henry John Woodcock]], Francesco Curcio, Alessandro Milita and Fabrizio Vanorio. He is accused of bribing in 2006, with €3 million (of which 1 million declared and 2 million undeclared to the tax authorities), directed to Senator [[Sergio De Gregorio (politician)|Sergio De Gregorio]] (the former leader of the [[Italians in the World]] party) to facilitate its passage&lt;ref&gt;"The charge is based on a singular reversal of provisions intended to monitor and protect (free) parliamentary activity. Since our Constitution prohibits the imperative mandate to MPs (in essence, the Member may at any time at its discretion to change its political position no risking forfeiture of the mandate given by the voters), the prosecution of the criminal case it has not already felt that you could not configure the corruption (to act contrary to official duties) provided that any official duty exists in the parliamentary leader, but on the contrary argued - and supports - that the very payment of a sum of money has, in fact, led to the rise of a mandatory (prohibited)": see http://www.goleminformazione.it/articoli/immunita-parlamentare-diritto-politico-lo-scudo-di-cartone.html#.VYo0i2AuV6B.&lt;/ref&gt; into the ranks of the Berlusconi led coalition [[House of Freedoms]]. Along with Berlusconi, a journalist ([[Valter Lavitola]]) at the head of the newspaper ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'' was also investigated, and Sergio De Gregorio self-confessed being the recipient of the bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://napoli.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/02/28/news/berlusconi_indagato_a_napoli_per_compravendita_di_senatori-53565459/?ref=HREA-1|title=Berlusconi indagato a Napoli per compravendita di senatori|language=Italian|publisher=La Repubblica|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October 2013, Silvio Berlusconi and Valter Lavitola were both indicted by the judge for preliminary hearings, Amelia Primavera. For Senator De Gregorio the process has already been closed in a preliminary hearing, because he opted to self-confess and bargained a reduced sentence of 20 months in prison for the crime. The court hearing at first-instance for the indicted Silvio Berlusconi, has been scheduled to start on 11 February 2014.&lt;ref name="Corruption of Prodi senators (ANSA)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corruption of Prodi senators (AGI)"/&gt; During the court proceedings, ex-senator [[:it:Paolo Rossi (politico 1958)|Paolo Rossi]] (a former member of the [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|Olive Tree party]]) also testified to have been offered a bribe from Berlusconi by another ex-Senator [[:it:Antonio Tomassini|Antonio Tomassini]] (a former member of the defunct Christian Democrats), to change political sides and join Silvio Berlusconi's center-right bloc, so that they together could cause the fall of the Romano Prodi government in 2006–08. According to the prosecutors, Valter Lavitola was as well working on behalf of Berlusconi as a go-between attempting to also bribe other senators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2014/05/07/rossi-offered-bribe-to-join-berlusconi_fc6e83b3-ae53-4e81-86d0-e07929a2e86e.html|title=Rossi 'offered bribe' to join Berlusconi|publisher=ANSA|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his solicitor, Professor Coppi, "recalled the constitutional basis of the freedom of parliamentary activity, the prosecutor Woodcock reacted indicating the illegality of the transfer of money, which resulted in the sale of senators.

On 20 April 2017 the Appeal Court of Naples ruled that, although the accusations against Mr Berlusconi were true, the statute of limitations applied, in other words the case had been "timed out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2017-04-20/compravendita-senatori-appello-prescrizione-berlusconi--164429.shtml?uuid=AEoKbf8&amp;refresh_ce=1|title=Compravendita senatori, prescrizione per Berlusconi|work=Il Sole 24 ORE|access-date=2017-04-20|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is worth noting that in spite of the overwhelming strength of the evidence against him, Mr Berlusconi went unpunished whilst the recipient of the bribe accepted a prison sentence.  This was due to Berlusconi's government (in 2011) shortening the time limits for completing a successful prosecution before the statute of limitations kicked in, which allowed his lawyer to play for time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blitzquotidiano.it/politica-italiana/prescrizione-breve-cosa-cambia-berlusconi-prescritto-mills-794662/|title=Cosa cambia con la prescrizione breve?

===Defamation against Antonio Di Pietro (2008)===
Berlusconi has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the educational degree of the former [[Mani Pulite|Operation "Clean Hands"]] magistrate and leader of the [[Italy of Values]] party, [[Antonio Di Pietro]], when he during a 2008 election rally and in an episode of the talk show Porta a Porta in March 2008, repeatedly claimed, that Di Pietro had not obtained his magistrate degree by passing the exams, but with the complicity of the secret services diverted, in order to have a judge placed in the system to overturn the parties of the so-called [[History of Italy as a Republic#The First Republic (1947-1992)|First Republic]]. Di Pietro subsequently sued Berlusconi for aggravated [[defamation]] in June 2008. The public prosecutor concluded the preliminary investigation 13 November 2009, by indicting Berlusconi for the defamation offense referred to in Article 595 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. The [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] then intervened in the case by passing a decree 22 September 2010, granting all Italian parliamentarians "absolute immunity" for words spoken while elected.&lt;ref name="Constitutional Court: Case II against Camera"/&gt;

On 5 October 2010, the court in [[Viterbo]] considered Berlusconi could not be judged or punished, because of the parliamentarian immunity Article 68 of the Italian constitution forbidding any legal prosecutions against words spoken by parliamentarians in the process of their "exercise of parliamentary duties", in conjunction with the Chamber of Deputies recently having voted for a decree to appoint Berlusconi absolute immunity for any spoken words while serving as a deputy. On 19 January 2012, this judgment was set aside by the Supreme Court, which ruled that Berlusconi had been speaking during a campaign rally and not in an institutional setting; meaning he was not covered by the immunity protection provided for by the constitutions Article 68, and consequently should face a new court trial to be held either at the Viterbo court or the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/News/Politica/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero_312877649022.html |title=Cassazione: Berlusconi accusato di diffamazione a Di Pietro, si riparte da zero |language=Italian |publisher=Adnkronos |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216134336/http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/News/Politica/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero_312877649022.html |archivedate=16 February 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cassazione: Berlusconi accusato di diffamazione a Di Pietro, si riparte da zero |url=http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/914198/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero.html |language=Italian |publisher=LiberoQuotidiano.it |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804135806/http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/914198/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero.html |archivedate=4 August 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2013, the Viterbo court decided to transfer the case for judgement directly to the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref name="Constitutional Court shall decide if Di Pietro case can be judged"/&gt; The Constitutional Court ruled on 20 June 2013, that the Chamber of Deputies decree having extended Berlusconi's immunity beyond what was provided for by the constitution, was a case with conflict of powers and should be disregarded. This mean that Berlusconi do not enjoy any special immunity protection for his spoken words during election campaigns, and that a court case now shall be held by the constitutional court, to decide the merits of the case. Before the case against Berlusconi can begin, the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] however shall be called for trial to defend and explain the reasons for passing their unconstitutional law from 2010.&lt;ref name="Constitutional Court reopened the Di Pietro case"/&gt; The court hearing against the Chamber of Deputies took place on 8 July 2014,&lt;ref name="Public hearing video 8 July 2014"/&gt; where the constitutional court was asked to deem the concerned Chamber of Deputies decree to be unconstitutional and annul it, by the Court of Rome&lt;ref name="Constitutional Court: Case I against Camera"/&gt; and the Viterbo court.&lt;ref name="Constitutional Court: Case II against Camera"/&gt; On 18 July 2014, the Constitutional Court indeed ruled the decree to be unconstitutional and annulled it; meaning that the civil court proceedings against Berlusconi now can continue.&lt;ref name="Constitutional Court ruling 221/2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Constitutional Court ruling 222/2014"/&gt;

===Ruby process: Child prostitution and abuse of office (2010)===
{{see also|2013 Silvio Berlusconi conviction}}
Silvio Berlusconi was indicted for paying Moroccan nightclub dancer [[Karima El Mahroug]], also known by the stage name Ruby Rubacuori (Italian for "Ruby the Heartstealer"), for sexual services between February and May 2010 when she was one year below the sexual criminal minimum age of 18. He was also indicted for abuse of office, by having arranged to have El Mahroug released from police detention, during an incident in which she was briefly held on claims of theft in May 2010. As evidence for the crimes, the police investigators submitted lawful interceptions of mobile phone conversations. In June 2013, Berlusconi was convicted of the charge and sentenced to seven years imprisonment and a lifetime public office ban, pending an appeal launched to the Appeals Court - and ultimately perhaps also a final appeal launched to the [[Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref name="BBC News Online"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-23034167|title=Italian ex-PM Berlusconi sentenced in Ruby sex case|publisher=BBC News Online|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, Silvio Berlusconi deposited an appeal against the judgment, requesting the complete absolution.&lt;ref name="Berlusconi appeals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/01/02/processo-ruby-berlusconi-deposita-appello-e-chiede-assoluzione/830232/|title=Processo Ruby, Silvio Berlusconi deposita appello e chiede assoluzione|publisher=''Il Fatto Quotidiano''|date=2 January 2014|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal process began on 20 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2014/06/10/processo-ruby-berlusconi_n_5480541.html|title=Silvio Berlusconi cavalca la guerra in procura per rallentare il processo Ruby|publisher=''The Huffington Post''|date=10 June 2014|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2014, the Italian appeals court announced the appeal had been successful and the convictions against Berlusconi were being overturned.&lt;ref name="BerlusconiAcquitted"&gt;{{cite news|title=Legal victory for Berlusconi as court annuls prison sentence|url=http://www.theitalynews.net/index.php/sid/223906793/scat/145bb158ac2f80f2/ht/Legal-victory-for-Berlusconi-as-court-annuls-prison-sentence|accessdate=18 July 2014|publisher=''The Italy News.Net''}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the court's published summary of the judgement, Berlusconi was acquitted from the extortion charges (abuse of power) because "the fact does not exist" and from the child prostitution charge because "the fact is not a crime".&lt;ref name="Ruby case appeal judgment summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilpost.it/2014/07/18/live-berlusconi-assolto-ruby/|title=Processo Ruby, Berlusconi assolto in appello|language=Italian|publisher=Ilpost.it|date=18 July 2014|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more detailed court reasoning for acquittal will be published within 90 days, and the prosecutor stated he would then most likely appeal the decision to the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref name="Next steps in the Ruby case"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2014/07/18/news/caso_ruby_il_giorno_della_sentenza_atteso_per_oggi_il_verdetto_d_appello-91851295/|title=Caso Ruby, clamorosa sentenza in appello: Berlusconi assolto da tutti i reati|language=Italian|publisher=La Repubblica|date=18 July 2014|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ongoing investigations==
In addition to the ongoing court trials, Berlusconi is currently also involved in the following two ongoing legal investigations, which will evolve to become an ongoing court trial if the judge at the preliminary hearing indict him of the alleged crime:

* '''Ruby [[wikt:ter#Latin|ter]] (2011–13):''' Corruption in judicial acts (bribing witnesses) in connection with evidence submitted at the main "Ruby case". Allegedly a bribery with €2500 paid per month for each of the 18 Olgettine girls from [[Arcore]] (the girls - including Ruby - participating in the evening events at Berlusconi's residents) to speak in favor of Berlusconi, had been started by his two defending lawyers, [[Niccolò Ghedini]] and [[:it:Piero Longo|Piero Longo]], in the aftermath of the opened police investigation on 15 January 2011. In addition the Mediaset journalist Silvia Trevaini had allegedly been bribed, not only by the same monthly fee but also by extra gifts equal to €800,000. Finally Ruby, in particular, had been promised by Berlusconi "a huge reward if she would keep quiet or otherwise make him mad", and Ruby had replied she was "waiting for €5 million". On 23 January 2014, the public prosecutor Edmondo Bruti Liberati, asked for a legal case to be opened for a preliminary hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/14_gennaio_23/ruby-ter-indagato-silvio-berlusconi-l-accusa-corruzione-atti-giudiziari-e27a629e-8415-11e3-a32e-831830ba1aa5.shtml|title="Ruby ter", indagato Berlusconi È accusato di avere corrotto i testimoni|language=Italian|publisher=Corriere Della Sera|date=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Illegal financing of the political party [[Italians in the World]]:''' On 16 April 2014, the Naples prosecutor deposited new documents in which Berlusconi is under investigation for the crime in recent years of illegal financing of the political party Italians in the World, being led by ex-Senator [[:it:Sergio De Gregorio|Sergio De Gregorio]]. Currently this process is under investigation, with an upcoming preliminary hearing to decide if an court indictment shall be filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/interni/napoli-pm-chiede-nuove-indagini-su-silvio-berlusconi-1011425.html|title=Napoli, pm chiede nuove indagini su Silvio Berlusconi|language=Italian|publisher=Il Giornale|date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Bulgaria}}

The '''Vice President of the Republic of Bulgaria''' is a position, established by the [[Constitution of Bulgaria]], and the only vice presidential office in the [[European Union]] (EU).&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Under the current [[Constitution of Cyprus]], there is post of Vice President of Cyprus that is reserved for a Turkish Cypriot, however since December 1963, the Turkish Cypriots have had no participation in the government, thus leaving the post of Vice President vacant since then.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vice president is elected in a popular vote, along with the [[president of Bulgaria|president]]. Candidates for president and vice president run on their party ticket and are prohibited from serving in any other post upon election.

According to the constitution the vice president shall be principal assistant to the president in his/her official duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter Four: President of the Republic|url=http://www.parliament.bg/en/const/|work=Constitution|publisher=National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1971–1990 period, the Chairmen of the State Council — [[Todor Zhivkov]] (1971–1989) and [[Petar Mladenov]] (1989–1990) — were the heads of state of Bulgaria. The First Deputy Chairmen of the State Council were deputy heads of state. The State Council was abolished on April 3, 1990.

Below is a list of First Deputy Chairmen of the State Council and Vice-Presidents of the Republic of Bulgaria:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3990">The '''Weerbaarheidsafdeling''' (typically called '''WA''') was the paramilitary arm of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] (Dutch: NSB), the fascist political party that collaborated with the German occupiers of the Netherlands during [[World War II]]. The organization, roughly equivalent to the German [[Sturmabteilung|SA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierik|first=Perry|title=Van Leningrad tot Berlijn: Nederlandse vrijwilligers in dienst van de Duitse Waffen-SS 1941-1945 : geschiedenis van het legioen, de brigade en de divisie 'Nederland'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpchAQAAIAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Aspekt|isbn=9789059114135}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1932 by Anton Mussert,&lt;ref name=europeana/&gt; co-founder of the NSB in 1931 and its leader until the end of the war.

In 1940, after the German invasion, the WA became openly active again, and more ruthless than before. They specialized in violent attacks, particularly on the Dutch Jewish population.&lt;ref name=europeana&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021622/detail_no_jsp_action_detail_imid_78393.html|title=De WA (Weerbaarheidsafdeling) van de NSB|work=[[Europeana]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupation ==
After the occupation the WA was put to use in much the same way as the SA was, forcing owners of restaurants and cafes to put up signs saying ''Jooden niet gewenscht'' ("Jews not welcome") and harassing and provoking inhabitants of neighbourhoods with many Jewish inhabitants. This led to the formation of ''"knokploegen"'', informal militias, and fights erupting between the WA and Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants. On February 9, 1941 there were riots on the [[Rembrandtplein]] between the WA and Jewish youngsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tweede-wereldoorlog.org/februaristaking.html|title=tweede-wereldoorlog.org, Februaristaking|work=Nederland in de Tweede Wereldoorlog|language=Dutch|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 11 a group of 40 to 50 WA members marched through Amsterdam to the [[Waterlooplein]] in the heart of the Jewish neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onsamsterdam.nl/tijdschrift/jaargang-2012/478-nummer-2-februari-2011?start=2|title=''Kameraden in de knokploeg van Koot''|work=Ons Amsterdam|language=Dutch|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a pitched battle with Jewish and inhabitants of the [[Jordaan]] in which [[Hendrik Koot|WA member Koot]] was severely injured. He died a few days later; he was buried with great pomp, and stylized a martyr, in much the same way as [[Horst Wessel]] in Nazi Germany. The events led to the first [[Roundup (history)|razzias]], deportations of Jews and formation of a ghetto in Amsterdam, and from there to the [[February strike]].
