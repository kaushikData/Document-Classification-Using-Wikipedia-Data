'''Alfred Arthur Hinchcliffe Denville''' (27 January 1876 – 23 March 1955&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Ncommons1.htm The House of Commons Constituencies Beginning with 'N']&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[England|English]] actor, theatre impresario and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician.

Denville, an actor by trade, ran one of the UK's leading [[repertory]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.svp.org.uk/04members/obituaries/denville.htm |title=Obituary of Barry Denville |access-date=7 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723162741/http://www.svp.org.uk/04members/obituaries/denville.htm |archive-date=23 July 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 Denville founded [[Denville Hall]], a [[retirement home]] for actors in [[Northwood, London]] that is still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/joan-hirst-647739.html Obituary of Joan Hirst]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a politician Denville was elected as the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Newcastle upon Tyne Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle upon Tyne Central seat]] from [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Sir Charles Trevelyan]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] and held the seat until he was defeated in 1945. For a time he was associated with the [[far right]] of the Conservative Party, and during the 1930s was a leading member of the Friends of National Spain, which stressed support for [[Francisco Franco]] and [[anti-communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, 2002, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; He had also declared himself to be an admirer of [[Benito Mussolini]] although, in keeping with a number of contemporary Tories who admired the southern European fascists, he was critical of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griffiths, ''Fellow Travellers on the Right'', Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A British Welterweight Championship was first set up in 1938 under [[All-in professional wrestling|All-In rules]] and won by Harold Angus.&lt;ref name=BrWelterweight&gt;{{cite book|first1=Royal | last1=Duncan | first2=Gary | last2=Will | title=Wrestling title histories: professional wrestling champions around the world from the 19th century to the present | chapter=Europe - Great Britain: British Welterweight Title|page=402|publisher=Archeus Communications|location=Pennsylvania|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom#Mountevans' committee|Mountevans Committee]] in 1947 called for the establishment of a British Welterweight Title and so recognised the still-incumbent All In titleholder Angus as champion.&lt;ref name=BrWelterweight/&gt; This lineage was recognised by [[Joint Promotions]] following its 1952 formation. The title would later be transplanted to [[All Star Wrestling]] following champion [[Danny Boy Collins|Danny Collins]]' defection in the late 1980s, where it would remain active until the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=BrWelterweight/&gt;  In the 21st century, revivals of the title have been hosted by The Wrestling Alliance in 2000-2003 and [[Revolution British Wrestling]] in 2003-2005 before most recently being contested for in [[LDN (wrestling)|LDN]]'s Academy/Spirit League since 2006. &lt;ref name=welter /&gt;

The title first became recognised by RBW in August 2003, when a decider contest was held between [[Spud (wrestler)|Spud]] and [[Jack Hazard]] which saw Spud crowned RBW's first British Welterweight Champion. The last RBW holder would be [[Kid Regis]] who would hold the belt at the time of RBW's eventual closedown in late 2005. &lt;ref name=welter /&gt;

Regis continued to defend the Welterweight Championship on the indy circuit, eventually losing it to Tex Benedict in 2006 in LDN, who in turn lost it to current champion Alan Travis in 2008.&lt;ref name=welter /&gt;

==Title histories==
This is the combined list of different versions of the British Welterweight Titles,&lt;ref name=welter /&gt; each of which was probably the most significant version at the time. Each version may or may not be connected to another. However, all title changes are either actual or "official" unless indicated otherwise.

'''Brock Gill''' (born January 6, 1975) is an illusionist, stunt artist and evangelist based out of Nashville, Tennessee.

== Early years ==
Gill attended [[East Texas Baptist University]] and had a reputation for having spontaneous church services in the open air quad on campus, baptizing people in the campus fountain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thrill Ride: a million miles. 2000 shows. one miraculous god.|last=Gill|first=Any|publisher=Amazon Create Space|year=2014|isbn=|location=San Bernardino, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 22 Gill felt led to become an illusionist and evangelist when working the graveyard shift at a saw mill in [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]]. With ear plugs in and no one to talk to, he started praying, which led to his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyadvance.com/Lifestyles/2017/07/20/World-traveling-illusionist-to-appear-at-MACU.html|title=World - traveling illusionist to appear at macs|last=Beamon|first=C|date=July 20, 2017|website=Daily Advance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A youth pastor at the church in Texarkana where he was doing ministry took him to a magic shop. The man behind the counter did a simple trick, awakening something in Gill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Brock is married to Aundrea “Auny" Gill. Brock and Auny met in 1997 while attending East Texas Baptist University where she was studying to become a child psychologist. The two married on May 8, 1999, at her father’s church in Shephard, Texas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The couple originally resided in Texas, later moving into a totorhome as they traveled the United States evangelizing through illusion. They now reside in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
In 1994, Gill started his career ministering through illusion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caliberoutreach.com/about/|title=About Us|website=Caliber Outreach|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill has shared the stage with many well known speakers, worship leaders, and artists such as Franklin Graham, Luis Palau, John Piper, David Nasser, Adrian Rogers, Toby Mac, Audio Adrenaline, Third Day, Relient K, Jaci Velasquez, Skillet, Mercy Me, Casting Crowns, and others.

He has performed for such organizations as Focus On The Family, BigStuf Camps, Student Life, Superwow, and on tours such as Winter Jam (2004), The Louis Palau Association’s Livin’ It with Stephen Baldwin, and Christ in Youth’s Believe tour (2001). He has appeared on multiple television programs like The GMA Dove Awards (2006), The Harvest Show, At Home Live, and Fox News Channel’s Fox and Friends and in numerous other media outlets including Passageway.com, Crosswalk.com, Baptist Standard, Christian Single, On Course Magazine, and radio programs across the country.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brockgill.com|title=about|last=|first=|date=|website=www.brockgill.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill is also a part of Freedom Experience, a nationwide city tour that combines action sports, music, and illusion.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2017 Gill performed with the Newsboys, Sidewalk Prophets, Blanca, Derk Minor, and Seventh Time Down as part of the Big Church Night Out tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/lehigh-valley-music/mc-ent-review-newsboys-stabler-arena-big-church-night-out-20171216-story.html|title=REVIEW: Newsboys show 'new' singer's influence, other acts good at Big Church Night Out at Stabler|last=Moser|first=John J.|work=themorningcall.com|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Filmography ==
In 2005, Gill hosted ''Miracles of Jesus'', a three-hour documentary produced by the BBC and aired on the Discovery Channel.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Gill has released four full-length DVDs: ''Close-Up and Personal'' (2002) and ''Hidden Agenda'' (2005), each produced by Jupiter Project, the Dove Award-winning creators of Third Day’s ''The Offerings Experience'' and Michael W. Smith’s ''Worship''. ''Standing Room Only'' (2006) features big stunts, such as "the bullet catch," as well as pro skateboarder Tim Byrne, X-Games gold medalist freestyle motocross rider Kevin Johnson, and other artists. His latest DVD, ''Alive on Stage'', is available to watch on Hulu. The videos are designed to be practical evangelism tools, because they always feature a Gospel presentation.

== Organizations ==
Caliber Outreach is a non-profit organization founded by Gill that sends creative evangelists out into the world. The organization provides evangelism training for those looking to share their faith, strengthen churches in their evangelistic efforts, and strategically advance the gospel throughout creative methods. Students come from the United States and other countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Gill and his wife Auny have also partnered with other non-profit groups such as Compassion International, Soles 4 Soles and Parties With a Purpose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Computer-assisted gaming''' ('''CAG''') and '''computer-assisted wargaming''' (CAWG) refer to games which are at least partially computerized, but where on important part of the action is not virtual but performed in real life or on a miniature terrain. Regulation of the game can be done completely by a computer or partly deferred to a human referee. Computer-assisted gaming attempts to combine the advantages of [[Personal computer games|PC games]] with those of face-to-face games. In computer-assisted gaming, computers are used for recordkeeping and sometimes for the resolution of combat, but a Human referee makes any decisions requiring judgement.

== Variations ==
A computer-assisted game can be little more than a collection of rules and notes on computer, or as complete as a computer game, with a human referee needed only to make the non-random decisions.  It can be played remotely or with everyone in the same room looking at one or more computer monitors.  (The referee must have his own monitor; the players can share one, or each player can have his own.  Or only the referee may have a monitor, with the players using paper as usual.)  This flexibility allows players to combine the best aspects of paper-and-pencil and computer games while computerizing the game as much or as little as desired.
 
Computer-assisted games are mostly not designed toward recreating the battlefield inside computer memory, but employing the computer to play the role of game master by storing game rules and unit (wargames) or role (role playing games) characteristics, tracking unit or character status and positions or distances, animating the game with sounds and voice and resolving combat (shooting and close combat). All distance relationships are tracked on the tabletop. All record-keeping is tracked by the computer.

===Role-playing games===
[[Role-playing game]]s were one of the first types of games for which computer-assisted gaming programs were developed. Computer-aided role-playing game programs are designed to help [[game master]]s and players alike.  Those programs range from acting as convenient format for a character sheet;&lt;ref name="RPGxplorer"&gt;{{cite web| title=www.rpgxplorer.com |url=http://www.rpgxplorer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other game materials;&lt;ref name="Reynolds99"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sean Reynolds  | title=[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons CD-ROM Core Rules|Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Core Rules CD-ROM 2.0]] | isbn= 0-7869-0793-2  | publisher=TSR | year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carton08"&gt;{{cite book| author=Jans Carton  | title=www.D20SRD.org | isbn= 0-7869-0793-2  | publisher=TSR | year= 2008 |url=http://www.d20srd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; all the way up to full automation of the [[game mechanic]]s of a [[role-playing game system]] {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. This is especially useful for character creation/maintenance and rules resolutions for complex [[simulationist]] games.

===Poker===
{{main|Poker tools}}

There are multiple poker tools that allow players to do statistical analysis of games. An example is a [[poker calculator]], which determines the player's probability of winning, losing, or tying a hand.

===Tabletop projection===
Another example of computer-assisted gaming growing in popularity among [[role-playing game]] players is the use of a [[digital projector]] or [[Video monitor|flat screen monitors]] to present maps or other visual elements during game play. These elements may be used on their own, or in concert with [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] to map out combats, and exploration or to introduce other visual media into the game without resorting to printing or drawing these items.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.d20srd.org/extras/tabletop_projection/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730213357/http://www.d20srd.org/extras/tabletop_projection/ |archivedate=2012-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Webcam data acquisition===
[[File:Computer-assisted wargaming using the webcam of a tablet..JPG|thumb|Computer-assisted wargaming using the webcam of a tablet.]] Webcam enabled computer-assisted wargames use computer vision to process firing with images of the camera. In the case of an external USB camera, it is placed behind the firing unit selected (third person shooter) in the direction of the target. When a tablet is used the rear webcam is selected. Precise positioning of the webcam behind the shooting unit is not required : it is sufficient both the shooting unit and the target unit are displayed on the captured image for the shot to be valid. This makes the usage of a tablet very practical for these games. Target detection algorithms (improved magic wand contour, polygon simplification, convex hull algorithms, polygon degree of convexity) allow to analyze the characteristics of the target and to estimate the distance to the target. Damage is computed by taking into the account distance (in distance units) between the firing unit and the target, the type of gun (anti-tank value) of the firing unit and the thickness of the armor of the target (defend value).

'''Constrained comics''' is a form of [[comics]] that places some fundamental constraint on form beyond those inherent to the medium. By adding a constraint, the artist is attempting to produce original art within tightly defined boundaries.

A conceptually similar movement is the [[constrained writing]] movement, where writers have attempted to do things such as write novels in [[palindrome|palindromic]] form or [[Lipogram|without the letter "e"]]. [[Poetry]] is sometimes constrained into specific rhyme and meter categories such as [[haiku]] or [[sonnet]].

==Examples==
Notable examples of constrained comics:
* [[Gustave Verbeek]]'s ''The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo'', a weekly 6-panel comic strip in which the first half of the story was illustrated and captioned right-side-up, then the reader would turn the page up-side-down, and the inverted illustrations with additional captions describing the scenes told the second half of the story, for a total of 12 panels.
* ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]'' a comic strip by [[David Lynch]]. Each four-panel comic has identical artwork. The only change between each comic is the dialogue in the first three panels.
* ''[[Dinosaur Comics]]'' which uses the same artwork, with only dialogue changing.
* ''[[Watchmen]]'' is created with a number of formal constraints; issue #5 in particular, entitled "Fearful Symmetry", follows a palindromic structure.
* ''[[Partially Clips]]'' which uses three identical panels based on [[clipart]].
* The many works of the [[Oubapo]] group.
* [[Matt Madden]]'s ''[[99 Ways to Tell a Story: Exercises in Style|99 Ways to Tell a Story]]''.
* ''[[Garfield Minus Garfield]]'', which features the comic character [[Jon Arbuckle]] without the titular cat, who has been digitally removed from the otherwise untouched comic.

[[File:Hanns Bolz Emmy Hennings 1911.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Emmy Hennings's portrait'' by [[Hanns Bolz]], 1911]] 
'''Emmy Hennings''' (born '''Emma Maria Cordsen''', 17 January 1885 &amp;ndash; 10 August 1948) was a performer and poet. She was also the wife of celebrated [[Dada]]ist [[Hugo Ball]]. Despite her own achievements, it is difficult to come by information in English about Hennings that is not directly related to her relationship with Hugo Ball. Several biographies of Hennings have been published in German.

==Life and work==

Hennings was born in [[Flensburg]], [[German Empire]], describing herself later as "a seaman's child".&lt;ref name="WAJ81"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rugh|first=Thomas|year=1981|title=Emmy Hennings and the Emergence of Zurich Dada|journal=Woman's Art Journal|publisher=Woman's Art Inc. {{Subscription required}}|volume=2|issue=1|jstor=1357892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of her first marriage in 1906, Hennings was an itinerant performer, travelling over much of the European continent.&lt;ref name="WAJ81"/&gt; She was a performer at the [[Cabaret Simplizissimus]] in [[Munich]], when she met Ball in 1913.

At the time, Hennings was already a published poet, whose works had appeared in [[left-wing]] publications called ''Pan'' and ''[[Die Aktion]]''. In 1913 she also published a short poetry collection called ''Ether Poems'', or ''Äthergedichte'' in German. Later, Hennings was a collaborator to the magazine ''Revolution'', which was founded by Ball and [[Hans Leybold]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Hennings and Ball moved to [[Zurich]] in 1915, where they took part in the founding of the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], which marked the beginning of the [[Dada]] movement. Hennings was a regular performer at the Cabaret Voltaire. Her performances included a role in ''Das Leben des Menschen'' (the Life of a Man), in which she appeared with Ball. This was the German premiere of the play by [[Leonid Andreev]]. Hennings also performed in a piece written by Ball, called ''Krippenspiel''. After the Cabaret Voltaire ended, Hennings and Ball toured, performing mostly in hotels. Hennings sang, did puppetry, and danced to music composed by Ball. She also recited her own poetry. In 1916 Ball and Hennings created Arabella, their own ensemble troupe, where Hennings performed under the name Dagny. Hennings married Ball on 21 February 1920. Although they had no children together, Hennings had a daughter, Annemarie, from a previous relationship. Hennings, who outlived Ball by two decades, lived in [[Magliaso]], [[Switzerland]] from 1942 to 1948. She died at a clinic in [[Sorengo]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Bärbel Reetz. ''Emmy Ball-Hennings: Leben im Vielleicht.'' Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 2001, p. 331-332&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dada star==
In ''The Magic Bishop: Hugo Ball, Dada Poet'', author [[Erdmute Wenzel White]] writes that Hennings “was admired by expressionists as the incarnation of the cabaret artist of her time... The shining star of the Voltaire, according to the ''Zuricher Post'' ([[Zurich Post]]), her role in Dada has not been adequately acknowledged.” (p.&amp;nbsp;11).

White also cites a poem by [[Johannes Becher]] which he uses as evidence that Emmy served as a muse for other artists of the time:&lt;br&gt;"It was in Munich, at the Café Stefanie,&lt;br&gt;Where I recited for you, Emmy, poems&lt;br&gt;That I dared tell only you,"

==Poetry==
The following poem is an example of Hennings' poetry:

'''Tänzerin'''

Dir ist als ob ich schon gezeichnet wäre

Und auf der Totenliste stünde.

Es hält mich ab von mancher Sünde.

Wie langsam ich am Leben zehre.

Und ängstlich sind oft meine Schritte,

Mein Herz hat einen kranken Schlag

Und schwächer wird's mit jedem Tag.

Ein Todesengel steht in meines Zimmers Mitte.

Doch tanz ich bis zur Atemnot.

Bald werde ich im Grabe liegen

Und niemand wird sich an mich schmiegen.

Ach, küssen will ich bis zum Tod.

'''Dancer'''

To you it's as if I was already

Marked and waiting on Death's list.

It keeps me safe from many sins.

How slowly life drains out of me.

My steps are often steeped in gloom,

My heart beats in a sickly way

And it gets weaker every day.

A death angel stands in the middle of my room.

Yet I dance till I'm out of breath.

Soon lying in the grave I'll be

And no one will snuggle up to me.

Oh, give me kisses up till death.

'''''Faith Fighter''''' is an online [[fighting game]] developed by the [[Italy|Italian]] website [[Molleindustria]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?Calls_to_ban_online_game_of_Holy_hatred&amp;in_article_id=635709&amp;in_page_id=34 "Calls to ban online game of Holy hatred"], ''Metro'', 26 April 2009&lt;br&gt;- {{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/28/islamic-group-forces-site_n_192220.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Stuart | last=Whatley | title=Islamic Group Forces Site To Remove Satirical Religious Video Game "Faith Fighter" | date=28 April 2009}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,518228,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Jesus vs. Mohammed?

in which players fight as religious figures such as [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Jesus]] or [[Muhammad]] and must fight [[Xenu]] after beating all playable characters.

The game was temporarily withdrawn from its hosting web site in late April 2009, in response to protests from the Islamophobia Observatory of the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rawstory.com/08/blog/2009/04/29/faith-fighter-game-goes-offline-after-muslim-protest/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504011827/http://rawstory.com/08/blog/2009/04/29/faith-fighter-game-goes-offline-after-muslim-protest/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-05-04 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |title=Faith Fighter game goes offline after Muslim protest |df= }}&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=15116 "Muslims against ‘faith fighters’ videogame"], ''AsiaNews.it'', 29 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the game's creators posted a sequel to the game with the figure of Muhammad's face censored, in which the player must bestow "love" by clicking on each religious figure in turn: without this action, the figures slowly fade away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article6194162.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Banned Faith Fighter game gets a caring sequel | first=Mike | last=Harvey | date=29 April 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original game has since been reposted on the maker's website.

In [[Brazil]], [[Universo Online]] was forced to remove the game from its servers following a judicial ruling, in a case sponsored by a mosque in [[Barretos]], [[São Paulo state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conjur.com.br/2011-mar-09/uol-tirar-ar-game-ofensivo-muculmanos-decide-tj-paulista "UOL deve tirar do ar game ofensivo a muçulmanos, decide TJ paulista"], ''Consultor Jurídico'', 9 March 2009 (In Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fighting Cholitas''' are a group of female [[wrestlers]] who perform in [[El Alto|El Alto, Bolivia]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;Forero, Juan. "In This Corner, in the Flouncy Skirt and Bowler Hat..." [[The New York Times]], 2005-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cholitas are part of a group called the [[Titans of the Ring]], which includes both male and female wrestlers. The Titans perform each Sunday for an audience of hundreds at El Alto's Multifunctional Center. Tickets to the exhibitions cost $1.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

The idea of including female wrestlers as a maneuver for publicity came from Juan Mamami, a wrestler and president of the Titans. They routinely attract over a thousand spectators to their bouts in El Alto and several hundred spectators when they travel with the Titans to smaller towns.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Like the general population of El Alto, which consists almost entirely of [[Aymara ethnic group|Aymara]] and [[Quechuas|Quechua]] residents, the Cholitas are [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]]. They wear braided hair, [[bowler hat]]s and multilayered skirts in the ring.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

According to a 2005 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, the Titans earn about $13 for each bout. Most of the wrestlers have other jobs besides their wrestling careers.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

The Fighting Cholitas were featured in an October 2008 episode of the American reality series ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', in which a contestant from each team was tasked with learning and performing a six-step wrestling routine with a Cholita.

==Film==
The Cholitas were the subject of an award-winning 2006 short-subject documentary, ''The Fighting Cholitas''.&lt;ref name="shortsfest"&gt;Adelman, Kim. "'Tanghi Argentini' Dances Away With Four Prizes at Aspen Shortsfest." [[IndieWire]], 2007-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty-minute documentary was directed by [[Mariam Jobrani]] and produced by Jobrani, [[Teresa Deskins]] and [[Kenny Krauss]].&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893327/ "The Fighting Cholitas (2006)".] Internet Movie Database. Retrieved on 2008-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The film received an honorable mention in Short Filmmaking at the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Todd. "Sundance hot for burning issues."

'''Fringe theatre''' is [[theatre]] that is experimental in style or subject matter.&lt;ref name="macmillandictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/fringe-theatre|title=Fringe theatre definition and synonyms &amp;#124; Macmillan Dictionary|publisher=macmillandictionary.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kemp, Robert, ''More that is Fresh in Drama'', Edinburgh Evening News, 14 August 1948&lt;/ref&gt; In [[London]], the fringe are small-scale theatres, many of them located above pubs, and the equivalent to New York's [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatres and Europe's "free theater" groups.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt;

In [[unjuried]] theatre festivals, all submissions are accepted, and sometimes the participating acts may be chosen by lottery, in contrast to [[juried (competition)|juried]] festivals in which acts are selected based on their artistic qualities. Unjuried festivals (e.g., Edinburgh Festival Fringe, [[Adelaide Fringe Festival]], and [[Fringe World]]) permit artists to perform a wide variety of works.

==History==
In 1947, eight theatre companies showed up at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], hoping to gain recognition from the mass gathering at the festival. In 1948, [[Robert Kemp (playwright)|Robert Kemp]], a Scottish journalist and playwright, described the situation, "Round the fringe of official Festival drama, there seems to be more private enterprise than before ... I am afraid some of us are not going to be at home during the evenings!".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] was founded in 1947. The first movement in Britain started in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=cambridge&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubr35UeE-UQC&amp;pg=PA129 |title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered similar to the United States' [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters and Europe's "free theater" groups.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; The term came into use in the late 1950s, and the show ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' premiered in Edinburgh in 1960, before transferring to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and is  the [[West End theatre|West End]].&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; One of the early innovators in fringe theatre was an American bookseller, [[James Haynes]], who in 1963 created the [[Traverse Theatre]] in Edinburgh. Also noted in this period is the [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s Theatre of 13 Rows, and [[Józef Szajna]]'s Studio Theatre in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt;

Haynes, while at the helm of the Traverse, was receiving state support and even got a new theatre in 1969. In 1969, Haynes created the [[Arts Lab]] in London, but it only lasted for two years. [[Peter Brook]] along with another American [[Charles Marowitz]] opened the [[Open Space Theatre]] on [[Tottenham Court Road]] in London in 1968. Young British writers, after the [[May 1968 events in France]], wrote [[agitprop]] plays, including [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]], [[Howard Brenton]], [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]].&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt;

Meanwhile, in the United States, experimental theatre was growing due to the political protest of the [[Vietnam War]]. [[The Living Theatre]], founded by [[Julian Beck]], is considered the leader of the "[[flower power]]" and "hippie" movement.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt;

By the early 1970s, many fringe theatres began to receive small subsidies. After the [[1973–74 stock market crash]], many fringe companies were forced to close. New playwrights were established at the [[Bush Theatre]] and [[King's Head Theatre]], both of whom survived the crash. [[7:84]] and [[Red Ladder Theatre Company]] were some of the surviving touring fringe groups.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt;

Fringe theatres were attractive to people in the 1960s due to their adventurousness but became less wild in the 1970s while the standards of production rose.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt;

In 1982, the first fringe festival in North America{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} was started in Edmonton, Alberta. It was then a theatre component of the larger Summerfest but evolved to become a stand-alone event, the [[Edmonton International Fringe Festival]], one of the largest annual arts events in Canada and still the largest fringe in North America by attendance.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The oldest{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} fringe festival in the United States is Orlando, FL, founded in 1992. There are more fringe festivals in North America than any other continent.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Fringe theatre festival organization==
One distinction between fringe festivals and conventional [[arts festival]]s is the method used to choose participants. Typically, conventional festivals use a jury selection process, whereas many fringe festivals do not use a jury process in their selection criteria. There are exceptions to this; some fringe festivals (e.g., [[New York International Fringe Festival]]) do employ a jury-based selection process.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelder, X. (2006). The world's largest arts festival, The Edinburgh Festival Fringe: mechanics, myth and management. (Electronic Thesis or Dissertation). Retrieved from https://etd.ohiolink.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

All performers are welcome to apply, regardless of their professional or amateur status. No restrictions are made as to the nature, style or theme of the performance, though some festivals have children's areas with appropriate content limitations. Festivals may have too many applicants for the number of available spaces; in this case, applicants are chosen based on an unrelated criterion, such as order of application or a random draw.

The number of performances varies among different fringe festivals. Larger festivals may have thousands of performances (e.g., Edinburgh's 2013 festival had 45,464 performances).&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-23842527|title=Edinburgh Fringe ticket sales up 5% - BBC News|publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fringe festivals typically have a common organising group that handles ticketing, scheduling, and some overall promotion (such as a program including all performers). Each production pays a set fee to this group, which usually includes their stage time as well as the organizational elements. The organising group and/or the venues often rely on a large pool of volunteers.

Ticket pricing varies between festivals. At UK fringe festivals, groups can decide their own ticket prices, and some sell tickets at fixed rates in one or two tiers, or in groups of 5 or 10.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Although it is unusual for the organising group to choose any winners of the festival, other organisations often make their own judgements of festival entries{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
. Productions can be reviewed by newspapers or publications specific to the festival, and awards may be given by certain organisations. Awards or favourable reviews can increase the tickets sales of productions or lead to extra dates being added {{Original research inline|date=February 2011}}.

==Elements of a typical fringe theatre production==
The limitations and opportunities that the fringe festival format presents lead to some common features.

Shows are not judged or juried. Depending on the popularity, some fringe festivals may use a lottery system to determine which shows are selected.

Shows are typically technically sparse. They are commonly presented in shared venues, often with shared technicians and limited technical time, so sets and other [[technical theatre]] elements are kept simple. Venues may be adapted from other uses.

Casts tend to be smaller than mainstream theatre; since many of the performing groups are traveling, and venues (and thus potential income) tend to be fairly small, expenses must usually be kept to a minimum. One-person shows are therefore quite common at fringe festivals. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Fringe festival productions often showcase new scripts, especially ones on more obscure, edgy, or unusual material. The lack of artistic vetting combined with relatively easy entry make risk-taking more feasible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fringenyc.org/index.php/get-involved/participants&lt;/ref&gt;

While most mainstream theatre shows are two or three acts long, taking two to three hours with intermissions, fringe shows tend to be closer to one-hour, single-act productions. The typically lowered ticket prices of a fringe theatre show permit audiences to attend multiple shows in a single evening.&lt;ref name="nofringe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nofringe.org/index.php/tickets/how-fringe-tickets-work|title=How Fringe Tickets Work|publisher=nofringe.org|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performers sometimes [[billet]] in the homes of local residents, further reducing their costs.&lt;ref name="boulderfringe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boulderfringe.com/billet-host-form/|title=Billet HOST Form &amp;#124; Boulder International Fringe Festival|publisher=boulderfringe.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fringetoronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://performers.fringetoronto.com/node/2044|title=Toronto Fringe Billet OFFER form &amp;#124; Performers Site: Toronto Fringe July 2016|publisher=performers.fringetoronto.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfringe.com/GET-INVOLVED/HOST-AN-ARTIST.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gamification==
{{main|Gamification}}
Although the term 'gamification' was coined by the founder of [[Bunchball]], Rajat Paharia, Gabe Zichermann is known as one of the concept's most vocal advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-price/the-man-who-coined-gamifi_b_3773928.html |title=The Man Who Coined "Gamification" Takes Loyalty to a New Level |first=Kevin |last=Price |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/home-of-the-future/videos/all/godfather-of-gamification |title=Home of the Future - Videos - Godfather of Gamification |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zichermann reports that he gravitated towards using game mechanics professionally with games like ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985)|Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]'' and ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]''. In his speeches at [[TED (conference)|TED]] he argues that not only can gamification be exploited by business but it also can be utilized in education as a [[serious game]] to teach students that are not otherwise engaged with traditional classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TED Brussels |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/gabe_zichermann_how_games_make_kids_smarter.html |title=Gabe Zichermann: How games make kids smarter |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points to  [[educationalist]] [[Anant Pai]]'s work with an elementary school in [[White Bear Lake, Minnesota]] as well as University of Washington's [[Foldit]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axk5-i8oTIU |title=TEDxBerlin - Gabe Zichermann - "Changing the Game in Education" |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He counters the argument that the immersive environment of video games don't teach the right kind of attention by pointing to the concept of [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]]. Zichermann believes the intense mental engagement of video games is tied to the [[dopamine]] released in game participants as the players receive rewards in game.  Zichermann also refutes the idea that gamification is necessarily pernicious or simply a fad by pointing to the positive results of gamification applied outside of the entertainment industry, although he has acknowledged that a dark side does exist to this technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gabe Zichermann |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/gamification-is-here-to-stay/244232/ |title=Gamification Is Here to Stay |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David F.

Zichermann describes business software utilizing gamification as ''[[funware]]'', remarking that even websites like [[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]] use some element of online reward to prompt user interaction.&lt;ref name="venture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/funware_new_game_theory_marketers_28628 |title=Funware, A New Game Theory For Marketers |publisher=Inventorspot.com |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has explained the "reason why Facebook is a really compelling [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] is because it's fun and you get something out of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slagle |first=Matt |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2007-11-22-socialgames_N.htm |title=Online games meet social networking tools|publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opines that increasing the degree of game mechanics through funware in work production will become even more effective on the [[millennial generation]] raised with video games and seek to stay in a game environment at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham |first=Fiona |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17160118 |title=BBC News - What if you got paid to play games at work? |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Von Christian Neeb |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/games/digitaltrend-gamification-das-ganze-leben-wird-zum-spiel-a-735202-2.html |title=Digitaltrend Gamification: Der neue große Hunger nach der verspielten Realität |publisher=[[Spiegel Online]] |date=2010-12-18 |accessdate=2013-09-28 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has criticized current location-based applications like [[Foursquare]] as lacking enough social element as well as being too complicated for users to remain engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=More |first=Adam |url=http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/09/20/social-media-week-location-and-social-space/ |title=Social Media Week – Location and Social Space – Nokia Conversations : the official Nokia blog |publisher=Conversations.nokia.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In 2010, Zichermann co-wrote ''Game-Based Marketing: Inspire Customer Loyalty Through Rewards, Challenges, and Contests'' with [[National Public Radio|NPR]] contributor Joselin Linder, describing the game mechanics that helped make [[FarmVille]] and Foursquare so successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm1008/feature-games.html |title=Game Changers Capitalize On Constantly Evolving Industry |author=Robert D.

In 2011, Zichermann co-wrote ''Gamification by Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps'' with Christopher Cunningham. The book has been described as a quick read, introducing the concept of gamification and discussing how businesses could implement gamification to keep their customers engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Review Gamification by Design by Gabe Zichermann and Christopher Cunningham|publisher=Blogcritics.com|url=http://blogcritics.org/book-review-gamification-by-design-implementing/|date=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zichermann agrees that the book's concept of engagement may be 75% customer psychology. The book also includes a [[Ruby on Rails]] coding tutorial to implement gamification in online forum design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33953">The '''gambler's fallacy''', also known as the '''Monte Carlo fallacy''' or the '''fallacy of the maturity of chances''', is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future (or vice versa). In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of [[statistical independence|independent]] trials of a [[random process]], this belief is false. The [[fallacy]] can arise in many situations, but is most strongly associated with [[gambling]], where it is common among players.

The term "Monte Carlo fallacy" originates from the best known [[Gambler's fallacy#Monte Carlo Casino|example]] of the phenomenon, which occurred in the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] in 1913.&lt;ref name= "monte_carlo" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Coin toss===
[[File:Lawoflargenumbersanimation2.gif|thumb|100px|Simulation of coin tosses: Each frame, a coin is flipped which is red on one side and blue on the other. The result of each flip is added as a coloured dot in the corresponding column. As the pie chart shows, the proportion of red versus blue approaches 50-50 (the [[Law of Large Numbers|law of large numbers]]). But the [[subtraction|difference]] between red and blue does not systematically decrease to zero.]]
The gambler's fallacy can be illustrated by considering the repeated toss of a [[fair coin]]. The outcomes in different tosses are [[statistically independent]] and the probability of getting heads on a single toss is {{sfrac|1|2}} (one in two). The probability of getting two heads in two tosses is {{sfrac|1|4}} (one in four) and the probability of getting three heads in three tosses is {{sfrac|1|8}} (one in eight). In general, if ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the event where toss ''i'' of a fair coin comes up heads, then:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pr\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\right)=\prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(A_i)={1\over2^n}&lt;/math&gt;.

If after tossing four heads in a row, the next coin toss also came up heads, it would complete a run of five successive heads. Since the probability of a run of five successive heads is {{sfrac|1|32}} (one in thirty-two), a person might believe that the next flip would be more likely to come up tails rather than heads again. This is incorrect and is an example of the gambler's fallacy. The event "5 heads in a row" and the event "first 4 heads, then a tails" are equally likely, each having probability {{sfrac|1|32}}. Since the first four tosses turn up heads, the probability that the next toss is a head is:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pr\left(A_5|A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4 \right)=\Pr\left(A_5\right)=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

While a run of five heads has a probability of {{sfrac|1|32}} = 0.03125 (a little over 3%), the misunderstanding lies in not realizing that this is the case only before the first coin is tossed. After the first four tosses, the results are no longer unknown, so their probabilities are at that point equal to 1 (100%). The reasoning that it is more likely that a fifth toss is more likely to be tails because the previous four tosses were heads, with a run of luck in the past influencing the odds in the future, forms the basis of the fallacy.

===Why the probability is 1/2 for a fair coin===
If a fair coin is flipped 21 times, the probability of 21 heads is 1 in 2,097,152. The probability of flipping a head after having already flipped 20 heads in a row is {{sfrac|1|2}}. This is an application of [[Bayes' theorem]].

This can also be shown without knowing that 20 heads have occurred, and without applying Bayes' theorem. Assuming a fair coin:
* The probability of 20 heads, then 1 tail is 0.5&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; × 0.5 = 0.5&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;
* The probability of 20 heads, then 1 head is 0.5&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; × 0.5 = 0.5&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;

The probability of getting 20 heads then 1 tail, and the probability of getting 20 heads then another head are both 1 in 2,097,152. When flipping a fair coin 21 times, the outcome is equally likely to be 21 heads as 20 heads and then 1 tail. These two outcomes are equally as likely as any of the other combinations that can be obtained from 21 flips of a coin. All of the 21-flip combinations will have probabilities equal to 0.5&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;, or 1 in 2,097,152. Assuming that a change in the probability will occur as a result of the outcome of prior flips is incorrect because every outcome of a 21-flip sequence is as likely as the other outcomes. In accordance with Bayes' theorem, the likely outcome of each flip is the probability of the fair coin, which is {{sfrac|1|2}}.

===Other examples===
The fallacy leads to the incorrect notion that previous failures will create an increased probability of success on subsequent attempts. For a fair 16-sided die, the probability of each outcome occurring is {{sfrac|1|16}} (6.25%). If a win is defined as rolling a 1, the probability of a 1 occurring at least once in 16 rolls is:
:&lt;math&gt;1-\left[\frac{15}{16}\right]^{16} \,=\, 64.39\%&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of a loss on the first roll is {{sfrac|15|16}} (93.75%). According to the fallacy, the player should have a higher chance of winning after one loss has occurred. The probability of at least one win is now:
:&lt;math&gt;1-\left[\frac{15}{16}\right]^{15} \,=\, 62.02\%&lt;/math&gt;

By losing one toss, the player's probability of winning drops by two percentage points. With 5 losses and 11 rolls remaining, the probability of winning drops to around 50%. The probability of at least one win does not increase after a series of losses. Instead, the probability of success decreases because there are fewer trials left in which to win. The probability of winning will eventually equal the probability of winning a single toss, which is {{sfrac|1|16}} (6.25%) and occurs when only one toss is left.

==Reverse position==
After a consistent tendency towards tails, a gambler may also decide that tails has become a more likely outcome. This is a rational and Bayesian conclusion, bearing in mind the possibility that the coin may not be fair; it is not a fallacy. Believing the odds to favor tails, the gambler sees no reason to change to heads. However it is a fallacy that a sequence of trials carries a memory of past results which tend to favor or disfavor future outcomes.

The [[inverse gambler's fallacy]] described by [[Ian Hacking]] is a situation where a gambler entering a room and seeing a person rolling a double six on a pair of dice may erroneously conclude that the person must have been rolling the dice for quite a while, as they would be unlikely to get a double six on their first attempt.

==Retrospective gambler's fallacy==
Researchers have examined whether a similar bias exists for inferences about unknown past events based upon known subsequent events, calling this the "retrospective gambler's fallacy".&lt;ref name= "retrospective"&gt;Oppenheimer, D.M., &amp; Monin, B. (2009). The retrospective gambler’s fallacy: Unlikely events, constructing the past, and multiple universes. ''Judgment and Decision Making, vol. 4, no. 5,'' pp. 326-334&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a retrospective gambler's fallacy would be to observe multiple successive "heads" on a coin toss and conclude from this that the previously unknown flip was "tails".&lt;ref name= "retrospective" /&gt; Real world examples of retrospective gambler's fallacy have been argued to exist in events such as the origin of the [[Universe]]. In his book ''Universes'', John Leslie argues that "the presence of vastly many universes very different in their characters might be our best explanation for why at least one universe has a life-permitting character".&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, J. (1989). ''Universes''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]] and Benoît Monin argue that "In other words, the 'best explanation' for a low-probability event is that it is only one in a multiple of trials, which is the core intuition of the reverse gambler's fallacy."&lt;ref name= "retrospective" /&gt; Philosophical arguments are ongoing about whether such arguments are or are not a fallacy, arguing that the occurrence of our universe says nothing about the existence of other universes or trials of universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hacking | first1 = I | year = 1987 | title = The inverse gambler's fallacy: The argument from design. The anthropic principle applied to Wheeler universes | url = | journal = Mind | volume = 96 | issue = 383| pages = 331–340 | doi=10.1093/mind/xcvi.383.331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = Fine-tuning and multiple universes | url = | journal = Noûs | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 260–276 | doi=10.1111/0029-4624.00210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three studies involving Stanford University students tested the existence of a retrospective gamblers' fallacy. All three studies concluded that people have a gamblers' fallacy retrospectively as well as to future events.&lt;ref name= "retrospective" /&gt; The authors of all three studies concluded their findings have significant "methodological implications" but may also have "important theoretical implications" that need investigation and research, saying "[a] thorough understanding of such reasoning processes requires that we not only examine how they influence our predictions of the future, but also our perceptions of the past."&lt;ref name= "retrospective" /&gt;

==Childbirth==
In 1796, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] described in ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'' the ways in which men calculated their probability of having sons: "I have seen men, ardently desirous of having a son, who could learn only with anxiety of the births of boys in the month when they expected to become fathers. Imagining that the ratio of these births to those of girls ought to be the same at the end of each month, they judged that the boys already born would render more probable the births next of girls." The expectant fathers feared that if more sons were born in the surrounding community, then they themselves would be more likely to have a daughter. This essay by Laplace is regarded as one of the earliest descriptions of the fallacy.&lt;ref name="BarronLeider2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barron|first1=Greg|last2=Leider|first2=Stephen|title=The role of experience in the Gambler's Fallacy|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~leider/Papers/Gamblers_Fallacy.pdf|date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having multiple children of the same sex, some parents may believe that they are due to have a child of the opposite sex. While the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]] predicts that birth sex is dependent on living conditions, stating that more male children are born in good living conditions, while more female children are born in poorer living conditions, the probability of having a child of either sex is still regarded as near 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer-Hague|first=Jaime|date=December 10, 2016|title=Trivers-Willard hypothesis|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science|volume=|pages=|via=SpringerLink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monte Carlo Casino==
Perhaps the most famous example of the gambler's fallacy occurred in a game of [[roulette]] at the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] on August 18, 1913, when the ball fell in black 26 times in a row. This was an extremely uncommon occurrence: the probability of a sequence of red or black occurring 26 times in a row is ({{sfrac|18|37}})&lt;sup&gt;26-1&lt;/sup&gt; or around 1 in 66.6 million, assuming the mechanism is unbiased. Gamblers lost millions of francs betting against black, reasoning incorrectly that the streak was causing an imbalance in the randomness of the wheel, and that it had to be followed by a long streak of red.&lt;ref name= "monte_carlo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150127-why-we-gamble-like-monkeys|title=Why we gamble like monkeys|work=BBC.com|date=2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-examples==
===Non-independent events===
The gambler's fallacy does not apply in situations where the probability of different events is not [[statistical independence|independent]]. In such cases, the probability of future events can change based on the outcome of past events, such as the statistical [[permutation]] of events. An example is when cards are drawn from a deck without replacement. If an ace is drawn from a deck and not reinserted, the next draw is less likely to be an ace and more likely to be of another rank. The probability of drawing another ace, assuming that it was the first card drawn and that there are no jokers, has decreased from {{sfrac|4|52}} (7.69%) to {{sfrac|3|51}} (5.88%), while the probability for each other rank has increased from {{sfrac|4|52}} (7.69%) to {{sfrac|4|51}} (7.84%). This effect allows [[card counting]] systems to work in games such as [[blackjack]].

===Bias===
In most illustrations of the gambler's fallacy and the reverse gambler's fallacy, the trial (e.g. flipping a coin) is assumed to be fair. In practice, this assumption may not hold. For example, if a coin is flipped 21 times, the probability of 21 heads with a fair coin is 1 in 2,097,152. Since this probability is so small, if it happens, it may well be that the coin is somehow biased towards landing on heads, or that it is being controlled by hidden magnets, or similar.&lt;ref name="Gardner1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=Entertaining Mathematical Puzzles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MDY0Aw-r9AC|year=1986|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-25211-7|pages=69–70|accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the smart bet is "heads" because [[Bayesian inference]] from the [[empirical evidence]] — 21 heads in a row — suggests that the coin is likely to be biased toward heads. Bayesian inference can be used to show that when the long-run proportion of different outcomes is unknown but [[exchangeable random variables|exchangeable]] (meaning that the random process from which the outcomes are generated may be biased but is equally likely to be biased in any direction) and that previous observations demonstrate the likely direction of the bias, the outcome which has occurred the most in the observed data is the most likely to occur again.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, B.; Puza, B.D. (2004). [http://hdl.handle.net/1885/43089 "Dice have no memories but I do: A defence of the reverse gambler's belief".] Reprinted in abridged form as: {{cite journal|last1=O'Neill|first1= B. |last2=Puza |first2=B.D.|year=2005|title= In defence of the reverse gambler's belief|journal=The Mathematical Scientist|volume=30|issue=1|pages= 13–16|issn=0312-3685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the ''a priori'' probability of a biased coin is say 1%, and assuming that such a biased coin would come down heads say 60% of the time, then after 21 heads the probability of a biased coin has increased to about 32%.

The opening scene of the play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' by Tom Stoppard discusses these issues as one man continually flips heads and the other considers various possible explanations.

===Changing probabilities===
If external factors are allowed to change the probability of the events, the gambler's fallacy may not hold. For example, a change in the game rules might favour one player over the other, improving his or her win percentage. Similarly, an inexperienced player's success may decrease after opposing teams learn about and play against their weaknesses. This is another example of bias.

===Impressiveness===
When statistics are quoted, they are usually made to sound as impressive as possible. If a politician says that unemployment has gone down for the past six years, it is a safe bet that seven years ago, it went up.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=The Guinness Book of Mindbenders|author1=David Wells|author2=Rob Eastaway|author3=Rob Easterway|ISBN=978-0851126685|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology behind the fallacy==

===Origins===
The gambler's fallacy arises out of a belief in a [[Hasty generalization|law of small numbers]], leading to the erroneous belief that small samples must be representative of the larger population. According to the fallacy, streaks must eventually even out in order to be representative.&lt;ref name="Burns2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Bruce D.|last2=Corpus|first2=Bryan|title=Randomness and inductions from streaks: "Gambler’s fallacy" versus "hot hand"|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=11|issue=1|year=2004|pages=179–184|issn=1069-9384|doi=10.3758/BF03206480}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] first proposed that the gambler's fallacy is a [[cognitive bias]] produced by a [[heuristics in judgement and decision making|psychological heuristic]] called the [[representativeness heuristic]], which states that people evaluate the probability of a certain event by assessing how similar it is to events they have experienced before, and how similar the events surrounding those two processes are.&lt;ref name=TverskyKahneman1974&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tversky |first=Amos |author2=Daniel Kahneman |year=1974 |volume=185 |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |journal=Science |pages=1124–1131 |doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 |pmid= 17835457 |issue=4157|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0767426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TverskyKahneman1971&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tversky |first=Amos |author2=Daniel Kahneman |year=1971 |title=Belief in the law of small numbers |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=105–110 |doi=10.1037/h0031322|url=http://www.nurs.or.jp/~lionfan/small_e.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, "after observing a long run of red on the roulette wheel, for example, most people erroneously believe that black will result in a more representative sequence than the occurrence of an additional red",&lt;ref name=TverskyKahneman1974 /&gt; so people expect that a short run of random outcomes should share properties of a longer run, specifically in that deviations from average should balance out. When people are asked to make up a random-looking sequence of coin tosses, they tend to make sequences where the proportion of heads to tails stays closer to 0.5 in any short segment than would be predicted by chance, a phenomenon known as [[insensitivity to sample size]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tune |first=G. S. |title=Response preferences: A review of some relevant literature |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year= 1964 |volume=61 |pages=286–302 |doi=10.1037/h0048618 |pmid=14140335 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahneman and Tversky interpret this to mean that people believe short sequences of random events should be representative of longer ones.&lt;ref name=TverskyKahneman1971 /&gt; The representativeness heuristic is also cited behind the related phenomenon of the [[clustering illusion]], according to which people see streaks of random events as being non-random when such streaks are actually much more likely to occur in small samples than people expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Gilovich |authorlink=Thomas Gilovich |title=How we know what isn't so |year=1991 |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |isbn=0-02-911706-2 |pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gambler's fallacy can also be attributed to the mistaken belief that gambling, or even chance itself, is a fair process that can correct itself in the event of streaks, known as the [[just-world hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Rogers1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Paul|title=The cognitive psychology of lottery gambling: A theoretical review|journal=Journal of Gambling Studies|volume=14|issue=2|year=1998|pages=111–134|issn=1050-5350|doi=10.1023/A:1023042708217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers believe that belief in the fallacy may be the result of a mistaken belief in an [[internal locus of control]]. When a person believes that gambling outcomes are the result of their own skill, they may be more susceptible to the gambler's fallacy because they reject the idea that chance could overcome skill or talent.&lt;ref name=SundaliCroson2006 /&gt;

===Variations of the gambler's fallacy===
Some researchers believe that it is possible to define two types of gambler's fallacy: type&amp;nbsp;one and type&amp;nbsp;two. Type&amp;nbsp;one is the classic gambler's fallacy, where individuals believe that a particular outcome is due after a long streak of another outcome. Type&amp;nbsp;two gambler's fallacy, as defined by Gideon Keren and Charles Lewis, occurs when a gambler underestimates how many observations are needed to detect a favorable outcome, such as watching a roulette wheel for a length of time and then betting on the numbers that appear most often. For events with a high degree of randomness, detecting a bias that will lead to a favorable outcome takes an impractically large amount of time and is very difficult, if not impossible, to do.&lt;ref name="KerenLewis1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keren|first1=Gideon|last2=Lewis|first2=Charles|title=The Two Fallacies of Gamblers: Type I and Type II|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=60|issue=1|year=1994|pages=75–89|issn=0749-5978|doi=10.1006/obhd.1994.1075}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two types differ in that type&amp;nbsp;one wrongly assumes that gambling conditions are fair and perfect, while type&amp;nbsp;two assumes that the conditions are biased, and that this bias can be detected after a certain amount of time.

Another variety, known as the retrospective gambler's fallacy, occurs when individuals judge that a seemingly rare event must come from a longer sequence than a more common event does. The belief that an imaginary sequence of die rolls is more than three times as long when a set of three sixes is observed as opposed to when there are only two sixes. This effect can be observed in isolated instances, or even sequentially. Another example would involve hearing that a teenager has [[unprotected sex]] and becomes pregnant on a given night, and that she has been engaging in unprotected sex for longer than if we hear she had unprotected sex but did not become pregnant, when the probability of becoming pregnant as a result of each intercourse is independent of the amount of prior intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oppenheimer | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Monin | first2 = B. | year = 2009 | title = The retrospective gambler's fallacy: Unlikely events, constructing the past, and multiple universes | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 326–334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to hot-hand fallacy===
Another psychological perspective states that gambler's fallacy can be seen as the counterpart to basketball's [[hot-hand fallacy]], in which people tend to predict the same outcome as the previous event - known as positive recency - resulting in a belief that a high scorer will continue to score. In the gambler's fallacy, people predict the opposite outcome of the previous event - negative recency - believing that since the roulette wheel has landed on black on the previous six occasions, it is due to land on red the next. Ayton and Fischer have theorized that people display positive recency for the hot-hand fallacy because the fallacy deals with human performance, and that people do not believe that an inanimate object can become "hot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayton | first1 = P. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = I. | year = 2004 | title = The hot-hand fallacy and the gambler's fallacy: Two faces of subjective randomness? | url = | journal = Memory and Cognition | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 1369–1378 | doi=10.3758/bf03206327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human performance is not perceived as random, and people are more likely to continue streaks when they believe that the process generating the results is nonrandom.&lt;ref name="Burns2004"/&gt; When a person exhibits the gambler's fallacy, they are more likely to exhibit the hot-hand fallacy as well, suggesting that one construct is responsible for the two fallacies.&lt;ref name=SundaliCroson2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sundali | first1 = J. | last2 = Croson | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Biases in casino betting: The hot hand and the gambler's fallacy | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 1–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between the two fallacies is also found in economic decision-making. A study by Huber, Kirchler, and Stockl in 2010 examined how the hot hand and the gambler's fallacy are exhibited in the financial market. The researchers gave their participants a choice: they could either bet on the outcome of a series of coin tosses, use an expert opinion to sway their decision, or choose a risk-free alternative instead for a smaller financial reward. Participants turned to the expert opinion to make their decision 24% of the time based on their past experience of success, which exemplifies the hot-hand. If the expert was correct, 78% of the participants chose the expert's opinion again, as opposed to 57% doing so when the expert was wrong. The participants also exhibited the gambler's fallacy, with their selection of either heads or tails decreasing after noticing a streak of either outcome. This experiment helped bolster Ayton and Fischer's theory that people put more faith in human performance than they do in seemingly random processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huber | first1 = J. | last2 = Kirchler | first2 = M. | last3 = Stockl | first3 = T. | year = 2010 | title = The hot hand belief and the gambler's fallacy in investment decisions under risk | url = | journal = Theory and Decision | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 445–462 | doi=10.1007/s11238-008-9106-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurophysiology===
While the [[representativeness heuristic]] and other cognitive biases are the most commonly cited cause of the gambler's fallacy, research suggests that there may also be a neurological component. [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] has shown that after losing a bet or gamble, known as riskloss, the frontoparietal network of the brain is activated, resulting in more risk-taking behavior. In contrast, there is decreased activity in the [[amygdala]], [[caudate nucleus|caudate]], and [[ventral striatum]] after a riskloss. Activation in the amygdala is negatively correlated with gambler's fallacy, so that the more activity exhibited in the amygdala, the less likely an individual is to fall prey to the gambler's fallacy. These results suggest that gambler's fallacy relies more on the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive, goal-directed processes, and less on the brain areas that control [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] decision-making.

The desire to continue gambling or betting is controlled by the [[striatum]], which supports a choice-outcome contingency learning method. The striatum processes the errors in prediction and the behavior changes accordingly. After a win, the positive behavior is reinforced and after a loss, the behavior is conditioned to be avoided. In individuals exhibiting the gambler's fallacy, this choice-outcome contingency method is impaired, and they continue to make risks after a series of losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xue | first1 = G. | last2 = Lu | first2 = Z. | last3 = Levin | first3 = I. P. | last4 = Bechara | first4 = A. | year = 2011 | title = An fMRI study of risk-taking following wins and losses: Implications for the gambler's fallacy | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 271–281 | doi=10.1002/hbm.21015| pmc = 3429350 | pmid=21229615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible solutions===
The gambler's fallacy is a deep-seated cognitive bias and can be very hard to overcome. Educating individuals about the nature of randomness has not always proven effective in reducing or eliminating any manifestation of the fallacy. Participants in a study by Beach and Swensson in 1967 were shown a shuffled deck of index cards with shapes on them, and were instructed to guess which shape would come next in a sequence. The experimental group of participants was informed about the nature and existence of the gambler's fallacy, and were explicitly instructed not to rely on run dependency to make their guesses. The control group was not given this information. The response styles of the two groups were similar, indicating that the experimental group still based their choices on the length of the run sequence. This led to the conclusion that instructing individuals about randomness is not sufficient in lessening the gambler's fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beach | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Swensson | first2 = R. G. | year = 1967 | title = Instructions about randomness and run dependency in two-choice learning | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 279–282 | doi=10.1037/h0024979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual's susceptibility to the gambler's fallacy may decrease with age. A study by Fischbein and Schnarch in 1997 administered a questionnaire to five groups: students in grades 5, 7, 9, 11, and college students specializing in teaching mathematics. None of the participants had received any prior education regarding probability. The question asked was: "Ronni flipped a coin three times and in all cases heads came up. Ronni intends to flip the coin again. What is the chance of getting heads the fourth time?" The results indicated that as the students got older, the less likely they were to answer with "smaller than the chance of getting tails", which would indicate a negative recency effect. 35% of the 5th graders, 35% of the 7th graders, and 20% of the 9th graders exhibited the negative recency effect. Only 10% of the 11th graders answered this way, and none of the college students did. Fischbein and Schnarch theorized that an individual's tendency to rely on the [[representativeness heuristic]] and other cognitive biases can be overcome with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischbein | first1 = E. | last2 = Schnarch | first2 = D. | year = 1997 | title = The evolution with age of probabilistic, intuitively based misconceptions | url = | journal = Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 96–105 | doi=10.2307/749665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible solution comes from Roney and Trick, [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychologists who suggest that the fallacy may be eliminated as a result of grouping. When a future event such as a coin toss is described as part of a sequence, no matter how arbitrarily, a person will automatically consider the event as it relates to the past events, resulting in the gambler's fallacy. When a person considers every event as independent, the fallacy can be greatly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roney | first1 = C. J. | last2 = Trick | first2 = L. M. | year = 2003 | title = Grouping and gambling: A gestalt approach to understanding the gambler's fallacy | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 69–75 | doi=10.1037/h0087414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roney and Trick told participants in their experiment that they were betting on either two blocks of six coin tosses, or on two blocks of seven coin tosses. The fourth, fifth, and sixth tosses all had the same outcome, either three heads or three tails. The seventh toss was grouped with either the end of one block, or the beginning of the next block. Participants exhibited the strongest gambler's fallacy when the seventh trial was part of the first block, directly after the sequence of three heads or tails. The researchers pointed out that the participants that did not show the gambler's fallacy showed less confidence in their bets and bet fewer times than the participants who picked with the gambler's fallacy. When the seventh trial was grouped with the second block, and was perceived as not being part of a streak, the gambler's fallacy did not occur.

Roney and Trick argued that instead of teaching individuals about the nature of randomness, the fallacy could be avoided by training people to treat each event as if it is a beginning and not a continuation of previous events. They suggested that this would prevent people from gambling when they are losing, in the mistaken hope that their chances of winning are due to increase based on an interaction with previous events.

A '''hand model''' is a person who [[Model (person)|models]] (poses or displays) their hand or hands for the purposes of [[art]], [[fashion]], [[product (business)|product]]s or [[advertising]]. Hand models are used in advertising where advertisers want close ups of the product being handled. Most hands have blemishes such as scrapes, [[scar]]s, [[pimple|spots]], or discolorations which would stand out in a close up and distract from the product. Hand models tend to have flawless skin and hands. In female hand models agents often seek long, slender hands and fingers and long [[fingernail|nail beds]]. They also value smooth, hairless, unblemished skin with minimal wrinkles and visible [[sweat gland|pores]].

Requirements for male hand models vary, depending on whether the job calls for a burly, [[Blue-collar worker|construction worker]] type hand or a more [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] look. For print media hand models, a necessary trait is the ability to pose in a relaxed, graceful fashion. Professional hand models avoid what photographers call "the claw," the rigid grip that novices often use before the camera. Hand models are prevalent in [[TV commercial]]s, although the hand may not always be visible. Many food commercials have hand models pouring gravy, dipping a French fry or cutting meat. Here perfect hands are not as important as the timing and patience required to "hit one's mark." Some hand models can make upwards of $1,200 a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/personal/08/10/hand.modeling/#cnnSTCText CNN Article on Hand Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hand art==
Hand art is the application of make-up or paint to a hand to make it appear like an animal or other object. Some hand artists, like [[Guido Daniele]], produce images that are [[trompe l'oeil]] representations of wild animals painted on people's hands. Hand artists work closely with hand models. Models can be booked through specialist acting and modeling agencies usually advertising under "body parts models" or "hands and feet models." Many hand models can be hired directly.

'''History Lesson – Part II''' is a song from the 1984 album ''[[Double Nickels on the Dime]]'' by the American rock band [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]]. The song, written by Mike Watt, is about the relationship of singer [[D. Boon]] and [[Mike Watt]] as they played music together.&lt;ref name="rs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendrickson|first=Tad|title=History Lesson — Part II|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 15, 2012|accessdate=April 22, 2018|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/history-lesson-part-ii-the-minutemen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is subtitled "Part II" as an earlier Minutemen composition titled "History Lesson" was included on their 1981 release, ''[[The Punch Line]]''.&lt;ref name="flight"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Bryan|title=“History Lesson Part 1: Punk Rock in Los Angeles in 1984″: We jam econo with D.

==Lyrics==
The song was penned by Watt&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt; and, as such, makes specific reference to Boon in the third person ("me and D. Boon, we played for years").&lt;ref name="flight"/&gt;  However, when the song was recorded, Boon performed lead vocals&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt; and changed the third person references to Watt ("me and Mike Watt, we played for years").&lt;ref name="flight"/&gt;  The lyrics, as printed on the cover of ''Double Nickels on the Dime'', contain the original references to Boon despite the difference in the actual recording.

The song features the iconic first line "Our band could be your life," was used as the title of the book ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991'' by [[Michael Azerrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honan|first=Mat|title=Minutemen: History Lesson Part II|url=https://gizmodo.com/5881066/minutemen-history-lesson-part-ii|website=[[Gizmodo]]|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stanza of the song also includes the line "Punk rock changed our lives." The band [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] sampled this line for their song "Waiting for My Ruca" on their debut album ''[[40oz. to Freedom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eakin|first=Marah|title=Jonah Ray on his intense, burning hatred for Sublime’s “What I Got”|url=https://music.avclub.com/jonah-ray-on-his-intense-burning-hatred-for-sublime-s-1798270599|website=[[The A.V.

==Plot==
Two cousins, Fred and Warren, live together in Hollywood. Fred, an aspiring horror-movie director with developed skills in SFX and animatronics, desperately tries to shoot his first movie in their house, but Warren, who plays the main male protagonist, keeps on flirting with Laurie, the main actress. When she can't stand it anymore, the project is over, and the bills are pilling up.

Out of the blue, Warren is called out to the reading of his grandfather's will and testament. The boys end up with an old clock, inhabited with the spirit of Warren, Karl's grandfather's deformed butler. The benevolent spirit, having appeared to Fred in the night, inspires him a new script for which he builds an animatronic version of the butler, whose spirit inhabits.

The butler and the boys will help each other as they face another relative of Warren, Producer Stan Gordon, who wants the grandfather's heritage, and try to get Fred's new movie made. It will all end in a race against the clock in an old house basement, and a fight against a ghost armor, as the movie pays homage to the late 50-to-70's Sci Fi B movies.

{{EngvarB|date=December 2016}}
'''Humour''' ([[British English]]), also known as '''humor''' ([[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|see spelling differences]]) is the tendency of experiences to provoke [[laughter]] and provide [[amusement]]. The term derives from the [[humorism|humoral medicine]] of the [[ancient Greeks]], which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours ([[Latin]]: ''humor'', "body fluid"), controlled human health and emotion.

People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. Most people are able to experience humour—be amused, smile or laugh at something funny—and thus are considered to have a ''sense of humour''. The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour inducing it to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. Though ultimately decided by personal [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]], the extent to which a person finds something humorous depends on a host of variables, including [[geographical location]], [[culture]], [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]], level of [[education]], [[intelligence]] and [[wiktionary:context|context]]. For example, young children may favour [[slapstick]] such as [[Punch and Judy]] puppet shows or the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, whose physical nature makes it accessible to them. By contrast, more sophisticated forms of humour such as [[satire]] require an understanding of its social meaning and context, and thus tend to appeal to a more mature audience.

==Theories==
{{main article|Theories of humour}}
Many theories exist about what humour is and what social function it serves. The prevailing types of theories attempting to account for the existence of humour include [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider humour-induced behaviour to be very healthy; spiritual theories, which may, for instance, consider humour to be a "gift from God"; and theories which consider humour to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Smullyan]], "The Planet Without Laughter", ''[[This Book Needs No Title]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The benign-violation theory, endorsed by [[Peter McGraw]], attempts to explain humour's existence. The theory says 'humour only occurs when something seems wrong, unsettling, or threatening, but simultaneously seems okay, acceptable or safe'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter McGraw]], "Too close for Comfort, or Too Far to care? Finding Humor in Distant Tragedies and Close Mishaps"&lt;/ref&gt; Humour can be used as a method to easily engage in social interaction by taking away that awkward, uncomfortable, or uneasy feeling of social interactions.

Others believe that 'the appropriate use of humour can facilitate social interactions'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Kuiper]], "Prudence and Racial Humor: Troubling Epithets"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Some claim that humour should not be explained. Author [[E.B. White]] once said, "Humor can be dissected as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/984.html|title=The Quotations Page: Quote from E. B. White|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter to this argument, protests against "offensive" cartoons invite the dissection of humour or its lack by aggrieved individuals and communities. This process of dissecting humour does not necessarily banish a sense of humour but begs attention towards its politics and assumed universality (Khanduri 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Ritu Gairola Khanduri. 2014. [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/authors/246935 Caricaturing Culture in India: Cartoons and History of the Modern World]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] lamented the misuse of ''humour'' (a [[German language|German]] [[loanword]] from [[English language|English]]) to mean any type of [[comedy]]. However, both ''humour'' and ''comic'' are often used when theorising about the subject. The connotations of ''humour'' as opposed to ''comic'' are said to be that of response versus stimulus. Additionally, ''humour'' was thought to include a combination of ridiculousness and wit in an individual; the paradigmatic case being Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff. The French were slow to adopt the term ''humour''; in French, ''humeur'' and ''humour'' are still two different words, the former referring to a person's [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] or to the archaic concept of the four [[Four Temperaments|humours]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Non-satirical humour can be specifically termed ''droll humour'' or ''recreational drollery''.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Benedict Graham ''[http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-11032003-192424/unrestricted/grahamsethb_etd2003.pdf A cultural analysis of the Russo-Soviet Anekdot]'' 2003 p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail. ''Rabelais and His World'' [1941, 1965]. Trans. Hélène Iswolsky. Bloomington: Indiana University Press p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological factors==

As with any art form, the acceptance of a particular style or incidence of humour depends on [[sociology|sociological]] factors and varies from person to person. Throughout history, comedy has been used as a form of entertainment all over the world, whether in the courts of the Western kings or the villages of the Far East. Both a social etiquette and a certain intelligence can be displayed through forms of [[wit]] and [[sarcasm]]. Eighteenth-century [[Germany|German]] author [[Georg Lichtenberg]] said that "the more you know humour, the more you become demanding in fineness."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Ancient Greece===
Western humour theory begins with [[Plato]], who attributed to [[Socrates]] (as a semi-historical dialogue character) in the ''[[Philebus]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;49b) the view that the essence of the [[ridiculous]] is an ignorance in the weak, who are thus unable to retaliate when ridiculed. Later, in Greek philosophy, [[Aristotle]], in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449a, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35), suggested that an ugliness that does not disgust is fundamental to humour.

===India===
In ancient [[Sanskrit drama]], [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' defined humour (''hāsyam'') as one of the nine ''[[nava rasas]]'', or principle ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasas]]'' (emotional responses), which can be inspired in the audience by ''[[bhava]]s'', the imitations of emotions that the actors perform. Each ''rasa'' was associated with a specific ''[[bhava]]s'' portrayed on stage.

===In Arabic and Persian culture===
[[file:Hadith imam baqir.svg|thumb|Muhammad al-Baqir's [[Hadith]] about humour]]
The terms [[comedy]] and [[satire]] became synonymous after Aristotle's ''Poetics'' was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Arabic literature|Arabic writers]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] such as [[Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus|Abu Bischr]], his pupil [[Al-Farabi]], Persian [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation, and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension" and made no reference to light and cheerful events or troublesome beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term ''comedy'' thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain|first=Edwin J.|last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/470561|jstor=470561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caribbean===
[[Mento]] star [[Lord Flea]], stated in a 1957 interview that he thought that: "[[West Indians]] have the best sense of humour in the world. Even in the most solemn song, like ''Las Kean Fine'' ["Lost and Can Not Be Found"], which tells of a boiler explosion on a sugar plantation that killed several of the workers, their natural wit and humour shine though."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Garnice|date=11 March 2012|accessdate=14 April 2013|url=http://www.mentomusic.com/flea.htm|title=Mento Music Lord Flea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[Confucianism|Confucianist]] Neo-Confucian orthodoxy, with its emphasis on ritual and propriety, has traditionally looked down upon humour as subversive or unseemly. Humor was perceived as irony and sarcasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Dong Yue|date=|title=Exploration of Chinese humor: Historical review, empirical findings, and critical reflections|url=|journal=Humor|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1515/HUMR.2010.018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Confucian "Analects" itself, however, depicts the Master as fond of humorous self-deprecation, once comparing his wanderings to the existence of a homeless dog.&lt;ref&gt;C. Harbsmeier, "Confucius-Ridens, Humor in the Analects." Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 50. 1 : 131-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Daoist philosophical texts such as "Zhuangzi" pointedly make fun of Confucian seriousness and make Confucius himself a slow-witted figure of fun.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Chey and Jessica Milner Davis, eds. "Humour in Chinese Life and Letters: Classical and Traditional Approaches" (HKUP, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Joke books containing a mix of wordplay, puns, situational humour, and play with taboo subjects like [[sex]] and scatology, remained popular over the centuries. Local performing arts, storytelling, vernacular fiction, and poetry offer a wide variety of humorous styles and sensibilities.

Famous Chinese humorists include the ancient jesters Chunyu Kun and Dongfang Shuo; writers of the Ming and Qing dynasties such as [[Feng Menglong]], Li Yu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674332270|title=The Invention of Li Yu — Patrick Hanan - Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wu Jingzi]]; and modern comic writers such as [[Lu Xun]], [[Lin Yutang]], [[Lao She]], [[Qian Zhongshu]], [[Wang Xiaobo]], and [[Wang Shuo]], and performers such as [[Ge You]], [[Guo Degang]], and [[Zhou Libo (comedian)|Zhou Libo]].

Modern Chinese humor has been heavily influenced not only by indigenous traditions, but also by foreign humor, circulated via print culture, cinema, television, and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;"Comic Visions of Modern China": http://u.osu.edu/mclc/files/2014/09/intro20.2-158jzq5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, the transliteration "youmo" (humour) caught on as a new term for humour, sparking a fad for humour literature, as well as impassioned debate about what type of humorous sensibility best suited China, a poor, weak country under partial foreign occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, "[http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520283848 The Age of Irreverence]: A New History of Laughter in China" (University of California Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/research/publication/195282 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002100340/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/research/publication/195282 |archivedate=2016-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/research/publication/195315 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002100338/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/research/publication/195315 |archivedate=2016-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some types of comedy were officially sanctioned during the rule of Mao Zedong, the Party-state's approach towards humour was generally repressive.&lt;ref&gt;David Moser, "Stifled Laughter": http://www.danwei.org/tv/stifled_laughter_how_the_commu.php&lt;/ref&gt; Social liberalisation in the 1980s, commercialisation of the cultural market in the 1990s, and the advent of the internet have each—despite an invasive state-sponsored censorship apparatus—enabled new forms of humour to flourish in China in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. "Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times" (HKUP, 2013): http://www.hkupress.org/Common/Reader/Products/ShowProduct.jsp?Pid=1&amp;Version=0&amp;Cid=16&amp;Charset=iso-8859-1&amp;page=-1&amp;key=9789888139248&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social transformation model ===
The social transformation model of humour predicts that specific characteristics, such as physical attractiveness, interact with humour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Heterosexual romantic preferences: The importance of humor and physical attractiveness for different types of relationships|last = Lundy, Tan, Cunningham|date = 1998|journal = Personal Relationships|doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00174.x|pmid = |volume=5 |issue = 3|pages=311–325}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model involves linkages between the humorist, an audience, and the subject matter of the humour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The two transformations associated with this particular model involves the subject matter of the humour, and the change in the audiences perception of the humorous person, therefore establishing a relationship between the humorous speaker and the audience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The social transformation model views humour as adaptive because it communicates the present desire to be humorous as well as future intentions of being humorous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This model is used with deliberate [[self-deprecating humour]] where one is communicating with desires to be accepted into someone else’s specific social group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although self-deprecating humour communicates weakness and fallibility in the bid to gain another's affection, it can be concluded from the model that this type of humour can increase romantic attraction towards the humorist when other variables are also favourable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The social transformation model can also be followed in teaching and lecturing where humour is used to improve the cognitive capabilities of the students. Humour could create a positive and informal classroom environment that triggers students’ enthusiasm and interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Higher Education Lecturing and Humor: From Perspectives to Strategies|author1=Nasiri, F. |author2=Mafakheri, F. |date = 2015| journal = Higher Education Studies| doi = 10.5539/hes.v5n5p26 |volume=5 |issue=5|pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

90% of men and 81% of women, all college students, report having a sense of humour is a crucial characteristic looked for in a romantic partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Student perceptions of traits desired in themselves as dating and marriage partners|last = Hewitt|first = L|date = 1958|journal = Marriage and Family Living|doi = 10.2307/348256|pmid = |access-date =|volume=20|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humour and honesty were ranked as the two most important attributes in a significant other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sex differences among partner preferences: Are the sexes really very similar?|last = Goodwin|first = R|date = 1990|journal = Sex Roles|doi = 10.1007/bf00289765|pmid = |access-date =|volume=23|pages=501–513}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been recorded that humour becomes more evident and significantly more important as the level of commitment in a romantic relationship increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Evolution, traits, and the stages of the parental investment model|last = Kenrick, Sadalla, Groth, Trost|date = 1990|journal = Journal of Personality|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00909.x|pmid = |access-date = |volume=58 |pages=97–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests expressions of humour in relation to [[physical attractiveness]] are two major factors in the desire for future interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women regard physical attractiveness less highly compared to men when it came to dating, a serious relationship, and sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, women rate humorous men more desirable than nonhumorous individuals for a serious relationship or marriage, but only when these men were physically attractive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Furthermore, humorous people are perceived by others to be more cheerful but less intellectual than nonhumorous people. [[Self-deprecating humour]] has been found to increase the desirability of physically attractive others for committed relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The results of a study conducted by [[McMaster University]] suggest humour can positively affect one’s desirability for a specific relationship partner, but this effect is only most likely to occur when men use humour and are evaluated by women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = The influence of humour on desirability|last = Bressler, Balshine|date = 2006|journal = Evolution and Human Behavior|doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.06.002|pmid = |access-date = |volume=27 |pages=29–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence was found to suggest men prefer women with a sense of humour as partners, nor women preferring other women with a sense of humour as potential partners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When women were given the forced-choice design in the study, they chose funny men as potential relationship partners even though they rated them as being less honest and intelligent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Post-Hoc analysis showed no relationship between humour quality and favourable judgments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Psychological well-being ==

It is generally known that humour contributes to higher subjective wellbeing (both physical and psychological).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Humor and self-concept|last = Kuiper &amp; Martin|date = 1993|journal = Humor-International Journal of Humor Research|doi = 10.1515/humr.1993.6.3.251|pmid = |access-date = |volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research on humour and [[psychological well-being]] show that humour is in fact a major factor in achieving, and sustaining, higher psychological wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Bos&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=Snippe, E.|author3=de Jonge, P.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11| issue = | pages = e0150867| url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | pmid=26963923}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is known as general facilitative hypothesis for humour.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That is, positive humour leads to positive health. Not all contemporary research, however, supports the previous assertion that humour is in fact a cause for healthier psychological wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laughter and stress in daily life: Relation to positive and negative affect|last = Kuiper &amp; Martin|date = 1998|journal = Motivation and emotion|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the previous researches’ limitations is that they tend to use a unidimensional approach to humour because it was always inferred that humour was deemed positive. They did not consider the types of humour, or [[humor styles|humour styles]]. For example, self-defeating or aggressive humour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Individual differences in uses of humor and their relation to psychological well-being: Development of the humor styles questionnaire|last = Martin, Puhlik-Doris, Larsen, Gray., &amp; Weir|date = 2003|journal = Journal of Research in Personality|doi = 10.1016/s0092-6566(02)00534-2|pmid = |access-date = |volume=37 |pages=48–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has proposed 2 types of humour that each consist of 2 styles, making 4 styles in total. The two types are adaptive versus maladaptive humour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Adaptive humour consist of facilitative and self-enhancing humour, and maladaptive is self-defeating and aggressive humour. Each of these styles can have a different impact on psychological and individuals’ overall subjective wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

#Affiliative style humour. Individuals with this dimension of humour tend to use jokes as a mean of affiliating relationships, amuse others, and reduce tensions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Self-enhancing style humour. People that fall under this dimension of humour tend to take a humorous perspective of life. Individuals with self-enhancing humour tend to use it as a mechanism to cope with [[Stress (biology)|stress]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Aggressive humour. Racist jokes, sarcasm and disparagement of individuals for the purpose of amusement. This type of humour is used by people who do not consider the consequences of their jokes, and mainly focus on the entertainment of the listeners.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Self-defeating humour. People with this style of humour tend to amuse others by using self-disparaging jokes, and also tend to laugh along with others when being taunted. It is hypothesised that people use this style of humour as a mean of social acceptance. It is also mentioned that these people may have an implicit feeling of negativity. So they use this humour as a means of hiding that inner negative feeling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the study on humour and psychological well-being, research has concluded that high levels of adaptive type humour (affiliative and self-enhancing) is associated with better self-esteem, positive affect, greater self-competency, as well as anxiety control and social interactions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Humor is not always the best medicine: Specific components of sense of humor and psychological well-being|last = Kuiper, Grimshaw, Leite., &amp; Kirsh|date = 2004|journal = Humor: International journal of Humor Research|doi = 10.1515/humr.2004.002|pmid = |access-date = |volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of which are constituents of psychological wellbeing. Additionally, adaptive humour styles may enable people to preserve their sense of wellbeing despite psychological problems.&lt;ref name= Bos/&gt; In contrast, maladaptive humour types (aggressive and self-defeating) are associated with poorer overall psychological wellbeing,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; emphasis on higher levels of anxiety and depression. Therefore, humour may have detrimental effects on psychological wellbeing, only if that humour is of negative characteristics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Physiological effects ==
[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumbnail|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and  [[Bill Clinton]] enjoying a joke, in spite of their language differences]]
Humour is often used to make light of difficult or stressful situations and to brighten up a social atmosphere in general. It is regarded by many as an enjoyable and positive experience, so it would be reasonable to assume that it humour might have some positive physiological effects on the body.

A study designed to test the positive physiological effects of humour,  the relationship between being exposed to humour and pain tolerance in particular, was conducted in 1994 by Karen Zwyer, Barbara Velker, and Willibald Ruch. To test the effects of humour on pain tolerance the test subjects were first exposed to a short humorous video clip and then exposed to the Cold Press Test. To identify the aspects of humour which might contribute to an increase in pain tolerance the study separated its fifty six female participants into three groups, cheerfulness, exhilaration and humour production. The subjects were further separated into two groups, high Trait-Cheerfulness and high Trait-Seriousness according to the State-Trait-Cheerfulness-Inventory. The instructions for the three groups were as follows: the cheerfulness group were told to get excited about the movie without laughing or smiling, the exhilaration group was told to laugh and smile excessively, exaggerating their natural reactions, the humour production group was told to make humorous comments about the video clip as they watched. To ensure that the participants actually found the movie humorous and that it produced the desired effects the participants took a survey on the topic which resulted in a mean score of 3.64 out of 5. The results of the Cold Press Test showed that the participants in all three groups experienced a higher pain threshold, a higher pain tolerance and a lower pain tolerance than previous to the film. The results did not show a  significant difference between the three groups.&lt;ref&gt;"Do cheerfulness, exhilaration, and humor production moderate pain tolerance? A FACS study". ''ResearchGate''. Retrieved 2015-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also potential relationships between humour and having a healthy immune system. SIgA is a type of antibody that protects the body from infections. In a method similar to the previous experiment, the participants were shown a short humorous video clip and then tested for the effects. The participants showed a significant increase in SIgA levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Mary Payne | last2 = Lengacher | first2 = Cecile | year = 2009 | title = Humor and Laughter May Influence Health IV. Humor and Immune Function | url = | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 159–164 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/nem149 | pmid = 18955287 | pmc=2686627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been claims that laughter can be a supplement for cardiovascular exercise and might increase muscle tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Mary Payne | last2 = Lengacher | first2 = Cecile | year = 2008 | title = Humor and Laughter May Influence Health: III. Laughter and Health Outcomes | url = | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 37–40 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/nem041 | pmid = 18317546 | pmc=2249748}}&lt;/ref&gt; However an early study by Paskind J. showed that laughter can lead to a decrease in skeletal muscle tone because the short intense muscle contractions caused by laughter are followed by longer periods of muscle relaxation. The cardiovascular benefits of laughter also seem to be just a figment of imagination as a study that was designed to test oxygen saturation levels produced by laughter, showed that even though laughter creates sporadic episodes of deep breathing, oxygen saturation levels are not affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fry | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Stoft | first2 = P. E. | year = 1971 | title = Mirth and oxygen saturation levels of peripheral blood | url = | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 76–84 | pmid = 5146348 | doi=10.1159/000286308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As humour is often used to ease tension, it might make sense that the same would be true for anxiety. A study by Yovetich N, Dale A, Hudak M. was designed to test the effects humour might have on relieving anxiety. The study subject were told that they would be given to an electric shock after a certain period of time. One group was exposed to humorous content, while the other was not. The anxiety levels were measured through self-report measures as well as the heart rate. Subjects which rated high on sense of humour reported less anxiety in both groups, while subjects which rated lower on sense of humour reported less anxiety in the group which was exposed to the humorous material. However, there was not a significant difference in the heart rate between the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yovetich | first1 = N. A. | last2 = Dale | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Hudak | first3 = M.

== In the workplace ==

Humour is a ubiquitous, highly ingrained, and largely [[meaningful]] aspect of human experience and is therefore decidedly relevant in organisational contexts, such as the workplace.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Healthy humour: Using humour to cope at work|journal = Kōtuitui: New Zealand Journal of Social Sciences Online|date = 2009-01-01|issn = |pages = 89–102|volume = 4|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/1177083X.2009.9522446|first = Barbara|last = Plester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The significant role that [[laughter]] and [[fun]] play in organisational life has been seen as a [[sociological]] phenomenon and has increasingly been recognised as also creating a sense of involvement among workers.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are we having fun yet? A consideration of workplace fun and engagement|journal = Employee Relations|date = 2009-10-02|issn = 0142-5455|pages = 556–568|volume = 31|issue = 6|doi = 10.1108/01425450910991721|last1 = Bolton|first1 = Sharon C.|last2 = Houlihan|first2 = Maeve}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sharing humour at work not only offers a relief from boredom, but can 
also build relationships, improve camaraderie between colleagues and 
create positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Humour in the workplace may also relieve tension and can be used as a [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategy]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
In fact, one of the most agreed upon key impacts that workplace humour 
has on people’s well being, is the use of humour as a coping strategy to
aid in dealing with daily stresses, adversity or other difficult 
situations.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
Sharing a laugh with a few colleagues may improve moods, which is 
pleasurable, and people perceive this as positively affecting their 
ability to cope.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
Fun and enjoyment are critical in people's lives and the ability for 
colleagues to be able to laugh during work, through banter or other, 
promotes  harmony and a sense of cohesiveness.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Humour may also be used to offset negative feelings about a
workplace task or to mitigate the use of profanity, or other coping 
strategies, that may not be otherwise tolerated.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
Not only can humour in the workplace assist with defusing negative 
emotions, but it may also be used as an outlet to discuss personal 
painful events, in a lighter context, thus ultimately reducing [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and allowing more happy, positive [[emotions]]  to surface.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
Additionally, humour may be used as a tool to mitigate the 
authoritative tone by managers when giving directives to subordinates. 
Managers may use self-deprecating humour as a way to be perceived as 
more human and "real" by their employees.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Furthermore, [[ethnography]] studies, carried out in a variety of workplace settings, confirmed the importance of a fun space in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
The attachment to the notion of fun by contemporary companies has 
resulted in workplace management coming to recognise the potentially 
positive effects of "workplay" and realise that it does not necessarily 
undermine workers’ performance.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Laughter and [[Play (activity)|play]] can unleash [[creativity]], thus raising [[morale]],
so in the interest of encouraging employee consent to the rigours of 
the labour process, management often ignore, tolerate and even actively 
encourage playful practices, with the purpose of furthering 
organisational goals.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Essentially, fun in the workplace is no longer being seen as frivolous.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
The most current approach of managed fun and laughter in the workplace 
originated in North America, where it has taken off to such a degree, 
that it has humour consultants flourishing, as some states have 
introduced an official "fun at work" day.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The results have carried claims of [[well-being]] benefits to workers, improved customer experiences and an increase in productivity that organisations can enjoy, as a result.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Others examined results of this movement while focusing around the science of happiness – concerned with [[mental health]], [[motivation]],
community building and national well-being – and drew attention to the 
ability to achieve "flow" through playfulness and stimulate "outside the
box" thinking.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Parallel to this movement is the "[[Positive psychology|positive]]" scholarship that has emerged in [[psychology]] which seeks to empirically theorise the optimisation of [[Human potential (disambiguation)|human potential]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
This happiness movement suggests that investing in fun at the 
workplace, by allowing for laughter and play, will not only create [[enjoyment]] and a greater sense of well-being, but it will also enhance energy, performance and commitment in workers.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Studies ==
{{main|Humor research}}

=== Laughter ===

One of the main focuses of modern psychological humour theory and research is to establish and clarify the correlation between humour and laughter. The major empirical findings here are that [[laughter]] and humour do not always have a one-to-one association. While most previous theories assumed the connection between the two almost to the point of them being synonymous, psychology has been able to scientifically and empirically investigate the supposed connection, its implications, and significance.

In 2009, Diana Szameitat conducted a study to examine the differentiation of emotions in laughter. They hired actors and told them to laugh with one of four different emotional associations by using auto-induction, where they would focus exclusively on the internal emotion and not on the expression of laughter itself. They found an overall recognition rate of 44%, with joy correctly classified at 44%, tickle 45%, schadenfreude 37%, and taunt 50%.&lt;ref name="Szameitat2009"&gt;Szameitat, Diana P., et al. Differentiation of Emotions in Laughter at the Behavioural Level. 2009 Emotion 9 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|399}} Their second experiment tested the behavioural recognition of laughter during an induced emotional state and they found that different laughter types did differ with respect to emotional dimensions.&lt;ref name="Szameitat2009" /&gt;{{rp|401–402}} In addition, the four emotional states displayed a full range of high and low sender arousal and valence.&lt;ref name="Szameitat2009" /&gt;{{rp|403}} This study showed that laughter can be correlated with both positive (joy and tickle) and negative (schadenfreude and taunt) emotions with varying degrees of arousal in the subject.

This brings into question the definition of humour, then. If it is to be defined by the cognitive processes which display laughter, then humour itself can encompass a variety of negative as well as positive emotions. However, if humour is limited to positive emotions and things which cause positive affect, it must be delimited from laughter and their relationship should be further defined.

=== Health ===

Humour has shown to be effective for increasing resilience in dealing with distress and also effective in undoing negative affects.

Madeljin Strick, Rob Holland, Rick van Baaren, and Ad van Knippenberg (2009) of Radboud University conducted a study that showed the distracting nature of a joke on bereaved individuals.&lt;ref name="Strick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strick | first1 = Madelijn | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = | title = Finding Comfort in a Joke: Consolatory Effects of Humor Through Cognitive Distraction | doi = 10.1037/a0015951 | journal = Emotion | volume = 9 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|574–578}} Subjects were presented with a wide range of negative pictures and sentences. Their findings showed that humorous therapy attenuated the negative emotions elicited after negative pictures and sentences were presented. In addition, the humour therapy was more effective in reducing negative affect as the degree of affect increased in intensity.&lt;ref name="Strick" /&gt;{{rp|575–576}} Humour was immediately effective in helping to deal with distress. The escapist nature of humour as a coping mechanism suggests that it is most useful in dealing with momentary stresses. Stronger negative stimuli requires a different therapeutic approach. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Humour is an underlying character trait associated with the positive emotions used in the [[broaden-and-build]] theory of cognitive development.

Studies, such as those testing the [[undoing (psychology)|undoing hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = Barbara L. | year = | title = What Good Are Positive Emotions? | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.300 | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 300–319 | pmid=21850154 | pmc=3156001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|313}} have shown several positive outcomes of humour as an underlying positive trait in amusement and playfulness. Several studies have shown that positive emotions can restore autonomic quiescence after negative affect. For example, Frederickson and Levinson showed that individuals who expressed [[Smile#Duchenne smile|Duchenne smiles]] during the negative arousal of a sad and troubling event recovered from the negative affect approximately 20% faster than individuals who didn’t smile.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson" /&gt;{{rp|314}}

Using humour judiciously can have a positive influence on cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=22 January 2017|url=https://allusdoctors.com/cancer-treatment/humor-in-cancer|title=Humor in Cancer Treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humour can serve as a strong distancing mechanism in coping with adversity. In 1997 Kelter and Bonanno found that Duchenne laughter correlated with reduced awareness of distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keltner | first1 = D. | last2 = Bonanno | first2 = G.A. | year = 1997 | title = A study of laughter and dissociation: Distinct correlates of laughter and smiling during bereavement | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 687–702 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.4.687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive emotion is able to loosen the grip of negative emotions on peoples’ thinking. A distancing of thought leads to a distancing of the unilateral responses people often have to negative arousal. In parallel with the distancing role plays in coping with distress, it supports the [[broaden and build]] theory that positive emotions lead to increased multilateral cognitive pathway and social resource building.

=== Ageing ===

Humour has been shown to improve and help the [[ageing]] process in three areas. The areas are improving physical health, improving social communications, and helping to achieve a sense of satisfaction in life.

Studies have shown that constant humour in the ageing process gives health benefits to individuals. Such benefits as higher [[self-esteem]], lower levels of [[clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], and perceived [[stress (biological)|stress]], and a more positive self-concept as well as other health benefits which have been recorded and acknowledged through various studies.&lt;ref name="Abel, M. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Humor, stress, and coping strategies | url = | journal = International Journal of Humor Research | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 365–381 | doi=10.1515/humr.15.4.365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kupier | first1 = N.A. | last2 = Martin | first2 = R.A. | year = 1993 | title = Humor and self-concept | url = | journal = International Journal of Humor Research | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 251–270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even patients with specific diseases have shown improvement with ageing using humour.&lt;ref name="Crew Solomon 1996 249–271"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crew Solomon|first=Jennifer|title=American Behavioral Scientist|journal=Humor and Aging Well: A Laughing Matter or a Matter of Laughing?|date=January 1996|volume=39|series=3|pages=249–271|doi=10.1177/0002764296039003004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall there is a strong correlation through constant humour in ageing and better health in the individuals.

Another way that research indicates that humour helps with the ageing process, is through helping the individual to create and maintain strong social relationship during transitory periods in their lives.&lt;ref name="Crew Solomon 1996 249–271" /&gt; One such example is when people are moved into [[nursing home]]s or other facilities of care. With this transition certain social interactions with friend and family may be limited forcing the individual to look else where for these social interactions. Humour has been shown to make transitions easier, as humour is shown reduce stress and facilitate socialisation and serves as a social bonding function.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley A. Crawford &amp; Nerina J. Caltabiano (2011): Promoting emotional well-being through the use of humour, The Journal of Positive Psychology: Dedicated to furthering research and promoting good practice, 6: 3, 237-252&lt;/ref&gt; Humour may also help the transition in helping the individual to maintain positive feelings towards those who are enforcing the changes in their lives. These new social interactions can be critical for these transitions in their lives and humour will help these new social interactions to take place making these transitions easier.

Humour can also help ageing individuals maintain a sense of satisfaction in their lives. Through the ageing process many changes will occur, such as losing the right to drive a car. This can cause a decrease in satisfaction in the lives of the individual. Humour helps to alleviate this decrease of satisfaction by allowing the humour to release stress and anxiety caused by changes in the individuals life.&lt;ref name="Crew Solomon 1996 249–271" /&gt; Laughing and humour can be a substitute for the decrease in satisfaction by allowing individuals to feel better about their situations by alleviating the stress.&lt;ref name="Abel, M. 2002" /&gt; This, in turn, can help them to maintain a sense of satisfaction towards their new and changing life style.

=== Physiology ===

In an article published in ''[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]'', it is reported that a study's results indicate that humour is rooted in the [[frontal lobe]] of the [[cerebral cortex]]. The study states, in part:&lt;blockquote style="text-indent: -0.5em; margin-top: -0.5em;"&gt;"Humour seems to engage a core network of cortical and subcortical structures, including temporo-occipito-parietal areas involved in detecting and resolving [[Theories of humor#Incongruous juxtaposition theory|incongruity]] (mismatch between expected and presented stimuli); and the [[Dopaminergic pathways|mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system]] and the [[amygdala]], key structures for [[Reward system|reward]] and [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] processing."&lt;ref name="NeuroStudy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vrticka|first1=Pascal|last2=Black|first2=Jessica M.|last3=Reiss|first3=Allan L.|title=The neural basis of humour processing|journal=[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]|date=30 October 2013|volume=14|issue=12|pages=860–868|doi=10.1038/nrn3566|pmid=24169937|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Formula==

Some theoreticians of the comic consider exaggeration to be a universal comic device.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Draitser, ''Techniques of Satire'' (1994) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; It may take different forms in different genres, but all rely on the fact that the easiest way to make things laughable is to exaggerate to the point of absurdity their salient traits.&lt;ref&gt;M. Eastman/W. Fry, ''Enjoyment of Laughter'' (2008) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
There are many taxonomies of humor; the following is used to classify humorous tweets in (Rayz 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Automatic Humor Classification on Twitter|url=https://aclanthology.info/pdf/N/N12/N12-2012.pdf|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

Different cultures have different typical expectations of humour so comedy shows are not always successful when transplanted into another culture. For example,  a 2004 [[BBC News]] article discusses a stereotype among [[British humour|British comedians]] that Americans and Germans do not understand [[irony]], and therefore UK [[sitcom]]s are not appreciated by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3433375.stm|title=Do the Americans get irony?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 January 2004|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Festival of Comics and Games''' is held annually in [[Łódź]] at the Lodz Culture Centre. It is the largest Polish and assumed to be one of the largest in Central and Eastern Europe comic con.

In the beginning, the festival was called All-Polish Convention of Comic Creators. The first one was held on 2 February 1991 in [[Kielce]]. All subsequent ones were held in Łódź. The name was changed to International Festival of Comics in 1999, during the tenth edition of the con. In 2008 the "and Games" was added to the name, as the con expanded also embraced the area of [[computer games]].

The Festival's special guests included [[Grzegorz Rosiński]], [[Simon Bisley]], [[Akira Yamaoka]], [[Brian Azzarello]], [[Eduardo Risso]], [[Stan Sakai]], [[Marvano]], [[Pat Mills]], [[Clint Langley]], [[Milo Manara]], [[Jean Giraud]], [[Tanino Liberatore]], [[Zbigniew Kasprzak]], [[Karel Saudek]], [[Henryk Chmielewski (comics)|Henryk Chmielewski]], [[Tadeusz Baranowski (artist)|Tadeusz Baranowski]], [[Janusz Christa]], [[Bogusław Polch]], [[Szarlota Pawel]], [[Bohdan Butenko]] and [[Norm Breyfogle]] among many other international and local comic creators.

During the Festival, numerous panels and workshops are held, as well as meetings with the creators, publishers and other important figures from the comic field, including the cross with movies and literature fields.

It is also accompanied by the largest comic market throughout the year, where fans, collectors and both professional and small-press publishers sell their products and collectibles.

== The contest ==
Each year a comic contest is held, where a special jury, composed of comic professionals and publishers chooses the best short comic submitted for the contest. The comic professionals and fandom prizes are also nominated and awarded during the Festival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1060">'''JOVO Click 'N Construct''' is a brand name of a [[construction toy]] system invented by Josef Volgger and produced by JOVO International of [[Helsinge]], [[Denmark]]. The toy consists of equilateral triangle, square and regular pentagon plastic pieces that click together on their edges, and the edges then act as hinges to allow them to be folded up into three dimensional shapes. The pieces were designed to model regular-faced polyhedra, such as the [[Platonic solid]]s, [[Archimedean solid]]s, and [[Johnson solid]]s.

While JOVO hasn't enjoyed the peak popularity of [[Zaks]], JOVO has outlasted its sister building set.
The two are mildly related to [[Zome]] and [[Geomag]] construction toys, except that they focus on the faces of the polyhedra instead of the edges. JOVO pieces come in six different colors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8948">This is a '''list of [[cross-genre|multi-genre]] [[Fan convention|conventions]]'''.&lt;ref group="nb" name="noteworthy"/&gt; These cons typically do not cater to one particular genre (i.e., [[anime]], [[science fiction]], [[furry fandom]], etc.), but instead cover the gamut of these [[popular culture|pop culture]] phenomena without specifying itself as a specific convention of that variety. Many of these conventions were at one time specialized conventions, but have since spread out into multiple genres. Examples of this are [[Comic-Con International]] and [[Animation On Display]].

The list is divided up by location, and each convention includes dates during which it is typically held in parentheses.  The dates listed are approximate or traditional time periods for each convention; for more details, please see the article or website of the individual convention(s) concerned.

'''Ludo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|lj|uː|d|oʊ}}; {{ety|la|ludo|I play}}) is a [[Abstract strategy game|strategy]] [[board game]] for two to four{{efn|In some countries (at least Denmark) a variant for six players is available, but it is uncommon.}} players, in which the players [[race game|race]] their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single [[dice|die]]. Like other [[cross and circle game]]s, Ludo is derived from the [[India]]n game [[Pachisi]], but simpler. The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.

== History ==
[[Pachisi]] was rediscovered in India by the 6th century. The earliest evidence of this game evolution in India is the depiction of boards on the [[Ellora Caves|caves of Ellora]]. Even Pachisi was evolved from a very ancient game of Chausar played in the times of epic Mahabharata (Kurukshetra War time) about 10 century BCE. This game was played between the pandavas and kauravas&lt;ref&gt;[[Game of Dice]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}}. Latest version as we describe as Ludo, was played by the [[Mughal empire|Mughal emperors]] of India; a notable example is [[Akbar]].&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld (1975), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Pachisi was modified to use a cubic die with dice cup and patented as "Ludo" in England in 1896.{{efn|Patent number 14636.&lt;ref name=Bell_p12 /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Bell_p12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=R. C. |authorlink=Robert Charles Bell |title=Board and Table Games From Many Civilizations |edition=Revised |volume=I |publisher=[[Dover Publications|Dover Publications Inc]] |year=1979 |origyear=1st Pub. 1960, [[Oxford University Press]], London |page=12 |isbn=0-671-06030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pachisi.vegard2.net/ludo.html |title=Pachisi &amp; Ludo – pc games, rules &amp; history |work=vegard2.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- q.v. da.wikipedia.org no.wikipedia.org --&gt;  The [[Royal Navy]] took Ludo and converted it into the board game [[Uckers]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

== Nomenclature ==
Ludo exists under different game names from various name derivations: 

=== Word ''pachisi'' ===
* In North America, the game is sold under the brand name ''[[Parcheesi]]''. Variations of the game are sold under the brand names ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'', ''[[Aggravation (board game)|Aggravation]]'', and ''[[Trouble (board game)|Trouble]]''.
* In Spain, it is called "[[Parchís]]" in Spanish and "[[:ca:Parxís|Parxís]]" in Catalan.
* In Colombia, it is called "[[Parqués]]".

=== Behaviour of players getting upset or similar ===
* In Germany, this game is called "[[Mensch ärgere dich nicht]]" (Man, don't get upset), and has equivalent names in many other languages, such as Albanian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, and Turkish.
* In Greece, the game is called "Γκρινιάρης" [Griniaris] (Grumbler) referring to typical player behaviour.
* In Italy, it is called "Non t'arrabbiare" (Don't get upset).

=== Other ===
* In Poland, it is commonly referred to as "Chińczyk" (The Chinese), though an equivalent form to the German name also exists ("Człowieku, nie irytuj się!").
* In Estonia, it is called "Reis ümber maailma" (Trip around the world).
* In China, Malaysia and Singapore, it is called "飞行棋" or "飞机棋" ([[Aeroplane Chess]]).
* In Sweden, it is known as "Fia", a name derived from the Latin word ''fiat'' which means "so be it!" Common variations on the name are "Fia-spel" (Fia the game) and "Fia med knuff" (Fia with push). In Denmark and Norway though, the game is known as Ludo.
* In Vietnam, it is called "Cờ cá ngựa".
* In France, it is called "Petits Chevaux" (Little Horses) or "Le Jeu de Dada" (The Game of Dada) (dada being a colloquial word for "horse") and typically played with horse-headed pieces.&lt;ref name="Parlett"&gt;Parlett (1999), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Hungary, this game is called "Ki nevet a végén" (Who laughs at the end).

== Ludo board ==
[[File:Ludo-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|An original Ludo board]]
Special areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is assigned a colour and has four tokens{{efn|Tokens were originally flat bone discs;&lt;ref name=Bell_1983 /&gt; modern materials are cardboard or plastic.}} in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped {{boardgloss|playspace}}, with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's ''home column''. A sixth coloured square not on the home column is a player's ''starting square''. At the centre of the board is a large ''finishing square'', often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus depicting "arrows" pointing to the finish).

== Rules ==

=== Overview ===
[[File:Ludo board.png|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Ludo board diagram]]
Two, three, or four can play, without partnerships.{{efn|name=2to4|"From two to four play, each with four pieces, and without partnerships."&lt;ref name=Parlett /&gt;}} At the beginning of the game, each player's four tokens are out of play and {{boardgloss|staging area|staged}} in the player's ''yard'' (one of the large corner areas of the board in the player's colour). When able to, the players will enter their tokens one per time on their respective starting squares, and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the ''game track'' (the path of squares not part of any player's home column). When reaching the square below his home column, a player continues by moving tokens up the column to the finishing square. The rolls of a single [[Dice|die]]&lt;ref name=Parlett /&gt;&lt;ref name=DG_p13 /&gt; control the swiftness of the tokens, and entry to the finishing square requires a precise roll from the player. The first to bring all their tokens to the finish wins the game. The others often continue play to determine second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers.

=== Gameplay ===
&lt;!-- Please don't change "die" to "dice" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; "dice rolls" implies two or more. --&gt;
Each player rolls the die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.

To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a ''6''.&lt;ref name=Parlett /&gt;&lt;ref name="DG_p13"&gt;Diagram Group (1975), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a ''6'', the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the die. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled. {{boardgloss|pass|Passes}} are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.

When a ''6'' is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a ''6'' earns the player an additional or "bonus" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a ''6'' again, the player earns an additional bonus roll.{{efn|"Should a player throw two 6s in succession, he is allowed a third throw."&lt;ref name=DG_p13 /&gt;}} If the third roll is also a ''6'', the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.

Players may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a ''6''. Unlike Pachisi, there are no "safe" squares on the game track which protect a player's tokens from being returned. A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.

== Variations ==
[[File:Narayangarh-12.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|right|[[Pachisi]] variant being played on a Ludo board in [[Nepal]]]]
* Ludo played in the [[Indian continent]] features a safe square in each quadrant, normally the fourth square from the top in the rightmost column. These squares are usually marked with a star. In India Ludo is often played with two dice, and rolling ''1'' on a die also allows a token to enter active play. Thus if a player rolls a ''1'' and a ''6'', they may get a token out and move it six steps.
* To get a game started faster, some [[house rule]]s allow a player with no pieces on the board to bring their first piece into play on any roll, on a ''1'' or a ''6'', or allow multiple tries to roll a ''6'' (with three rolls being the most popular).
* If a piece lands on the same space as another piece of the same colour, the moved piece must take the preceding space.
* If a piece lands on the same space as another piece(s) of the same colour, the pieces are doubled or combined and form a ''block'' which cannot be passed or taken by any opponent's pieces.&lt;ref name="Bell_1983"&gt;Bell (1983), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Some variations permit such blocks to be passed by rolling a ''6'' or ''1''.
* A block of two or more pieces can be taken by an opponent's single piece.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1978), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doubled pieces may move half the number if an even number is thrown (e.g. move two spaces if a ''4'' is thrown).
* A doubled piece may capture another doubled piece (like in [[Coppit]]).
* A board may have only four spaces in each home column. All four of a player's pieces must finish in these spaces for the player to have finished the game. (See {{lang|de|[[Mensch ärgere dich nicht]]}}.)
* A player must move all the numbers rolled (e.g. if a player rolls multiple ''6s'', they have to use all the numbers to move).
* A player cannot capture or enter finish if they have numbers remaining. (E.g., if a player rolls a ''6'' and a ''2'' and they have the option to capture or enter finish with one of their pieces using the ''2'', they can only do so if they have another piece that can use the ''6''.)
* To speed the game up, extra turns or bonus moves can be awarded for capturing a piece or getting a piece home; these may grant passage past a block.
* In Denmark and some other countries the board has eight spaces marked with a globe and eight with a star. The globes are safe spaces where a piece cannot be captured. The exception is that a player who has not yet entered all pieces, can always enter a piece on a roll of ''6''. If the entry space is occupied by another player's piece, that piece is captured. Otherwise the entry spaces work like the other globe spaces. A piece which would have landed on a star instead moves to the next star.
* In Vietnam, it is called "Cờ cá ngựa", where the game is modeled after a horse race with the tokens modeled as horse heads. In this variation, a ''1'' is given equal status to a ''6'' (meaning that the player can enter a token into play and can roll again). Furthermore, once a player's token reaches their home column, it can only go up each square with an exact roll. This means that a person outside the column must roll a ''1'' to enter the first square, a ''2'' afterwards to enter the second, and so forth.
* In Pakistan, a variation that uses two dice allows backwards movement. The dice are rolled and the die values can be used independently or in combination to move two pieces or a single piece forwards or backwards or both. (E.g., if the roll gives ''1'' and ''4'', the player can move a single piece 4 steps forwards and then 1 step backwards, or 1 step forwards and 4 steps backwards, or 1 then 4 steps forwards or backwards. Or the player can move a piece 1 step forwards or backwards, and another piece 4 steps forwards or backwards.)

=== African variations ===
In some parts of Africa the following rules are reportedly played:
* A doubled block also blocks trailing pieces of the player who created the block, or blocks them unless they roll the exact number to land on the block; additionally, the doubled block cannot move forwards until the block that landed upon it moves off again. This reduces the tactical advantage of a block and makes the game more interesting.
* If the two players sitting opposite are partners, the players can exchange numbers.
* There are four safety squares on the board, like castle squares in Pachisi, as well as the safe home squares, where a piece may able to move forwards or backwards and start their turn before previous player finishes.
* A piece landing on a square with an opponent's piece not only sends the opponent piece back to the starting area but also sends the landing piece to its home square.
* A player cannot move their first piece into the home column unless they have captured at least one piece of any of the opponents.
* If a player captures the piece of another player, they are awarded a bonus roll. If in the bonus roll, another player's piece is captured, another bonus roll is awarded and so on.

[[image:Maculele in New York.jpg|thumb|Maculele in New York.]]
'''Maculelê''' (Pronounced: mah-koo-leh-LEH) is an [[Afro Brazilian]] [[dance]] where a number of people gather in a circle called a [[Roda (art)|roda]].

==Form==
In the roda, one or more [[atabaque]]s positioned at the entrance of the circle. Each person brandishes a pair of long sticks, traditionally made from [[Rollinia deliciosa|biriba]], canzi, or pitia wood from Brazil. The sticks, called grimas, traditionally measure 20 - 24&amp;nbsp;inches long by 1 and 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch thick. As the Maculelê rhythm plays on the atabaque, the people in the circle begin rhythmically striking the sticks together. The leader sings, and the people in the circle respond by singing the [[refrain|chorus]] of the songs. When the leader gives the signal to begin playing Maculelê, two people enter the circle, and to the rhythm of the atabaque, they begin striking their own and each other's sticks together. On the first three beats, they strike their own sticks together, making expressive and athletic dance movements, and on each fourth beat, they strike each other's respective right-hand stick together. This makes for a dance that looks like "mock stick combat". (Also, traditionally in Maculelê, the players wear dried grass skirts).

Maculelê has steps similar to many other Brazilian dances such as "frevo" from Pernanbuco, "Moçambique" from São Paulo, "Cana-verde" from Vassouras-RJ, "Bate-pau" from Mato Grosso, "Tudundun" from Pará among others.

==Capoeira==
In some [[capoeira]] schools, students perform maculelê using a pair of [[machete]]s (''facão'' in Portuguese; plural: ''facões'').  These large knives are associated with the tools used by slaves in plantations. The knives spark as they strike in the air, and the sparks along with the sounds of the knives striking one another make this performance particularly impressive. Because a fast moving dance with large knives is dangerous, only very experienced capoeiristas will use knives.

==Origins==
The origins of Maculelê are obscure, and there are many stories, theories and beliefs that claim "this is how Maculelê came to be". Here are three:{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

#During the slavery era in Brazil, the slaves in the sugarcane plantations would gather and play Maculelê as a game to vent their anger and frustration from being slaves. At this time, machetes were used instead of sticks. Sticks were later incorporated for safety reasons. However, some experts still use machetes.
#There were two tribes in Brazil: a peaceful tribe, and a warlike pirate one. For stealing supplies and raping this tribe would repeatedly attack the peaceful tribe, who had no way of defending themselves. One day, during an attack, a young boy named "Maculelê" picked up a pair of sticks and fought off the other tribe. The other tribe never attacked again. His home tribe then made a mock combat dance using sticks and named the dance "Maculelê" in his honor and memory.
#An interior West African village was embroiled in a regional conflict.  All of the warriors of the village were called to the front lines to defend their people from invaders.  All of the able bodied men gathered their arms and went to join the battle.  The next day, the villagers were awakened to find their small village, supposedly far from the battle, was being attacked by part of the invading army.  With no warriors left to defend the village, an unlikely hero emerged.  A young boy took up two simple sticks and inspired the remaining villagers to mount a fearless defense.  His heroic efforts became legend are represented in the Maculelê.

Maculelê is sometimes practiced by itself, but is quite often practiced alongside capoeira, and is featured in many capoeira performances. Maculelê and Capoeira are fairly similar in style and reason.

==In popular culture==
Maculelê was performed as a group dance in the Canadian version of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (Canada)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''.

'''Mimicry Srinivos''' is an international [[impressionist (entertainment)]], [[ventriloquist]] and very first sound illusionist from India.
For the past 40 years he performed more than 7000 shows all over [[India]] and around the world, including [[US]], [[UK]], [[UAE]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]], [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Tanzania]], [[Saudi Arabia]]  [[Sri Lanka]] Australia.
He is a disciple of the world-renowned mimic Padmashri Dr. [[Nerella Venumadhav]] and learnt ventriloquism from Prof. M.M. Roy of [[Chennai]], India and later he graduated in ventriloquism from Mahers institute of ventriloquists, Colorado, US. He is a member of " North American Association of Ventriloquists". He is also known as "Mimikry Srinivas, " Mimicry Sreenivas,
"Mimicry Srinivas" "Mimicry Seenu" and "Mimicry Srinivos". In the year 2013, the Education department of previous combined Andhra Pradesh state (India) included Srinivos' story in Class 8th Physics lesson in the chapter "Sound".

==Early life==
Sreenivos was born in a small village called [[Kesamudram]] in [[Warangal district]] of [[Telangana]] state in 1961. When he was a kid, got impressed by Dr Nerella Venumadhav's performance and started practising imitation of various voices. Fortunately, he got an opportunity to learn more and improve his skills when his family moved to Warangal which is the hometown of renowned artist Dr Venumadhav. Soon he became a favorite desciple of Dr Venumadhav.  He started performing on stage when he was 15 years old and quickly became a popular artist with his new and bold experiments in mimicry and ventriloquism.
He is also a graphic artist and as a teenager, he ran his own graphic art business 'Navata Arts' in Warangal during the late 70s.

==Education==
He graduated in 'Bachelor of Arts' from Arts and Science College (affiliated to Kakatiya University), Warangal, Telangana state, India in the year 1982.

==Career==
Srinivos is the first Indian mimic to perform ventriloquism and sound illusion.
Srinivos has enthralled audiences all over India. He has performed and entertained worldwide, including cities like New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Chicago, Springfield (IL), Pittsburgh, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Huntsville, San Francisco, San Jose, Berkely, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, London, Stoke on trent, Dubai, Sharjah, Bahrain, Kuwait, Riyadh, Dammam, Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Colombo, Walatgama, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bagandatho, Kulim, Abudhabi, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne to name a few.

Srinivos created "Dhwanyavadhaanam", a unique feat in the world history of mimicry in the year 1990 and performed it first time in Tyagaraya gana Sabha auditorium in Hyderabad. He was awarded the title Dhwanyavadhaana Samrat.

He set a sensational world record by performing a 32-hour nonstop mimicry show in 1990 at Tyagaraja Ganasabha auditorium in Hyderabad.  It was organized by the Hyderabad Film &amp; Cultural Circle.
It was a very successful show, and at least 50,000 spectators enjoyed that event. It was shown live on big screens outside the auditorium for those who were unable to enter in.

He is well known for his presentation skills and most importantly, for his analysis of voices of various movie stars and popular figures, comparing how those voices changed from time to time.  He always says the secret for his success is that he does not do different mimicry but does it differently.  He inspired and taught mimicry and ventriloquism to many popular artists performing in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana States today. Srinivos is often considered as the successor to Dr Venumadhav.
He made the art so popular that 'Mimicry' has become part of his name. Later many mimics in India followed the same trend by adding 'Mimicry' to their name.

His performances include 'Mimicry Jugalbandi' and 'Group Mimicry' and unbelievable items in ventriloquism like Voice Throwing, Sound Perspective, Sound in Liquid, Distant Ventriloquism, Caricature Illusion, Close-up Sound Illusion, Point-blank Sound Illusion, etc.
He was hired by Indian Railways as a cultural representative and he currently works for South Central Railways, Hyderabad, India.
He appears very often in various Telugu television channels.
Srinivos performs in English, Hindi, Urdu, Tamil and Telugu.

The '''Mozart family grand tour''' was a journey through [[western Europe]], undertaken by [[Leopold Mozart]], his wife [[Anna Maria Mozart|Anna Maria]], and their musically gifted children [[Maria Anna Mozart|Maria Anna]] (Nannerl) and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang Amadeus]] from 1763 to 1766. At the start of the tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress [[Maria Theresa]] at the [[Habsburg monarchy|Imperial Court]]. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy [[Kapellmeister]] to the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]]. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's ''[[Child prodigy|Wunderkind]]'' status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences.

The first stage of the tour's itinerary took the family, via Munich and [[Frankfurt]], to [[Brussels]] and then on to Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first [[Symphony|symphonies]]. The family then moved on to the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to [[Salzburg]] in November 1766.

The material rewards of the tour, though reportedly substantial, did not transform the family's lifestyle, and Leopold continued in the Prince-Archbishop's service. However, the journey enabled the children to experience to the full the cosmopolitan musical world, and gave them an outstanding education. In Wolfgang's case this would continue through further journeys in the following six years, prior to his appointment by the Prince-Archbishop as a court musician.

==Child prodigies==

Watercolour by [[Louis Carrogis Carmontelle|Carmontelle]], c. 1763&amp;ndash;64.]]

The Mozart children were not alone as 18th-century music prodigies. Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of [[William Crotch]] of [[Norwich]] who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals.&lt;ref&gt;Spruce, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as "the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 40&amp;ndash;41&lt;/ref&gt; Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer [[Thomas Linley the younger|Thomas Linley]], born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy [[Sixtus Bachmann|Josef Siegmund Bachmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, pp. 192&amp;ndash;93&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.&lt;ref&gt;Knittel, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy.&lt;ref&gt;The full baptismal names of these children were Maria Anna Walburgia Ignatia and Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus. Maria Anna was always known by the diminutive "Nannerl", while the boy's name was contracted in general usage to Wolfgang Amadé (or Amadè). The form "Wolfgang Amadeus", occasionally used in his lifetime, has become popularised since. Theophilus and Amadeus are respectively the Greek and Latin forms of "Loved of God". Sadie, pp. 15&amp;ndash;16&lt;/ref&gt; The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography.&lt;ref name= Glover16/&gt; Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians.&lt;ref name= Glover16/&gt; When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the [[harpsichord]], with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account "the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him... When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down".&lt;ref name= Sadie18&gt;Sadie, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; A family friend, the poet [[Johann Andreas Schachtner]], recounted that at the age of four Wolfgang began to compose a recognisable [[piano concerto]], and was able to demonstrate a phenomenal sense of pitch.&lt;ref name= Glover16&gt;Glover, pp. 16&amp;ndash;17&lt;/ref&gt;

Nannerl herself was an   apt pupil, no less quick to learn than her brother, and was playing the keyboard with striking virtuosity by the time she was eleven.&lt;ref name= Blom8&gt;[[Eric Blom|Blom]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, 1762, Leopold brought the children to Munich to play before [[Maximilian III Joseph]], the [[prince-elector|Elector]] of [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 22, casts doubt on this visit, suggesting that it might have been "falsely remembered" by Nannerl.&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold then took the entire family to Vienna, on a trip that lasted for three months.&lt;ref name= Sadie23&gt;Sadie, pp. 23&amp;ndash;29&lt;/ref&gt; He had secured invitations from several noble patrons, and within three days of arriving the children were playing at the palace of Count Collalto. Among those present was the Viennese Treasury councillor and future prime minister [[Karl von Zinzendorf]], who noted in his diary that "a little boy, said to be only five-and-a-half years old (Wolfgang was actually nearly seven) played the harpsichord".&lt;ref name= Sadie23/&gt; After an appearance before the Imperial Vice-Chancellor, the Mozarts were invited to the royal court, where the Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] tested Wolfgang's abilities by requiring him to play with the keyboard covered.&lt;ref name= Sadie23/&gt; During this court visit Wolfgang met the Archduchess Maria Antonia, the future Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] of France, who was two months his senior. Mozart's biographer [[Eric Blom]] recounts an anecdote of how the Archduchess helped Wolfgang when he slipped on the polished floor; she is supposed to have received a proposal of marriage in return.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 14. Gutman, Introduction p. xx, has the same story. See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=OVaeF4RT4f0C&amp;pg=PA8 Evelyne Lever, ''Marie Antoinette'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Mozarts began to be noticed by the Viennese aristocracy, they were often required to give several performances during a single day.&lt;ref name= Sadie23/&gt; They were well rewarded for this activity&amp;mdash;at the end of their first hectic week in Vienna, Leopold was able to send home the equivalent of more than two years' salary.&lt;ref name= Glover18&gt;Glover, pp. 18&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt; Their schedule was interrupted when Wolfgang fell ill with [[scarlet fever]], and their former momentum was not regained. Nevertheless, the visit left Leopold eager to pursue further opportunities for social and financial success.&lt;ref name= Glover18/&gt; On their return to Salzburg, Wolfgang played the harpsichord and violin at a birthday concert for the Archbishop, to the evident astonishment of those present.&lt;ref name= Kenyon55&gt;Kenyon, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand tour==
===Preparations===
[[File:Leopold Mozart.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= Serios-faced middle-aged man, seated facing half- left, wearing a wig and a heavy brown formal coat|[[Leopold Mozart]], c. 1765.]]

In a letter to his friend and landlord Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm]], who after hearing the children play had said: "Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first".&lt;ref name= Sadie34&gt;Sadie, pp. 34&amp;ndash;36&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be "the most ungrateful creature".&lt;ref name= Sadie34/&gt; He was said to have describe Wolfgang as "The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Wolfgang-Amadeus-Mozart|title=Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart {{!}} Biography, Facts, &amp;amp; Works|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart biographer [[Wolfgang Hildesheimer]] has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: "Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child..."&lt;ref name= Hildesheimer30&gt;Hildesheimer, pp. 30&amp;ndash;31&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.&lt;ref name= Hildesheimer29/&gt;

Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible&amp;mdash;the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts.&lt;ref name= Sadie34/&gt; The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the [[Austrian Netherlands]], Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour.&lt;ref name= Sadie34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities.&lt;ref name= Glover18/&gt; These would enable them to obtain money ''en route'', while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently without any tuition whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; As for more general preparation, the children delighted in making music together, something they never lost.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; On tour, even during the busiest travelling days they would fit in their daily practice, appearing to thrive on the hectic schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Before the journey could begin, Leopold needed the consent of his employer, the prince-archbishop. Leopold had only been appointed deputy Kapellmeister in January 1763; nevertheless the archbishop's consent to an extended leave of absence was granted, on the grounds that the Mozarts' successes would bring glory to Salzburg, its ruler, and to God.&lt;ref name= Sadie34/&gt;

===Early stages (July&amp;ndash;November 1763)===

He is wearing [[livery]] presented by the Empress [[Maria Theresa]] the previous winter.]]

The journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on the first day a carriage wheel broke, requiring a 24-hour pause while repairs were carried out. Leopold turned this delay to advantage by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at [[Wasserburg am Inn|Wasserburg]], where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ [[Pedal keyboard|pedalboard]] as if he had been studying it for months.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Mozart letter, quoted by Sadie, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before Elector Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]] or [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|florins]].&lt;ref&gt;The florin, or [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]], was the currency of the Austro-Hungarian empire. A florin was worth about one-tenth of a £ sterling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Sadie37&gt;Sadie, pp. 37&amp;ndash;47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The next stop was [[Augsburg]], where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend any of the three concerts given there.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The family then moved on to [[Schwetzingen]] and the [[Mannheim]] court, where the children's performance apparently amazed [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Elector Palatine Karl Theodor]] and his [[Countess Elizabeth Augusta of Sulzbach|Electress]].&lt;ref name= Sadie37/&gt;

The next extended stop was at [[Mainz]]. The Elector was ill, but the Mozarts gave three concerts in the town, which brought in 200 gulden.&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; From Mainz the family took the market boat up the River [[Main (river)|Main]] to Frankfurt, where several public concerts were given. Among those present at the first of these was the fourteen-year-old [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who would many years later recall "the little fellow with his wig and his sword".&lt;ref name= Sadie37/&gt; An advertisement for these concerts announced that "the girl" would play "the most difficult pieces by the greatest masters", while "the boy" would play a concerto on the violin and also repeat his Vienna trick of playing with the keyboard completely covered by a cloth. Finally "he will improvise out of his head, not only on the fortepiano but also on the organ...in all the keys, even the most difficult, that he may be asked".&lt;ref name= Sadie37/&gt;

The family proceeded by riverboat to [[Koblenz]], [[Bonn]] and [[Cologne]]. Turning west they reached [[Aachen]], where a performance was given before [[Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia]], the sister of [[Frederick the Great]].&lt;ref name= Kenyon55/&gt; The princess tried to persuade Leopold to abandon his itinerary and go to [[Berlin]], but Leopold resisted. "She has no money," he wrote to Hagenauer, recounting that she had repaid the performance with kisses. "Howbeit, neither mine host nor the postmaster are to be contented with kisses."&lt;ref name= Blom17&gt;Blom, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; They proceeded into the Austrian Netherlands, an area corresponding roughly to present-day [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]],&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; where they arrived in the regional capital, Brussels, on 5 October. After several weeks' waiting for the governor-general, [[Prince Charles of Lorraine]], to summon them ("His highness the prince does nothing but hunt, gobble and swill", wrote Leopold to Hagenauer),&lt;ref name= Blom17/&gt; the Mozarts gave a grand concert in the prince's presence on 7 November. On the 15th the family departed for Paris.&lt;ref name= Sadie37/&gt;

During the hiatus in Brussels, Wolfgang turned his attention briefly from performing to composing. On 14 October he finished an [[Glossary of musical terminology#A|Allegro]] for harpsichord, which would later be incorporated into the [[Sonata in C for Keyboard and Violin (Mozart)|C major sonata]], [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 6, which he completed in Paris.&lt;ref name= Sadie37/&gt;

===Paris (November 1763 &amp;ndash; April 1764)===
[[File:Boupomp3 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Oval portrait of an elegant woman in a low-bosomed dess, wearing a cloak tied at the neck with a ribbon. She is holding a small flower in her left hand.|[[Madame de Pompadour]], the courtesan whom the Mozarts met at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], 1763&amp;ndash;64.]]

On 18 November 1763 the Mozart family arrived in Paris, one of the most important musical centres of Europe, and also a city of great power, wealth, and intellectual activity.&lt;ref name= Sadie47&gt;Sadie, pp. 47&amp;ndash;50&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold hoped to be received by the court of [[Louis XV]] at nearby [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. However, a recent death in the royal family prevented any immediate invitation, so Leopold arranged other engagements.&lt;ref name= Sadie47/&gt; One person who took particular note of the children was the German diplomat [[Friedrich Melchior von Grimm]], whose journal records Wolfgang's feats in glowing terms: "the most consummate Kapellmeister could not be more profound in the science of harmony and modulation".&lt;ref name= Sadie47/&gt; Leopold's own assessment, written a few months later, was similarly effusive: "My little girl, although only 12 years old, is one of the most skilful players in Europe and, in a word, my boy knows more in his eighth year than one would expect for a man of forty".&lt;ref name= Kenyon56&gt;Kenyon, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Zaslaw28&gt;Zaslaw, pp. 28&amp;ndash;29&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December the family moved to Versailles for two weeks during which, through a court connection, they were able to attend a royal dinner, where Wolfgang was reportedly allowed to kiss the hand of the Queen.&lt;ref name= Sadie47/&gt; At Versailles they also visited the famous courtesan [[Madame de Pompadour]], then in the last months of her life&amp;mdash;"an extremely haughty woman who still ruled over everything", according to Leopold.&lt;ref name= Baker&gt;Baker, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Nannerl's later recollections, Wolfgang was made to stand on a chair to be examined by the Madame, who would not allow him to kiss her.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no record of the children giving a formal concert at Versailles. In February 1764 they were given 50 [[louis d'or]] (about 550 florins) and a gold snuff-box by the royal entertainments office, presumably for entertaining the royal family privately, but no more details are available.&lt;ref name= Sadie47/&gt; Further concerts were given in Paris on 10 March and on 9 April, at a private theatre in the rue et Porte St Honoré.&lt;ref name = Sadie47/&gt; At the same time Wolfgang's first published works were printed: two pairs of sonatas for harpsichord and violin, K. 6 and 7, and K. 8 and 9. These pairs became Opus 1 and Opus 2 in Leopold's private catalogue of his son's work.&lt;ref name = Kenyon56/&gt; The first pair was dedicated to the king's daughter, [[Princess Victoire of France|Madame Victoire de France]], the second to the [[Madame de Tessé|Countess of Tessé]]. Mozart biographer [[Stanley Sadie]] comments that some aspects of these pieces are rather childish and naïve, but that nevertheless their technique is "astonishingly sure, their line of thinking is clear and smooth, and their formal balance is beyond reproach".&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

A decision was taken in Paris to go to London, perhaps on the advice of Leopold's musical and court acquaintances, who would probably have advised him that England was, in the words of the Mozart scholar [[Neal Zaslaw]], "known for the enthusiasm with which it received continental musicians and the extravagance with which it rewarded them".&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 April the family left for [[Calais]] and after an unpleasant crossing to [[Dover]] on a hired boat, and some delays, arrived in London on 23 April.&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, pp. 58&amp;ndash;59&lt;/ref&gt;

===London (April 1764 &amp;ndash; July 1765)===
[[File:London Cecil Court.jpg|thumb|alt= Narrow street with shops on each side. A few people are walking or window-shopping.|[[Cecil Court]], the street in which the Mozart family found lodgings on arriving in [[London]], April 1764 (2005 photograph).]]

The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in [[Cecil Court]], near [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and his 19-year-old German queen, [[Charlotte Sophia]].&lt;ref name= Sadie58&gt;Sadie, pp. 58&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May,&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw dates this second royal recital 28 May &amp;ndash; Zaslaw, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Johann Christian Bach]] and [[Carl Friedrich Abel]]. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an [[aria]], and he later improvised on the [[Figured bass|bass part]] of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced "the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished".&lt;ref name= Sadie58/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blom, pp. 23&amp;ndash;24&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th.&lt;ref name= Blom25&gt;Blom, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at [[Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens]]. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as "a way to earn the love of this very special nation".&lt;ref name= Blom25/&gt; Wolfgang was advertised as "the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age..." (he was in fact eight), "justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age".&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July there was a private performance at the [[Grosvenor Square]] home of the [[Earl of Thanet]], from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms.&lt;ref name= Blom25/&gt; "Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.&lt;ref name =Sadie63&gt;Sadie, pp. 63&amp;ndash;65&lt;/ref&gt; He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at [[180 Ebury Street]], then considered part of the village of [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].&lt;ref name= Glover25&gt;Glover, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mozart - 180 Ebury Street Belgravia SW1W 8UP.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Two Georgian terraced houses in brown brick with the bottom storey in stucco, that on the right with a brown circular plaque marking Mozart's residence|[[180 Ebury Street]], Pimlico, where the Mozarts stayed in the summer of 1765.]]

During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician [[Jane Glover]], Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach.&lt;ref name= Glover25/&gt; It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital.&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, pp. 25&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfgang soon completed his [[Symphony No. 1 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16]], and started his [[Symphony No. 4 (Mozart)|No. 4 in D major, K. 19]] (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague).&lt;ref name = Zaslaw44/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The symphonies numbered 2, K. 17 and 3, K. 18 are each spurious. No. 2 is the work of Leopold, No. 3 of Carl Friedrich Abel. Blom, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The D major [[symphony]] has, in Hildesheimer's words, "an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries".&lt;ref&gt;Hildesheimer, pp. 34&amp;ndash;35&lt;/ref&gt; These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical "Symphony No. 0" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook.&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, pp. 17&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt; Three lost symphonies, identified in the [[Köchel catalogue]] of Mozart's works only by their [[incipit]]s (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period.&lt;ref name= Zaslaw28&gt;Zaslaw, pp. 28&amp;ndash;29&lt;/ref&gt; Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental [[sonata]]s, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the [[Sonata in C major for keyboard four-hands, K. 19d|C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d]].&lt;ref&gt;Hildesheimer, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Violin Sonatas, KV 10-15 (Mozart)|set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts]], was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765.&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfgang also wrote his first vocal works, the [[motet]] "God is our Refuge", K. 20, and the tenor [[aria]] ''[[Va, dal furor portata]]'', K. 21.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of September, with Leopold's recovery, the family moved back to central London, to lodgings in Thrift Street (later [[20 Frith Street]]), [[Soho]]. These lodgings were located conveniently close to several concert rooms, and to the residences of both J. C. Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. Bach, a son of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], soon became a family friend; Nannerl later recalled Bach and the eight-year-old Wolfgang playing a sonata together, taking turns to play a few bars individually, and that "anyone not watching would have thought it was played by one person alone".&lt;ref name = Sadie66&gt;Sadie, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record that the Mozarts met Abel, but Wolfgang knew his symphonies, perhaps through the medium of the annual Bach-Abel concert series, and was much influenced by them.&lt;ref&gt;Gutman, p. 184 (f/n)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October, at King George's invitation, the children played at the celebrations marking the fourth anniversary of the king's accession.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Their next public appearance was a concert on 21 February 1765, before a moderate audience&amp;mdash;the date clashed with a Bach-Abel concert. Only one more London concert was given, on 13 May, but between April and June members of the public could go to the Mozarts' lodgings where, for a five [[shilling]] fee, Wolfgang would perform his musical party pieces. During June both the "young Prodigies"&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; performed daily at the Swan and Harp Tavern in [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]], the charge this time being a mere two shillings and sixpence. These were, as Sadie puts it, "Leopold's last, desperate effort to extract [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s from the English public".&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Hildesheimer likens this part of the tour to a travelling circus, comparing the Mozarts to a family of acrobats.&lt;ref name= Hildesheimer30/&gt;

The Mozarts left London for the continent on 24 July 1765. Before this, Leopold allowed Wolfgang to be subjected to a scientific examination, conducted by The Hon. [[Daines Barrington]]. A report, issued in ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' for the year 1770, confirms the truth of Wolfgang's exceptional capabilities.&lt;ref name= Sadie75&gt;Sadie, pp. 75&amp;ndash;78&lt;/ref&gt; Practically the last act of the family in London was the gift to the [[British Museum]] of the manuscript copy of "God is our Refuge".&lt;ref name= Sadie75/&gt;

===The Netherlands (September 1765 &amp;ndash; April 1766)===
[[File:WilliamV.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Head and shoulders of a young man, half smiling, wearing a heavily braided coat|[[William V, Prince of Orange|Willem V, Prince of Orange]], painted by [[Johann Georg Ziesenis]]. The young prince met the Mozart family in 1765&amp;ndash;66.]]

Leopold had been specific in letters to Hagenauer that the family would not visit the [[Dutch Republic]], but would go to Paris and then return home to Salzburg.&lt;ref name= Zaslaw44&gt;Zaslaw, pp. 44&amp;ndash;45&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was persuaded by an envoy of the [[Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau]], sister of the [[Willem V of Orange|Prince of Orange]], to go instead to [[The Hague]] and to present the children to her, as official guests of the court.&lt;ref name= Zaslaw44/&gt; After the party's landing at [[Calais]] there was a month's delay at [[Lille]], as first Wolfgang fell sick with [[tonsillitis]], then Leopold suffered prolonged dizziness attacks.&lt;ref name= Sadie90&gt;Sadie, pp. 90&amp;ndash;95&lt;/ref&gt; Early in September the family moved on to [[Ghent]], where Wolfgang played on the new organ at the Bernardines chapel; a few days later he played on the cathedral organ at [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September the family finally reached The Hague.&lt;ref name= Sadie90/&gt;

After arriving in The Hague, Nannerl developed a severe cold and was unable to participate in the initial concerts before the Princess during their first week, nor in a performance before the Prince a few days later.&lt;ref name= Sadie90/&gt; Leopold was sufficiently confident of Nannerl's recovery to announce the appearances of both prodigies at a concert to be given at the hall of the Oude Doelen on 30 September. The notice for this concert gives Wolfgang's age as eight (he was nine), but correctly gives Nannerl's as fourteen. The advertisement concentrates on Wolfgang: "All the overtures will be from the hands of this young composer [...] Music-lovers may confront him with any music at will, and he will play it at sight".&lt;ref name= Zaslaw44/&gt; It is not certain whether this concert in fact took place&amp;mdash;Sadie believes it may have been postponed.&lt;ref name= Sadie90/&gt; If it did happen, Wolfgang appeared alone, for by this time Nannerl's cold had turned into [[typhoid fever]]. Her condition grew steadily worse, and on 21 October she was given the [[last sacrament]].&lt;ref name=Sadie90/&gt; A visit from the royal physician turned the tide; he changed the treatment, and by the end of the month she was recovering. Then Wolfgang fell ill, and it was mid-December before he was on his feet again.&lt;ref name= Sadie90/&gt;

Both children were able to appear at the Oude Doelen on 22 January 1766, in a concert which may have included the first public performance of one of Wolfgang's London symphonies, K. 19, and possibly of a new symphony in [[Symphony No. 5 (Mozart)|B flat major K. 22]], composed in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, pp. 47&amp;ndash;51&lt;/ref&gt; Following this concert they spent time in [[Amsterdam]] before returning to The Hague early in March.&lt;ref name= Sadie90/&gt; The main reason for their return was the forthcoming public celebrations of the Prince of Orange's coming of age. Wolfgang had composed a [[quodlibet]] (song medley) for small orchestra and harpsichord, entitled ''[[Gallimathias musicum]]'', K. 32, which was played at a special concert to honour the Prince on 11 March.&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, pp. 52&amp;ndash;55&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of several pieces composed for the occasion; Wolfgang also wrote arias for the Princess using words from [[Metastasio]]'s libretto ''[[Artaserse]]'' (including ''[[Conservati fedele]]'', K. 23), and keyboard variations on a Dutch song ''Laat ons juichen, Batavieren!'' K. 24. He wrote a [[Violin Sonatas, KV 26-31 (Mozart)|set of keyboard and violin sonatas]] for the Princess, as he had earlier for the French princess and for the Queen of Great Britain. Another symphony, K. 45a, commonly known as "[[Symphony, K. 45a (Mozart)|Old Lambach]]" and once thought to have been written several years later, was also written in The Hague, possibly for the Prince's coming-of-age concert.&lt;ref name= Sadie90/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The family left The Hague at the end of March, moving first to [[Haarlem]], where the organist of [[Sint-Bavokerk|St Bavo's Church]] invited Wolfgang to play on the church's organ, one of the largest in the country.&lt;ref name= Sadie90/&gt; From there they traveled east and south, giving concerts along the way at Amsterdam and [[Utrecht]] at 21 April, before leaving the Netherlands and traveling through Brussels and [[Valenciennes]], to arrive in Paris on 10 May.&lt;ref name= Sadie90/&gt;

===Homeward journey (April&amp;ndash;November 1766)===
The family remained in Paris for two months. No concerts were given by them in this period although, according to Grimm, there were performances of Wolfgang's symphonies.&lt;ref name= Zaslaw65&gt;Zaslaw, pp. 64&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt; Grimm was effusive about the development of both children; Nannerl, he wrote, "had the finest and most brilliant execution on the harpsichord", and: "no-one but her brother can rob her of supremacy".&lt;ref name= Sadie96&gt;Sadie, pp. 96&amp;ndash;99&lt;/ref&gt; Of Wolfgang he quoted a Prince of Brunswick as saying that many Kapellmeisters at the peak of their art would die without knowing what the boy knew at the age of nine. "If these children live," wrote Grimm, "they will not remain in Salzburg. Monarchs will soon be disputing about who should have them".&lt;ref name= Sadie96/&gt;

The only surviving music composed by Wolfgang during this Paris visit is his [[Kyrie in F major (Mozart)|''Kyrie'' in F major, K. 33]], his first attempt to write formal church music.&lt;ref&gt;Blom. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July, the family left Paris for [[Dijon]], following an invitation from the [[Louis François, Prince of Conti|Prince of Conti]]. The children played in a concert there on 19 July, accompanied by a local orchestra, about whose players Leopold made disparaging comments: ''Très médiocre &amp;ndash; Un misérable italien détestable &amp;ndash; Asini tutti &amp;ndash; Un racleur'' (a scratcher) ''&amp;ndash; Rotten''.&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, p. 67. The other terms may be translated: ''très mediocre'', "very undistinguished"; ''Un misérable italien détestable'', "a repulsive Italian misery"; ''Asini tutti'', "all idiots"; and ''Rotten'', "inadequate".&lt;/ref&gt; They moved on to [[Lyon]] where Wolfgang "preluded for an hour and a quarter with the most capable master here, yielding nothing to him".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Sadie, p. 99, from a contemporary report&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter to Hagenauer dated 16 August indicated that Leopold wished to proceed to [[Turin]], then across northern Italy to [[Venice]], and home via the [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. "Our own interest and love of travel should have induced us to follow our noses", he wrote, but added: "...I have said I shall go [directly] home and I shall keep my word".&lt;ref name= Sadie99&gt;Sadie, pp. 99&amp;ndash;103&lt;/ref&gt; The family took a shorter route through Switzerland, arriving in [[Geneva]] on 20 August, where the children gave two concerts, and were received by the distinguished composer [[André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry]]. Many years later Grétry wrote of this encounter: "I wrote for him [Wolfgang] an Allegro in E flat, difficult but without pretension; he played it, and everyone, except myself, thought it was a miracle. The child had never broken off, but following the modulations, he had substituted a number of passages for those I had written".&lt;ref name= Sadie99/&gt; This claim, that Wolfgang improvised when faced with passages he could not play, appears to be the only adverse comment from all those called upon to test him.&lt;ref name= Sadie99/&gt;

The journey through Switzerland continued, with concerts at [[Lausanne]] and [[Zurich]]. Since leaving the Netherlands, Wolfgang had composed little; a minor harpsichord piece, [[Piece in F for Keyboard, K. 33B (Mozart)|K. 33B]], written for the Zürich concerts, and later some cello pieces (since lost) written for the Prince of [[Fürstenberg (princely family)|Fürstenberg]]. The prince received the party on 20 October, on its arrival in [[Donaueschingen]] on the German border, for a stay of some 12 days.&lt;ref name= Sadie99/&gt; Resuming their journey, they reached Munich on 8 November. They were delayed here for nearly two weeks after Wolfgang fell ill, but he was well enough to perform before the Elector, with Nannerl, on 22 November.&lt;ref name= Sadie99/&gt; A few days later they set out for Salzburg, arriving at their home on the [[Getreidegasse]] on 29 November 1766.&lt;ref name= Sadie99/&gt;

==Evaluation==
===Financial===
The party had survived major setbacks, including several prolonged illnesses which had curtailed their earning powers. Although Leopold did not reveal the full extent of the tour's earnings, or its expenses,&lt;ref name="Glover26"/&gt; the material benefits from the tour had evidently been considerable&amp;mdash;but so had the costs. The librarian of St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg, thought that the gifts ("gewgaws") alone which they brought back were worth about 12,000 florins, but estimated the total costs of the enterprise at 20,000 florins.&lt;ref name= Sadie111&gt;Sadie, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The expenses were certainly high; in a letter to Hagenauer sent in September 1763, after ten weeks on the road, Leopold reported expenses to date as 1,068 florins, an amount covered by their concert earnings without, however, any significant surplus.&lt;ref name= Halliwell55&gt;Halliwell, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold stated that "there was nothing to be saved, because we have to travel in noble or courtly style for the preservation of our health and the reputation of my court".&lt;ref name= Halliwell55/&gt; He later recorded that on arrival in Paris in November 1763 that they had "very little money".&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, the coffers were full; in April 1764, near the end of the Paris sojourn and after two successful concerts, Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2,200 florins with his bankers.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, after the initial London successes, Leopold banked a further 1,100 florins. However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was worrying about the high costs of living in London&amp;mdash;he informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures&lt;ref name=Glover24&gt;Glover, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating.&lt;ref name= Glover24/&gt; The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, and needed to be anchored to an assured salary.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical===
In terms of musical development, while both children had advanced, Wolfgang's progress had been extraordinary, beyond all expectation.&lt;ref name= Glover26&gt;Glover, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Mozarts were now known throughout the musical establishments and royal courts of Northern Europe.&lt;ref name= Glover26/&gt; As well as the encounters in palaces with kings, queens and nobility, the children could converse in several languages;&lt;ref name= Glover26/&gt; the tour represented, for them, an outstanding education.&lt;ref name= Hildesheimer29&gt;Hildesheimer, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; However, these advantages had been gained at a price; Grimm, in Paris, noting the stress and strain on Wolfgang in particular, had feared that "so premature a fruit might fall before maturing".&lt;ref name = Glover26/&gt; However, Hildesheimer, while also expressing concerns, concludes that if Mozart's death at the age of 35 was caused by the exertions of his childhood, the intervening decades would not have been so productive, and obvious symptoms of decline would have manifested themselves.&lt;ref name= Hildesheimer29/&gt;

Of Wolfgang's music composed during the tour, around thirty pieces survive. A number of   works are lost, including the Zürich cello pieces and several symphonies.&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, pp. 29&amp;ndash;31&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving works include the keyboard sonatas written in Paris, London and The Hague, four symphonies, various arias, the assorted music written for the Prince of Orange, a Kyrie, and other minor pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, pp. 613&amp;ndash;21 (summary of Köchel catalogue)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Köchel's catalogue of Mozart's works|url= http://www.classical.net/music/composer/works/mozart/|publisher= Classical.net|accessdate= 27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart's career as a symphonist began in London where, in addition to the direct influences of Abel and J.C. Bach, he would have heard symphonies from leading London composers including [[Thomas Arne]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]] and [[Giuseppe Sammartini]]&amp;mdash;"a nearly ideal introduction to the genre", according to Zaslaw.&lt;ref name= Zaslaw28/&gt; The earliest symphonies, Zaslaw points out, while not in the same class as the later Mozart masterpieces, are comparable in length, complexity and originality to those written at the same time by the acknowledged symphonic masters of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Abel's Symphony No. 6 in E Flat was similar enough in style and technique to be mistaken as Mozart's, and is listed as such (Symphony No. 3, K. 18) in the original Köchel catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 82. A similar misunderstanding arose over a symphony of Leopold's which Köchel called Symphony No 2, K. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Sadie observes that the K. 22 symphony composed in The Hague is a good deal more sophisticated than the earlier ones which were written in London.&lt;ref name= Sadie104&gt;Sadie, pp. 104&amp;ndash;08&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozart's creative progress is likewise reflected in the sonatas composed for the Princess of Orange, which, according to Sadie, mark a considerable advance in technique and ideas over the earlier Paris and London sets.&lt;ref name= Sadie104/&gt; The arias composed in the Netherlands include Mozart's first attempts at "aria d'affetto", ''Per pièta, bell'idol mio'', K. 73b, once thought to have been composed much later, as its higher K number indicates.&lt;ref&gt;"Aria d'affeto" refers to arias of the slow, expressive type, such as ''Dove sono'' in ''Figaro'' or ''Per pièta, ben mio, perdona'' from ''Così fan tutte''. Sadie, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The tour thus saw Wolfgang's transformation from a composer of simple keyboard pieces to one with increasing mastery over a range of genres. This was evidenced in his home city, on 8 December&lt;!--which year?--&gt;, when one of his symphonies (it is uncertain which) was performed at [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]] at [[Salzburg Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, pp. 111&amp;ndash;12&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold's employer, the Prince-Archbishop, was frankly sceptical about Wolfgang's compositions, believing them to be Leopold's because they were "not nearly bad enough to be the work of a child".&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Whatever the true extent of their financial rewards from the tour, the Mozart family continued to live in their cramped apartment on the Getreidegasse, while Leopold resumed his duties as a court musician.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; However, travel and public display dominated the next six years of Wolfgang's life. In September 1767 the family was on the move again, this time to Vienna, remaining there (apart from an enforced evacuation during a [[Mozart and smallpox|smallpox]] epidemic) until January 1769.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year Leopold and Wolfgang left for Italy&amp;mdash;without Nannerl who, now 18, was no longer exhibitable as a child wonder.&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; They were away for sixteen months, and returned to Milan in August 1771 for five months, to attend rehearsals and the performance of Wolfgang's opera ''[[Ascanio in Alba]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; A third and final visit to Italy, from October 1772 until March 1773, was the last of the extended trips; the new Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo|Hieronymous Colloredo]], had distinct views about the roles of his court musicians, which precluded the freedoms that Leopold—and now Wolfgang, himself employed by the court&lt;ref&gt;He had been made a concert master with a salary of 150 florins. Blom, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;—had formerly enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NWA Canadian Junior Heavyweight Championship''' was the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] Board-controlled version of the Canadian Junior Heavyweight title. Previous non-NWA versions of the title also existed in [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]] and [[Manitoba]]. The title has existed since 1998.

The NWA Canadian Light Heavyweight Championship was a title that existed before the NWA Canadian Junior Heavyweight Championship.  The NWA Canadian Light Heavyweight Championship was vacated upon the inception of the NWA Canadian Junior Heavyweight Championship.

Being a professional wrestling championship, it is not won via direct competition; it is instead won via a predetermined ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a wrestling angle.  There have been 37 reigns by 24 wrestlers with five vacancies.  One of the vacancies came when [[Tony Kozina]] vacated the title upon winning the [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]].  The title is currently inactive after being deactivated by [[Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling]], an NWA member, in December 2011.

However, the viewing of footage from the [[New York City Police Department]] of real-life [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcisms]] changed her mind, and she has stated that "I'm a full believer [now]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/deliver-us-from-evil-made-olivia-munn-into-supernatural-believer|title=Deliver Us From Evil made Olivia Munn into supernatural believer|last=Hasty|first=Katie|date=April 25, 2014|work=[[HitFix]]|accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videos.huffingtonpost.com/entertainment/olivia-munn-says-shes-a-believer-after-working-on-deliver-us-from-evil-518205740|title=Olivia Munn Says She's a Believer After Working on 'Deliver Us from Evil'|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7208">'''Origami''' is a [[magic (illusion)|magic]] stage illusion with a Japanese paperfolding theme, designed by [[Jim Steinmeyer]].  It was originally performed in 1986 by Canadian illusionist [[Doug Henning]], using a working prop constructed by illusion builder [[John Gaughan]]. Illusionist [[David Copperfield]] later introduced presentational changes that would be widely copied by other performers.

==Effect==
{{Quote box|quote=In 1986, the wonderful Doug Henning, my former boss, introduced the Origami illusion, which means that it's been twenty-five years since that debut.

Of course, at that time, I had no understanding how popular or how imitated this illusion would become. For the record, there are no "plans" for the illusion; I've always licensed it through specific associates and the illusion is protected by US patent. This hasn't prevented some magicians from building, selling and performing embarrassing and inferior versions of it. And it hasn't stopped magicians from performing it when they never really understood it. But I try to remind myself that imitation, even poor imitation, is the sincerest form of flattery.|source=[[Jim Steinmeyer]] (2011)&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{Cite news | last = Steinmeyer | first = Jim | title = Newsletter | date = 30 March 2003 | url = http://www.jimsteinmeyer.com/newsletter/| accessdate = 27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=19.5%|align=right}}

===Doug Henning version===
''Origami'' was first performed by Canadian magician [[Doug Henning]] in 1986.  At that time, designer Jim Steinmeyer was employed as a magic consultant by Henning.

In the original presentation, Henning displays a small box, 12 inches square and decorated with Japanese-style prints, on top of a thin table. He explains that the box is held together by two ivory skewers and a wooden pole.

At this point, a male assistant appears on stage carrying a large mirror, which is mounted at the rear of the table and reflects the back of the box. Henning explains that the purpose of the mirror is to allow the audience to see the routine from the back. The ivory skewers and wooden pole are now removed from the box and placed against the mirror.

Henning tells the audience that the ''Origami Box'' is so named because it ''"unfolds, like an Origami work of art."'' He proceeds to unfold the box into a larger orange and black box. He further explains that the box holds just as much when it is folded down small as when it is opened up large.  To demonstrate, a female assistant wearing a turquoise costume appears on stage and climbs into the box. Henning points out that she barely fits inside the larger box; and then proceeds to fold the box down into its original smaller size. As he does so, he recites a short poem:

{{quote|
'' "A little box, proved otherwise'' &lt;br&gt;
'' The world at large, made small in size!"'' 
}}

The female assistant has disappeared from the table and it seems impossible that she can be inside the 12 inch box. Henning now takes the ivory skewers and wooden pole and inserts them back into the box, cross ways, length ways, and vertically.  He now rotates the table, showing the back for the first time.  There is no sign of the assistant.

Henning jokes that, the next time they travel, he will take his assistant as carry-on luggage.  He now tells the audience that the Japanese believe that whatever can be folded can also be unfolded. As he does so, he begins to unfold the box, and recites the rest of the poem:

{{quote|
'' "And as they gazed, the wonder grew'' &lt;br&gt;
'' The more they saw, the less they knew'' &lt;br&gt;
'' Each fold and crease had not explained'' &lt;br&gt;
'' All wonders of the world contained!"'' 
}}

The assistant emerges from the box, now dressed in a different outfit and wearing a mask.

===David Copperfield version===
David Copperfield introduced a number of presentational changes to ''Origami'' in 1989, devised by his choreographer, co-director and on-stage assistant [[Joanie Spina]].  The choreography, background music and presentational patter used in this version have all since been widely copied by other performers.&lt;ref&gt;http://illusionbooks.wordpress.com/tag/stage-illusions/&lt;/ref&gt;

Copperfield displays a red box, around 12 inches square, on a thin table.  It is penetrated by three Samurai swords - ''"side to side, front to back, and even from top to bottom."''  A male assistant mounts a mirror at the back of the table, and Copperfield explains that this enables the audience to ''"see the box from around the sides and from the back at all times."''

Copperfield asks the audience to watch very carefully ''"because we're going to do this very slowly."''

The lights are extinguished, leaving the stage in darkness. A musical soundtrack of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Mercy Street]] plays. The lighting is slowly restored to reveal Copperfield, in silhouette, holding one of the Samurai swords.  Behind him, a female assistant clothed in red is seen, sitting on the stage floor.  Copperfield removes each of the swords from the box with a flourish and mounts them on a nearby rack, before unfolding the box to its expanded state.  The larger box is white.

Copperfield moves across to the female assistant, takes her hand and lifts her to her feet.  The two embrace briefly, to the tempo of the music, and she then steps up onto the table.  The two embrace again.  The assistant then steps into the box, which Copperfield then folds back into a 12-inch cube.  He takes each sword in turn, with a flourish, and stabs them through slits in the center of each face of the box; the first from front to back, the second from side to side, and then stands on the table to insert the third sword from top to bottom. He now rotates the table full circle to show all sides.

Then he removes the swords, unfolds the box once again to its full size, and the assistant steps out onto the table unharmed. She is now wearing a white costume, matching the expanded box. Copperfield lifts her from the table and they embrace one last time as the lights are dimmed.

===Greg Frewin version===
Illusionist [[Greg Frewin]] developed a version of ''Origami'' in which a black cloth is placed over the mirror; the mirror is then broken and three of the broken shards are used to penetrate the box.  Finally, the mirror is restored.&lt;ref name="wellingtonent.com"&gt;http://www.wellingtonent.com/products/origami.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The original ''Origami'' prop was constructed by illusion builder [[John Gaughan]].  Current authorized versions are licensed to Gaughan and to Wellington Enterprises of [[New Jersey]], United States.&lt;ref name="wellingtonent.com"/&gt;

The design of the prop is protected by [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|US Patent]] #593178, issued in 2009 and expiring in 2023.

'''''Polda''''' is a 1998 Czech adventure video game developed by Sleep Team. 

== Sequels ==
Polda spawned five sequels between 1999–2014, developed by ZIMA software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://games.tiscali.cz/tema/hry-ze-serie-polda-za-smsku-33444|title=Hry ze série Polda za SMSku - Games.cz|last=Tiscali|website=Games.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Polda 2 ===
In 2010 the game was re-released for the iOS mobile platforms and later on Android.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://games.tiscali.cz/tema/ceske-a-slovenske-hry-pod-koly-casu-245471|title=České a slovenské hry pod koly času - Games.cz|last=Tiscali|website=Games.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the original production of ''Polda 2'' fell through, the license remained in the hands of Martin Zima, and following unsuccessful legal action, Sleep Team lost any percentage of the sale of future Polda games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://games.tiscali.cz/tema/historie-adventur-4-ceska-stopa-56482|title=Historie adventur #4: česká stopa - Games.cz|last=Tiscali|website=Games.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Polda 3 ===
'''''Polda 3''''' was originally intended to be the final Polda game, finishing the trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/polda-3-policista-pankrac-se-vraci-dqb-/Novinky.aspx?c=A000426_polda3000427_bw|title=Polda 3 - policista Pankrác se vrací|date=27 April 2000|website=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bonusweb, the developers deceived the entire gaming community by publicly announcing that the series was over while privately working on a fourth title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/polda-4-8211-z-komedie-vazna-detektivka-d7f-/Novinky.aspx?c=A010918_polda4n010919_bw|title=Polda 4 – z komedie vážná detektivka?|date=19 September 2001|website=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Polda 4 ===
'''''Polda 4''''' was released in 2002, departing from the previous artistic style by incorporating a hybrid 2D / 3D design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/polda-4-nove-informace-o-ctvrtem-dilu-d7h-/Novinky.aspx?c=A011125_polda4n011126_bw|title=Polda 4 - nové informace o čtvrtém dílu|date=26 November 2001|website=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Polda 5 ===
'''''Polda 5''''' was released in 2005.

=== Polda 6 ===
'''''Polda 6''''' was released in 2014. 

The release date for '''''Polda 7''''' is currently unknown.

== Critical reception ==
The first game in the series was a huge success and became a standard of Czech games.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Bonusweb.cz rated the first six games in the series at 91%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/polda-aneb-s-poctivosti-nejdriv-pojdes-dyk-/Recenze.aspx?c=A000404_polda_bw|title=Polda, aneb s poctivostí nejdřív pojdeš|date=1998-12-20|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 71%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/polda-2-c4l-/Recenze.aspx?c=A000213_polda2_bw|title=Polda 2|date=1999-11-30|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 72%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/polda-3-pankrac-agentem-cia-095-/Recenze.aspx?c=A001120_polda3_bw|title=Polda 3 - Pankrác agentem CIA|date=2000-11-20|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 77%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/polda-4-8211-soudruh-pankracov-zasahuje-dsl-/Recenze.aspx?c=A020221_polda4_bw|title=Polda 4 – soudruh Pankrácov zasahuje|date=2002-02-22|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 60%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/polda-5-8211-do-petice-vseho-dobreho-dos-/Recenze.aspx?c=A051116_polda5_bw|title=Polda 5 – do pětice všeho dobrého?|date=18 November 2005|website=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 60%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/polda-6-recenze-0p6-/Recenze.aspx?c=A141209_152003_bw-pc-recenze_srp|title=RECENZE: Polda 6 je jako Kameňák českého herního průmyslu|date=12 December 2014|website=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56736">'''Revenge porn''' or '''revenge pornography''' is the distribution of [[sexually explicit]] images or video of individuals without their permission.&lt;ref name=W346&gt;{{harvnb|Citron &amp; Franks|2014|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexually explicit images or video may be made by a partner of an [[intimate relationship]] with the knowledge and consent of the subject, or it may be made without his or her knowledge. The possession of the material may be used by the perpetrators to [[blackmail]] the subjects into performing other sex acts, to coerce them into continuing the relationship, or to punish them for ending the relationship.

In the wake of civil lawsuits and the increasing numbers of reported incidents, legislation has been passed in a number of countries and jurisdictions to outlaw the practice, though approaches have varied. The practice has also been described as a form of [[psychological abuse]] and [[domestic violence]], as well as a form of [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://summit.sfu.ca/item/15668|title="Stripped": An analysis of revenge porn victims' lives after victimization|first=Samantha|last=Bates|publisher=Simon Fraser University|date=2015-08-04|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "revenge porn" generally refers to the uploading of this sexually explicit material to [[humiliate]] and [[intimidate]] the subject, who has broken off the relationship.&lt;ref name= W346/&gt; The term is also often misused to describe non 'revenge' scenarios, including nonconsensual pornography distributed by [[hacker (term)|hackers]] or by individuals seeking profit or notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayward &amp; Rahn|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images are usually accompanied by [[doxing|sufficient information]] to identify the pictured individual, typically names and locations, and can include links to [[social media]] profiles, home addresses and workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Bazelon, [http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/revenge_porn_legislation_a_new_bill_in_california_doesn_t_go_far_enough.html Why Do We Tolerate Revenge Porn?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' (Sept. 25, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;Eric Larson, [http://mashable.com/2013/10/21/revenge-porn/ "It's Still Easy to Get Away With Revenge Porn"], ''[[Mashable]]'', 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims, whose images expose them to [[workplace discrimination]], [[cyber-stalking]] or physical attack, can have their lives ruined as a result. Given the practice by some companies of searching for potential sources of bad publicity, many victims of revenge porn have lost their jobs and found themselves effectively unhirable.&lt;ref name = Citron&gt;Danielle K. Citron, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/29/opinion/citron-revenge-porn/index.html "‘Revenge porn’ should be a crime"], ''CNN Opinion'' (Aug. 30, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics argue that the term "revenge porn" should not be used, and instead that it should be referred to as '''image based sexual abuse'''.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Rackley &amp; Clare McGylnn, "Image Based Sexual Abuse" (2017) Oxford Journal of Legal Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions which have passed laws against revenge porn include [[Israel]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref name=Laws_Lois&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2014_31/page-1.html|title=Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act (S.C. 2014, c. 31)|first=|last=|date = 9 December 2014|work = Justice Laws Website|accessdate = 25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; forty states of the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="cybercivilrights.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cybercivilrights.org/revenge-porn-laws/|title=40 States + DC have Revenge Porn Laws - Cyber Civil Rights Initiative|author=|date=|website=cybercivilrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Australia]]n states of Victoria, New South Wales, the Northern Territory,&lt;ref name="nt.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://legislation.nt.gov.au/en/LegislationPortal/Acts/~/link.aspx?_id=970FB2443D814DD9ACFD71DA0C6AD56F&amp;amp;_z=z&amp;format=assented|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Intimate Images) Act 2018|author=|date=|website=Northern Territory government}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Capital Territory,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/now--a-crime-in-act-to-share-an-intimate-photo-without-consent-20170816-gxx8sa.html|title=Canberrans who publish, or threaten to publish, 'revenge porn' now face jail|first=Katie|last=Burgess|date=16 August 2017|newspaper=The Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/bills.nsf/BillProgressPopup?openForm&amp;ParentUNID=DC68AED6CEC73FFB482582B90017A6C3|title=Criminal Law Amendment (Intimate Images) Bill 2018|publisher=Parliament of Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South Australia.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-05/criminalising-'revenge-porn'-in-nsw-a-step-closer/7813446|title='Revenge porn' to be criminalised in response to NSW privacy inquiry|author=Lucy McNally|date=4 September 2016|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 1980s, ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine began a monthly feature of reader-submitted images of naked women called "Beaver Hunt".&lt;ref name=artporn&gt;Kelly Dennis, ''Art/Porn: A History of Seeing and Touching'', Oxford International Publishers (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Beaver Hunt photographs were often accompanied by details about the woman, like her hobbies, her sexual fantasies, and sometimes her name.&lt;ref name=artporn /&gt; Not all of the women featured in Beaver Hunt submitted their own images and several women sued the magazine for publishing their photographs without their permission, or without verifying information on forged consent forms.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://leagle.com/decision/19841820736F2d1084_11634.xml/WOOD%20v.%20HUSTLER%20MAGAZINE,%20INC. ''Wood v. Hustler''], 736 F.2d 1084 (5th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades later, Italian researcher [[Sergio Messina]] identified "realcore pornography", a new genre consisting of images and videos of ex-girlfriends distributed through [[Usenet]] groups.&lt;ref name=history&gt;Alexa Tsoulis-Reay, [http://nymag.com/news/features/sex/revenge-porn-2013-7 "A Brief History of Revenge Porn"], ''New York Magazine'' (July 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, amateur porn aggregator [[XTube]] began receiving complaints that pornographic content had been posted without subjects' consent. Several sites began staging consensual [[pornography]] to resemble revenge porn, as well as hosting "authentic" user-submitted content.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name=twsEconomist&gt;{{cite news|title=Revenge porn: Misery merchants|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21606307-how-should-online-publication-explicit-images-without-their-subjects-consent-be|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenge porn began garnering international media attention when [[Hunter Moore]] launched the website ''[[IsAnyoneUp]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref name=frontier&gt;On The Media, [http://www.onthemedia.org/story/173718-revenge-porns-latest-frontier/transcript "Revenge Porn’s Latest Frontier"], WNYC (Dec. 2, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The site featured user-submitted pornography,&lt;ref name=frontier /&gt; and was one of the first sites to adopt the model initiated by Beaver Hunt: ''IsAnyoneUp'' often included identifying information, such as the subjects' names, employers, addresses and links to social networking profiles.&lt;ref name=frontier /&gt; Activist [[Charlotte Laws]] was the first person to speak out against Moore and one of the first people to publicly support revenge porn victims. This prompted backlash from some of Moore's devotees, who stalked Laws and sent her death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/mar/30/charlotte-laws-fight-with-internet-revenge-porn-king|title=Charlotte Laws' fight with Hunter Moore, the internet's revenge porn king|author=Carole Cadwalladr|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the [[social media]] site and [[Internet forum|online bulletin board]] [[Reddit]] announced a change to its privacy policy to ban the posting of sexually explicit content without the consent of those depicted. The announcement was made after a company meeting at which the issue of "illicit pornography—pictures and video—was a burning one".&lt;ref name=2015Reddit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pardon|first1=Rhett|title=Reddit to Ban Sexually Explicit Content Posted Without Consent|url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/191561|accessdate=25 February 2015|publisher=XBIZ.com|date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, [[Twitter]] followed suit with new rules to address the posting of unauthorized content and specifically revenge porn. Starting March 11, Twitter stated it would immediately remove "any 'link to a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct' that has been posted without consent."&lt;ref name=2015TwitterChange&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hymes|first1=Tom|title=Twitter Targets Revenge Porn with New Abusive Behavior Policies New tougher prohibitions start today.|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/technology/Twitter-Targets-Revenge-Porn-with-New-Abusive-Behavior-Policies-591209.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, the changes were in response to growing concerns "that [Twitter] has not done enough to prevent bad behavior on its site."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tsukayama|first1=Hayley|title=Twitter updates its rules to specifically ban ‘revenge porn'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/11/twitter-updates-its-rules-to-specifically-ban-revenge-porn/|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, [[Google]] announced it would remove links to revenge porn on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golbeck|first1=Jennifer|title=Google to Remove Revenge Porn from Search Results|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/06/19/google_announces_plan_to_remove_revenge_porn_from_search_results.html|website=slate.com|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] followed suit in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beauchere|first1=Jacqueline|title=‘Revenge porn:' Putting victims back in control|url=http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2015/07/22/revenge-porn-putting-victims-back-in-control/|website=blogs.microsoft.com/|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have placed forms on-line for victims to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061#ts=2889054,2889099 "Remove information from Google"].

==Advocacy==
The website ''endrevengeporn.org'', founded by [[Holly Jacobs]], a revenge porn victim, campaigns for the criminalization of revenge porn and considers it to be a form of [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/petition/|title=End Revenge Porn: Petition|website=www.endrevengeporn.org|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCRI FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/faqs/|website=.endrevengeporn.org|publisher=[[Cyber Civil Rights Initiative]]|quote=Revenge porn, n. – A form of sexual abuse that involves the distribution of nude/sexually explicit photos and/or videos of an individual without their consent. Revenge porn, sometimes called cyber-rape or nonconsensual pornography, is usually posted by a scorned ex-lover or friend, in order to seek revenge after a relationship has gone sour.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs is also the founder of the [[Cyber Civil Rights Initiative]] (CCRI), a nonprofit organization that seeks to challenge cyber harassment. [[Danielle Citron]], known for her discourse on cyber harassment as a civil rights issue, is an advisor for the CCRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCRI: About us|url=http://www.cybercivilrights.org/about|website=cybercivilrights.org|publisher=[[Cyber Civil Rights Initiative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvardnb|Citron|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Anne Franks]], CCRI's Vice-President and Legislative &amp; Tech Policy Director, has been heavily involved with legislative and policy efforts to combat revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/mary-anne-franks-revenge-porn/|title=Meet the Krav Maga-fighting law professor behind U.S. revenge porn laws|work=The Daily Dot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Laura Hilly and Kira Allmann of the [[Oxford Human Rights Hub]] have characterized revenge porn as a kind of gendered hate speech designed to silence women. An article of theirs argues that this stifling of free expression is often ignored in debates over revenge porn.&lt;ref name=OxHRH&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hilly|first1=Laura|last2=Allman|first2=Kira|title=Revenge porn does not only try to shame women – it tries to silence them too|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/22/revenge-porn-women-free-speech-abuse?CMP=ema_565|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not solely focused on revenge porn, the older non-profit organization ''Without My Consent'' provides legal resources related to it and lobbies to protect the privacy and free speech rights of online harassment victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24lede-t.html|title=How to unmask the Internet's vilest characters|first=Emily|last=Bazelon|publisher=New York Times Magazine|date=2011-04-22|accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, there has also been a website ''Women Against Revenge Porn'', calling itself "not an organization or a business", which has been cited as an advocacy group for people exposed in revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/revenge-porn-the-ugly-side-of-sexting-20131122-2y1ns.html|title=Revenge porn the ugly side of sexting|first=Miles|last=Godfrey|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2013-11-23|accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, Elisa D'Amico and David Bateman, partners at the law firm [[K&amp;L Gates]], launched the Cyber Civil Rights Legal Project (CCRLP), a project offering free legal help to victims of revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Law Firm Founds Project to Fight 'Revenge Porn'|url = https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/law-firm-founds-project-to-fight-revenge-porn/?_r=0|website = DealBook|access-date = 2016-01-28|first = Matthew|last = Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BigLaw firm fights 'revenge porn' with pro bono advocacy; suit alleges copyright infringement|url = http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/biglaw_firm_fights_revenge_porn_with_pro_bono_advocacy_suit_alleges_copyrig|website = ABA Journal|access-date = 2016-01-28|first = Debra|last = Cassens Weiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To better facilitate the introduction of relevant legislation, some anti-revenge porn activists have called upon others in their community to use gender-neutral language more often when discussing the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialchangenyu.com/revenge-porn-legislation-activists-and-the-lessons-from-sexual-harassment-jurisprudence-gender-neutrality-public-perceptions-and-implications/#_ftn1|title=Revenge Porn Legislation Activists and the Lessons from Sexual Harassment Jurisprudence: Gender Neutrality, Public Perceptions and Implications|first=Amy|last=Lai|publisher=NYU|year=2015|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "revenge porn" itself has also come under fire. The CCRI for instance prefers the term "nonconsensual pornography".&lt;ref name=CCRImission&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=About|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/welcome/|publisher=CCRI|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In analogy with "child sexual abuse images" being the preferred term for child pornography, McGlynn and Rackley proposed "image-based sexual abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGlynn | first1 = Clare | last2 = Rackley | first2 = Erika | title = Not ‘revenge porn', but abuse: let's call it image-based sexual abuse (blog) | journal = Inherently Brief | volume = 41 | publisher = Postgraduate Students, [[Durham University|Gender &amp; Law at Durham (GLAD)]] via [[WordPress]]| date = 15 February 2016 | url = https://inherentlyhuman.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/not-revenge-porn-but-abuse-lets-call-it-image-based-sexual-abuse/ | ref = none | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with journalist [[Sarah Jeong]], they have argued that it is harmful to associate revenge porn with pornography which revolves around consent. Jeong also considers it a mistake for activists to focus on revenge porn itself as the main problem, rather than the underlying culture which leads to its subjects being socially ostracized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Snap Judgment {{!}} Bitch Media|url = https://bitchmedia.org/article/snap-judgment-revenge-porn|website = Bitch Media|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], an electronic petition was started in March 2017 that called upon the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly to consider criminalizing the non-consensual disclosure of sexual images and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/petition-calls-on-act-government-to-introduce-revenge-porn-laws-20170322-gv4gaj.html|title=Calls for ACT government to introduce 'revenge porn' laws|first=Michael|last=Gorey|date=23 March 2017|work=canberratimes.com.au|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A.C.T Legislative Assembly consequently passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, of intimate photos and videos on 16 August 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Legislation==
Laws banning revenge pornography have been slow to emerge.&lt;ref name= W347&gt;{{harvnb|Citron &amp; Franks|2014|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributing factors include a lack of understanding about the gravity of the problem, free speech concerns,&lt;ref name=greenfield&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenfield|first1=Rebecca|title=Why Isn't Revenge Porn Illegal Everywhere?|url=http://www.thewire.com/technology/2013/08/why-isnt-revenge-porn-illegal-everywhere/68758/|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=The Wire (The Atlantic)|date=27 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; belief that existing law provides adequate protection,&lt;ref name=greenfield/&gt; a lack of care, historically, for women's issues, and "misunderstandings of [[First Amendment]] doctrine" (Citron &amp; Franks).&lt;ref name=W347/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Citron|first1=Danielle|title=Debunking the First Amendment Myths Surrounding Revenge Porn Laws|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellecitron/2014/04/18/debunking-the-first-amendment-myths-surrounding-revenge-porn-laws/|website=forbes.com|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] have drawn attention to the implications for free speech if legislation is too broad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Revenge Porn' Bill Needs Changes|url=http://www.acluct.org/updates/revenge-porn-bill-needs-changes/|website=acluct.org|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Franks|first1=Mary Anne|title=The ACLU's Frat House Take on 'Revenge Porn'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-anne-franks/the-aclus-frat-house-take_b_6980146.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arizona"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mullin|first1=Joe|title=Arizona makes deal with ACLU, won't enforce bad law on "revenge porn"|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/arizona-makes-deal-with-aclu-wont-enforce-bad-law-on-revenge-porn/|website=arstechnica.com|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/victims_are_taking_on_revenge_porn_websites_for_posting_photos_they_didnt_c|title=Victims are taking on 'revenge porn' websites for posting photos they didn't consent to|first=Lorelei|last=Laird|publisher=ABA Journal|date=2013-11-01|accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

===Australia ===
In November 2014, the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] modified its existing [[sexting]] laws.

===North America===

====Canada====
In 2014, with the passage of the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, Canada criminalized the "non-consensual distribution of intimate images" that were made under a "reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]".&lt;ref name=Laws_Lois/&gt;

====United States ====
[[Tort]], [[Privacy law|privacy]], [[copyright]], and criminal laws offer remedies against people who submit revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Hartzog, [http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/05/how-fight-revenge-porn "How to Fight Revenge Porn"], Stanford Law Center for Internet and Society (May 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doug Barry, [http://jezebel.com/5993942/a-new-bill-in-florida-would-make-non+consensual-revenge-porn-a-felony "A New Bill in Florida Would Make Non-Consensual ‘Revenge Porn’ a Felony"], ''[[Jezebel]]'', 7 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty states have laws against revenge porn as of August 2018.&lt;ref name="cybercivilrights.org"/&gt;
For example, New Jersey law prohibits both the capture and the distribution of sexually explicit photographs and films by any person, "knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so" and without the subjects' consent.{{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=14|section=9|subsection=b|citeonly=true}} The law was used to prosecute [[Dharun Ravi]], the [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] student who distributed webcam footage of his roommate Tyler Clementi engaging in sexual activity, after which [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Clementi killed himself]].&lt;ref&gt;Megan DiMarco and Alexi Friedman, [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/dharun_ravi_sentenced_for_bias.html "Live Blog: Dharun Ravi Sentenced to 30 Days in Jail"], ''The Star-Ledger'' (May 12, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The law has also been used to prosecute several men who allegedly distributed revenge porn of their ex-girlfriends.&lt;ref&gt;Marueen O'Connor, [http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/08/crusading-sisterhood-of-revenge-porn-victims.html "The Crusading Sisterhood of Revenge-Porn Victims"], ''[[New York Magazine]]'' (Aug. 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Anne Franks]], a law professor and constitutional scholar who drafted the model legislation and advised legislators in the majority of the above states, emphasizes that many of these laws are still deeply flawed.&lt;ref name= Huff4&gt;{{cite web|last1=Franks|first1=Mary Anne|title=How to Defeat 'Revenge Porn': First, Recognize It's About Privacy, Not Revenge|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-anne-franks/how-to-defeat-revenge-porn_b_7624900.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives from the Department of Justice, California's Office of the Attorney General, 50 major technology companies, victim advocates, and legislative and law enforcement leaders joined together in 2015 to form a Cyber Exploitation Working Group, and have announced the creation of a working hub "to combat so-called cyber exploitation – the practice of anonymously posting explicit photographs of others online, often to extort money from the victims."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = California teams with tech firms to fight cyber exploitation|url = http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-1015-cyber-exploitation-20151015-story.html|website = [[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate = 2015-10-20|date = 2015-10-15|last = [[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Criminal prosecutions =====
Several well-known revenge porn websites, including ''IsAnyoneUp'' and the ''Texxxan'', have been taken down in response to actual or threatened legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Goode, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/us/victims-push-laws-to-end-online-revenge-posts.html?pagewanted=all "Victims Push Laws to End Online Revenge Posts"], ''New York Times'' 23 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The former was investigated by the FBI after anti-revenge porn activist [[Charlotte Laws]] uncovered a hacking scheme associated with the website. Indictments for fifteen felonies were handed down under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] in January 2014 for the site owner and his accomplices, and the trial was initially set to begin in November 2014 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=2014FBITime&gt;{{cite news|last=Roy|first=Jessica|title=Revenge-Porn King Hunter Moore Indicted on Federal Charges|url=http://time.com/1703/revenge-porn-king-hunter-moore-indicted-by-fbi/|publisher=Time|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hunter Moore]], the owner of ''IsAnyoneUp'' pleaded guilty to hacking and identity theft in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/revenge-porn-kingpin-hunter-moore-pleads-guilty-faces-jail-n313061|title=Revenge Porn Kingpin Hunter Moore Pleads Guilty, Faces Jail|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore was sentenced to two and a half years in prison on December 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/27/is-this-the-end-of-revenge-porn.html|title=Is This the End of Revenge Porn?|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/12/03/revenge-porn-purveyor-hunter-moore-is-sentenced-to-prison/|title=Revenge porn purveyor Hunter Moore is sentenced to prison|first=Abby|last=Ohlheiser|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2015-12-03|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, California Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]] charged Kevin Bollaert, who ran the revenge porn website ''UGotPosted'', with 31 felony counts, including [[extortion]] and [[identity theft]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-arrest-revenge-porn-website-operator "Press Release: Attorney General Kamala D.

Casey Meyering, the operator of revenge porn website ''WinByState'', was arrested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/revenge-porn-website-operator-sentenced-to-years/article_fd4ea4fe-16c7-517c-a763-115e92f66cdf.html|title='Revenge porn' website operator sentenced to 3 years|author=Sean Scully|work=Napa Valley Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Oklahoma in 2014 and extradited to Napa County. Meyering's website invited users to submit nude photos of ex-girlfriends and other women, with the photos categorized by state. He would then make the women featured on his website pay $250 to have their photos taken down. There were about 400 images of California women on the website, including at least one in Napa Valley, where California Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]] had filed the case. After originally pleading not guilty, on May 8, 2015, the 28-year-old man pleaded no contest to one count of [[extortion]], three counts of attempted extortion, and one count of [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment as of early June 2015.

=====Tort and privacy law=====
States without specific laws about revenge porn have seen lawsuits alleging [[invasion of privacy]], [[privacy laws|public disclosure of private fact]] and [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] against the individuals who uploaded the images.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/138909420/Revenge-Porn-Complaint-Holly-Jacobs-vs-Ryan-Seay Complaint in ''Jacobs v.

=====Communications Decency Act §230=====
Some revenge porn lawsuits have named service providers and websites as defendants alongside individuals who uploaded the images.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/121463764/Class-Action-Suit-Against-GoDaddy-com-Texxxan-com ''Toups v.

=====First Amendment and anti-SLAPP=====
Some [[free speech]] advocates object to revenge porn laws on [[First Amendment]] grounds, citing the fact that US laws restricting expression have a history of being overturned.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2853347803518998660&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''United States v.

===Europe===
Many European countries have broad privacy statutes that may be applicable to revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rotenberg &amp; Jacobs|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; France also criminalizes the willful violation of the intimate private life of another by "transmitting the picture of a person who is within a private place, without the consent of the person concerned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archive.equal-jus.eu/181/1/French_penal_code.pdf | title = French Penal Code Article 226-1 | date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German [[High Court]] made a May 2014 ruling that intimate photographs of partners should be deleted if the partner so requests.&lt;ref name=2014IndependentGrayling/&gt;

====Malta====
A law criminalising revenge porn in Malta entered into force in November 2016. Article 208E of the Maltese Criminal Code punishes whoever, with an intent to cause distress, emotional harm or harm of any nature, discloses a private sexual photograph or film without the consent of the person or persons displayed or depicted in such photograph or film. Such person would, on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term of up to two years or to a fine of not less than €,3000 and not more than €5,000, or to both such imprisonment and fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-04-17/local-news/Government-does-not-exclude-updating-current-laws-on-suits-for-pain-and-suffering-6736173075|title=Government does not exclude updating current laws on suits for pain and suffering|last=Grech|first=Helena|date=17 April 2017|website=|publisher=The Malta Independent|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=April 2017}}

In 2012, the English singer-songwriter [[Tulisa (singer)|Tulisa Contostavlos]] obtained an injunction preventing the distribution of a sex-tape of her and a former lover that had been published on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2012/850.html|title=Tulisa Contostavlos v Michael Mendahun and others|author=|date=29 March 2012|work=bailii.org|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9155127/Tulisa-sex-tape-removed-after-lawyers-obtain-injunction.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Tulisa 'sex tape' removed after lawyers obtain injunction | date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was set to include considerable damages, but was settled out of court before it could be considered.&lt;ref name = "House of Lords report"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Triumphant Tulisa settles legal action against ex over sex tape publication|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2172471/Tulisa-Contostavlos-settles-legal-action-ex-Justin-Edwards-sex-tape.html|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=12 July 2012|location=London|first1=Sarah|last1=Bull|first2=Donna|last2=McConnell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, UK charities including [[The National Stalking Helpline]], [[Women's Aid]], and the [[UK Safer Internet Centre]] reported increased use of revenge porn websites.&lt;ref name=2014IndependentGrayling/&gt; Women's Aid Charity Chief Executive Polly Neate stated, "To be meaningful, any attempt to tackle revenge porn must also take account of all other kinds of psychological abuse and [[controlling behaviour]], and revenge porn is just another form of [[coercive control]]. That control is central to domestic violence, which is why we're campaigning for all psychological abuse and coercive control to be criminalised". In July [[Chris Grayling]], the [[Secretary of State for Justice]], announced plans to "take appropriate action" to address revenge porn in Britain.&lt;ref name=2014IndependentGrayling&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=Jack|title=Revenge porn: What is it and how widespread is the problem?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/what-is-revenge-porn-9580251.html|website=www.independent.co.uk|publisher=Independent UK|accessdate=7 July 2014|location=London|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A House of Lords Committee, in a report on social media and the law, subsequently called for clarification from the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|DPP]] as to when revenge porn becomes a crime.&lt;ref name = "House of Lords report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social media and criminal offences – Communications Committee Contents|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/ldcomuni/37/3704.htm|publisher=[[House of Lords]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Revenge porn' laws must be clearer, say Lords|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jul/29/revenge-porn-laws-must-be-clearer-say-lords|work=[[The Guardian]]|agency=Press Association|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6T1o04Z9x?url=http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jul/29/revenge-porn-laws-must-be-clearer-say-lords|archivedate=2 October 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015 the [[Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015]], which has a specific amendment dealing with such actions, received [[Royal Assent]]. Section 33 of the Act makes it an offence in England and Wales to disclose private sexual photographs and films without the consent of the individual depicted and with the intent to cause distress. There is a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31429026|title='Revenge porn' illegal under new law in England and Wales|work=BBC News | date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/2/section/33/enacted#section-33-1-a|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2015, a seminar was held in [[Westminster]] on the new legislation. The seminar was organised by the [[Oxford Human Rights Hub]] and co-hosted with the law firm [[McAllister Olivarius]], the [[End Violence Against Women Coalition]], [[The University of Durham]], and [[The University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Call to extend revenge porn laws|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3052592/Call-extend-revenge-porn-laws.html|website=dailymail.co.uk|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Event: Revenge Porn: The New Law|url=http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/revenge-porn-the-new-law/|website=ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk|publisher=[[Oxford Human Rights Hub]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seminar called for the law to be extended to cover activities such as [[upskirting]].

In June 2015 it was reported that [[BriaAndChrissy|Chrissy Chambers]], a [[YouTube]] star from the United States, was pursuing a civil suit against her British ex-boyfriend who posted sexually-explicit videos taken without her knowledge or consent to [[Facebook]] where they were [[viral video|repeatedly shared]]. Chambers chose to pursue a civil case as the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 does not apply retroactively to content posted prior to its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kleeman|first1=Jenny|title=US woman pursues ex-boyfriend in landmark UK revenge-porn action|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/03/us-woman-pursues-ex-boyfriend-in-landmark-uk-revenge-porn-action|website=theguardian.com|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Phoebe|title=YouTube star Chrissy Chambers: 'Discovering revenge porn video devastated me|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/youtube-star-chrissy-chambers-discovering-revenge-porn-video-devastated-me-10307182.html|website=standard.co.uk|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 2015 (the date that section 33 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 came into force) and December 2015 the number of reported incidents of revenge pornography in England and Wales was 1,160. However, 61% of them resulted in no action being taken and the number of people prosecuted for disclosing private sexual images during the legislation's first year was 206.

=====Scotland=====
In Scotland, revenge porn became a specific offence in April 2016 when the Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Act came into effect.

=====Northern Ireland=====
In Northern Ireland, revenge porn was made a crime in February 2016 through the amendment of an existing law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revenge porn: More than 200 prosecuted under new law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37278264|date=6 September 2016|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minors==
If the video or images in question are of individuals who are minors, this can lead to legal action for [[child pornography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/technology&amp;id=6555650 |title=Sexting teens can go too far |work=Philadelphia News |date=2008-12-14 |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has happened in non-revenge porn related cases involving [[sexting]].&lt;ref name=2013CaNPSelfiePorn&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Karen|title=Child pornography laws ‘too harsh' to deal with minors sexting photos without consent, experts say|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/11/16/child-pornography-laws-too-harsh-to-deal-with-minors-sexting-photos-without-consent-experts-say/|publisher=National Post News – Canada|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CnetSelfiePorn&gt;{{cite web|last=Matyszczyk|first=Chris|title=Teen charged with child porn for allegedly tweeting nude selfies|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/teen-charged-with-child-porn-for-allegedly-tweeting-nude-selfies/|publisher=Cnet.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prenuptial agreements==
{{main|Prenuptial agreement}}
Some couples are drafting "social media" [[prenuptial agreement]]s,&lt;ref name=2014ABCSocialMedia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Effron|first1=Lauren|title= I Love You, You're Perfect, but Watch What You Facebook: Social Media Prenups|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/love-perfect-watch-facebook-social-media-prenups/story?id=23977608&amp;singlePage=true|website=abcnews.go.com|publisher=ABC News, Good Morning America|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may include provisions relating to revenge porn.&lt;ref name=2014AVNPrenup&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title='Revenge Porn' Increasingly Added to Marriage Prenups|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/Revenge-Porn-Increasingly-Added-to-Marriage-Prenups-563939.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clauses may state that couples agree not to share photos or posts that are likely to harm a spouse's professional reputation.&lt;ref name=2014ABCSocialMedia/&gt;

==In other media==
The 2017 independent film ''[[From Jennifer (2017 film)|#FromJennifer]]'' tackles the subject of revenge porn. In the film, the main character's acting career is derailed by an ex-boyfriend who posts a video of them online without her consent. When the video goes viral, her manager drops her as a client, and the ensuing humiliation she suffers leads her toward a path of destruction and counter-revenge.

'''''Ripley Bogle''''' is the [[debut novel]] of Northern Irish author [[Robert McLiam Wilson]], published in 1989 in the UK although not until 1998 in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readinggroupguides.com/guides_R/ripley_bogle2.asp ReadingGroupGuides.com – Robert McLiam Wilson interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Written when he was 26 it is arguably his most acclaimed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/robert-mcliam-wilson-215185 Robert McLiam Wilson biography]&lt;/ref&gt; winning the [[Rooney Prize]] and the [[Hughes Prize]] in 1989, and a [[Betty Trask Award]] and the [[Irish Book Awards]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/ripley-bogle/9780749394653&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of the novel are autobiographical; the author himself was born in [[Belfast]], attended [[Cambridge University]], dropped out and became homeless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405192446_chunk_g978140519244617_ss1-8 ''The Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Fiction Volume I: Twentieth-Century British and Irish Fiction : McLiam Wilson, Robert'' by Matthew McGuire]&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as a significant novel, producing "both a re-evaluation of Northern Irish literary identity, and an alternative perspective on [[the Troubles]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=26AgoZ4TiGkC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=ripley+bogle+falls+road&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m4pfyI4oOd&amp;sig=_B0QCjjth_t8eYjIHjjZaqimtxk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RC2lUKb9JbCayQHY3oHYAg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ripley%20bogle%20falls%20road&amp;f=false ''The Cambridge Introduction to Modern British Fiction, 1950–2000'' by Dominic Head, pages 139–140 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot introduction==
The novel is set over four days in London, where homeless 22-year-old Ripley Bogle aimlessly wanders the streets and, with angry satire, reflects on his life, directly addressing the reader. There are frequent flashbacks to growing up on the [[Turf Lodge]] estate in West Belfast during The Troubles, his move to Cambridge University and his subsequent decline into homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/bibdbs/pelaschiar3.htm "Writing the North – The Contemporary Novel in Northern Ireland", by Laura Pelaschiar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
*"An astonishing performance, fluent, profound, angry. It made me laugh; it made me think; it made me envious." – ''[[The Irish Times]]''&lt;ref name=litpub&gt;[http://thelitpub.com/featured-books/ripley-bogle/ For my money, Robert McLiam Wilson has written the best novel to come out of Northern Ireland in the last 30 years]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Ripley Bogle is probably one of the best Irish novels to have appeared in the last decade. It goes straight for the jugular." ''[[The Times]]''&lt;ref name=litpub/&gt;
*[[Zachary Leader]] in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' compares the lead character novel to John Self and Charles Highway in [[Martin Amis]]'s ''[[Money (novel)|Money]]'' and ''[[The Rachel Papers]]'': "''Ripley Bogle'' isn't as good a novel as ''The Rachel Papers'', let alone ''Money'', but its author has talent and nerve". He goes on to say "Wilson is a writer worth watching – for all the present novel's indebtedness and clamouring, bumptious self-regard."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v11/n12/zachary-leader/down-and-out-in-london-and-amis Zachary Leader reviews ''Ripley Bogle'' by Robert McLiam Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Liam Callanan in the ''[[New York Times]]'' writes "The shadow of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' looms large throughout the novel, since Bogle's wisecracking ramblings around London over the course of a long weekend draw a clear parallel to Bloom's wanderings through Dublin, almost to the point of parody." and concludes "By detailing the painful minutiae of homeless existence with aching accuracy, Bogle succeeds in making the impersonal hostility of street life in London seem almost as cruel as the intimate terror of Belfast. He is unsettlingly deadpan in his descriptions of one horrific episode after another, but making readers uncomfortable seems to be precisely Wilson's aim. What better way to evoke a world of senseless, skittish violence than to disconcert the reader with a challenging – and puzzling – narrator? And what better way to leave the reader truly puzzled than by tossing in a series of gratuitous twists at the end of the novel?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/17/reviews/980517.17callant.html Bad Scenes in Belfast and London]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage adaptations==
It was adapted for the stage in 1997 at [[Theatre503]] when it was directed by [[Richard Hurst]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/play/ripley-bogle/L1399491300/ UK Theatre Web]&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2005 when adapted by actor Sean O Tarpaigh (at Camden People's Theatre).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/8081/ripley-bogle The Stage review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fringereport.com/0505ripleybogle.php Ripley Bogle Verdict: Homeless man drama]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:White soundpony logo.jpg|thumb|The SOUNDPONY Bar, Tulsa OK]]
The '''SOUNDPONY''' is a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] located in the [[Neighborhoods of Tulsa, Oklahoma#Tulsa Arts District|Tulsa Arts District]] of downtown [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].  The venue is known for its live music, and sponsorship of cycling and other sporting events.  It is located two doors down from the world-famous Cain’s Ballroom, 3 blocks from the Brady Theater, and 0.5&amp;nbsp;mi from the BOk center arena.

Owned by Mike Wozniak and Josh Gifford, the bar was one of the first businesses, along with Caz’s and McNellie’s, to initiate the revitalization of Tulsa’s downtown nightlife in the mid-2000s.  It was selected best venue for original live music from Urban Tulsa’s “Best of Tulsa” in 2008, 2009, 2010,&lt;ref name="UTW2010"&gt;Urban Tulsa Weekly. [http://www.urbantulsa.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A31177] July 14, 2010. Mentions winning for three years straight.&lt;/ref&gt; and  2011,&lt;ref name="UTW2011"&gt;Urban Tulsa Weekly. [http://www.urbantulsa.com/abot2011.pdf] July 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the club has been featured in issues of ''[[Southern Living]]'', ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'',&lt;ref name="spin"&gt;Spin Magazine. [http://www.indigenousforum.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=1081&amp;sid=78130d130fc4410553b0af9497a6fec3] April, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Reuters]]'',&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;[http://blogs.reuters.com/events/2007/05/22/birthday-milestone-tulsa-style/ Reuters Events blog]&lt;/ref&gt; and the China Shop blog.&lt;ref name="cblog"&gt;China Shop blog. [http://www.chinashopmag.com/2009/08/soundpony/] A good story about the bar with great pics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features ==
Located at 409 N. Main St. in Tulsa, The SOUNDPONY is open, as its door says, at “3-ish” until close around 2am.  It sports a shot-gun style layout of 1500 sq feet, not including a back outdoor patio with a view of the Tulsa skyline.  Featuring a full bar, the bar also carries Marshall (Tulsa), Coop (OKC), and Boulevard (KC) beers on tap, a large bottled beer selection, darts, retro video games, and a turntable and mic behind the bar, which is used for Tuesday’s trivia night. Sometimes the bar facilitates consignment bike sales.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;Interview with the owners. May 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
Mike Wozniak and Josh Gifford met in Norman where they worked at Chili’s circa 1994.  After both moving to Tulsa, they bartendered together at Empire Bar and the Brook, where they aspired to have their own establishment so that they could have a venue for their own creative endeavors in music and video.  Eventually, they started a company called Creative Juices that made wedding videos and art.

To finance the bar, they took out personal lines of credit that were secured by Josh’s life insurance policy and Mike’s house. Doug Dijarne at Bank of Oklahoma handled the financing.  Contractor Mickey Payne found the space near Cain’s, noting it would be a good spot because the ticket line from Cain’s often stretches past the space that was to become the bar.

Once money and name were in place, Mike and Josh enlisted the help of Duvall Architects (the firm that also designed Vintage 1740 and the Dust Bowl in Tulsa) and contractor Mickey Payne of Happy Hammer, along with Roger Condray welder who did much of the bar’s fixtures and signs.  Artist Anne-Marie Foy did the iconic SOUNDPONY moss sign inside the bar.

In addition to the short-lived band, the SOUNDPONY race team existed before the bar, though they were incorporated in July, 2005.

The Bar opened May 2006 and tends to attract a diverse and varied crowd.  As Mike states, “The bar has changed and evolved over time in a very organic way.  Just like we envisioned.”&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

==The Name==
People often wonder how the bar got its name.  One year when Mike was in Vail, he called Josh who was at the moment playing music with a band back in Tulsa.  Someone yelled out, “We are the fabulous SOUNDPONY.”  Eventually, drawing on the myth, the word got tied to the idea of a good horse, riding, racing, and then bikes, any form of alternate transportation.  As Josh put it, “Legend has it that Johnny Rotten, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, James Earl Jones, Conan, Bob Newhart, and a horse had an orgy and out blasted the SOUNDPONY.”

== Sponsorships and enthusiasts==
The SOUNDPONY is known for sponsoring cycling, art, music.  Bands that have performed at the Pony include [[Marbin]], Pontiak, Klondike 5, Sweet Baby Jaysus, The Eastern Sea and Oilhouse.  The bar's music consists of everything from Soul and Punk to DJs, Jazz, and Hip-Hop. but it is best known for its indie music scene.

Athletes like Floyd Landis, Brad Huff, and Ivan Stevic, along with musicians like Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney of the Black Keys and Georgia Hubley, Ira Kaplan, James McNew of Yo La Tengo, can regularly be seen at the Pony after events and shows.

'''''Santa Sangre''''' ('''''Holy Blood''''') is a 1989 Mexican-Italian [[Avant-garde film|avant-garde]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] and written by Jodorowsky along with [[Claudio Argento]] and Roberto Leoni. It stars [[Axel Jodorowsky]], [[Adan Jodorowsky]], Teo Jodorowsky, [[Blanca Guerra]], [[Thelma Tixou]] and [[Guy Stockwell]]. Divided into both a flashback and a flash-forward, the film, which is set in Mexico, tells the story of Fenix, a boy who grew up in a [[circus]], and his life through both adolescence and early adulthood.

==Plot==
The film starts with a naked figure sitting in a tree in what looks like a [[History of psychiatric institutions|mental asylum]]. Nurses come out to him, bringing a plate of conventional food and also one of a raw fish. As they try to coax him off of his perch, it is the fish that persuades him to come down. As the nurses get him to put on some overalls, the viewer sees that he has a tattoo of a phoenix on his chest.

===Flashback===
The film flashes back into Fenix's childhood, which he spent performing as a "child magician" in a circus run by his father Orgo, the knife-thrower, and his mother Concha, a trapeze artist and aerialist. The circus crew also includes, among others, a tattooed woman, who acts as the object of Orgo's knife-throwing feats, her adopted daughter Alma (a hearing-impaired, voiceless mime and tightrope walker whom Fenix adores, with the feeling mutual), Fenix's dwarf friend Aladin, a pack of clowns and a small elephant. Orgo carries on a very public flirtation with the tattooed woman, and their knife-throwing act is heavily sexualized.

Concha is also the leader of a religious cult that considers, as its patron saint, a little girl who was raped and had her arms cut off by two brothers. Their church is about to be bulldozed at the behest of the owner of the land, and the followers make one last stand against the police and the bulldozers. A Roman Catholic [[Monsignor]] drives into the conflict, saying that he will prevent its demolition, but after he enters the temple to inspect it he deems it blasphemous and unworthy (the girl worshipped is no saint, he says, and the supposed pool of "holy blood" at the center of the edifice contains just red paint), so the demolition is carried out. Fenix leads Concha back to the circus, where she finds out about Orgo's affair, but Orgo, being also a [[Hypnosis|hypnotist]], puts Concha in a trance and rapes her.

The circus elephant then dies, much to Fenix's grief, and a public funeral is conducted, in which the elephant is paraded through the city inside a giant casket. The casket is then dropped into the city dump, where scavengers open it up and proceed to carve up the elephant and take away the [[Elephant meat|meat]]. Orgo consoles his son by tattooing a spread-eagled phoenix onto his chest, identical to the one on his own chest, using a knife dipped in red ink. This tattoo, Orgo says, will make Fenix a man.

Later on, Concha, during her trapeze act, sees Orgo and the tattooed woman sneak out of the big top. She chases after them and, seeing them sexually engaged, pours a bottle of [[sulphuric acid]] onto Orgo's genitals. Orgo retaliates by cutting off both her arms (much like the girl previously venerated). He then walks into the street and slits his own throat. Fenix witnesses this, locked inside a trailer. He then sees the tattooed woman driving off with Alma.

===Flash-forward===
Back in the present, Fenix is taken out to a movie theater, along with other patients, most of whom have [[Down syndrome]]. A pimp intercepts them and persuades them to take [[cocaine]] and follow him to meet an overweight prostitute. Fenix then spots the Tattooed Woman, who is now a prostitute, and becomes filled with rage. Back in the asylum, Fenix's armless mother Concha calls out for him from the street and he escapes by climbing down a rope from his cell window. The Tattooed Woman is shown trying to prostitute Alma, who runs away and sleeps on the roof of a truck. The Tattooed Woman is then mutilated and killed by the hands of unseen woman.

Mother and son go on to perform an act whereby he stands behind her and moves his arms so that they appear to be Concha's arms that are moving. But Concha soon starts to use her son's hands to kill those women whom she deems a threat to her, including a young performer that he kills with a knife-throw, as well as a cross-dressing wrestler, whom he slashes with a Japanese [[katana]] sword. A dream sequence subsequently shows that he has killed many more women, all of whose memories haunt him.

Alma finds Fenix and together they plan to run away from Concha and her house. She tries to force Fenix to murder Alma as well, but, after a struggle, he manages to plunge a knife into Concha's stomach. Yet she does not die but taunts him by saying she will always be inside him as she vanishes before his eyes. Through a quick series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Concha actually died after being maimed by Orgo, and that Fenix has actually kept a mannequin of his armless mother for performing on stage and at home, which also now appears in reality to be a thoroughly dilapidated house. He destroys the home-made temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his imaginary childhood friends, Aladin and the clowns.

Alma proceeds to lead Fenix outside the house where police are waiting and order them to put up their hands. As they both comply, Fenix watches his own hands in awe as he does so. And Fenix's realization that he has finally regained control of them brings him joy and peace.

==Release==
''Santa Sangre'' did not receive a [[wide release]] in the U.S. since its original premiere, only screening at a few theaters familiar with Jodorowsky's previous work. On January 25, 2011, Severin Film gave the film a release on both [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] with more than "five hours of exclusive extras".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Santa Sangre [Blu-ray] |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004B32532 |title=Santa Sangre [Blu-ray&amp;#93;: Guy Stockwell, Blanca Guerra, Axel Jodorowsky, Alejandro Jodorowsky: Movies &amp; TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UK DVD from [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]] was released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0000CERU3 |title=Santa Sangre [1990&amp;#93; [DVD&amp;#93;: Amazon.co.uk: Axel Jodorowsky, Blanca Guerra, Guy Stockwell, Thelma Tixou, Sabrina Dennison, Adan Jodorowsky, Faviola Elenka Tapia, Teo Jodorowsky, María de Jesús Aranzabal, Jesús Juárez, Sergio Bustamante, Gloria Contreras, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Angelo Iacono, Anuar Badin, Claudio Argento, René Cardona Jr., Roberto Leoni: Film &amp; TV |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/266/year/1989.html | title=Festival de Cannes: Santa Sangre | accessdate=2009-08-02 | work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally was critically well received, eventually being ranked 476th on ''[[Empire magazine]]'s'' 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.&lt;ref name="empireonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/5.asp |title=Empire's 500 Greatest Movies Of All Time |publisher=Empireonline.com |date=2006-12-05 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], it was originally [[List of NC-17 rated films|rated NC-17]] for "several scenes of extremely explicit violence". However, an edited version was released with an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] for "bizarre, graphic violence and sensuality, and for drug content".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
''Santa Sangre'' has received predominantly positive reviews, with a reviewer from the British [[Film 4]] describing it as "One of Jodorowsky’s finest films" which "resonates with all the disturbing power of a clammy nightmare filtered through the hallucinatory lens of 1960s psychedelia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1989/santa-sangre |title=Santa Sangre |publisher=Film4 |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a positive review, and said that he believed it carried the moral message of genuinely opposing [[evil]], rather than celebrating it like most contemporary horror films. Ebert described it as "a horror film, one of the greatest, and after waiting patiently through countless Dead Teenager Movies, I am reminded by Alejandro Jodorowsky that true psychic horror is possible on the screen – horror, poetry, surrealism, psychological pain and wicked humor, all at once."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030831/REVIEWS08/308310301/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Santa Sangre (1989)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of its critical success, ''Santa Sangre'' ranks 476th on ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.&lt;ref name="empireonline.com"/&gt;

The film holds an 85% rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 39 reviews; the consensus states: "Those unfamiliar with Alejandro Jodorowsky's style may find it overwhelming, but ''Santa Sangre'' is a provocative psychedelic journey featuring the director's signature touches of violence, vulgarity, and an oddly personal moral center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/santa_sangre/ | title=Santa Sangre (Holy Blood) | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1965">Much of the British independent film, television and [[post-production]] industry is based in London's [[Soho]] area. Many of the people who work in the industry form a village-like community, with the various companies hiring and re-hiring one another's employees, and, like many other villages, having a lively social life that revolves around [[gossip]] and the eighty or so [[pub]]s in Soho.

Post-production companies in Soho include:
* [[Ascent Media]]
* [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]
* [[Film Cut Post Production]]
* [[Framestore CFC]]
* [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest Post-Production]]
* [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]]
* [[Moving Picture Company]]
* [[Evolutions Television]]
* [[Reliance MediaWorks Ltd]]
* [[Rushes (company)|Rushes]]
* [[The Yard]]

==Locations==
The above listed "Cinesite" company is near London's [[Piccadilly Circus]], though there is also a non-graphical department based at [[Pinewood Studios]], who made some of mechanical props for the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films, amongst other productions.

"The Mill" is at the western end of [[Dean Street]] and is in a white 3-storey building with a purple door. Whereas a rival Co "Framestore-CFC" is just a minutes walk away along the same road, being midway along, on a corner, with a large windowed frontage along its ground-floor.

Also, though not media related, but [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] related, is [[Sony]]'s PlayStation game creation department of Europe, which is also located in London's [[Soho]], specifically off [[Golden Square]], the latter having a sleeping-giant sculpture that is opposite the front door of [[SCE London Studio|SCE]]. This [[video-game studio]] is housed in a large stone-built  building with a brass [[plaquette|plaque]] out front.

'''Television in [[Sri Lanka]]''' dates back to 1979. Television broadcasting, like other forms of media in the country, is generally divided along linguistic lines with state and private media operators providing services in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[English language|English]] languages.

==History==
Sri Lanka didn't have any television until 1979. Businessmen Anil Wijewardena and Shan Wickremasinghe established the country's first TV station [[Independent Television Network]] which started broadcasting on 15 April 1979.&lt;ref name=ACH08&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian Communication Handbook 2008|year=2008|publisher=[[Asian Media Information and Communication Centre]], Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, [[Nanyang Technological University]]|location=Singapore|isbn=9789814136105|pages=446–459|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wo9YWvrWFcIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Indrajit Banerjee, Stephen Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new station remained ''independent'' for less than two months as the [[Sri Lankan government|government]] took control of it on 5 June 1979 following a dispute with [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] [[J. R. Jayewardene]].&lt;ref name=ACH08/&gt; Sri Lanka's second [[state-owned]] TV station - [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation]] (SLRC) - was established by the ''Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act No. 6 of 1982''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SRI LANKA RUPAVAHINI CORPORATION|url=http://www.lawnet.lk/section.php?file=http://www.lawnet.lk/docs/statutes/stats_1956_2006/indexs/Vol2/1982Y0V0C6A.html|publisher=LawNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; SLRC started broadcasting on 15 February 1982.&lt;ref name=ACH08/&gt; The Act required the SLRC maintain taste and decency and not to incite crime and disorder or cause religious or public offence.

The government maintained a monopoly on television broadcasting until 1992 when private TV stations were allowed to broadcast but they were to be regulated by the SLRC.&lt;ref name=ACH08/&gt; [[Maharaja Television]] (MTV), a joint venture between [[Capital Maharaja]] and [[Singapore Telecommunications Limited]], was one of the first private TV stations. Since then many new TV stations have started in Sri Lanka. There are also a number of satellite networks and pay per view television networks in Sri Lanka. The national telecommunications provider [[Sri Lanka Telecom]] also launched an [[IPTV]] service in 2008.

{{nihongo|'''''The Street Fighter'''''|激突！殺人拳|''Gekitotsu! Satsujin Ken''}}, literally ''Clash, Killer Fist!'', is a [[Japan]]ese [[martial art]]s [[film]] released in 1974 and produced by [[Toei Company]] Ltd. It was released in the US by [[New Line Cinema]] and became one of the first films to be a commercial success for the distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newline.com/about/shaye.shtml |title=New Line Cinema |website=Newline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Sonny Chiba's `Street Fighter' Unleashed |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=1996-02-09|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-02-09/entertainment/9602090106_1_sonny-chiba-martial-arts-new-line-home-video|accessdate=2011-01-19|first=Donald|last=Liebenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is notable as the first film to receive an X-rating in the United States solely for violence. In the UK it was originally released as ''Kung Fu Streetfighter'', presumably to avoid confusion with the [[Charles Bronson]] movie ''[[Hard Times (1975 film)|Hard Times]]'' which was initially released as ''The Streetfighter'' in the UK.

''The Street Fighter'' inspired two sequels, ''[[Return of the Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[The Street Fighter's Last Revenge]]''. Additionally, the film ''[[Sister Street Fighter]]'' and its sequels is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series of ''The Street Fighter''.  There was another spin-off entitled ''Kozure Satsujin Ken'', which was brought to the US by a different company under the title ''[[Karate Warriors]]''. The [[video game]] ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' has the entire movie available, to watch, on any of the in-game TVs.

The film is in the [[public domain]] and is available for free download at the [[Internet Archive]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Streetfighter_778|title=The Streetfighter (1974)|first=|last=GCDB|accessdate=11 October 2017|publisher=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins as [[Takuma Tsurugi|Takuma (Terry) Tsurugi]] meets the condemned murderer Tateki Shikenbaru (renamed Junjo in the English dub) while disguised as a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]. Tsuguri applies his "oxygen coma punch" to Shikenbaru, causing him to collapse just before he can be executed. As Shikenbaru is rushed to a hospital, Tsurugi and his [[sidekick]] Rakuda (renamed Ratnose in the English dub) ambush the ambulance and free him. As Tsurugi and Rakuda watch the incident on the news, Shikenbaru's brother Gijun and sister Nachi arrive and plead for more time to pay for Tsurugi's help. Outraged, Tsurugi refuses and attacks the siblings. Gijun accidentally kills himself when Tsurugi dodges his flying kick, causing him to go out of a window, and Nachi is sold into [[sexual slavery]] through Renzo Mutaguchi.

Mutaguchi and his associates attempt to hire Tsurugi to kidnap Sarai, the daughter of a recently deceased oil tycoon. Tsurugi refuses after discovering that the gangsters are [[Yakuza]]. He escapes, but the Yakuza gangsters resolve to kill Tsurugi as well as kidnap Sarai. Tsurugi immediately seeks out Sarai, who is being protected at the [[Nippon Seibukan]] [[dojo]] by her uncle, Kendō Masaoka, a Karate master. Tsurugi captures Sarai and challenges the entire dojo to a fight. He brutalizes the rank-and-file students before Masaoka fights him to a standstill--then recognizes him as the half-Chinese son of a karate master he knew long ago. Ultimately, Tsurugi offers to protect Sarai, and Masaoka agrees, against Sarai's protests. Meanwhile, the Yakuza's allies in [[Hong Kong]], led by Kowloon boss Dinsau, recruit Shikenbaru to avenge his siblings by killing Tsurugi.

The gangsters make several attempts to kill Tsurugi before they successfully kidnap Sarai. Tsurugi manages to rescue her, but gets captured himself. Rakuda gives up Sarai's location to save Tsurugi, causing Tsurugi to forsake him. When Tsurugi struggles fighting with a blind samurai working for the Hong Kong gangsters, Rakuda dies by his sword in a reckless attempt at redemption. Tsurugi finally tracks the gangsters down to a shipyard and fights his way through their guards. In the end, Dinsau permits Tsurugi to duel Shikenbaru. Nachi sacrifices herself to give her brother a free shot with a [[Sai (weapon)|sai]], but Tsurugi survives and rips out Shikenbaru's vocal cords. Critically wounded, Tsurugi is helped to his feet by Sarai and Dinsau in the final shot of the film.

==US releases==
''The Street Fighter'' was the first film to receive an [[X-rated|X rating]] solely for violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The 10 Faces of Sonny Chiba (10 Movies)|work= [[DVD Talk]]|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/4769/10-faces-of-sonny-chiba-10-movies-the/|accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= At the movies |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2003-10-30|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A1EFD3C540C738FDDA90994DB404482|accessdate=2011-01-19|first=Dave|last=Kehr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was especially controversial because of a scene in which Tsurugi [[castration|castrates]] a rapist with his bare hands; it is this scene (among others) that reputedly gained the film its 'X' rating.  A similarly violent scene involves Tsurugi delivering a powerful punch to an henchman's head, followed by a cut to an x-ray shot of the skull being completely shattered and blood gushing from the man's mouth. 16 minutes were later edited from the film in order to get an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= PRIVATE LIVES: HOME ENTERTAINMENT, FAMILY ACTIVITIES; VIDEO; 'The Street Fighter' Scratches a Niche; Japanese action star Sonny Chiba is coming to America, and he's bringing blood and gore with him. |newspaper= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1996-01-28|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-28/entertainment/ca-29543_1_street-fighter|accessdate=2011-01-19|first=Donald|last=Liebenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the version initially released on home video by [[MGM/CBS Home Video]] in 1980. Since then, the film was re-released in its entirety. Consequently, the English dub of the uncut version suffers from inconsistencies to the soundtrack quality, as the restored footage was dubbed by a different studio using different voice actors.

In the English dubbed versions of ''The Street Fighter'' and ''Return of The Street Fighter'', Chiba's character is identified as "Terry Sugury" in the credits but dubbed by the voice actors as "Terry Tsurugi". In ''The Street Fighter's Last Revenge'', however, the voice actors call him "Terry Sugury."  ''Rakuda'' is named "Ratnose"; The villain ''Tateki'''s name is also mistranslated as ''Junjō''.

On November 7, 2018, it was announced that [[Shout! Factory]] has acquired the license of all three films in the series for a Blu-ray release on February 19, 2019 via their Shout! Selects line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=24187|title=The Street Fighter Blu-ray Collection|website=blu-ray.com|date=November 7, 2018|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only contains the dub, and its extras are yet to be announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shoutfactory.com/product/the-street-fighter-collection?product_id=6985|title=The Street Fighter Collection + Exclusive Poster|website=[[Shout!

==Influence==
In 1993, the film (and its sequels) received mainstream exposure in North America when they were featured in [[Tony Scott]]'s ''[[True Romance]]'' (written by [[Quentin Tarantino]]), which had the two lead characters spending time at a Sonny Chiba ''Street Fighter'' marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Tarantino for dummies |newspaper= [[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2004-04-17|url= http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/16/1082055642818.html|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= FILM; Charting the Tarantino Universe|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2004-04-11|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E0DD1638F932A25757C0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=Sonny%20Chiba&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2011-01-30|first=Dave|last=Kehr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early performers and venues===
What evidence remains of drama in medieval Birmingham suggests that it was largely religious in its basis. The [[Guild of the Holy Cross]] was established in the 14th century to maintain [[Chantry|chantries]] in the parish church of [[St Martin in the Bull Ring]], and is likely to have presented liturgical drama at its guildhall on [[New Street, Birmingham|New Street]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|p=9}} The street now known as Carr's Lane in Birmingham City Centre was originally called "God's Cart Lane", after the Holy Cart used for [[Medieval pageant|religious pageantry]] and the presentation of [[morality play]]s and [[Mystery play|miracle plays]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|p=9}} [[Wake]]s were established in [[Deritend]] and in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] in the 15th century where [[booth drama]] would have been presented.{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|pp=9-10}}

The earliest definite records of dramatic performances in the town are of regular seasonal performances by [[strolling players]] in the early 18th century.{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|p=10}} A booth existed by 1715 in "The Hinkleys" – the area bounded by Smallbrook Street and Dudley Street near the site of the current [[Old Rep]] theatre – and a second, described as a "shed of boards", is recorded a few years later in the meadows that would later be developed as Temple Street.{{sfn|Salberg|1980|p=12}} These later developed into the [[Theatre in Smallbrook Street]] and the [[Playhouse in New Street]],{{sfn|Crompton Rhodes|1924|p=5}} but at this early date would have presented plays and performances by travelling actors of indifferent quality, who carried their costumes and scenery with them on their backs and announced their performances by beating a drum.{{sfn|Salberg|1980|p=12}}

A building "something like a stable" in Castle Yard between High Street and Moor Street was used for dramatic performances from 1730.{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|p=11}} The standard of production in this new venue was reflected in the remarks of [[William Hutton (historian)|William Hutton]], writing later in the century: "here the comedian strutted in painted rags, ornamented with tinsel. The audience raised a noisy laugh, half real and half forced, at three-pence a head."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hutton|first=William|year=1795|title=An History of Birmingham|edition=3rd|publication-place=London|publisher=Thomas Pearson|page=196|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaJbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA194-IA2|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of the performances of this era were of such low quality, however: later playbills suggest that [[George Hallam]] had visited Birmingham with a company of actors from London, and that a repertoire of good quality was being presented in the town, by 1730 at the latest.{{sfn|Crompton Rhodes|1924|p=5}}{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|p=10}}

===Georgian theatre===
[[File:Moor-Street-Theatre-1751.jpg|right|upright|thumb|The [[Moor Street Theatre]], marked as the "Play House", on Samuel Bradford's 1751 map of Birmingham]]
It was in the 1740s that Birmingham emerged as the home of a distinctive theatrical tradition, which had become well-established by 1750.{{sfn|Money|1977|p=87}} The town's first permanent theatre was the [[Moor Street Theatre]], which opened in 1740.{{sfn|Price|1988|p=1}} Though not purpose-built, this was a substantial structure with boxes, a pit, a balcony, two galleries, and significant backstage machinery.{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|pp=12-13}} This new venue brought a major increase in the quality of drama presented in the town. It was managed during the 1740s by [[John Ward (actor)|John Ward]], whose background lay not with provincial [[strolling players]] but with [[London]]'s fashionable [[Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre]] and [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], and with the [[Aungier Street Theatre]] in [[Dublin]].{{sfn|Thompson|1999|p=142}} The Moor Street Theatre featured notable cast-members – [[David Garrick]] himself performed at Moor Street in the 1740s{{sfn|Stephens|1964}} – and presented a credible repertoire: the season for 1744 included [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'', [[John Vanbrugh]]'s ''[[The Provok'd Wife]]'', ''[[Fair Rosamund]]'' and ''[[The Biter Bit]]'', [[William Congreve]]'s ''[[Love for Love]]'' and ''[[The Mourning Bride]]'', and [[John Rich]]'s ''[[The Spaniard Outwitted]]''.{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|p=13}} Performances were given in costumes "proper to the play", reflecting the time and culture in which the drama was set, anticipating Garrick's later reforms at Drury Lane in London.{{sfn|Salberg|1980|p=7}}

The most notable development of the 1740s was John Ward's founding of the [[Warwickshire Company of Comedians]] – Birmingham's first indigenous [[theatre company]].  Ward was the manager of the Moor Street Theatre in the 1740s and had established the company by 1744, when it is recorded as playing in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].{{sfn|Thompson|1999|p=142}}{{sfn|Pendleton|2010|pp=38-39}}{{sfn|Money|1977|p=87}} At a time when any actor outside London was officially "deemed to be a rogue and a vagabond"{{sfn|Price|1973|p=175}} the Birmingham company's performances were of much higher standard than was usual outside London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Highfill|first1=Philip H.|last2=Burnim|first2=Kalman A.|last3=Langhans|first3=Edward A.|year=1993|contribution=Ward, John 1704-1773, actor, manager, singer|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGgS9VxWJ0oC&amp;pg=PA258|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers &amp; Other Stage Personnel in London, 1660-1800|publication-place=Carbondale|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|volume=15|pages=258–262|isbn=0809318024|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGgS9VxWJ0oC|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer of their performance in Stratford on Avon in 1746 described them as "much ye best Set I have seen out of London, &amp; in which opinion I am far from being singular"{{sfn|McManaway|1949|p=299}} and the memoirs of the contemporary Irish actor [[Charles Lee Lewes]] speak of "the Great Ward" who "has now a very great company at Birmingham: many of them are no less than Londoners".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lewes|first=Charles Lee|year=1805|title=Memoirs of Charles Lee Lewes: containing anecdotes, historical and biographical, of the English and Scottish stages, during a period of forty years|volume=2|publication-place=London|publisher=Richard Phillips|page=130|oclc=1943377|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glAOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=2014-02-09}} Ward maintained an interest in theatrical affairs in London throughout the 1740s{{sfn|McManaway|1949|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the actors in his company had experience from London and Dublin{{sfn|McManaway|1949|p=304}} and the company's repertoire included works by Congreve, Dryden, Lee, Rowe, Shakespeare, Steele, and Vanbrugh, as well as more populist fare including pantomime, music and dance.{{sfn|Thompson|1999|p=142}}

Developments in Birmingham's theatrical culture were not confined just to the new theatre. The [[Playhouse in New Street]] and the [[Theatre in Smallbrook Street]] – successors to booths recorded earlier in the century{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|pp=10-11}} – continued to operate through the 1740s, though both had disappeared by 1751.{{sfn|Stephens|1964}} Serious plays co-existed with more vulgar entertainments at all Birmingham's theatres – from musical concerts to fire-eating, rope-dancing to ventriloquism – often at the same venue, sometimes even on the same evening.{{sfn|Stephens|1964}} Popular dramatic entertainment much like later [[music hall]] was also often held in the town's larger public houses, including the "George and Dragon" and the "Red Lion" in the [[Bull Ring, Birmingham|Bull Ring]], the "King's Head" in [[Digbeth]] and the "Roe Buck" in Cox Street. Though popular these were illegal and often prosecuted by the owners of the more established theatres, who viewed them as unwelcome competition.{{sfn|Cunningham|1950|p=14}}

The [[Licensing Act of 1737]] confined drama in England to the two London [[patent theatre]]s, otherwise forbidding "every Person who shall for Hire, Gain or Reward, act, represent or perform, any Interlude, Tragedy, Comedy, Opera, Play, Farce, or other entertainment of the stage"{{sfn|Price|1973|p=175}} To get round this all Birmingham theatrical venues were licensed by magistrates for the performances of "Concerts of Music" under the [[Disorderly Houses Act 1732]], with plays technically being given free of charge during the interval.{{sfn|Crompton Rhodes|1924|pp=7-8}} Such licenses were only available for 60 day periods between June and October, however, as a result of which Birmingham theatres had only summer seasons until the licensing of the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]] in 1807.{{sfn|Stephens|1964}}

===Twentieth century theatre===
By 1901 Birmingham had ten theatres.{{sfn|Cochrane|2006|p=91}} The Tivoli (later the [[Birmingham Hippodrome|Hippodrome]]) and the Lyceum (later the [[New Alexandra Theatre|Alexandra Theatre]]) showed melodrama, pantomime, circus and variety acts.{{sfn|Cochrane|2006|p=91}} The [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]] and the [[Prince of Wales Theatre, Birmingham|Prince of Wales]], which had closed their stock companies, received touring modern and classical drama from leading national actor-managers.{{sfn|Cochrane|2006|p=91}}

===Post-war theatre===
The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] saw the enforced closure of all Birmingham's theatres in anticipation of immediate bombing.{{sfn|Salberg|1983|p=123}} Although they were allowed to reopen after a few weeks, the onset of the [[Birmingham Blitz]] in 1940 led to a collapse in attendance at evening performances and the return of closure for the majority of theatres.{{sfn|Salberg|1983|p=123}} The [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] was closed for two years from December 1940, and only the [[New Alexandra Theatre|Alexandra Theatre]] would stay open for the entire remaining duration of the war.{{sfn|Salberg|1983|p=123}} The most notable theatrical development of the war years were the [[Plays in the Park]], that saw Birmingham's theatre companies working around the threat of evening bombing of the city centre by presenting matinèe performances of drama in the city's parks.{{sfn|Cochrane|2006|p=91}}

The opening of the [[Sutton Coldfield transmitting station]] in 1949 made Birmingham the first British city outside London to have a [[television]] service, and this came to have a severe effect on the city's commercial theatres.{{sfn|Salberg|1983|p=124}} [[Moss Empires]] closed the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]] in 1958, with the replacement proposed as part of the [[Alpha Tower|ATV Centre]] never materialising.{{sfn|Salberg|1983|pp=124-125}} The [[New Alexandra Theatre|Alexandra Theatre]] was suffering financial problems by 1956, being forced to seek a loan from [[Birmingham City Council]] in 1963 and from the [[Arts Council]] in 1968.{{sfn|Salberg|1983|pp=131-132}} In October 1968 it was bought by the City Council and leased to a non- profit making management trust.{{sfn|Salberg|1983|p=132}} The Alex's repertory company was closed in 1974 and the company continued as a [[receiving house]].{{sfn|Salberg|1983|p=132}} Moss Empires threatened to close the [[Birmingham Hippodrome|Hippodrome]] in 1961 and 1970, but in 1979 sold it to the City Council who in turn leased it to a [[charitable trust]].{{sfn|Salberg|1983|p=129}} The Hippodrome's fortunes gradually revived, and by the early 21st century it was selling more tickets than any other single theatre in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Glenn Howells and Mike Hayes join board of Birmingham Hippodrome|newspaper=Birmingham Post|publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands|publication-date=2012-04-19|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/glenn-howells-mike-hayes-join-3913104|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s Birmingham had only three large-scale professional theares, though this was still – jointly with [[Manchester]] – the highest number of any English city outside London.{{sfn|Salberg|1983|p=127}}

During the 70s, mac, then known as the Midlands Arts Centre for Young People had its own professional puppet theatre and resident theatre company, members of the theatre company included Mike Leigh, Brian Blessed and Sir Tony Robinson.

[[Image:Faded Chinese theatre sign.JPG|thumb|A faded sign advertising [[Beijing opera]].]]
'''Theatre of China''' has a long and complex history. Today it is often called '''[[Chinese opera]]''' although this normally refers specifically to the more well-known forms such as [[Beijing Opera]] and [[Cantonese Opera]], there have been many other forms of theatre in China.

==Traditional Form of Theatre from China==
[[File:Lijiang Yunnan China-Naxi-people-carrying-baskets-01.jpg|thumb|Public performance in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Open Air Theatre.]]

===Classical Chinese theatre===
There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as the [[Shang Dynasty]]; they often involved happiness, mimes, and acrobatic displays.

The [[Tang Dynasty]] is sometimes known as "The Age of 1000 Entertainments". During this era, Ming Huang formed an acting school known as The [[Pear Garden]] to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical. That is why actors are commonly called "Children of the Pear Garden."

===Shadow play===
During the Dynasty of Empress Ping, [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]] first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the [[puppets]], as opposed to the type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a peacock). They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the seventh century before becoming a tool of the government.

===Chinese opera and tradition===
{{main|Chinese opera|Song Dynasty|Zaju}}
{{further|History of the Song dynasty}}
In the [[Song Dynasty]], there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] into a more sophisticated form known as ''[[zaju]]'', with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, which is still popular today.

===Xiangsheng===
[[Xiangsheng]] is a certain traditional Chinese comedic performance in the forms of monologue or dialogue or naralouge or salalouge or cococlouge.

[[China|Chinese]] performers usually clap with the audience at the end of a performance; the return applause signals "thank you" to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs |author1=Brown, Ju |author2=Brown, John |publisher=BookSurge |location=North Charleston |year=2006 |page=55 |isbn=1-4196-4893-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3r-3YH3t45cC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Chinese drama===
Chinese drama is an acting style that has influenced the world at that time. Well, Chinese drama usually contains the following: a protagonist, an antagonist, a heroine, and a sidekick (which is usually not that smart). The protagonist usually gets in trouble with the antagonist and gets kidnapped, and the heroine stands by, but can not do anything. The antagonist's sidekick may accidentally release the protagonist because the sidekick is not that smart, and later the sidekick may get killed for doing that. The antagonist usually gets caught at the end of the play.

Like the Chinese play [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]], there is a certain style when acting Chinese drama and plays.

===Shadow play===

===Modern Chinese theatre===
Modern Chinese theatre and drama has changed quite a lot compared to the past. The influences of the modern world affected the form of music/ theatre/ drama the Chinese were having. The rapid development of the country made theater not has important, as it started to pay focus on its economic environment, not its culture. Although some elderly Chinese try to protect and make the old Chinese theater tradition not fade out, but the fading out of the traditional Chinese is unavoidable. The current Chinese theater has been developed to a new form: people do not watch plays from theater, they watch it at homes on their TV. In addition to music theater, the modern world inspired new forms of drama, including what became known as the spoken drama (huaju 话剧) of the Western stage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199920082/obo-9780199920082-0011.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yolk''''' was a quarterly magazine for young [[Asian Americans]]. It was published by InformAsian Media, Inc. (IAMI) between 1994 and 2004,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19990203204737/http://www.yolk.com/yolk/general.html General Information]." ''Yolk''. February 3, 1999. Retrieved on September 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was headquartered in [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]], [[California]], in [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Greater Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.asianweek.com/081999/calendar_community.html AsianWeek's Community Calendar]." ''[[AsianWeek]]''. Thursday August 19, 1999. Volume 20, No. 51. Retrieved on September 25, 2012. "Yolk Magazine, 2005 Orange St., Suite A, Alhambra, CA 91803"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wan&gt;Wan, William. "[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/08/business/fi-yolk8 Pop Culture Asian American Magazine Falters]." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. December 8, 2003. Retrieved on September 25, 2012. "But the periodical never turned a profit, and now the Alhambra-based Yolk is the latest in a line of Asian American publications to fold."&lt;/ref&gt; The later incarnations of the magazine were titled ''Yolk: GenerAsian Next 2.0''.&lt;ref name=Wong134&gt;Wong, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uHJprl1xkmUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=Yolk+magazine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cp9BX7dLeq&amp;sig=8Geva6Do5MSNWeKC0mDMYdO4xPY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VTRhUNLoMoHI9QTrzoGwCA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Yolk%20magazine&amp;f=false p. 134].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and content ==
It was founded in 1994 by Tommy Tam, Tin Yen, and Amy Lee Tu. Tommy Tam was in charge of operations, Tin Yen was the graphic designer/art director, and Amy Tu oversaw the financial aspects of the magazine.

Based in Los Angeles, ''Yolk''{{'}}s reflection of its generation combines sections on fashion, entertainment and music, book reviews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaweedproductions.com/press_details.aspx?id=13 Seaweed Productions: Book Review of Paper Bullets by Alex Luu]&lt;/ref&gt; with occasional in-your-face attacks on our society's misunderstandings of Asian culture. The magazine's premise is that there is something common to Japanese, Korean and Chinese Americans, as well as Vietnamese, Filipinos, Indians and other Asian American groups.

''Yolk''{{'}}s first editor was Philip Chung, and managing editor, Larry Tazuma, came up with the magazine's name. "An egg yolk is yellow," he said," and so is the nominal color of Asian people's skin, regardless of nationality." &lt;ref&gt;Hong, Peter Y. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-12/local/me-34433_1_asian-americans Magazine Caters to Lifestyles of Young Asian Americans]." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. August 12, 1995. Retrieved on September 25, 2012. [https://web.archive.org/web/19970617221655/http://www.yolk.com/yolk/clippings/inside.html Alternate link]&lt;/ref&gt; "YOLK draws a strong reaction. But it simply stands for the color of our skin," he says. "It's what connects all Asians."&lt;ref&gt;Quintanilla, Michael. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-04/news/ls-46410_1_asian-americans Mixed Media : To Be Young, Hip and Asian]." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. October 4, 1994. Retrieved on September 25, 2012. [https://web.archive.org/web/19970617221709/http://www.yolk.com/yolk/clippings/hip.html Alternate]&lt;/ref&gt;  Performance artist and professor Alex Luu served as its editor and graphic designer Max Medina/Mystery Parade served as the Art Designer of ''YOLK''. Staff writers include XD Lim and [[Margaret Rhee]].

As the business grew, operations expanded into the clothing business. YOLK was well known for producing its line of [[Got Rice?]] t-shirts under the Brand Fury name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfstation.com/brand-fury-sf-b4138 SF Station: Brand Fury SF]&lt;/ref&gt; Popular sellers included phrases such as Got Rice?, Got Sushi?, Got Adobo? and Got Pho?

Circulation reached a high of 50,000 in 2000 and targeted English-fluent college-educated Asian Americans coming from various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alinemagazine.wordpress.com/category/news/ A-Line Magazine: Wait, A-Line isn’t the only Asian-interest magazine alive?]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Stanley Lim&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/031024/dip.html Asia Pacific Arts Online Magazine: Interview with Stanley Lim]&lt;/ref&gt; came in as the new publisher of the magazine. He proposed a new formula heavy on "guy stuff"—reviews of video games and tech gadgets, interviews with models and more bikini-clad women, both on the cover and throughout the pages. But ''Yolk'' was not able to sustain success, and folded in 2004 after a 10-year, 31-issue run.&lt;ref name=Wan/&gt;

Tommy Tam is currently the VP of Marketing at Dream Tube Entertainment. Tin Yen is still involved with graphic design today and has taught at UCLA Extension in the graphic design program. He founded creative agency TYS Creative, Inc. Amy Lee Tu is currently the Head of Marketing at Indomina Releasing.

As ''Yolk'' was closing, [[Honda Motor Co.]] offered a four month advertising contract. Lim and the editorial staff changed the publication into a web publication, and asked Honda to provide online advertising banners in lieu of print advertisements. Honda agreed to the change, and Chopblock.com became active.&lt;ref name=Wan/&gt;
