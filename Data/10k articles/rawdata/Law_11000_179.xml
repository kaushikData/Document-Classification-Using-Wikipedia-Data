{{wikinews|Two people killed in apparent murder-suicide at UCLA}}
On June 1, 2016, two men were killed in a [[Murder–suicide|murder-suicide]] at an engineering building at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). The gunman was identified as Indian-born 38-year-old former UCLA [[Ph.D]] student, Mainak Sarkar. The victim was William Scott Klug, an associate professor who was Sarkar's thesis adviser while Sarkar was a student at UCLA. A woman, later identified as Sarkar's estranged wife, was found dead in [[Minnesota]] during the subsequent investigation into the shooting, and is suspected to have been killed by Sarkar before the UCLA shooting.

==Details==
[[Image:UCLA Engr IV Bldg.jpg|thumb|right|Engineering IV, the building where the shooting occurred.]]
The shooting occurred at a fourth-floor office in Engineering IV, a building that is part of the [[UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science]].&lt;ref name="bhcouriertwodeadinapparentjune1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide Shooting At UCLA|url=http://bhcourier.com/two-dead-in-murder-suicide-shooting-at-ucla/|accessdate=June 1, 2016|work=The Beverly Hills Courier|date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChuckBlankstein&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/ucla-gunman-mainak-sarkar-had-kill-list-may-have-slayed-n584616|title=UCLA Gunman Mainak Sarkar Had Kill 'List,' May Have Killed Minnesota Woman: LAPD|work=NBC News|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck|first2=Andrew|last2=Blankstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the shooting, Christopher Lynch, an aerospace and mechanical engineering professor who heard the gunshots, went to Klug's office.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Quick&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucla-shooting-account-klug-sarkar-20160603-snap-story.html|title=Quick action by professors kept UCLA gunman from escape and potentially shooting more people|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016|first=Teresa|last=Watanabe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held the door shut, after which he heard another shot and then silence. Another professor said she heard someone fall after the last shot. Lynch later said that he did not feel the gunman try to open it but suspected the gunman heard yells for the hallway to be cleared out and that police were called in. Lynch was credited for potentially saving lives during the shooting.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Quick/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS.Quick&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ucla-shooting-professor-william-klugs-office-door-mainak-sarkar-los-angeles/|title=UCLA prof's quick thinking hailed for saving lives during shooting|work=CBS News|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyBruin.Recount&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailybruin.com/2016/06/08/faculty-recount-events-at-engineering-building-the-day-of-ucla-shooting/|title=Faculty recount events at engineering building the day of UCLA shooting|work=Daily Bruin|date=June 8, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2016|first=Angie|last=Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A campus-wide alert to avoid the area was issued via UCLA's BruinAlert system at 9:49&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Daylight Time|PDT]],&lt;ref name=Tweet1&gt;{{cite tweet|user=UCLABruinAlert|author=UCLA BruinAlert|number=738049937326252032|date=1 June 2016|title=BruinAlert: Police Activity vic Engineering Building 4.

==Aftermath==
Based on initial reports of the shooting, authorities mistook it as an attempted [[mass shooting]], prompting a massive police response.&lt;ref name=APAL/&gt; School officials put the campus on [[lockdown]] as hundreds of UCLA and LAPD officers, including [[SWAT]] officers, and officers of other agencies searched the area.&lt;ref name=APAL/&gt;&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|title=2 killed in UCLA shooting, campus on lockdown|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/345098-active-shooter-ucla-victims/|publisher=Russia Today|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yan|first1=Holly|last2=Bloom|first2=Deborah|last3=Mossburg|first3=Cheri|title=UCLA shooting: Murder-suicide occurs on campus|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/01/us/ucla-shooting-report/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nearby hospital and three elementary schools were also put on lockdown. When the lockdown was lifted just after noon ([[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=UCLABruinAlert|author=UCLA BruinAlert|number=738087056061042689|date=1 June 2016|title=Lockdown lifted  All Clear  Check for details|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; classes at UCLA were canceled for the day.&lt;ref name=ChuckBlanksteinCarrero/&gt; An apartment traced to the gunman was searched by police, and a description of his vehicle, which had not been located, was released.&lt;ref name=ShoichetBerlingerChan/&gt;&lt;ref name=BloomPascucci&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ktla.com/2016/06/03/car-matching-description-plate-of-suspected-ucla-shooter-found-in-culver-city-video/|title=UCLA Shooter’s Car Found in Culver City; Bomb Squad Called: LAPD|work=KTLA|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016|first=Tracy|last=Bloom|first2=Christina|last2=Pascucci}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WalshXiong&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/woman-shot-dead-in-brooklyn-park-death-linked-to-ucla-shooting/381659331/#1|title=Killing in Twin Cities linked to UCLA shooting|work=Star-Tribune|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=Paul|last=Walsh|first2=Chao|last2=Xiong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the school was in lockdown, people at many locations found it difficult to shelter in place, as few of the doors had locks for events of this nature. As a result, some students resorted to creative mechanisms to keep the doors closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/ucla-students-on-active-shooter-lockdown-are-engineerin-1779897413|title=UCLA Students on Active Shooter Lockdown Are Engineering the Hell Out of Doors Without Locks|first=Matt|last=Novak|publisher=Gizmodo|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Waugh, the school's executive vice-chancellor and provost, said the University will review its [[Active shooter|active-shooter]] protocols.&lt;ref name=SvrlugaBerman/&gt; The issue was previously brought up during deadly mass shootings at [[Virginia Tech shooting|Virginia Tech]] and [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook Elementary School]], where students and teachers also had to improvise to keep the doors to classrooms closed. Although some schools across the country installed locks to doors, a more widespread adoption of this security measure was hindered by "the cost to retrofit doors and local fire codes that require doors to open in one motion during emergencies", according to experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ucla-shooting-renews-concerns-classrooms-locks-39609955|title=UCLA Shooting Renews Concerns About Classrooms With No Locks|publisher=ABC News|agency=Associated Press|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016|first=Christine|last=Armario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools and universities disagreed about the importance of door locks during active-shooter situations; the [[University of Colorado]] stated that it wanted students and teachers to rely on training instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_30001959/locks-all-classroom-doors-ucla-shooting-raises-concerns|title=

U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] was briefed about the shooting aboard [[Air Force One]], according to [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Josh Earnest]].&lt;ref name=ChuckBlanksteinCarrero/&gt;

On June 3, two days after the shooting, the gunman's car was discovered by a bicyclist, parked in a residential area in [[Culver City, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/03/us/ucla-shooting/|title=UCLA shooting: Gunman's car found near Los Angeles|work=CNN|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016|first=Catherine E.|last=Shoichet|first2=Joshua|last2=Berlinger|first3=Stella|last3=Chan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KPCC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/06/03/61303/police-ucla-assailant-s-car-found-in-culver-city/|title=UCLA shooting update: Gun used in Minnesota, UCLA shootings appears to be the same|work=KPCC|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; located about six miles southeast of the UCLA campus. It contained multiple containers of gasoline and an additional handgun. Police theorized that the containers were used to refuel the car during the gunman's drive from Minnesota to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=BloomPascucci/&gt; They also theorized that the gunman parked in Culver City, where he had lived at one time, and took a bus that he regularly used to get to UCLA during his attendance there. A bus transfer was found on his body.&lt;ref name=KPCC/&gt;

On June 8, a week after the shooting, UCLA announced the launch of a task force that will review the university's response to the incident, as well as a security analysis of the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting-university-idUSKCN0YU0AB|title=UCLA to launch task force and investigation into campus shooting|work=Reuters|date=June 8, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2016|first=Sharon|last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/06/09/ucla-launches-task-force-on-campus-safety-after-shooting/|title=UCLA Launches Task Force On Campus Safety After Shooting|work=CBS Los Angeles|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task force would later recommend "more frequent staff and student emergency-response training, more wardens to conduct emergency drills and a requirement that all faculty, staff and students provide cellphone numbers to the school so they could receive emergency-alert text messages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ohio-state-attack-prompts-colleges-to-review-emergency-response-plans-1480605230|title=Ohio State Attack Prompts Colleges to Review Emergency-Response Plans|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 1, 2016|accessdate=December 1, 2016|first1=Melissa|last1=Korn|first2=Kris|last2=Maher|first3=Douglas|last3=Belkin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on June 10, UCLA students and campus leaders also called for more research into the increase of gun violence in American schools, and announced its intention to create the UCLA Institute on Campus Violence. It will be a research center that would "utilize the university’s research and public service capacity to study strategies to combat campus violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20160610/ucla-students-plan-institute-on-gun-violence-dedicated-to-shooting-victim-william-klug|title=UCLA students plan institute on gun violence dedicated to shooting victim William Klug|work=Los Angeles Daily News|date=June 10, 2016|accessdate=June 11, 2016|first=Joshua|last=Cain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal background===
Sarkar was born and raised in [[Durgapur]], a city in the state of [[West Bengal]], India. In 1984, he enrolled in [[St. Michael's School, Durgapur|St. Michael's School]], a local [[Mixed-sex education|co-education]], [[English-medium education|English-medium]] school. A schoolteacher working there described Sarkar as "an ordinary boy. Very quiet. Extremely well behaved and obedient. Never causing any trouble to anyone." The teacher also said that Sarkar left the school to attend the nearby Durgapur Bidhan Chandra Institute. From 2000 to 2001, he worked for eighteen months as a software developer at [[Infosys]] in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/ucla-shooting-mainak-sarkar-remembered-as-good-student-in-his-hometown-2833413/|title=UCLA shooter Mainak Sarkar remembered as ‘good student’ in his hometown of Durgapur|work=The Indian Express|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016|first=Esha|last=Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sources and his now-deactivated [[LinkedIn]] profile, Sarkar graduated from the [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]] in [[West Bengal]], India, in 2000 with an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering. He then traveled to the U.S. in 2001 on a [[Visa (document)|student visa]] to pursue graduate studies. He first attended [[Stanford University]] from 2003 to 2005, graduating with a master's degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Sarkar then attended UCLA's engineering school from the fall of 2007 to the summer of 2013, graduating with a Ph.D degree in [[solid mechanics]].&lt;ref name=ChuckBlankstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=MargolinSoneKeneally/&gt;&lt;ref name=MatherWintonRochaWatanabe/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kharagpur"&gt;{{cite news|title=IIT alumnus, disgruntled student: Who is UCLA gunman Mainak Sarkar?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world/iit-alumni-disgruntled-student-who-is-ucla-gunman-mainak-sarkar/story-dyCATG886H8rsgXWhfWrEM.html|accessdate=June 2, 2016|publisher=Hindustan Times|date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-mainak-sarkar-ucla-shooter/381683701/|title=What we know about Mainak Sarkar, UCLA shooter|work=The Star-Tribune|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MatherWintonWatanabeHamilton2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ucla-shooting-20160602-snap-story.html|title=An allegation of academic theft at heart of UCLA shooting|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=Kate|last=Mather|first2=Richard|last2=Winton|first3=Teresa|last3=Watanabe|first4=Matt|last4=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2016/06/03/what-we-know-about-ucla-shooter-mainak-sarkar/|title=What we know about UCLA shooter Mainak Sarkar|work=Twin Cities Pioneer Press|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professors at UCLA described him as a "quiet and reserved" man who would not greet them whenever he passed by, and stated that he left "little impression" in their classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/ucla-gunman-mainak-sarkar-did-not-impress-in-class-indian-origin-professor-1415673|title=UCLA Gunman Mainak Sarkar Did Not Impress In Class: Indian-Origin Professor|work=NDTV|date=June 5, 2016|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point after his relocation to the U.S., Sarkar briefly worked as a research assistant at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]] and as a software developer.

===Relationship with victims===
Sarkar maintained a personal blog called "''thelongdarktunnel''", which has since been deleted.&lt;ref name=ChuckBlanksteinCarrero/&gt; For months, he had been making hostile comments about Klug on social media, according to ''The Los Angeles Times''.

Police found a "kill list" at Sarkar's home in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], which named Hasti and Klug as well as another UCLA professor who remains unidentified but is stated to be "alright" by a police official.&lt;ref name=ChuckBlankstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=WalshXiong/&gt;&lt;ref name=MatherWintonRochaWatanabe/&gt; This professor, who had been aware of Sarkar's issues with him, was later confirmed to have been off-campus at the time of the shooting.&lt;ref name=MargolinSoneKeneally/&gt;

===Weapons===
After killing Hasti, Sarkar is believed by police to have equipped himself with two legally-purchased [[handgun]]s, along with several rounds of ammunition and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]], and driven from his home to Los Angeles to commit Klug's murder.&lt;ref name=ChuckBlankstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=MargolinSoneKeneally/&gt;&lt;ref name=WalshXiong/&gt; A police official said of his weaponry, "He was certainly prepared to engage multiple victims".&lt;ref name=NYPostLi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/06/02/woman-on-ucla-shooters-kill-list-found-dead-in-minnesota/|title=Woman on UCLA shooter’s ‘kill list’ found dead in Minnesota|work=New York Post|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=David K.|last=Li}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballistic tests indicated Klug and Hasti were both killed by the same handgun. A search of Sarkar's Minnesota apartment recovered more ammunition and a ballistic vest, alongside other items.&lt;ref name=KPCC/&gt;

==Reactions==
Klug was memorialized in a tweet posted by [[Lieutenant Governor of California|California Lieutenant Governor]] [[Gavin Newsom]], who called him an "empathetic, brilliant teacher."&lt;ref name=NBCChuck&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/slain-ucla-professor-william-klug-was-father-two-brilliant-teacher-n584496|title=Slain UCLA Professor William Klug Was a Father of Two, 'Brilliant' Teacher|work=NBC News|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day after the shooting, UCLA hosted a candlelight vigil, attended by hundreds, including the Mayor of Los Angeles, [[Eric Garcetti]].&lt;ref name="ktlavigil"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawkins|first1=Kirk|title=L.A.

Media outlets in India noted some similarities between Sarkar's killings and a 1969 murder case at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where student [[Tarasoff v.

The company will primarily focus on producing and distributing films and television using the [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Pictures]], [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Participant Media]] brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cieply|first1=Michael|title=Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks Studios in Deal to Form New Company|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/business/media/steven-spielberg-and-dreamworks-studios-in-deal-to-form-new-company.html?_r=0|accessdate=December 23, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For films, it will use the DreamWorks label for mature content, Amblin label for family-friendly content, and Participant label for [[social justice]] content, although the latter will remain a separate company.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/steven-spielbergs-dreamworks-relaunches-as-amblin-partners-1450301848|title=Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Relaunches as Amblin Partners|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day as the company's formation, Amblin Partners announced that it entered into a five-year distribution deal with [[Universal Pictures]] by which the films will be distributed and marketed by either the main Universal label or its specialty label, [[Focus Features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Lang|first1 = Brent|title = Steven Spielberg, Jeff Skoll Bring Amblin Partners to Universal|url = https://variety.com/2015/film/news/steven-spiellberg-universal-1201662956/|accessdate = December 23, 2015|work = Variety|date = December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Busch|first1 = Anita|title = It's Official: Spielberg, DreamWorks, Participant, eOne, Others Pact For Amblin Partners|url = http://deadline.com/2015/12/spielberg-dreamworks-participant-eone-others-pact-for-amblin-partners-1201668244/|accessdate = December 23, 2015|work = Deadline.com|date = December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Girl on the Train (2016 film)|The Girl on the Train]]'' was the first film released under the new agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1 = Pamela McClintock|author2 = Gregg Kilday|title = Steven Spielberg, Jeff Skoll Team to Form Amblin Partners, Strike Distribution Deal With Universal|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steven-spielberg-jeff-skoll-team-849249|accessdate = December 22, 2015|work = The Hollywood Reporter|date = December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Antarctic Treaty issue''' is a [[postage stamp]] that was issued by the [[United States Post Office Department]] on June 23, 1971. Designed by [[Howard Koslow]], it commemorates the ten-year anniversary of the [[Antarctic Treaty]], and is notable as Koslow's first postage stamp design. 

The stamp has a face value of eight cents. One-hundred thirty million were issued. 

==Background==
The [[Antarctic Treaty]] was signed on December 1, 1959 by the United States and eleven other nations involved in scientific research on the continent of [[Antarctica]] during the preceding biennium; seven of these nations – [[Argentina]], Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom – had competing territorial claims to Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Antarctic Treaty |url=https://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm |website=ats.aq |publisher=Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From November 18 to November 19, 1968, the fifth consultative meeting of the state parties to the treaty was held in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fifth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting |url=https://www.coldregions.org/vufind/Record/148830 |website=coldregions.org |publisher=[[American Geosciences Institute]] |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During it, the issue of decennial commemorative stamps by the state parties who had signed the Antarctic Treaty was recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Final Report of the Fifth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting|date=1968|publisher=[[Antarctic Treaty System]]|page=2|accessdate=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Antarctica_6400px_from_Blue_Marble.jpg|thumb|The Antarctic Treaty issue commemorates the Antarctic Treaty which provided a framework governing access to Antarctica (''pictured'').]]
The public announcement of the Antarctic Treaty issue release was made in May 1971 and it was officially released June 23, 1971, the tenth (decennial) anniversary on which the Antarctic Treaty became effective.&lt;ref name="weis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt; 

The official release was accompanied by a [[First day of issue|first day ceremony]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] attended by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William P. Rogers]], [[United States Postmaster General]] [[Winton M. Blount]], and the ambassadors to the United States of the state parties to the Antarctic Treaty.&lt;ref name="dos"&gt;{{cite news|title=President Praises Antarctic Treaty on its Anniversary|work=Department of State Newsletter|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ceremony, Blount presented an album of the stamps to Soviet ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]].&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;

One-hundred thirty million Antarctic Treaty issue stamps were printed.&lt;ref name="ati"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctic Treaty Issue|url=https://arago.si.edu/category_2034389.html|website=arago.si.edu|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stamp was designed by the acclaimed [[United States|American]] postage stamp illustrator [[Howard Koslow]], and was notable as his first postage stamp design.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grimes|first1=William|title=Howard Koslow Dies at 91; Artist Designed Stamps for 40 Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/arts/design/howard-koslow-dies-at-91-artist-designed-stamps-for-40-years.html|accessdate=September 3, 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Langer |first1=Emily |title=Howard Koslow, stamp designer whose masterpieces adorned millions of items of mail, dies at 91 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/howard-koslow-stamp-designer-whose-masterpieces-adorned-millions-of-items-of-mail-dies-at-91/2016/02/02/a66b7684-c9bf-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c0b53ddea6ad |accessdate=August 22, 2018 |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="woz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wozniak|first1=Maurice|title=Krause-Minkus Standard Catalog of U.S. Stamps|date=2001|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0873493214|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a map of Antarctica in white, set on a field of blue, which was adapted from the logo design used on documents of the treaty's consultative meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=William|title=Nine U.S. Stamps to be Issued During Next Several Months|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/61949679|accessdate=November 21, 2017|work=[[The San Bernardino Sun]]|date=April 11, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in 1965, the Special Committee on Antarctic Research of the [[International Council of Scientific Unions]] had called for stamps commemorating the decennial of the treaty to prominently feature the map of Antarctica.&lt;ref name="bas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sollie|first1=Finn|title=The Political Experiment in Antarctica|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=EAcAAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=November 21, 2017|work=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]|date=December 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to competing [[territorial claims in Antarctica]], the simplicity of a map-centered design was considered a matter of political importance.&lt;ref name="bas"/&gt; 

The stamp has an eight cents face value.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

In addition to the United States, other state parties to the Antarctic Treaty also issued commemorative stamps on its ten-year anniversary.&lt;ref name="weis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weis|first1=Paul|title=Stamps: Wildlife Series|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/41902561/?|accessdate=November 21, 2017|work=Daily Courier|agency=Copley News Service|date=May 5, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 1917, '''an armistice''' was signed between the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) on the one side and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], the [[German Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]—the [[Central Powers]]—on the other.&lt;ref&gt;A complete English translation of the text of the armistice can be found in [[#CITEREFHorne1920|Horne 1920]], pp. [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.32000011529601;view=1up;seq=441 391–92]&lt;/ref&gt; The armistice took effect two days later, on 17 December. (These were 2 December and 4 December, respectively, in the [[Old Style]] [O.S.] calendar in use in Russia at the time.) By this agreement Russia ''de facto'' exited [[World War I]], although fighting would briefly resume before the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed on 3 March 1918 and Russia made peace.

==Ceasefires==

The Bolsheviks came to power with the slogan "Bread and Peace".  On 26 November (13 November O.S.) 1917 three Russian emissaries under a white flag entered the German lines to arrange for negotiations which they agreed would be held at the headquarters of the Central Powers Armies at [[Brest-Litovsk]].{{sfn|Lincoln|1986|pp=484–90}} A local ceasefire agreement  was  reached at [[Soly]] on 4 December (21 November O.S.) between the Russians and Germans on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] (Russia's "Western Front"). It superseded any local ceasefires or truces already agreed to—without specifying what these were—and was to be in effect from 6–17 December.{{sfn|Slusser|Triska|1959|p=1}} Notice of the agreement was published in ''[[Izvestia]]'' on 8 December (25 November O.S.).{{sfn|Slusser|Triska|1959|p=1}}

A fuller ceasefire encompassing all the Central Powers was signed at [[Brest-Litovsk]] on 5 December (22 November O.S.), the day after the agreement with Germany at Soly. This ceasefire came into effect a day later (7 December [24 November O.S.]), but expired on the same date as the local agreement of 4 December.{{sfn|Slusser|Triska|1959|p=1}} It was published in ''Izvestia'' on the day it came into effect.{{sfn|Slusser|Triska|1959|p=1}} In [[Soviet historiography]] there is some dispute about whether any agreement was signed on 5 December, and the explicit reference in the text of the armistice to a ceasefire of that date is dismissed as an error. That the 5 December agreement is historical is generally agreed. One of the Russian negotiators, [[L. B. Kamenev]], wrote about the details of the agreement in ''Izvestia'' on 9 December (26 November O.S.); and the German general [[Max Hoffmann]] discussed it in his war diary.{{sfn|Slusser|Triska|1959|p=1}}

==Armistice==
The negotiations were organized by General [[Max Hoffmann]], chief of staff of the Eastern Armies. His negotiating team consisted of five Germans, four Austro-Hungarians (led by [[Kajetan von Mérey]]), three Ottomans (led by [[Zeki Pasha]]) and two Bulgarians (led by Petar Ganchev). Russian overtures to their French, Italian, and British allies to join in were rejected with "an, angry stony silence".{{sfn|Lincoln|1986|pp=484–90}} Foreign minister [[Leon Trotsky]] assembled a Russian delegation of twenty eight, which one of them described as a menagerie because they were chosen to represent the social groups supporting the revolution, including soldiers, sailors, and factory workers.  On the way to the railway station they realized that they lacked a peasant{{mdash}} one was recruited from the street. The female representative was celebrated for having assassinated a general. They were led by [[Adolph Joffe]], an experienced Bolshevik who had studied medicine in Berlin, supported by a tsarist  lieutenant  colonel as military adviser and the experienced revolutionaries Kamenev and  [[Lev Karakhan]].  

When they arrived at Brest-Litovsk they found the city a blackened ruin, burnt to the ground during the Russian retreat in 1915.  The offices and common facilities of the headquarters were in the fortress which had survived the fire and lodgings were in temporary wooden buildings erected in its courtyards. The delegation was welcomed by Field Marshal [[Prince Leopold of Bavaria]], a younger brother of the King of Bavaria and supreme commander on the eastern front.  The Russians ate in the officer's mess, where their hosts endeavored to  establish friendly relations with their perplexing guests.  

After three days of negotiations they agreed on an armistice for twenty eight days, during which no German troops would leave the eastern front.  The sticking point was that Joffe's instructions were to sign a general  armistice for all of the fighting fronts, which Hoffmann rejected because obviously they had no such mandate from their allies. The talks were recessed for a week while Joffe obtained new instructions. The Russians returned without their symbolic soldier, sailor, worker, and peasant.  On 15 December 1917 an armistice for thirty days was agreed,  which would automatically be extended to thirty  days until seven days after notice had been given by any party of its intention to resume hostilities. A supplement to the armistice was signed later the same day. It provided for a commission to be set up at [[Saint Petersburg]] (Petrograd) to restore the postal system, trade relations and the transport of books and newspapers.{{sfn|Slusser|Triska|1959|p=2}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17295">The '''Bering Sea Arbitration of 1893''' arose out of a [[fishery]] dispute between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[United States]] in the 1880s. The United States Revenue Cutter Service, today known as the [[United States Coast Guard]], captured several Canadian sealer vessels throughout the conflict. Diplomatic representations followed the capture of the first three ships and an order for release was issued by the British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada), but it did nothing to stop the seizures and none were released. This led to the U.S. claiming exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]], and that led to negotiations outside of the courts. The award was given in favor of the British, however, and the Americans were denied exclusive jurisdiction. The British were awarded compensation for the damage that had been inflicted on their vessels, and the American sealing zone remained as it was prior to the conflict (60 miles).

==Origins==
In 1867 the United States government purchased from [[Russia]] all her territorial rights in [[Alaska]] and the adjacent islands. The boundary between the two countries was a line drawn from the middle of [[Bering Strait]] south-west to a point midway between the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and [[Komandorski Islands]] dividing the Bering Sea into two parts, the larger being on the American side. This portion included the [[Pribilof Islands]], the principal breeding-grounds of the seals in those seas.

By [[Acts of Congress]], passed between 1868 and 1873, the killing of seals was prohibited on the Pribilof Islands and in "the waters adjacent thereto" except upon certain specified conditions. This created a large swathe of friction between the executive and legislative branches of the US government with the [[presidential veto]] employed by [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on two notable occasions.   No definition of the meaning of the words "waters adjacent" was given in the act. In 1870 the exclusive rights of killing seals on these islands was leased by the United States to the [[Alaska Commercial Company]], on conditions limiting the numbers to be taken annually, and otherwise providing for their protection. As early as 1872, the operations of foreign sealers attracted the attention of the United States' government, but any precautions then taken seem to have been directed against the capture of seals on their way through the passages between the Aleutian Islands, and no claim to jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit appears to have been made. On March 12, 1881, the acting [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], in answer to a letter asking for an interpretation of the words "waters adjacent thereto" in the acts of 1868 and 1873, stated that all the waters east of the boundary line were considered to be within the waters of Alaska territory. In March 1886 this letter was communicated to the [[San Francisco]] [[customs]] by [[Daniel Manning]], U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, for publication.

Beginning in about 1886, it became the practice of certain Canadian vessels to intercept passing seals in the open ocean (over three miles from any shore) and shoot them in the water (pelagic sealing), often killing both male and female.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; The great drawback of pelagic sealing lies in the fact that nursing seal mothers wander far in search of food, while the males do not take food during the breeding season, but remain on the islands. Consequently, practically all the seals taken by pelagic sealers are nursing females, the death of which ordinarily results in the starvation of the pups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE |last=Clark |first=Hubert Lyman |authorlink=Hubert Lyman Clark |wstitle=Seal (mammal)|display=Seal. A carnivorous aquatic mammal of the suborder Pinnipedia }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this practice, the real possibility of the destruction of the seal fisheries became apparent, together with industries valuable to both the United States and Great Britain.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

==British involvement and escalation==
In the summer of 1886, three British Columbian sealers, the ''Carolena'', ''Onward'', and ''Thornton'', were captured by an American revenue cutter, the [[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|''Corwin'']],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII "The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration"''] E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay, S.J. Clarke Publ. Co, Vancouver, 1914, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; 60 miles from land. They were condemned by the district judge because they had been sealing within the limits of Alaska territory and owed  [[Prima facie|a pro tanto obligation]] to respect the sovereign laws of the [[Territory of Alaska]]. Diplomatic representations followed and an order for release was issued but, in 1887, further captures were made which were judicially supported on the same grounds. From that point the United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]]; it also contended that the protection of the [[fur seal]] was an international duty, and should be secured by international arrangement. The British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada) repudiated the claim, but was willing to negotiate on the question of international regulation.

==Negotiations==
Between 1887 and 1890, negotiations were carried out among Russia, Great Britain and the United States with a view to a joint convention but the parties were unable to agree on basis for regulating sealing in the open seas, the [[pelagic zone]]. America had seal nurseries on the Pribilof Islands and Russia on the Komandorski group. Neither Britain, nor the Dominion of [[Canada]], had land access to the Bering Sea or seal breeding grounds. Thus, to prohibit pelagic sealing would have been to exclude Britain from the industry.

The United States insisted that such prohibition was indispensable on the grounds that pelagic sealing involved the destruction of breeding stock, because it was practically impossible to distinguish between the male and female seal when in the water; and that it was unnecessarily wasteful, inasmuch as a large proportion of the seals so killed were lost. Britain contended that in all known cases the extermination of seals had been the result of operations upon land, and had never been caused exclusively by sealing in the pelagic zone.

The negotiations came to nothing, and the United States fell back upon their claim of right. In June 1890, it was reported that certain American revenue cutters had been ordered to proceed to the Bering Sea. Sir [[Julian Pauncefote]], the British ambassador at [[Washington, DC|Washington]], having failed to obtain an assurance that British vessels would not be interfered with, laid a formal protest before the United States government.

==Arbitration==
There followed a diplomatic controversy, in the course of which the United States developed the contentions which were afterwards laid before the tribunal of arbitration. The claim that Bering Sea was ''[[mare clausum]]'' was abandoned, but it was asserted that Russia had formerly exercised therein rights of exclusive jurisdiction which had passed to the United States, and they relied ''[[inter alia]]'' upon the [[ukase]] of 1821, by which foreign vessels had been forbidden to approach within 100 Italian miles of the coasts of Russian America. It was pointed out by Great Britain that this ukase had been the subject of protest both by Great Britain and the United States, and that by treaties similar in their terms, made between Russia and each of the protesting powers, Russia had agreed that their subjects should not be troubled or molested in navigating or fishing in any part of the Pacific Ocean. The American answer was that the [[Pacific Ocean]] did not include the Bering Sea. They also claimed an interest in the fur seals, involving the right to protect them outside the three-mile limit. In August 1890 [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] proposed that the question at issue should be submitted to arbitration. This was ultimately assented to by the secretary of state, [[James Gillespie Blaine]], on the understanding that certain specific
points, which he indicated, should be laid before the arbitrators.

On February 29, 1892, a definitive treaty was signed at Washington, D.C. Each power was to name two arbitrators, and the president of the [[France|French]] Republic, the king of [[Italy]], the king of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] were each to name one.

===Terms of reference and arbitrators===
The points submitted were
#What exclusive jurisdiction in the sea now known as Bering Sea, and what exclusive rights in the seal fisheries therein, did Russia assert and exercise prior to and up to the time of the cession of Alaska to the United States? 
#How far were her claims of jurisdiction as to the seal fisheries recognized and conceded by Great Britain? 
#Was the body of water now known as Bering Sea included in the phrase "Pacific Ocean", as used in the treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, and what rights, if any, in Bering Sea were held exclusively exercised by Russia after the said treaty? 
#Did not all the rights of Russia as to jurisdiction and as to the seal fisheries in Bering Sea east of the water boundary, in the treaty between the United States and Russia of the 30th of  March 1867, pass unimpaired to the United States under that treaty? 
#Had the United States any and what right of protection over, or property in, the fur seals frequenting the islands of Bering Sea when such seals are found outside the three-mile limit?

In the event of a determination in favour of Great Britain the arbitrators were to determine what concurrent regulations were necessary for the preservation of the seals, and a joint commission was to be appointed by the two powers to assist them in the investigation of the facts of seal life. The question of damages was reserved for further discussion, but either party was to be at liberty to submit any question of fact to the arbitrators, and to ask for a finding thereon. The tribunal was to sit at [[Paris]]. The treaty was approved by the [[United States Senate]] on the March 29, 1892, and ratified by the president on April 22.

The United States appointed as arbitrator Mr. [[John Marshall Harlan|John M. Harlan]], a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and Mr [[John T. Morgan]], a member of the Senate. The British arbitrators were [[Lord Hannen]] and [[Sir John Sparrow David Thompson]]. The neutral arbitrators were the Baron de Courcel, the [[Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta|Marquis Visconti-Venosta]], and Mr. [[Gregers Winther Wulfsberg Gram]], appointed respectively by the president of the French Republic, the king of Italy, and the king of Norway and Sweden. The sittings of the tribunal began in February 1893 and ended in August.  [[Henry Williams Blodgett]] acted as U.S. counsel before the tribunal.

===Main arguments===
When the evidence was before the tribunal, it was plain that the United States had a very weak case with regard to the claim of exclusive jurisdiction in the Bering Sea (the first claim), and it was not strongly pressed by the counsel of the United States.&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Sealing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real question, therefore, and the one upon which the chief argument was directed, was the second of the two claims put forward on behalf of the United States, the right of property in the seals and the right of protecting them beyond the three-mile limit.

It was suggested that the seals had some of the characteristics of the domestic animals, and could therefore be the subject of something in the nature of a right of property. They were so far amenable to human control that it was possible to take their increase without destroying the stock. Sealing upon land was legitimate sealing; the United States being the owners of the land, the industry was a trust vested in them for the benefit of mankind. On the other hand, pelagic sealing, being a method of promiscuous slaughter, was illegitimate; it was ''contra bonos mores'' and analogous to piracy. Consequently, the United States claimed a right to restrain such practices, both as proprietors of the seals and as proprietors and trustees of the legitimate industry.

Such a right to restrain was a novelty hitherto unrecognized by any system of law. [[James C. Carter]], therefore, as counsel for the United States, submitted a theory of international jurisprudence which was equally novel. He argued that the determination of the tribunal must be grounded upon "the principles of right," that "by the rule or principle of right was meant a moral rule dictated by the general standard of justice upon which civilized nations are agreed, that this international standard of justice is but another name for international law, that the particular recognized rules were but cases of the application of a more general rule, and that where the particular rules were silent the general rule applied." The practical result of giving effect to this contention would be that an international tribunal could make new law and apply it retrospectively. Carter's contention was successfully combated by [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]], the leading counsel for Great Britain.

===Conclusion===
The award, which was signed and published on 15 August 1893, was in favour of Great Britain on all points. The question of damages, which had been reserved, was ultimately settled by a mixed commission appointed by the two powers in February 1896, the total amount awarded to the British sealers being $473,151.26 - in excess of US$10 million in present-day inflation-adjusted dollars.

Since the decision was in favor of Great Britain, in accordance with the arbitration treaty the tribunal prescribed a series of regulations for preserving the seal herds which were to be binding upon and enforced by both powers. They limited pelagic sealing as to time, place, and manner by fixing a zone of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands within which the seals were not to be molested at any time, and from May 1 to July 31 each year they were not to be pursued anywhere in Bering Sea. Only licensed sailing vessels were permitted to engage in fur sealing, and the use of firearms or explosives was prohibited. The regulations were to remain in force until abolished by mutual agreement, but were to be examined every five years with a view to modification.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

These regulations, however, failed of their object, because the mother seals did not feed within the protected area, but far outside of it. The mother seals were therefore taken by the pelagic sealers as before, and their young were left to starve. The largest catch in the history of pelagic sealing, that of 1894, was made in the first season of the operation of these very regulations designed to so limit and restrict pelagic sealing as to protect and preserve the herd.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Americana |last=Clark |first=George Archibald |wstitle=Seals and Sealing|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint commission of scientists from Great Britain and the United States further considered the problem, and came to the conclusion that the pelagic sealing needed to be curtailed.  However further joint tribunals did not enact new legal restrictions, and then Japan also embarked upon pelagic sealing.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; Finally, the [[North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911]] severely curtailed the sealing industry.

'''''Calderbank v Calderbank''''' [1975] 3 All ER 333 (EWCA) was an important [[English Court of Appeal]] decision establishing the concept of a "Calderbank Offer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Philip|title=Construction Claims|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3Zp9kGPBYYC&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=Calderbank%20v%20Calderbank&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q=Calderbank%20v%20Calderbank&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Federation Press|isbn=1862876088|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; A “Calderbank Offer” can often be identified by the disclaimer "[[without prejudice]], save as to costs".


==Facts==
After a marriage of 17 years, Mr and Mrs Calderbank separated and filed for [[divorce]], which was duly granted.

However substantial difficulties arose regarding the division of the matrimonial assets of £78,000, consisting of the £80,000 Mrs Calderbank had previously inherited during the relationship from the estates from the death of both her parents. Complicating matters further, the matrimonial home was registered under only Mr Calderbank’s name (due to fiscal reasons) and he continued to live in this property after the divorce.

The matter was referred to the Family Court, and the judge awarded Mr Calderbank the modest amount of £10,000 (out of the total assets of £78,000), as well as court costs.

However prior to the matter going to trial, Mrs Calderbank had made the following offer via no less than the form of an affidavit "I am willing, and have always been willing, to make over to the [husband] the house at Alderley Edge", which Mr Calderbank declined.

While this house was not the matrimonial home (it was rented by Mr Calderbank’s father, and Mr Calderbank's mother lived there), the trial judge was of the opinion that this house was worth about £12,000, which was £2,000 more than Mr Calderbank later obtained at trial.

Mrs Calderbank, not happy with the outcome, appealed on 2 grounds, first that the courts had no legal jurisdiction to make such a property division, and secondly, and of most legal significance, that as Mr Calderbank had obviously declined a reasonable pre trial settlement offer, he should not be entitled to legal costs for unnecessarily prolonging these legal proceedings.

==Judgment==
The Court decided that where a winning party in litigation refuses an earlier settlement offer made by the losing party, the losing party may produce the settlement offer as evidence towards the appropriate level of costs payable. In practice, if the winning party’s award of damages is less than the earlier settlement offer, then the losing party may have to pay less costs to the winning party than normal.

On the facts, the Court upheld the lower court's quantum of the £10,000. However, the Court reversed the burden of paying legal costs from Mrs Calderbank onto Mr Calderbank. The Court held that the legal proceedings had been unnecessarily prolonged by Mr Calderbank's earlier refusal to accept Mrs Calderbank's settlement offer of around £12,000.

{{Chinese Political Realism}}
The '''''Canon of Laws''''' or '''''Classic of Law''''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|法|经}}|p=Fǎ Jīng}}) is a lost legal code that has been attributed to [[Li Kui (legalist)|Lǐ Kuǐ]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|李|悝}}}}), a [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] scholar and minister who lived in the [[Wei (state)|State of Wei]] during the [[Warring States|Warring States Period]] of Chinese history (475-220 BCE). This code has traditionally been dated to the early fourth century BCE, but scholars now widely consider it to be a forgery from the fifth or sixth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Ogawa Shikegi, "On Li K'uei's ''Fa-ching''," ''Tōyō gakuhō'' (Kyōto) 4 (1933): 278-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.F.P. Hulsewé, ''Remnants of Han Law'' (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1955), pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timoteus Pokora, "The Canon of Laws of Li K'uei: A Double Falsification?" ''Archiv Orientalni'' 27 (1959): 96-121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.F.P. Hulsewé, "The Legalists and the Laws of Ch'in," in ''Leyden Studies in Sinology: Papers Presented at the Conference Held in Celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Sinological Institute of Leyden University, December 8–12, 1980'' (Leyden: E.J. Brill, 1981), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herrlee G. Creel, "Legal Institutions and Procedures During the Chou Dynasty," in ''Essays on China's Legal Tradition'', ed. by Jerome A. Cohen, R. Randle Edwards, and Fu-mei Chang Chen (Princeton University Press, 1980), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Endymion Wilkinson, ''Chinese History: A Manual'', Revised and Enlarged (Harvard University Asia Center, 2000), p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the traditional account, which first appeared in the monograph on law (''Xingfa zhi'' 刑法志) of the ''[[Book of Jin]]'', the ''Canon of Laws'' was the earliest legal canon of ancient China and became the basis for all later legal works.&lt;ref&gt;A.F.P. Hulsewé, ''Remnants of Han Law'' (Leiden: Brill, 1955), pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Legalist reformer [[Shang Yang|Shāng Yǎng]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|商|鞅}}}}) took it to the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] where it became the basis of the law of the State of Qin ({{zh|c={{linktext|秦|律}}|p=Qīn Lü}}) and later the law of the [[Qin Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;A.F.P. Hulsewé, ''Remnants of Han Law'' (Leiden: Brill, 1955), pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the original text has been lost, according to later records the '''''Canon of Laws''''' comprised six chapters:
* Theft and robbery law ({{zh|c={{linktext|盗|法}}|p=Dào Fǎ}})
* Treason law ({{zh|t={{linktext|賊|法}}|s={{linktext|贼|法}}|p=Zéi Fǎ}})
* Prisoner or extent of justice law ({{zh|c={{linktext|囚|(|或|网|)法}}|p=Qiú Fǎ huò Wǎng Fǎ}})
* Law of arrest ({{zh|c={{linktext|捕|法}}|p=Bǔ Fǎ}})
* Miscellaneous law ({{zh|t={{linktext|雜}}|c={{linktext|杂|法}}|p=Zá Fǎ}})
* Law of possession ({{zh|c={{linktext|具法}}|p=Jù Fǎ}})

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1946">The '''Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth''' (CAMY) is a research and advocacy organization, based at the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] in Baltimore, MD, which monitors and reports on youth exposure to [[alcohol advertising]]. According to CAMY's mission statement, the organization "monitors the marketing practices of the alcohol industry to focus attention and action on industry practices that jeopardize the health and safety of America's youth."  For purposes of CAMY's research, youth are defined as persons under the age of 21, which is the minimum legal age in the US for the purchase and public possession of alcoholic beverages, although not necessarily for consumption.

Since its founding in 2002, CAMY has reported on alcohol advertising and marketing in television, magazines, radio, and the internet, and has produced over 25 reports.  Its reports are generally based on research used by marketers and the advertising industry to plan, buy, and sell advertising time and space.

CAMY is funded by [[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) by grants administered through [[Johns Hopkins University]].  From 2002 until 2008, CAMY was funded by [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] and the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] by grants administered through [[Georgetown University]].

{{Corporatism sidebar}}
'''Corporate nationalism''' is a phrase that is used to convey various meanings:
*A [[political culture]] in which members believe the basic unit of society and the primary concern of the state is the [[corporate group (sociology)|corporate group]] rather than the individual, and the interests of the corporate group are the same as the interest of the nation.
*Corporations should work mainly for the national good rather than the good of their owners.
*Corporations should be protected from foreign ownership.
*Corporations should or may be nationalized.
*The state is biased towards corporate interests.

==State should deal with corporations rather than individuals==

"Corporate Nationalism" may be used to describe a [[political philosophy]] and [[economic theories|economic theory]] whose adherents are [[corporatism|corporatists]] and believe that the basic unit of the society, be it the family or other [[corporate group (sociology)|corporate group]]s, has  the same interests as the [[nation]]. Some therefore believe that the state should deal primarily with "corporations", which may include companies, worker's cooperatives, unions and so on, and allow these units to organize themselves to serve their members as they feel fit.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Streeck &amp; Lane Kenworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kmr6gBjhRI4C&amp;pg=PA441&amp;lpg=PA441&amp;dq=neocorporatism+schmitter&amp;source=web&amp;ots=N3SHQvThaq&amp;sig=b94xLY4X_pKzuIdtQ2thZonD3Co "Theories and Practices of Neocorporatism"]. In Thomas Janoski (ed.) ''The Handbook of Political Sociology'' (Cambridge Univ. Press: 2005), p. 441ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations should work mainly for the national good==
The Christian [[Falange|Falangist]] Party of America espouses this view. They do not reject the right of investors to make profit, but believe they do not have the right to take actions such as moving factories to other countries and thus endangering American workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falange1.com/faq1.htm ''Frequently Asked Questions''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230203401/http://www.falange1.com/faq1.htm |date=2008-12-30 }} Christian Falangist Party of America&lt;/ref&gt;

==National corporations should be protected from foreign ownership==
Norway has a history of state campaigns to block foreign companies from taking over major Norwegian firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKL1234466320070412 ''Norway watchdog wary of Kaupthing buying insurer''] Reuters Apr 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, PepsiCo was rumored to be planning a bid to take over French food group Danone, arousing popular outcry. A former boss of Danone said. "Danone is like Chartres cathedral, and one does not buy the cathedral of Chartres."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/feb/27/france.internationalnews1 ''Battle to preserve identity''] The Guardian 27 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations should (may) be nationalized==

The phrase may be used to describe national intervention in corporations, including outright nationalization where the state assumes ownership of the corporation. Some see recent US government interventions in the Financial industry, including the effective nationalization of [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] are seen as a form of corporate nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article5605.html ''It's Always Darkest Before the Dawn...of a Economic Depression''] marketoracle.co.uk. Jul 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The state is biased towards corporate interests==

Some libertarians in the USA consider that the end of slavery coincided with the start of a regime "tainted" by aggressive ''corporate nationalism'', or government intervention into the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory136.html ''Real World Politics and Radical Libertarianism''] Lew Rockwell.com: anti-state, anti-war, pro-market. April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the destruction of chattel slavery preserved and perpetuated "bourgeois" slavery.&lt;ref name=Hummel1996&gt;{{Citation

A '''counterparty''' (sometimes '''contraparty''') is a [[Juristic person|legal entity]], [[unincorporated entity]], or collection of entities to which an exposure to [[financial risk]] might exist. The word became widely used in the 1980s, particularly at the time of the [[Basel I]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas J. Sargent|Sargent, T. J.]], and Velde, F. R., ''The Big Problem of Small Change'' ([[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and [[Oxford]]: [[Princeton University Press]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-drafted contracts usually attempt to spell out in explicit detail what each counterparty's rights and obligations are in every conceivable circumstance, though there are limits. There are general provisions for how counterparties are treated under the law, and (at least in [[common law]] legal systems) there are many [[legal precedent]]s that shape the common law.

==Financial services sector==
Within the [[financial services]] sector, the term '''market counterparty''' is used to refer to [[government]]s, [[national bank]]s, national monetary authorities and international monetary organisations such as the [[World Bank Group]] that act as the ultimate guarantor for loans and indemnities. The term may also be applied, in a more general sense, to companies acting in this role.

Also within financial services, counterparty can refer to brokers, [[investment bank]]s, and other securities dealers that serve as the  contracting party when completing [[Over-the-counter (finance)|"over the counter"]] securities transactions.  The term is generally used in this context in relation to "[[counterparty risk]]", which is the risk of monetary loss a firm may be exposed to if the counterparty to an over-the-counter securities trade encounters difficulty meeting its obligations under the terms of the transaction.

==Insurance sector==
Within the [[insurance]] sector, this term is extended to include companies offering or requiring high-level [[Reinsurance#Retrocession|retrocession]] of insurance risk to insurance companies in a role similar to that offered by governments. This term, over time, has become more generally applied to companies offering or requiring retrocession and other forms of [[reinsurance]].

In U.S. law, a '''covered security''' may refer to two categories of securities:
* Under [[The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996]], is a security listed on the [[NYSE]], [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]], Midwest (Chicago), or NASDAQ Global Market or any security senior to (bond or preferred) or equal to (rights and warrants).  These securities are exempt from registration and advertising filing requirements of the [[Uniform Securities Act]] but are not exempt from any anti-fraud provisions.
* In [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax law]], a covered security is one for the sale of which the broker must report, to the [[Internal Revenue Service]], the customer's basis and information on whether the sale results in a short-term or long-term gain or loss. This rule applies to certain types of securities, acquired after a specified effective date. The law phases in between January 1, 2011 and January 1, 2013 (or later).&lt;ref&gt;See generally subsection (g) of {{usc|26|6045}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter category was created in an amendment to section 6045 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] in [[s:Energy_Improvement_and_Extension_Act_of_2008#SEC._403._BROKER_REPORTING_OF_CUSTOMER.27S_BASIS_IN_SECURITIES_TRANSACTIONS.|Section 403]] of the ''[[Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008]]'' ([[Public Law 110-343]], [[s:Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008|division B]]). The law refers to any security in this category as "specified security", and defines such securities to include stock in a corporation, notes, bonds, debentures and other evidence of indebtedness, commodities, commodity contracts or derivatives, and any other financial instrument for which the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate determines that the reporting of adjusted basis is appropriate. Information is reportable if the security is acquired after a certain effective date (with some exceptions, January 1, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/taxpros/article/0,,id=237099,00.html Cost Basis Reporting Overview and FAQs], Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.&lt;/ref&gt;

These criminal acts include advocation of crime, sabotage, violence, and other unlawful methods of terrorism.&lt;ref name="US Legal, Inc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Syndicalism Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/criminal-syndicalism/|publisher=US Legal, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal syndicalism laws were enacted to oppose economic radicalism.&lt;ref&gt;White, Ahmed A.

== Background ==
Idaho legislation defines it as, “the doctrine which advocates crime, sabotage, violence, or other unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform”.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Radical Agitation|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1935032800&amp;type=query&amp;num=criminal+syndicalism&amp;|publisher=CQ Press|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key terms in criminal syndicalism statutes had vague definitions.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal syndicalism became a matter of public attention during and after the World War I period, and has been used to stymie the efforts of radical labor movements.&lt;ref name=Idaho&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sims|first=Robert, C|title=Idaho's Criminal Syndicalism Act: One States Response to Radical Labor|journal=Labor History|year=1974|volume=15|issue=4|pages=511–527|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=97f94314-a47c-4869-8d62-d520de82fd21%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=122&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=ahl&amp;AN=4558619|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s, the public was hostile towards leftist ideologies and deemed social radicalism un-American. Government officials on the state and federal level ordered arrests, imprisonments  and killings of people who challenged industrial capitalism or made militant demands under the pre-existing economic structure.&lt;ref name="White, 650"&gt;White, p. 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the year 1933, over 700 convictions of criminal syndicalism were made.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;  Organizations like the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] believe laws on criminal syndicalism were aimed to punish doctrines or memberships in unions.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;

=== Industrial Workers of the World ===
Criminal Syndicalism laws were enacted to combat the efforts of radical labor unions. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) is one such union in particular.&lt;ref name="Idaho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White, 650"/&gt; Defining the labor efforts as criminal allowed for the government to stop the [[Wobblies]]' activities and the labor problem of World War I and post World War I altogether. Senator W.G. Walker of Idaho, the nation’s first state to enact a criminal syndicalism law, introduced the criminal syndicalism legislation to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] with an anti-IWW speech.&lt;ref name="Idaho"/&gt;

The IWW’s confrontational rhetoric factored into public concerns.&lt;ref name="White, 687"&gt;White, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization used “sabotages” and military tactics in its invocation of social change.&lt;ref name="White, 687"/&gt; The public assumed the IWW promoted violence and destruction of properties even though the IWW did not share these intentions.&lt;ref name="White, 687"/&gt; The IWW’s later attempts at reducing enforcement efforts through distancing itself from this doctrine were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="White, 688"&gt;White, p. 688.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWW’s opposition to [[United States in World War I|United States’ involvement in World War I]] was in contrast of public sentiment, leading to an unfavorable public opinion towards the organization.&lt;ref name="White, 688"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, Woodrow C. "Criminal Syndicalism and the Law in California: 1919-1927."Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 59, no. 2 (1969): 15. Accessed November 25, 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006021.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriotic societies alleged that German gold financed IWW operations, and that the organization received support from hostile nations.&lt;ref&gt;Blasi, Vincent. "The First Amendment and the Ideal of Civic Courage: The Brandeis Opinion in Whitney v. California." William and Mary Law Review 29, no. 4 (1988): 655. Accessed November 24, 2014. http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3S3V-3SV0-00CW-G2NH&amp;csi=7413,270077&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[red scare]] exacerbated public distrust and fear against all radical leftist organizations, including the IWW.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; Strikes (involving over 4 million workers) across the nation increased negative sentiments against these organizations.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 697.&lt;/ref&gt;
Various bombings and bombing plots attributed to radical leftists caused the public to view radical leftist organizations as threats to state security.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitten, 13"&gt;Whitten, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
While repressions against the IWW through government actions and vigilantism were rampant, the public continued to perceive efforts to suppress the organization as insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 700.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense by the IWW's [[General Defense Committee]] in the case of [[Fiske v. Kansas]] resulted in a critically important 1924 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling which led to the decline of criminal syndicalism laws as a factor in legislative anti-union initiatives.&lt;ref name="Cortner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cortner |first=Richard C. |date=Spring 1981 |title=The Wobblies and Fiske v.

== Legislation ==

=== History ===
State government legislation has been made to address criminal syndicalism according to their own definitions.  States enacted criminal laws, the first of which was enacted in Idaho in 1917, or [[sedition]] law (operating basically in the same way as criminal syndicalism laws).&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;

During [[World War I]] and post-World War I, more than half the states passed these anti-radical statutes, most of which still remain in effect today.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;

By 1935, there were a number of 33 states with remaining criminal syndicalism laws or sedition laws.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;  Between the years 1918 and 1919 Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, and fourteen other states passed criminal syndicalism laws and between 1917 and 1923 thirteen states enacted sedition laws.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;  Those states without Criminal Syndicalism laws or sedition laws during this period are noted to have had some similar already existing statutes against incitement and rebellion.

The degree of the consequences range from state to state.  Criminal Syndicalism laws called for maximum fines of $10,000 and a maximum 25-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;  Prosecutions under Criminal syndicalism laws ensued. The [[California Criminal Syndicalism Act|California Criminal Syndicalism Act of 1919]] alone, only five years after its enactment, was responsible for over 500 arrests and 164 convictions.&lt;ref name=Charlotte&gt;{{cite web|last=Urofsky|first=Melvin, I|title=Charlotte Anita Whitney, Whitney v. California: Free Speech for Radicals|url=http://library.cqpress.com/scc/amcons-228-9677-607867|publisher=SAGE Publications|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act was upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court]] on May 16, 1927 in the ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' case.&lt;ref name="Charlotte"/&gt;  The power of law against criminal syndicalism began to falter by the 1930s as the courts began to overturn convictions as either being no true threat to the US or by declaring the laws to be too vague or broad.&lt;ref name=Freedom&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage|first=David, G|title=Freedom of Political Association|url=http://library.cqpress.com/scc/gct5v1-1179-57464-2235286|publisher=SAGE Publications|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example was the court's overturning of the conviction of Dirk DeJonge due to protesting the police brutality in the longshoreman’s strike, as violating Oregon's criminal syndicalism law.&lt;ref name="Freedom of Speech"&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage|first=David G|title=Freedom of Speech|url=http://library.cqpress.com/scc/gct5v1-1179-57463-2235059|publisher=SAGE Publications|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idaho===

On February 19, 1917, the criminal syndicalism bill was introduced into the Idaho state legislature.&lt;ref name="Sims, 512"&gt;Sims, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses which stood to lose the most at the hands of the IWW, including lumber and mining interests, lobbied for the statute’s enactment.&lt;ref name="Sims, 512"/&gt;  In March 1917, the Idaho state government enacted the statute.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Idaho criminal syndicalism bill served as a prototype for many other similar bills passed in various state legislatures in the following four years.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Robert Justin. Political Repression in Modern America from 1870 to 1976. Urbana: University of Illinois Press (2001): 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the rhetoric behind criminal syndicalism laws appealed strictly to business interests. After the United States entered the World War I, then Governor of Idaho Moses Alexander instilled nationalist rhetoric into the public discourse of the law while referring to the IWW’s opposition against United States’ participation in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, the Idaho legislature enacted a bill which outlawed non-violent attempts of sabotage; "work done in an improper manner, slack work, waste of property, and loitering at work" became illegal acts.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;  Organized labor opposed the amendment because the expanded definition of sabotage might be applied against recognized trade union practices.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings later limited the applicability of criminal syndicalism laws in Idaho, and criminal syndicalism laws in Idaho became a dead issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
Criminal syndicalism in [[California]] was defined as "any doctrine or precept advocating . . . the commission of crime, sabotage . . . or unlawful acts of force and violence . . . as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial ownership or control, or effecting any political change.” 
Knowingly associating oneself with a group which advocates, teaches, or aids and abed criminal syndicalism could also lead to criminal liability under the California statute.&lt;ref name="Blasi, 655"&gt;Blasi, p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt;

Violators could be punished by up to fourteen years in jail.&lt;ref name="Blasi, 655"/&gt;

The bill’s enactment came after a series of events undermining IWW’s public image.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 1916, [[Preparedness Day Bombing|a bomb exploded in the Preparedness Day parade in San Francisco]]. It led to the arrests of [[Warren K Billings]] and [[Thomas Mooney]] – both of whom were associated with militant labor movement – and two others. The San Francisco public responded with an uproar.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 13"/&gt;

Fresno and Riverside agricultural strikes took place in 1917, months preceding the California criminal syndicalism bill’s first introduction.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt of inducting the criminal syndicalism bill into the California law took place in 1917. The bill was a copy of the Idaho statute. Legislators found the term “sabotage” in the bill ambiguous and did not pass the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the federal government increased crackdowns against IWW on suspicion of the organization’s financial ties with foreign hostiles. The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] conducted raids on IWW headquarters across the country, including bases in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Fresno.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the protests, IWW was accused of sabotaging Fresno famers by burning hay stacks and covering raisins with dirt. The Department of Justice opened its Fresno branch in response. California State Federation of Labor also issued a condemnation of IWW. These events coincided with the bombing of the governor’s residence at Sacramento, which led to arrests of IWW members. The press began to pose a negative attitude towards IWW.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917-19, tension between capital and labor grew. Strikes and IWW activities in key wartime industries increased. The California public invoked a patriotic sentiment and saw IWW as an enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1919, Senator William Kehoe made the second introduction of the criminal syndicalism bill in California. The introduction came five days after the trial of the Governor’s residence bombing, possibly to drown out opposition to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Stephens|Governor William Stephens]] recommended measures to check IWW propaganda in the bill.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 24"&gt;Whitten, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators included his proposed amendment in the final bill.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"&gt;Whitten, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed bill would outlaw labor organization which conduct strikes or boycotts with the intent of changing industrial ownership and control or causing any political change.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"/&gt;

Representatives of organized labor, while supportive of the bill’s intent to reduce IWW influences,&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"/&gt; believed the bill could be used to imprison labor leaders should strikes or boycotts be used in industrial disputes.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 24"/&gt;  Labor leaders proposed an amendment which defined the punishable offense more definitely. The amendment failed to pass.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"/&gt;

Governor Stephens signed the bill containing his proposed clause into law on April 30, 1919.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"/&gt;

=== Kansas ===
The defense by the IWW's [[General Defense Committee]] in the case of [[Fiske v. Kansas]] resulted in a critically important 1924 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling which led to the decline of criminal syndicalism laws as a factor in legislative anti-union initiatives.&lt;ref name="Cortner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cortner |first=Richard C. |date=Spring 1981 |title=The Wobblies and Fiske v. Kansas: Victory Amidst Disintegration |journal=[[Kansas History: A Journal of the Central Plains|Kansas History]] |url=http://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/1981spring_cortner.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=30–38 |access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, [[Kansas]]' state criminal syndicalism law was challenged by a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in the case of [[Fiske v. Kansas]], which would become critically important in the future of legal battles over [[freedom of speech]], and which was an early case supported by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. The ruling overturned the conviction of Harold B. Fiske, an organizer affiliated with the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]'s [[Agricultural Workers Industrial Union]].

=== In 2013 ===
The states who still have criminal syndicalism statutes in 2013 are:
* [[Montana]] ({{Cite web|url = http://leg.mt.gov/bills/1995/mca/45/8/45-8-105.htm|title = M.C.A. 45-8-105}})

Moreover, 
* [[California]] allows the firing of teachers involved in "commi[ting], aiding, or advocating the commission of acts of criminal syndicalism, as prohibited by Chapter 188 of the [[California Criminal Syndicalism Act|Statutes of 1919]], or in any amendment thereof." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=edc&amp;group=44001-45000&amp;file=44930-44988|title = C.C. 44-932(a)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kansas]] allows, by an artifact disposition, the issuance of ''[[subpoena]]s'' for "any alleged violation in this state pertaining to terrorism, illegal use of weapons of mass destruction,..., ''criminal syndicalism''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_22/Article_31/22-3101.html|title = K.S.A. 22-3101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minnesota]] allows courts and state executive to interviene in labor actions "where criminal syndicalism, or the acts constituting the same, are involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://policy.mofcom.gov.cn/english/flaw!fetch.action?id=b6168ea9-f032-4eb2-811c-3c0af1db996a&amp;pager.pageNo=1#minnesota-175-186-185-185_06|title = M.C. 185.06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutionality==

Some argued that criminal syndicalism laws violated the United States Constitution.

In ''Whitney v. California'', 274 U.S. 357 (1927), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that California's law suppressing speech advocating criminal acts against the state did not violate the right to [[freedom of speech]] as enumerated in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], since it encouraged a bad tendency in listeners.

However, that holding ''Whitney'' was overturned in ''Brandenburg v. Ohio'', 395 U.S. 444 (1969), where the Court replaced the "bad tendency" test with "imminent lawless action" test. Since the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism law criminalized speech that did not incite imminent lawless action, the Ohio law violated the Freedom of Speech clause of the First Amendment.

'''Emancipation of minors''' is a legal mechanism by which a [[Minor (law)|minor]] is freed from control by their parents or guardians, and the parents or guardians are freed from any and all responsibility toward the child.&lt;ref name=expertlaw/&gt; Children are considered legally incompetent to enter into contracts and to handle their own affairs. Emancipation overrides that presumption and allows emancipated children to legally make certain decisions on their own behalf.

Even without a court proceeding, some jurisdictions will find a minor to be emancipated for purposes of making a decision in the absence of the minor's parents or guardians. For example, a child in most jurisdictions can enter into a binding contract to procure their own basic needs. However, in such cases where a child's needs are not provided for by a parent, a child will often be deemed a ward of the state and have a court appointed guardian placed in the role of the parent.

==History==

In [[Roman law]] the father of the extended household, the ''[[pater familias]]'', exercised autocratic authority through ''patria potestas'' over his extended family, including his wife, his children and his slaves. Such rights persisted through feudal and English [[common law]], assigning most people the status of personal property (chattel). In common law, emancipation is the freeing of someone from this control. It grants the emancipated the ability to legally engage in civil actions, and frees the former owner of liability.

In common-law jurisdictions, [[chattel slavery]] was abolished during the 19th century and married women were given [[Women's rights|independent rights]] during the 19th and at the start of the 20th century. Later during the 20th century, common law jurisdictions split over both [[children's rights]] and [[youth rights]]; in some, such as the USA, a traditional father's control became a right to shared parental control and emancipation remained a remedy for mature minors, but in others, for example England, the idea of absolute control over minors has been repudiated; parent's responsibilities are emphasised and children's rights promoted. In these jurisdictions, the rights of minors to act on their own behalf are granted on a case-by-case basis if a minor can show the capacity and maturity to handle them, and juvenile emancipation from control is deemed unnecessary.

It isn't as simple as all-or-nothing emancipation in some places and gradually acquired rights in others. For example, in the US minors have some rights to consent to medical procedures without parental consent or emancipation, under the [[Mature minor doctrine|doctrine of the mature minor]]. In England a minor may still not own and administer land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law of Property Act, England, 1925, 1(9)|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in any jurisdiction statute law may limit action due to insufficient age, such as the purchase of alcohol or the right to drive on public roads, without regard to capacity.

The rights of the child described in the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child|UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989]] are recognized and ratified the world over, [[US ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child|except within the USA]], which may explain why even though other jurisdictions recognize parental control and juvenile emancipation, nowhere else is the issue of emancipation so important.

==Global understanding of emancipation  ==

Common law countries that retain the idea of control and emancipation include USA, Canada and South Africa. Countries that have followed the route to gradual civic rights for adolescents include England, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. In these countries emancipation is unavailable. Statutory provision for juvenile emancipation has spread outside of common law jurisdictions, for example Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National law and policies on minimum ages – Brazil |url=http://r2e.gn.apc.org/country-node/312/country-minimum |publisher=Right to Education Project |accessdate=11 February 2018 |date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries some aspects of emancipation are in force. The right to engage in civil acts as an adult are granted after marriage, as is the freedom of liability for the parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knapp |first1=Victor |title=International Encyclopedia of Comparative Law, Chapter 3 |date=1983 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=9024727871 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKoPfh4UuPAC |accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, where there is no lower age limit on marriage, child marriage is sometimes used as a mechanism for emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UNICEF review of legal minimum ages and the realization of adolescents' rights in Latin American countries |url=https://www.unicef.org/lac/20160406_UNICEF_Edades_Minima_Eng(1).pdf |publisher=UNICEF |access-date=11 February 2018 |date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights granted in such cases may not be as full as common-law emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentinian Civil Code, sections 131-135 on emancipation following marriage|url=https://archive.org/stream/argentinecivilc00whelgoog/argentinecivilc00whelgoog_djvu.txt|website=Archive.org|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Routes to emancipation==
'''Express''': When the parent(s) or legal guardian agrees with the minor that the minor can leave home, become self-sustaining, and control their own wages and assets. Courts may review. For example, elements of coercion can void the emancipation, so if a child agrees to leave because their life has been made intolerable through fault, the court may decree the parents still owe a duty of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emancipation or Leaving Home|url=http://ojen.ca/wp-content/uploads/Youth-Agency_Emancipation.pdf|website=Youth Agency and the Culture of Law|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Implied''': When circumstances dictate that a child has become emancipated, even though no explicit agreement was made. Common reasons include
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marriage
&lt;li&gt;Active military service
&lt;li&gt;The minor leaving home and acting in a responsible and self-sustaining manner for a number of months. Reaching a ''de facto'' state of separation without explicit agreement has dangers: a child might be declared a [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]], a parent charged with [[Child neglect|neglect]].
&lt;li&gt;Other reasons may be given by statutory definition or through case law.
&lt;/ul&gt;

'''Court Order''': A court may declare a minor to be emancipated when deciding a relevant case or following a petition of emancipation. Not all jurisdictions that support emancipation allow a direct petition to the courts, for example in Canada only Quebec&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juvenile emancipation in Quebec|url=https://www.educaloi.qc.ca/en/capsules/emancipation-when-teens-get-legal-rights-adult|website=educaloi.qc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; does. Even in those jurisdictions that do, the court may not allow a minor to file on their own behalf (as they are not yet emancipated), nor may they directly instruct a lawyer to act on their behalf. Instead they petition through an adult [[next friend]]. Courts decide in the minor's best interest: between parental control, care through child services (including fostering or adoption), and emancipation.

'''Partial''': A minor may be considered emancipated for some reasons and not others. A grant of partial emancipation may, for example, be given to homeless youths to allow them to consent to state housing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Understanding the Emancipation of a Minor|url=http://www.cookcountycourt.org/Portals/0/County%20Division/emancipation%20zero%20eight.pdf|website=Cook County Circuit Court|publisher=State of Illinois|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage, incarceration, living apart, pregnancy and parenthood may automatically confer some of the rights of emancipation, particularly health consent and privacy in US states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Minor Consent Laws|url=https://www.freelists.org/archives/hilac/02-2014/pdftRo8tw89mb.pdf|publisher=Center for Adolescent Health &amp; the Law|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although allowed for in common law, some of these methods could be almost impossible to use in practice in a particular jurisdiction, especially if it has no relevant statute or case law.

==United States==

Minors are under the control of their parents or legal guardians until they attain the [[age of majority]], at which point they become legal adults. In most states this is upon turning 18 years of age. However, in special circumstances, minors can be freed from control by their guardian before they reach the age of majority.&lt;ref name=expertlaw&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How Can a Minor Get Emancipated|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/juvenile-law/how-can-minor-get-emancipated|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental duties===
Parents have a number of legal duties while bringing up their biological child (e.g., a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the child) . Failure to meet these requirements can result in the state taking civil and/or criminal action against the child's parent(s).  When the "parent" is not the biological parent of the child, such as a stepchild or an informal adoption (not adopted by court order), the matter is more complex; various legal doctrines, as well as statutes in many states may impose various support obligations on step-parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stepfamilies.info/articles/do-i-have-an-obligation-to-support-my-stepchildren.php|website=National Stepfamily Resource Center|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Emancipation terminates these parental obligations and duties of support.

While parents may have expectations of particular conduct or contributions from their children, parents may not condition the provision of basic necessities upon the child conducting or contributing. However they may condition other privileges on particular conduct or contribution by the child. When a child fails to conduct themselves according to rules which ensure their basic safety and the safety of those around them, a parent has recourse to petition a court to declare the child a "person in need of supervision", which essentially transfers guardianship to the state, who in turn subjects the individual to supervision in the form of a group home or in foster care monitored by an officer of the court. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out of Control Teens: PINS and Juvenile Justice System|url=https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/When-a-Teenager-is-Out-of-Control.aspx|website=healthychildren.org|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily discharge parents from their duty of financial support. 

Children who have not reached the age of majority are generally are not able to legally own property, enter into contracts (including enrolment contracts to university), or make certain life altering decisions for themselves, such as the right to marry or to join the armed forces. Such decisions can, in some cases, be made with parental consent (e.g., marriage of child over age 16), and in other cases are proscribed or require a judicial consent (e.g., marriage of child under 13). A legal guardian (including a parent) may dispose of the property (including bank accounts) of the child, generally for the benefit of the child, including the provision of basic necessities.  Wages which a child earns may be considered the child's property or may be required to be turned-over to their parents to satisfy parental claims for costs associated with discharging parental responsibilities, depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Are-parents-entitled-to-their-childrens-paycheck|website=Quora|accessdate=29 April 2018}}. &lt;/ref&gt;  

Upon emancipation, a minor child will no longer be subject to claims by their parent / guardian for contribution out of their wages, and will be granted full authority and legal ownership of their property and bank accounts. They would also gain legal capacity to enter into binding contracts, and have authority to marry or join the armed forces. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Teenager's guide to emancipation|url=https://ctlawhelp.org/en/a-teenagers-guide-to-emancipation|website=CTLawHelp|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Emancipation laws===
The exact laws and protocols for obtaining emancipation vary from state to state. In most states, minors must file a [[petition]] with the family court in the applicable jurisdiction, formally requesting emancipation and citing reasons it is in their best interest to be emancipated. These minors must prove financial self-sufficiency. In some states, free [[legal aid]] is available to minors seeking emancipation, through children law centers. This can be a valuable resource for minors trying to create a convincing emancipation petition. Students are able to stay with a guardian if necessary.

Emancipation is not easily granted because of the subjectivity and narrowness of the definition of "best interest." Some minors have been victims of abuse. In most cases, the state's department of child services will be notified and the child placed in foster care. Others are minors who are seeking emancipation for reasons such as being dissatisfied with their parents' or guardians' rules.

Laws vary by state. In [[California]], a minor cannot use the excuse of not obeying the parent's reasonable and proper orders or directions of parents, and that minor could become a ward of the court, which is different than emancipation.[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=WIC&amp;sectionNum=601]

Where a [[statute of limitations]] for bringing a legal action is [[tolling (law)|tolled]] while a person is a minor, emancipation will usually end that tolling.

Based on federal and state laws, those whose mental disability is so severe that they are incapable of caring for themselves may not necessarily be considered or legally viewed as emancipated, even though they have attained the age of majority. That may or may not affect legal matters related to such things as insurance benefits, SSI, SSDI, wills, tax obligations to them and their [[caregivers]], medical decisions, religious choices, residential and other accommodations, etc. due to their non-emancipated status.

[[File:Hydroton.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Clay pebbles]]

'''Lightweight expanded [[clay]] aggregate''' (LECA) or '''expanded clay''' (exclay) is a light weight [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] made by heating clay to around  {{convert|1200|C|F}} in a [[rotary kiln]]. The yielding gases expand the clay by thousands of small bubbles forming during heating producing a honeycomb structure. LECA has an approximately round or potato shape due to circular movement in the kiln, and is available in different sizes and densities. LECA is used to make lightweight concrete products and other uses.

==History==
LECA was developed about 1917 in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], to the production in a [[rotary kiln]] of a patented expanded [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] known as Haydite which was used in the construction of [[SS Selma (1919)|USS Selma]], an ocean-going ship launched in 1919. Following in the USA was the development of a series of aggregates known as Gravelite, [[Perlite]], Rocklite, etc. In [[Europe]], LECA commenced in [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], UK and [[Middle East]].

==Characteristics==
LECA is usually produced in different sizes and densities from {{convert|0.1|mm|in|3}} up to {{convert|25|mm|in|1}},commonly 0-4 mm, 4-10 mm, 10-25 mm and densities of 250, 280, 330, and 510 kg/m3. LECA ''boulder'' is the biggest size of LECA with 100–500&amp;nbsp;mm size and 500&amp;nbsp;kg/m3 density.

Some characteristics of LECA are: lightness, thermal insulation by low conductivity coefficient (as low as 0.097 W/mK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norliteagg.com/geotech/insulation.asp |title=Geotechnical Fill |website=Norlite Lightweight Aggregate}}&lt;/ref&gt;), soundproofing by high acoustic resistance, moisture impermeable, incompressible under permanent pressure and gravity loads, non–decomposition against severe condition, fire resistant, Ph of nearly 7, freezing and melting resistance, easy movement and transportation, lightweight backfill and finishing, reduction of construction dead load and earthquake lateral load, perfect sweet soil for plants, material for drainage and filtration.

== Uses ==
Common uses are in [[Concrete masonry unit| concrete blocks]], [[concrete slab]]s, geotechnical fillings, [[Autoclaved aerated concrete|lightweight concrete]], water treatment, [[hydroponics]], [[aquaponics]] and [[hydroculture]].
[[File:Fortunaa.jpg|thumb|LECA can be easily used for plant-growing [[Hydroponics#Expanded clay aggregate|substrate]].]]
LECA is a versatile material, and is utilized in an increasing number of applications. In the construction industry, it is used extensively in the production of lightweight concrete, blocks and precast or incast structural elements (panels, partitions, bricks and light tiles). LECA used in structural backfill against foundations, retaining walls, bridge abutments etc., in addition it can reduce earth pressure by 75% compared with conventional materials, and also increases ground stability while reducing settlement and land deformation. LECA can drain the surface water and groundwater to control ground water pressure. LECA grout can be used for flooring (finishing) and roofing with thermal and sound insulation.

LECA is also used in water treatment facilities for the filtration and purification of municipal wastewater and drinking water as well as in other filtering processes, including those for dealing with industrial wastewater and fish farms.  

LECA has uses in agriculture and landscapes. It can alter [[soil mechanics]]. It is used as a growing medium in hydroponics systems, and blended with other growing mediums such as soil and peat to improve drainage, retain water during periods of drought, insulate roots during frost and provide roots with increased oxygen levels promoting very vigorous growth. LECA can be mixed with heavy soil to improve its aeration and drainage.

[[File:Emblem of the Highland Land League (1880s).svg|thumb|The emblem of the Highland Land Law Reform Association]]
The first '''Highland Land League''' ({{lang-gd|Dionnasg an Fhearainn}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary Detail - Dionnasg an Fhearainn|url=http://www.faclair.com/ViewEntry.aspx?ID=28C09D64A92AE13DD511C234E1F82EC7|website=www.faclair.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as a distinct political force in [[Scotland]] during the 1880s, with its power base in the country's [[Highlands and Islands]]. It was known also as the '''Highland Land Law Reform Association''' and the '''Crofters' Party'''. It was consciously modelled on the [[Irish Land League]].

The Highland Land League was successful in getting [[Members of Parliament|Members of Parliament (MPs)]] [[election|elected]] in 1885 (in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]]). As a parliamentary force, it was dissipated by the [[Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886|Crofters' Act]] of 1886 and by the way the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was seen to adopt Land League objectives. The Land League also used [[direct action]] protest tactics and the use of these tactics was to reappear in the early 20th century. The protests included [[rent strike]]s and land occupations (which came to be known as land raids) by [[Croft (land)|crofters]], [[Cotter (farmer)|cottars]] and [[squatter]]s. Perhaps the Land League's best known slogan was ''Is treasa tuath na tighearna''. This [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] saying or proverb is usually translated as ''The people are mightier than a lord''.

==Background==
By the 1880s the common people or [[peasant|peasantry]] of the Highlands and Islands had been cleared from large areas of their ancestral lands, the clearances (known as the [[Highland Clearances]]) having occurred during the decades following the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. Many emigrated to Canada, the USA, as well as Australia and other British colonies. Many who did not emigrate were crammed into crofting townships on very small areas of land where they were very vulnerable to abuse and exploitation by their [[landlord]]s. Many lacked even crofts of their own and became cottars and squatters on the crofts of other people. Landlords turned most of the land over to use as sheep farms and hunting parks called [[deer]] forests. In addition, in the 1880s, the Highlands and Islands were recently ravaged by the [[Highland Potato Famine|potato famine]] of the mid 19th century. The 1880s were also a time, however, of growing [[democracy]] and of government which was increasingly responsive to public opinion, particularly after the [[electoral reform Act of 1884]]. As many crofters in the [[Scottish Highlands]] newly qualified as £10 occupiers, the Act empowered Scottish Gaels to form the [[Crofters' Party]] and Highland Land League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crowley|first1=D.W.|title=The Crofters’ Party - 1885 to 1892 The first British independent common people’s political party|url=http://www.caledonia.org.uk/land/documents/Crofters%27%20Party.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1880s, in terms of gaining sympathetic public opinion, crofters were protesting very effectively, with rent strikes and land raids, about their lack of secure tenure of land and their severely reduced access to land. The government responded in 1883 with a commission of enquiry headed by [[Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier|Francis Napier]], and the [[Napier Commission]] published recommendations in 1884. Napier's report fell a long way short of addressing crofters' demands, and it stimulated a new wave of protests.

==The Crofters' Party==
{{main article|Crofters Party}}

The earlier protests had been largely confined to [[Skye]]. In 1884 protest action was much more widespread, many thousands of crofters became members of the Highland Land League and among [[MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1885]] there were Crofters' Party MPs elected by the [[constituencies]] of [[Argyllshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Argyllshire]] ([[Donald Horne Macfarlane]]), [[Inverness-shire (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverness-shire]] ([[Charles Fraser-Mackintosh]]), [[Ross and Cromarty (UK Parliament constituency)|Ross and Cromarty]] ([[Roderick Macdonald (politician)|Roderick Macdonald]]) and [[Caithness (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness]] ([[Gavin Brown Clark]]). At [[Wick Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Wick Burghs]] [[John Macdonald Cameron]] was also allied with the Crofters Party. A year later Parliament created the Crofters Act.

==The Act of 1886==
{{main article|Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886}}
The Act applied to croft tenure in an area which is now recognisable as a definition of the ''Highlands and Islands'': that of the ancient counties of [[Argyll]], [[Inverness-shire]], [[Ross and Cromarty]], [[Sutherland]], [[Caithness]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]. (The name is used now as a name for an electoral area of the [[Scottish Parliament]]: please see [[Highlands and Islands]]). The Act granted security of tenure of existing crofts and established the first [[Crofters Commission]] (The same name was given to a different body in 1955).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crofting.scotland.gov.uk/ Commission website today]&lt;/ref&gt; The Crofters Commission had rent-fixing powers. Rents were generally reduced and 50% or more of outstanding arrears were cancelled. The Act failed however to address the issue of severely limited access to land, and crofters renewed their protest actions. At the same time there was a shift in the political climate: [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]]'s Liberal government fell from power; the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government was much less sympathetic to the plight of crofters and much more willing to use troops to quell protests. The Liberal Party appeared to adopt and champion Land League objectives and, as a distinct parliamentary force, the Land League fragmented during the 1890s. On the issue of access to land, therefore, little real progress was to be made until after the First World War.

Some resources were put into development of the communications infrastructure of the Highlands and Islands (roads, railways, and harbours) and, in the early years of the 20th century the [[Congested Districts Board (Scotland)|Congested Districts Board]] was able to push through the establishment of new crofting townships on Skye and in the [[Strathnaver]] area of Sutherland. The Congested Districts Board was created in 1897 and can be seen as a precursor to the [[Highlands and Islands Development Board]], which is known now as [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise|Highland and Islands Enterprise (HIE)]].

A new Liberal government, elected in 1906 (in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election)]], abolished the [[Congested Districts Board (Scotland)|Congested Districts Board]] and created the [[Board of Agriculture for Scotland]]. The new board's principal task was supposed to be that of pressing forward with [[land reform]] in the Highlands and Islands. It was largely ineffective. By 1913 crofters were again staging land raids.

==Second League in 1909==
{{main article|Highland Land League (1909)}}

Meanwhile, in Glasgow, in 1909, a second Highland Land League was formed as a [[political party]]. This organisation was a broadly left-wing group that sought the ''restoration of deer forests to public ownership'', ''abolition of plural farms'' and the ''nationalisation of the land''.  Also they resolved to ''resolutely defend crofters facing eviction by their landlords'' and they ''supported [[home rule]] for Scotland''.

During the First World War (1914 to 1918) politicians made lavish promises about reform which would follow the war, and of course many crofters lost their lives in the war itself. After the war the words of politicians did not translate into immediate action, but crofters returning from the war were in no mood to accept government inaction. Land raids began again. To set this Scottish Highland political radicalism in context, the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] was recent history in Ireland, as were the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] [[February Revolution]] and the [[Communist]] [[October Revolution]] in Russia, not to mention the socialist [[Kiel mutiny]], which helped end the First World War and bring about the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]]. With these other events in mind, the Highland Land League, although radical, were positively gentle in their politics compared to radicals in other countries around the same time.

In August 1918 the new Land League had affiliated with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], with four candidates for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1918 general election]] being joint League-Labour.  By the 1920s they had fully merged with Labour, under the promise of autonomy for Scotland were Labour to gain power in the forthcoming years, which however remained unfulfilled, presumably at least partly because although Labour succeeded in forming a government, they failed to gain a majority in the House of Commons.

==Subsequent history==
Land League members were then key to the formation of the [[Scottish National Party]] in 1934. When faced with new land raids the government responded by giving the Board of Agriculture the money and powers to do something like what had been promised. The Board's work was assisted by a downturn in the profitability of sheep farming and, by the late 1920s, perhaps 50,000 [[acre]]s (200&amp;nbsp;km²) of arable land and 750,000 acres (3,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of hill pasture had been given over to establishing new crofts. Most of the new crofts were in the [[Hebrides]], the area where Gaelic best survives into the present day. There at least it became possible to claim that the effects of the clearances had been largely reversed. Crofters benefited also in parts of Caithness, Sutherland, Shetland, and various other localities.

Crofting is still a distinct lifestyle today, and the Scottish Crofting Federation continues to represent crofters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crofting.org/index.php/contact_headoffice SCF website]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''in-chambers opinion''' is an opinion by a single justice or judge of a multi-member appellate court, rendered on an issue that the court's rules or procedures allow a single member of the court to decide. The judge is said to decide the matter "in chambers" because the decision can be issued from the justice's [[chambers (law)|chambers]] without a formal court proceeding.

==Supreme Court of the United States==
Each Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is assigned as the "[[Supreme Court of the United States#Justices as Circuit Justices|Circuit Justice]]" to one or more of the 13 judicial circuits. The role of the Circuit Justice has changed over time, but has included addressing certain types of applications arising within the Circuit.

Under current practice, the Circuit Justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with certain types of applications that, under the Court's rules, may be addressed by a single Justice. These include emergency applications for stays (including requests for stays of execution in death-penalty cases) and injunctions pursuant to the [[All Writs Act]] arising from cases within that circuit, as well as more routine matters such as requests for extensions of time. In the past, Circuit Justices also sometimes ruled on motions for [[bail]] in criminal cases, writs of [[habeas corpus]], and applications for [[writ of error|writs of error]] granting permission to appeal.

Most often, a Justice will dispose of such an application by simply noting that it is "Granted" or "Denied," or by entering a standard form of order unaccompanied by a written opinion. However, a Justice may elect to author an opinion explaining his or her reasons for granting or denying relief. Such an opinion is referred to as an "in-chambers opinion" or an "opinion in chambers." On occasion, Justices have also issued single-Justice in-chambers opinions on other matters, such as explaining why they have chosen not to [[judicial disqualification|recuse]] themselves from participating in a particular case before the Court.

The Justices author and publish fewer in-chambers opinions today than they did during the twentieth century; it has been rare in recent years for there to be more than one or two such opinions published per term.

Since 1969, in-chambers opinions that a Justice wishes to have published have appeared in the Court's official reporter, the ''[[United States Reports]]''. They appear in a separate section at the back of each volume that contains one or more such opinions. Before 1969, in-chambers opinions did not appear in the ''U.S. Reports'', although they were occasionally published in other reporters or in legal periodicals. During the 1990s, the Supreme Court Clerk's Office compiled a collection of in-chambers opinions contained in the Court's records and other sources. The collection was subsequently published in a three-volume edition by the [[The Green Bag|Green Bag]] Press, and is supplemented from time to time.

==Other American appellate courts==
The rules of some other multi-member American appellate courts sometimes authorize a single judge or justice to take certain actions. Sometimes these actions are procedural in nature, such as granting extensions of time or granting or denying permission to file an [[amicus curiae]] brief. In other courts, the powers of a single judge can be more extensive; for example, in the [[New York Court of Appeals]], a single judge rules on a defendant's motion for leave to appeal in a criminal case, and his or her decision is final.

It is relatively unusual for single judges or justices of lower courts to issue opinions explaining their rulings on these matters, but when they do, the designation "in chambers" is sometimes used.

{{Intellectual property}}
Typefaces, [[font]]s, and their [[glyph]]s raise [[intellectual property]] considerations in [[copyright]], trademark, design patent, and related laws. The copyright status of a typeface—and any font file that describes it digitally—varies between jurisdictions. In the United States, the shapes of typefaces are not eligible for copyright, though the shapes may be protected by design patent (although these are rarely applied for, the first US design patent ever awarded was for a typeface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=D0000001&amp;IDKey=F61340F43401&amp;HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect2%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPALL%2526S1%3DD000001.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2FD1%2526RS%3DPN%2FD1|title = Patent #: US0D0000001|date = November 9, 1842|accessdate = November 23, 2014|website = United States Patent and Trademark Office|publisher = United States Patent and Trademark Office|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Typefaces can be protected in other countries, including the UK, Germany, and France, by industrial design protections that are similar to copyright or design patent in that they protect the abstract shapes. Additionally, in the US and in some other countries, computer ''fonts''—the ''digital instantiation'' of the shapes as vector outlines—may be protected by copyright on the computer code that produces them. The name of a typeface may also be protected as a trademark.

==Copyright==

=== Germany ===

In 1981, West-Germany passed the ''Gesetz zum Wiener Abkommen vom 12. Juni 1973 über den Schutz typographischer Schriftzeichen und ihre internationale Hinterlegung'' ("Law on the 1973 Vienna Agreement for the Protection of Type Faces and their International Deposit", also simply known as ''Schriftzeichengesetz'' or "Type Faces Law"), according to which a typeface is initially protected under German copyright law for 10 years from first publication on. After the end of this initial ten-year period, the rights holder may pay a fee to prolong copyright status for additional 15 years only once. According to German law, every typeface thus ends up in the public domain after no more than 25 years from first publication onwards, after which it is also free to be digitized into a computer [[font]], which in itself holds a much higher copyright protection status by German law than analogue typefaces due to being legally classified as a computer program.

The ''name'' of a typeface can separately be registered as a [[trademark]] (''Wortmarke'') for a fee, which like a digital font also holds much higher copyright protection status than an analogue typeface itself. If a typeface's name is trademarked, no other typeface may bear the same name, not even digital clones of the analogue typeface.

=== Ireland ===

[[Irish copyright law]] covers typefaces. Like the United Kingdom law (see below), it allows for using the typeface in the ordinary course of printing. The term of protection is 15 years from first publication.&lt;ref name=irish&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0028/index.html Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000] (Ireland), §§ 84-85. Irishstatutebook.ie,  Accessed January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===

In [[Copyright law of Japan|Japan]], typefaces have been held not to be covered by copyright, on the ground that they function primarily as a means of communicating information, rather than an appeal to aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;''Yagi v. Kashiwa Shobo K.K.'', II-1 Chosakuken Hanreishu 8 (9 Mar. 1979, Tokyo District Court) (the ''Typeface Design Case''), cited in {{cite journal |last=Karjala|first=Dennis S. |author2=Sugiyama, Keiji |title=Fundamental Concepts in Japanese and American Copyright Law |journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |date=Autumn 1988|volume=36|issue=4|pages=613, 625–26|jstor=840277 |doi=10.2307/840277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===

In [[Copyright law of Russia|Russia]] the [[Non liquet|legal vacuum]] with soviet intellectual legacy combined with absence of specific law regulation of the fonts – created the opposite situation, where all typefaces have copyright and payments can be collected by current law. According to the Russian Yur'yev legal bureau, at least 99 [[legal threat]]s by [[Art. Lebedev Studio|Lebedev's design studio]] have been about the use of studio made typefaces in Russia without payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://juryev.ru/intellektualnaya-sobstvennost/182-shrif-objekt-avtorskogo-prava |title=Юридическое бюро Юрьева - Шрифт как объект авторского права |website=Juryev.ru |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===

In [[Copyright law of Switzerland|Switzerland]], there is no specific law for the protection of typefaces. So far, the jurisdiction has been very reluctant in admitting legal protection of any sort to typefaces. However, the denied protection is not imperative: in theory, typefaces could be protected based on both copyright and design law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vblank.ch/articles/font-protection/index-g.html |title=Valentin Blank — Schriftschutz |website=Vblank.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the name of a typeface can be protected by a trademark.

=== United Kingdom ===

In 1916, England recognized copyright in typefaces, but protected only the design with all the letters in their particular order.&lt;ref&gt;"Stephenson, Blake and Co. v. Grant, Legros &amp; Co., 115 L.T.R. 666, 61 Sol. J. 55 (1916), reprinted in E.J. MacGillivray, Copyright Cases 1911-1916 326-329 (1969), aff'd 116 L.T.R. 268 (1917), noted in 13 Eng. and Empire Digest 68, 68-69. The court recognized that the typeface design was subject to copyright under the then-current Copyright Act of 1911, an Act to Amend and Consolidate the Law Relating to Copyright, 1911, 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, ch. 46 (Eng.). However, the plaintiff's victory was hollow. The court held that the copyright protected only the design in its entirety, with all the letters in their particular order. The defendant's embodiment of them into a font of his own, as opposed to a reproduction of the design with the letters in the same order, was held not to infringe. MacGillivray , supra at 327-28."  Terrence J. Carroll, [http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/chtlj/vol10/iss1/5/ Protection For Typeface Designs: A Copyright Proposal], 10 Santa Clara Computer &amp; High Tech. L.J. 139, 169, n.181.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current United Kingdom copyright statute, enacted in 1989, expressly refers to copyrights in typeface designs.&lt;ref name="UK, CDPA 1988, 48, 54"/&gt; English law does consider that fonts are subject to copyright. However, this only covers typefaces for 25 years from first publication, and does not cover their usage by typographers.&lt;ref name="UK, CDPA 1988, 48, 54" &gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/III/crossheading/typefaces Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48), § 54] (England), Legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Typefaces cannot be protected by copyright in the United States ([[Code of Federal Regulations]], [http://frwebgate3.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=36964326810+4+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve Ch 37, Sec. 202.1(e)]; ''Eltra Corp. vs. Ringer''). The idea that typefaces (rather than fonts, which are computer software) cannot be copyrighted in the United States is [[black letter law]]. 37 C.F.R. § 202.1(e). Under U.S. law, [[typefaces]] and their letter forms or [[glyph]]s are considered utilitarian objects whose public utility outweighs any private interest in protecting their creative elements. However, there is a distinction between a font and a typeface. The machine code used to display a stylized typeface (called a font) is protectable as copyright. In 1992, the US Copyright Office determined that digital outline fonts had elements that could be protected as software.&lt;ref name="1992_regulation"&gt;"Registrability of Computer Programs that Generate Typefaces", 57 Fed. Reg. 6201 (Feb. 21, 1992), reproduced in U.S. Copyright Office announcement [http://www.copyright.gov/history/mls/ML-443.pdf ML-443]&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the Office has accepted registration of copyright for digital vector fonts, such as PostScript Type 1, TrueType, and OpenType format files.

This is part of the basis of the 2017 lawsuit brought by Berthold LLC against Target Corporation for its alleged unlawful use of its fonts. ''Berthold v. Target'', no. 1:17-cv-07180 (N.D. Ill.). It is also part of the basis for an unpublished 1998 opinion by Judge Whyte in ''[[Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc.]]'', finding that Adobe Software held a valid copyright for its Utopia ''font'' and that it had been infringed by the defendant(s) in that case. 

Historically, the unavailability of protection for typefaces reaches back to at least 1976. In 1988, the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] published a report titled, ''Policy Decision on Copyrightability of Digitized Typefaces'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/history/mls/ML-393.pdf |format=PDF |title=Notice of Policy Decision on Copyrightability of Digitized Typefaces |website=Copyright.gov |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explains: "The decision in ''Eltra Corp. v. Ringer'' clearly comports with the intention of the Congress. Whether typeface designs should be protected by copyright was considered and specifically rejected by Congress in passing the Copyright Act of 1976. The 1976 House Report states: A "typeface" can be defined as a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic characters, whose forms are related by repeating design elements consistently applied in a notational system, and are intended to be embodied in articles whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for use in composing text or other cognizable combinations of characters. The Committee does not regard the design of typeface, as thus defined, to be a copyrightable "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work" within the meaning of this bill and the application of the dividing line in section 101 [H.R. Reg. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess 5 (1976)].

In addition to rejecting copyright protection for typeface designs, Congress deferred a decision on a more limited form of protection under proposed ornamental design legislation. Title II of the 1976 copyright revision bill as passed by the Senate could have protected typeface designs, but the House of Representatives had doubts about this limited form of protection. Consequently, only copyright revision passed. [H.R. Reg. No. 1476 at 50 and 55]. Design legislation has yet to be enacted, and Congress has chosen not to include typeface designs within the Copyright Act's definition of pictorial, graphic or sculptural works."&lt;ref name=us-co-policy&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Policy Decision on Copyrightability of Digitized Typefaces

According to section 906.4 of the ''[[Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices]]'', [[typography]] and [[calligraphy]] are also not copyrightable in themselves.&lt;ref name="Compendium313.6C2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copyright.gov/comp3/chap900/ch900-visual-art-122214.pdf |title=Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, § 906.4 ("Typeface, Typefont, Lettering, Calligraphy, and Typographic Ornamentation") |page=13 |publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]] |date=December 22, 2014 |accessdate=December 22, 2014 |quote=The copyright law does not protect typeface or mere variations of typographic ornamentation or lettering.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design patents==
Typefaces may be protected by a [[design patent]] in many countries (either automatically, by registration, or by some combination thereof). A design patent is the strongest system of protection, but the most uncommon. It is the only US legal precedent that protects the actual design (the design of the individual shapes of the letters) of the font.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; A prominent example is the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oami.europa.eu/en/design/faq/faq01.htm#200 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406114320/http://oami.europa.eu/en/design/faq/faq01.htm |date=2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the automatic protection (without registration) expires after three years and can be extended (by registration) up to 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oami.europa.eu/en/design/faq/faq01.htm#500 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406114320/http://oami.europa.eu/en/design/faq/faq01.htm |date=2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Germany passed a special extension (''Schriftzeichengesetz'') to the design patent law (''Geschmacksmustergesetz'') for protecting typeface designs. This also permits typefaces to be registered as designs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Trademarks ==
The names of particular fonts may be protected by a [[trademark]]. This is the weakest form of protection because only the font name itself is being protected.  For example, the letters that make up the trademarked font Palatino can be copied but the name must be changed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[URW++]] was involved in a 1995 lawsuit with [[Monotype Corporation]] for cloning their fonts and naming them with a name starting with the same three letters. As typeface shapes themselves cannot be copyrighted in the United States, the lawsuit centered on [[trademark infringement]]. A US court decided that Monotype's trademarks were "fanciful" and did not have descriptive value of the actual products. However it also decided that URW was confusing the public deliberately because "the purloining of the first part of a well-known trademark and the appending of it to a worthless suffix is a method of trademark poaching long condemned by the courts." The court issued an injunction preventing URW from using their chosen names.&lt;ref name="Graham1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence D. Graham|title=Legal Battles that Shaped the Computer Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6IS3RnN6qAC&amp;pg=PA47|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-56720-178-9|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing ==
The basic standard for copyrighted digital font use is that a license is required for each individual font used on a computer, or in the case of businesses, one per entity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaultney |first=Victor |url=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=UNESCO_Font_Lic|title=Font Licensing and Protection Details |work=Sil International and UNESCO |date=October 31, 2003 |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the license fonts are typically licensed only for use on one computer. These [[End User License Agreement]]s (EULAs) generally state that fonts may only be used on machines that have a valid license.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; These fonts cannot be shared by multiple computers or given to others. These licenses can be obtained in three ways: directly from the font authors (e.g., [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]), as part of a larger software package (e.g., [[Microsoft Office]]), or through purchasing or downloading the font from an authorized outlet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Such licenses typically only apply to the font file itself (which is a computer program), and not to the shape of the typeface, which may be subject to a design patent.

==Lawsuits==
From 1993 to 1995, [[Bitstream Inc.]] and four other type companies successfully sued [[SWFTE]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; SWFTE was using special computer programs to take other type founders' fonts, convert them and give them new names.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The case focused on the fact that SWFTE had used Bitstream's software to create these new fonts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

''[[Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc.]]'' helped clear the distinction between intellectual property protection for a font versus a typeface.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; SSI had used the FontMonger program to copy and rename fonts from Adobe and others.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They assumed safety from prosecution because, though they had directly copied the points that define the shapes from Adobe's fonts, they had made slight adjustments to all the points so they were not technically identical.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Nevertheless, it was determined that the computer code had been copied.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="adobe_v_ssi_opinion"&gt;''[http://lw.bna.com/lw/19980303/9520710.htm Adobe Systems, Inc. v.

Hasbro, Inc. |website=Torrentfreak.com |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; Font Brothers filed a lawsuit against [[Hasbro]], claiming that Hasbro used the “Generation B” font for its [[My Little Pony]] product without permission. Font Brothers claimed that Hasbro had refused to comply with their licensing request. They are also claiming substantial damages, from loss of revenue for this misuse, and requesting a jury trial to resolve this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/my-little-pony-sued-for-using-a-pirated-font-160125/|title="My Little Pony" Sued For Using a Pirated Font - TorrentFreak|work=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, Berthold LLC sued Target Corporation for its alleged breach of a font license agreement. ''Berthold LLC v. Target Corp.'', No. 1:17-cv-07180 (N.D. Ill.). Target recognized the distinction between a font and a typeface, and what is protectable under U.S. copyright laws. (See docket entry no. 21).

The '''International Plant Protection Convention''' ('''IPPC''') is a 1951 [[multilateral treaty]] overseen by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] that aims to secure coordinated, effective action to prevent and to control the introduction and spread of [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s of plants and plant products. The Convention extends beyond the protection of cultivated plants to the protection of natural flora and plant products. It also takes into consideration both direct and indirect damage by pests, so it includes weeds.

The Convention created a governing body consisting of each party, known as the '''Commission on Phytosanitary Measures''', which oversees the implementation of the Convention. As of August 2017, the Convention has 183 parties, which includes 180 [[United Nations member states]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], and the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/&lt;/ref&gt;. The Convention is recognized by the World Trade Organization's (WTO) [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]] (the SPS Agreement) as the only international standard setting body for plant health.

While the IPPC's primary focus is on plants and plant products moving in international trade, the Convention also covers research materials, biological control organisms, germplasm banks, containment facilities, food aid, emergency aid and anything else that can act as a vector for the spread of plant pests – for example, containers, packaging materials, soil, vehicles, vessels and machinery.

The IPPC was created by member countries of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations. The IPPC places emphasis on three core areas: international standard setting, information exchange and capacity development for the implementation of the IPPC and associated international phytosanitary standards.  The Secretariat of the IPPC is housed at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy, and is responsible for the coordination of core activities under the IPPC work program.

In recent years the Commission of Phytosanitary Measures of the IPPC has developed a strategic framework with the objectives of:
* protecting sustainable agriculture and enhancing global food security through the prevention of pest spread;
* protecting the environment, forests and biodiversity from plant pests;
* facilitating economic and trade development through the promotion of harmonized scientifically based phytosanitary measures, and:
* developing phytosanitary capacity for members to accomplish the preceding three objectives.

By focusing the Convention's efforts on these objectives, the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures of the IPPC intends to:
*Protect farmers from economically devastating pest and disease outbreaks.
*Protect the environment from the loss of species diversity.
*Protect ecosystems from the loss of viability and function as a result of pest invasions.
*Protect industries and consumers from the costs of pest control or eradication.
*Facilitate trade through International Standards that regulate the safe movements of plants and plant products.
*Protect livelihoods and food security by preventing the entry and spread of new pests of plants into a country.

'''Kinetic military action''' is a [[euphemism]] for [[military]] action involving active warfare, usually including lethal force. "'''Kinetic'''" was used as a [[Retronym|retronymic]] euphemism for military action in ''Bush at War,'' a 2002 book by [[Bob Woodward]]. Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] used the words "kinetic" and "non-kinetic" often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/11/birth_of_a_washington_word.html|title=Birth of a Washington Word|last=Noah|first=Timothy|date=November 20, 2002|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=October 30, 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is now also commonly used as a contrast to [[cyber warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityweek.com/cyberwar-breaching-kinetic-barrier "Cyberwar: Breaching the Kinetic Barrier"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Cyber-Warfare.htm "A Brief Summary of Cyber Warfare"]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kinetic military action" was used by White House aide [[Ben Rhodes (speechwriter)|Ben Rhodes]] on March 23, 2011 to describe U.S. military action in [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Libya]]:{{Quote|I think what we are doing is enforcing a resolution that has a very clear set of goals, which is protecting the Libyan people, averting a humanitarian crisis, and setting up a no-fly zone...

Retrieved May 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This use was noted by news media: "'Kinetic military action' is still hell"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/editorials/kinetic_military_action_is_still_m5xY8QTxTK35Y5VympnGbK 'Kinetic military action' is still hell]", ''New York Post'', March 26, 2011.

Retrieved May 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] used "kinetic operations" on a webpage about "[[Operation Inherent Resolve]]". It contained an interactive graphic titled "AIRSTRIKES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA" and captioned "... operations related to [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] since kinetic operations started on Aug. 8, 2014 ...".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2014/0814_iraq/ OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE]".

February 11, 2015 [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] used "kinetic strike" in a letter to Congress. He wanted, among other things, Congress to "authorize the use of U.S. forces [against [[ISIL]]] in ... [ground] missions to enable kinetic strikes".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/11/letter-president-authorization-use-united-states-armed-forces-connection Letter from the President -- Authorization for the Use of United States Armed Forces in connection with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]".

December 2, 2015 [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] spoke after attending a series of [[NATO]] meetings in Brussels, “There are various ways in which countries can contribute; they don’t necessarily have to be troops, engaged in kinetic action.

'''Legal protection insurance''' ('''LPI'''), also known as '''legal expenses insurance''' ('''LEI''') or simply '''legal insurance''', is a particular class of insurance &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32009L0138&amp;from=EN|title=Non-life insurance classes are listed in Annex II of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II Directive)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which facilitates access to law and justice by providing legal advice and covering legal costs of a dispute, regardless of whether the case is brought by or against the policyholder. Depending on the national rules, legal protection insurers can also represent the policyholder out-of-court or even in-court.

== History ==
Legal protection insurance has a 100-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://riad-online.eu/fileadmin/documents/homepage/News_and_publications/Reports_Information/general_publications/Historical_brochure.pdf|title=Legal expenses insurance: origins and development|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept originated in 1911 when members of the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Automobile Club de l’Ouest''' were offered several additional services among which protection in case of fines or for disputes in front of police courts. This basic legal protection was then extended to traffic accidents and gave rise to the first legal protection insurance policy in France offered by ‘''La Défense Automobile et Sportive (DAS)''’ which was founded in 1917. ‘''La Défense Automobile et Sportive (DAS)''’ offered legal services and coverage of expenses for legal prosecution to car drivers and athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histoire de la défense automobile et sportive|last=Auffret|first=Marc|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, a motoring club in Germany called the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Deutsche Automobil Schutz''' (D.A.S.) increased membership contributions to create a similar pool to pay for the defence of its members charged with traffic related offences. Members of the general public then enquired about joining the scheme. That is when the idea of an insurance available to the general public became firmly established. At present, D.A.S. Germany is still the largest legal protection insurer in the world, followed by ARAG, another German insurer. Legal protection insurance is today well established in Europe and has been developing beyond. The German market alone has 36% market share worldwide, followed by France with 12%. The European market represents more than 80% of the global legal protection insurance market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://riad-online.eu/industry-data/statistics/|title=RIAD - International Association of Legal Expenses Insurance: Statistics|website=riad-online.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and Scope==
Legal protection insurers cover the costs (e.g. legal fees and expenses of a lawyer) incurred in case of an unforeseen legal matter. These costs usually include lawyer and court fees, witness expenses, translation costs or expert fees. Depending on national law, legal protection insurers also provide legal services and represent policyholders out-of-court or in-court. The policyholder is usually protected for disputes in several areas of law such as [[Contract Law|contract]], [[Labour law|labour]], [[Consumer Law|consumer]] and [[family law]] (in rare cases including [[divorce]]). The premium is generally paid on an annual basis.

The extent of the cover depends on the type of contract and is defined in the policy terms and conditions. When the policy is sold as part of a home, motor or travel insurance package (i.e. add-on policy) it only covers disputes strictly linked to the purpose of the main cover (e.g. home related claims such as disputes with neighbours or car related disputes in case of a motor legal protection insurance). When legal protection insurance is purchased as a separate and independent insurance product (stand-alone cover) the range of services provided, the extent and scope of the cover are much larger. Sometimes legal protection insurance is offered as a benefit to members of a trade union or association.

In the European Union precise rules govern legal protection insurance and explicitly define how insurers must organise their business and manage claims. These rules are included in the [[Solvency II Directive 2009|Solvency II Directive]] (Articles 198 - 205) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32009L0138&amp;from=EN|title=Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) (Text with EEA relevance)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal protection insurance should not be confused with the coverage often included in a liability insurance. Liability coverage is designed to protect the policyholder against losses resulting from acts or omissions that are negligent and that result in damage to another person, his/her property or interests. Therefore, the main scope of third party liability insurance is to protect others from the consequences of the policyholder’s wrong-doing. In other words, the third-party liability insurance reimburses the other party’s damages which were caused by a negligent act of the insured. It does not intervene to protect the property and interests of the policyholder, except against being held liable for the other party’s damages. It will also provide legal representation and pay the cost of defense of the policyholder if the policyholder is sued as a result of being involved in an accident because losing the liability claim would be detrimental for the liability insurer since he would have to bear the financial consequences. The liability insurer, however, does not assist the policyholder to seek justice as a plaintiff in case he suffered a damage.

== Different Forms of Legal Protection Insurance ==
Different forms of legal protection insurance exist and have developed depending on the national jurisdictions. Traditionally, legal protection insurance covers unforeseen events as Before-The-Event insurance (BTE). The ‘event’ in this case being the incident triggering the legal action. However, in some countries (e.g. Australia, Canada, and the UK), it is also possible to obtain cover after a legal dispute has been initiated which is described as After-The-Event insurance (ATE). In the US market, legal protection and support is often granted via legal plans or pre-paid legal services which, most of the time, are not an insurance.

=== ‘Before-The-Event’ Legal Protection Insurance ===
This form of insurance is the most widespread. It covers those wishing to protect themselves against possible future claims and it is purchased before the prospect of any legal dispute. It supports the policyholder either by providing legal advice or even by representing the policyholder in-court or out-of-court. It also covers the costs and expenses of legal proceedings.

=== ‘After-The-Event’ Legal Protection Insurance ===
ATE policies insure legal actions relating to events that have already happened. This insurance covers an already existing dispute where, however, proceedings have not yet started or significant legal costs or disbursements have not been incurred. Should the case fail, ATE insurance protects the insured against the risk of having to pay own expenses and adverse costs. This type of cover is usually only available for disputes having high prospects of success where the insurer is likely to be able to recover his costs from the adverse party. It is available in Australia, Canada, and the UK. In the UK solicitors who take on, for example, personal injury cases on a ‘[[no win no fee]]' basis, may require their clients (whether defendants or plaintiffs) to take out 'ATE insurance' so that costs will be covered if the case is lost. The premium payments, especially in a 'no win no fee' arrangement, may be deferred until the conclusion of the case; thus in most cases the premium itself is self-insured. This insurance is often offered by solicitors and [[claims management company|claims management companies]]. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/contents/enacted|title=Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which came into force on 1 April 2013) introduced an important change regarding the recoverability of the premium: before the Act went into force the policyholder could recover the premium paid from the losing party whilst now the premium has to be paid by the client out of any damages received.

== Legal Protection Insurance in Europe ==
The European market is by far the most developed, with Germany, France and the Netherlands, representing respectively 43%, 14%, and 8% of the market. According to a survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://riad-online.eu/fileadmin/documents/homepage/events/past_events/2017_Dubin/Ipsos_web.pptx.pdf|title=Consumer Perception of Legal Issues and Legal Protection Insurance in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Ireland|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned by RIAD and conducted by Ipsos in August 2017 in Germany, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands, over a quarter of respondents had a legal dispute in the past 5 years. The replies showed that in all 4 countries people are mainly concerned about the costs of a dispute, this is particularly true in Ireland (50% of respondents) where fees for lawyers are extremely high. In comparison to the other countries, Dutch citizens are particularly wary of wasting time and energy (33%) while Germans are overly afraid of being deprived of their rights (27% compared to 18% in Ireland and only 10% and 8% in France and the Netherlands). Dutch respondents said that a legal protection insurer is the first point of reference if they have a legal dispute which shows the high appreciation Dutch people have for the services of legal protection insurers. This as well as the high quality of legal protection insurers in the Netherlands was confirmed by a survey commissioned in 2016 by the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice. According to this survey employed lawyers of legal protection insurers scored highest in regard of the perceived quality of services as well as on the basis of a peer review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2017/01/18/lagere-drempels-voor-rechtzoekenden-wodc-cahier-2016-14|title=Lagere drempels voor rechtzoekenden (WODC Cahier 2016-14)|last=Veiligheid|first=Ministerie van Justitie en|website=www.rijksoverheid.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK is the only country where legal protection insurance is primarily marketed directly to the end user (no intermediaries). The focus is on preventive dispute resolution via in-house lawyers. 80% of issues are resolved in-house. In its report of November 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cjc-bte-report.pdf|title=The Law and Practicalities of Before-The-Event (BTE) Insurance|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;‘The Law and Practicalities of Before-The-Event (BTE) Insurance – An Information Study’ the UK Civil Justice Council concludes that legal protection insurance offers many people access to significant legal assistance. To this end, LPI's legal helplines are filling a real gap in the marketplace and in this regard insurers considerably improve access to justice in the current landscape. The report also sees a general lack of awareness among consumers about the existence of a legal protection cover as such as well as about the scope of the coverage. The report underlines that all stakeholders (lawyers, brokers, insurers, the Law Society, and the advice sector) can actively contribute to improving the awareness of legal protection insurance. With this the report confirms prior findings of two previous reports (Thematic Review of the UK's Motor Legal Expenses Insurance industry by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/thematic-reviews/tr13-01.pdf|title=Motor Legal Expenses Insurance (MLEI) Report on the thematic project|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Report of the UK [[Ministry of Justice]] published in October 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/legal-exp-ins-report.htm|title=Legal expenses insurance report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110204175634/http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/legal-exp-ins-report.htm|archive-date=2011-02-04|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).The FCA saw that many consumers were not able to distinguish between the cover of motor insurance (protection against liability for third-party damages) and motor legal protection insurance (pursuit of claims to recover uninsured losses and protection against criminal prosecution). The 2007 report of the Ministry of Justice comes to the result that, although 59% of the UK population have some form of legal protection insurance (whether they knew it or not), fewer than one in four consumers had ever heard of BTE nor of ATE insurance. The Ministry's research estimated that 28 million British adults have actually BTE insurance, mostly as an add-on to another insurance policy.

== Legal Protection Insurance Outside Europe ==
Legal protection insurance has gained significant importance in several countries outside Europe: Canada, Japan, South Africa and USA. It is also emerging in Australia, Chile, China, New Zealand and South Korea.

The Japanese market had a gross written premium of around 600 million euros in 2016, which makes of Japan the fifth biggest market after Germany, France, USA and the Netherlands. In 2016, legal protection cover added-on to motor insurance represented 90% of the market share; this is due to the fact that stand-alone insurance has only been introduced during in the last decade.

The Canadian market has been growing rapidly and several companies (some native, some US-based) offer legal protection insurance. In 2016 legal protection insurance gross written premium was around 56 million Canadian dollars; compared to the previous year almost double. In order to promote further access to justice, in 2013, the [[Canadian Bar Association]] partnered with a Canadian licensed specialist legal protection insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cba.org/News-Media/Press-Releases/2013/DAS-Canada-sponsors-Canadian-Bar-Association-Acces|title=Canadian Bar Association - DAS Canada sponsors Canadian Bar Association Access to Justice Initiative|website=CBA-NA|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Québec]], legal protection insurance is both endorsed and promoted by Québec's [[law society]] ([[bar association]]), ''[[Bar of Quebec|Le Barreau du Québec]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legalinsurancebarreau.com/|title=L'assurance juridique - Une protection contre les aléas de la vie courante|last=|first=|date=|website=Le Barreau du Québec|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pioneer of legal protection insurance in South Africa is LegalWise which introduced a basic legal protection cover in the late 1970’s.

The USA market is dominated by pre-paid legal services/ legal plans and legal protection insurance is now starting to emerge. Legal plans are largely offered in the USA and usually provide for specific events, like drafting a contract or a will, while legal protection insurance covers unforeseen events (e.g. employment or consumer disputes). Legal plans rely mainly on bulk savings (for instance mass purchasing of legal services or in-house counsel for a specified group of people, such as trade union members) rather than on insurance principles, i.e. they do not include guarantees like insurance but provide cover only until the accumulated funds are used up. Legal plans are offered by trade unions as a free benefit of union membership or they are set up by groups of people having a common interest, like university students.

'''Legal plunder''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/frdric-bastiat-on-legal-plunder|author=David Hart|title=Frédéric Bastiat on Legal Plunder|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the act of appropriating, under the laws, the property of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/frdric-bastiat-on-legal-plunder|author=David Hart|title=Frédéric Bastiat on Legal Plunder|accessdate=2014-04-30|quote=the State (which he often wrote as THE STATE) is a vast machine that is purposely designed to take the property of some people without their consent and to transfer it to other people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was coined by [[Frédéric Bastiat]], most famously in his 1850 book [[The Law (book)|''The Law'']]. It has since become a concept in [[libertarianism|libertarian thought]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/legal-plunder Legal Plunder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/61/3057-legal-plunder Legal Plunder]&lt;/ref&gt;, and has been used similarly by others, including [[Daniel Lord Smail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674737280 Legal Plunder: Households and Debt Collection in Late Medieval Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is the appropriation of the assets of another person by power groups through rules of public law that violate the principle of equality and the Constitution.

Throughout history there are many examples of legal [[plunder]] as the political and economic regimes that have followed: partial legal plunder are the result of tyranny and protectionism or universal legal plunder the result of socialism or communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 15 - Partial plunder. This is the system that prevailed so long as the elective privilege was partial; a system that is resorted to, to avoid the invasion of socialism. Universal plunder. We have been threatened by this system when the elective privilege has become universal; the masses having conceived the idea of making law, on the principle of legislators who had preceded them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the thought of Frédéric Bastiat==
Frédéric Bastiat thought that the law can only implement the individual rights: personality, liberty, and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 2 - If every man has the right of defending, even by force, his person, his liberty, and his property, a number of men have the right to combine together to extend, to organize a common force to provide regularly for this defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, if the law goes against the person, liberty, property, it becomes perverse as it goes against the rights that should be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 3 - For who will dare to say that force has been given to us, not to defend our rights, but to annihilate the equal rights of our brethren? And if this be not true of every individual force, acting independently, how can it be true of the collective force, which is only the organized union of isolated forces?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For him ''The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense''.

So he prefers a government that intervenes as little as possible in the sphere of people, liberty, and property.

Every citizen is therefore responsible for his fortune or his failures.

Frédéric Bastiat to defend his idea of what should be the purpose of the law, has set a specific definition of "''legal plunder''".

First he defines "''extra-legal plunder''" "such as theft, or swindling, which is defined, foreseen, and punished by the penal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 13 - As to extralegal plunder, such as theft, or swindling, which is defined, foreseen, and punished by the penal code, I do not think it can be adorned by the name of socialism. It is not this that systematically threatens the foundations of society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that case, "magistracy, police, gendarmerie, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds" are the instrument of the State used against the plunderer and to defend the plundered party.

Legal plunder is when the law "''takes from some persons that which belongs to them, to give to others what does not belong to them.''"

Examples of legal plunder include protectionist tariffs, redistributive taxation, crony capitalism, welfare, etc., which Bastiat terms (only two years after the publication of the Communist Manifesto, and before it was a firm political science term of art), "socialism:"
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now, legal plunder may be exercised in an infinite multitude of ways. Hence come an infinite multitude of plans for organization; tariffs, protection, perquisites, gratuities, encouragements, progressive taxation, free public education, right to work, right to profit, right to wages, right to assistance, right to instruments of labor, gratuity of credit, etc., etc. And it is all these plans, taken as a whole, with what they have in common, legal plunder, that takes the name of socialism.

Now socialism, thus defined, and forming a doctrinal body, what other war would you make against it than a war of doctrine? You find this doctrine false, absurd, abominable. Refute it. This will be all the easier, the more false, absurd, and abominable it is. Above all, if you wish to be strong, begin by rooting out of your legislation every particle of socialism which may have crept into it—and this will be no light work.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2018-07-09|quote=p. 14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In that case, "magistracy, police, gendarmerie, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds" are the instrument of the State to defend the plunderer and treat the plundered party that tries to defend his property as a criminal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46088">The following are settlements reached with US authorities against [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] to resolve allegations of [[Off-label use|"off-label"]] promotion of drugs. Under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], it is illegal for pharmaceutical companies to promote their products for uses not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and corporations that market drugs for off-label indications may be subject to civil liability under the [[False Claims Act]] as well as criminal penalties.

==Off-label promotion settlements under the False Claims Act==
Descriptions of the lawsuits are listed in chronological order.

=== Parke-Davis, Warner-Lambert and Pfizer: Off-label promotion of Neurontin, May 2004 ===
{{main|Franklin v. Parke-Davis}}
In 1996, whistleblower [[David Franklin (scientist)|David Franklin]] left his position as a medical liaison with [[Parke-Davis]], a pharmaceutical division of [[Warner-Lambert Company]], after learning of the company's marketing strategy to promote the epilepsy drug [[Neurontin]] for uses not approved by the FDA.&lt;ref name="BMJ_20030322"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lenzer J |title=Whistleblower charges drug company with deceptive practices |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7390 |pages=620 |date=2003-03-22 |pmid=12649230 |pmc=1125531 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7390.620 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin and his attorney, Thomas M. Greene, filed a lawsuit, [[Franklin v. Parke-Davis]], under the False Claims Act in federal [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|district court]] in Boston. In the first off-label promotion case ever litigated in a whistleblower suit under the False Claims Act, the settlement was announced after eight years of litigation in May 2004. Warner-Lambert agreed to pay $430 million to resolve all civil and criminal liability, with $24.64 million going to Franklin for his participation in the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2004/May/04_civ_322.htm|title=Warner-Lambert to Pay $430 Million to Resolve Criminal &amp; Civil Health Care Liability Relating to Off-Label Promotion |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|date=13 May 2004|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, it is one of the [[List of largest pharmaceutical settlements in the United States|largest recoveries against a pharmaceutical company]] in U.S. history. The total settlement remains the largest against a pharmaceutical company in a non-intervened False Claims Act case, but a July 2017 settlement against Celgene Corporation exceeds it, as the civil settlement in that case was $280 million while the civil component of the Parke-Davis case settled for $190 million.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of largest civil only pharmaceutical settlements]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}}

=== Serono: Off-label promotion of Serostim, October 2005 ===
[[Serono]], a Swiss biotechnology company, obtained approval from the FDA for the drug [[Serostim]] in 1996 to treat [[Cachexia|AIDS wasting]], a condition in which [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] patients experience rapid weight loss.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lichtblau|first=Eric|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/18/business/18drug.html|title=Settlement in Marketing of a Drug for AIDS|date=18 October 2005|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, around the same time, the advent of more robust [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]] that could interact in AIDS cocktails to markedly slow the advancement of the syndrome led to a decline in symptoms of AIDS wasting and, consequently, demand for Serostim.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; As a result, according to prosecutors, Serono devised a marketing scheme by which the definition of AIDS wasting would be changed to measure a loss in "body cell mass." The company then created a computerized medical test designed to detect loss of body cell mass and thereby diagnose AIDS wasting even in patients who had not experienced any weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2005/October/05_civ_545.html |title=SERONO TO PAY $704 MILLION FOR THE ILLEGAL MARKETING OF AIDS DRUG |date=17 October 2005 |publisher=justice.gov |accessdate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102113937/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2005/October/05_civ_545.html |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serono ultimately agreed to pay $704 million to resolve all civil and criminal liability. Five whistleblowers, all former employees of Serono, initiated complaints under the False Claims Act, ultimately leading to the government's investigation. The whistleblowers shared in a $51 million reward from the settlement.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

=== Schering-Plough: Off-label promotion of Intron A and Temodar, August 2006 ===
[[Schering-Plough]] pleaded guilty to one count of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to make false statements to the [[Medicaid]] program in connection with the pricing of its allergy drug [[Loratadine|Claritin]]. Allegations of off-label promotion, however, centered on the off-label promotion of several cancer drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krasner|first=Jeffrey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/business/worldbusiness/30iht-drug.2639326.html|title=Schering-Plough pleads guilty to conspiracy|date=30 August 2006|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug [[Temodar]], which was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] in 1999 for treatment of a specific type of brain tumor, was allegedly being promoted as a treatment for other types of brain cancer for which it had not been approved. Schering-Plough allegedly promoted [[Intron A]], meanwhile, for use in superficial [[bladder cancer]] and [[hepatitis C]].

=== InterMune: Off-label promotion of Actimmune, October 2006 ===
In 2007, [[Hoffmann-La Roche|InterMune]] abandoned all efforts to develop the drug [[Actimmune]], which goes by the generic name of Interferon-gamma, as a treatment for [[Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis|idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)]], a chronic lung condition, after experimental trials showed the drug was ineffective at treating the disease.&lt;ref name="Pollack March 2007"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pollack|first=Andrew|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/business/06drug.html|title=Drug Maker Stops Work on Lung Disease Medicine|date=6 March 2007|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was announced after the company agreed to pay $36.9 million to resolve criminal charges and civil liability in connection with InterMune's off-label promotion of the drug, which had only been approved by the FDA to treat chronic granulomatous disease and severe malignant osteopetrosis, both extremely rare illnesses which would have generated sales of only $20 million a year.

=== Medicis Pharmaceutical: Off-label promotion of Loprox, May 2007 ===
This settlement of $9.8 million resolved allegations that [[Medicis Pharmaceutical]] promoted [[Loprox]], a topical skin preparation, for use on children under the age of 10 despite the fact that use in children under 10 had not been approved by the FDA. According to the government and the whistleblower complaint filed by four former Medicis sales representatives under the False Claims Act, pediatricians were urged to prescribe Loprox as a treatment for diaper rash.&lt;ref name="Justice May 2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2007/May/07_civ_336.html|title=Medicis Pharmaceutical To Pay U.S. $9.8 Million to Resolve False Claims Allegations|date=8 May 2007|publisher=justice.gov|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four relators shared a $1,078,000 reward for providing information in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Justice May 2007"/&gt;

=== Orphan Medical and Jazz Pharmaceuticals: Off-label promotion of Xyrem, July 2007 ===
[[Orphan Medical]], a subsidiary of [[Jazz Pharmaceuticals]], pleaded guilty to felony misbranding under the FDCA and agreed to pay $20 million to resolve all civil claims and criminal charges in connection with [[Xyrem]], a drug approved by the FDA for narcolepsy and the street version of which is classified by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] as a Schedule I drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berenson|first=Alex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/14/business/14jazz.html|title=Maker of Narcolepsy Drug Pleads Guilty in U.S. Case|date=14 July 2007|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the drug's distribution as a narcolepsy medication is strictly regulated, the complaint filed under the False Claims Act alleged that the company promoted the drug as a treatment for [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[insomnia]], and [[fibromyalgia]].

This case was later overturned as the drug was found to be effective for insomnia and fibromyalgia. In 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals further expanded First Amendment commercial speech protection in the realm of pharmaceutical marketing in United States v. Caronia. The court overturned a pharmaceutical sales representative’s conviction arising from a recording of his promotion of off-label use of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) to a group of doctors. Xyrem was approved for the indication of excessive daytime sleepiness, but Caronia promoted it for insomnia and fibromyalgia. The court held that convicting the sales representative for off-label marketing that was not untruthful or misleading violated his First Amendment rights. In contrast, off-label promotion that is untruthful and misleading would be fraudulent, and thus not protected by the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/07/19/fda-sanctions-off-label-drug-promotion/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Johnson &amp; Johnson: Off-label promotion of Risperdal, Invega and Natrecor, November 2013 ===
[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] agreed to pay $1.391 billion to resolve false claims resulting from its off-label promotion of [[Risperdal]], [[Invega]] and [[Natrecor]]. Risperdal was approved only to treat schizophrenia, yet Janssen, a Johnson and Johnson (J&amp;J) subsidiary, promoted Risperdal to physicians and other prescribers who treated elderly dementia patients by urging the prescribers to use Risperdal to treat symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, depression, hostility and confusion. Similarly,  although Invega was approved only for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, from 2006 through 2009, J&amp;J and Janssen marketed the drug for off-label indications. Finally, Scios Inc,. a subsidiary of J&amp;J, launched an aggressive campaign to market Natrecor for scheduled, serial outpatient infusions for patients with less severe heart failure – a use not included in the FDA-approved label and not covered by federal health care programs. This settlement figure represents resolution of other claims in addition to off-label promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/November/13-ag-1170.html|title=Johnson &amp; Johnson to Pay More Than $2.2 Billion to Resolve Criminal and Civil Investigations|date=4 November 2013 |publisher=justice.gov|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CareFusion: Off-label promotion of ChloraPrep, January 2014 ===
[[CareFusion]] agreed to pay $40.1 million to resolve allegations of off-label promotion of [[ChloraPrep]]. ChloraPrep had been approved by the FDA for the preparation of a patient’s skin prior to surgery or injection. This settlement also resolves allegations that, during the period between September 2009 and August 2011, CareFusion knowingly promoted the sale of ChloraPrep for uses that were not approved by the FDA, some of which were not medically accepted indications, and made unsubstantiated representations about the appropriate uses of ChloraPrep.

=== Endo Pharmaceuticals: Off-label promotion of Lidoderm, February 2014 ===
[[Endo Pharmaceuticals]] agreed to pay $171.9 million to resolve civil liability under the False Claims Act for its off-label promotion of [[Lidoderm]]. The government charged that, between 2002 and 2006, Endo misbranded Lidoderm and introduced it into interstate commerce in violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Lidoderm's labeling lacked adequate directions for use in the treatment of non-PHN related pain, including low back pain, diabetic neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. These uses were intended by Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. but never approved by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/February/14-civ-187.html|title=Endo Pharmaceuticals and Endo Health Solutions to Pay $192.7 Million to Resolve Criminal and Civil Liability Relating to Marketing of Prescription Drug Lidoderm for Unapproved Uses

=== Insys Therapeutics: Off-label promotion of Opioid drug Subsys, August 2015 ===
In August 2015, [[Insys Therapeutics]] reached a $1.1 million settlement with the Oregon Department of Justice, resolving allegations that it promoted its opioid drug [[Subsys]] to treat off-label non-cancer uses that were not approved by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doj.state.or.us/releases/Pages/2015/rel080515.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Insys has also paid New Hampshire $2.9 million to settle allegations of aggressive marketing of Subsys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/opioid-crisis-and-insys-therapeutics-fentanyl-spray-2017-4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acclarent Inc.: Off-label promotion of Sinus Spacer Product, July 2016 ===
On July 22, 2016, California-based medical device manufacturer and Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary [[Acclarent Inc.]] agreed to pay $18 million to resolve allegations that it marketed and distributed its sinus spacer product for use as a drug delivery device without FDA approval.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/johnson-johnson-subsidiary-acclarent-inc-pays-government-18-million-settle-false-claims-act&lt;/ref&gt;  The government alleged that it continued its off-label marketing even after the FDA rejected the company's request to expand the approved uses, and even though the company added a warning to its label regarding the use of active drug substances in the device.  On July 20, 2016, the company's former CEO and former Vice President of Sales also were convicted following a trial of ten misdemeanor counts of introducing adulterated and misbranded medical devices into interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt;

=== Biocompatibles Inc.: Off-label promotion of LC Bead, November 2016 ===
On November 7, 2016, medical device company [[Biocompatibles Inc.]], a subsidiary of [[BTG plc]] agreed to pay $25 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by causing false claims to be submitted to government health care programs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medical-device-maker-biocompatibles-pleads-guilty-misbranding-and-agrees-pay-36-million&lt;/ref&gt;  The company allegedly promoted LC Bead, its embolization device—designed, to be inserted into blood vessels to block the flow of blood to tumors—for off-label use as a "drug-delivery" device, which was not an FDA-approved use and was not supported by substantial clinical evidence.  The company also agreed to pay an additional $11 million in criminal fines and forfeitures for a total of $36 million.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Bristol-Myers Squibb Company: Off-label promotion of Abilify, December 2016 ===
On December 9, 2016, pharmaceutical company [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] agreed to pay $19.5 million to settle claims with forty-three state attorneys general concerning the alleged off-label promotion of its schizophrenia drug [[Abilify]].&lt;ref&gt;https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-texas-and-42-states-reach-19.5-million-settlement-with-bristol-my&lt;/ref&gt;   The lawsuit alleged the company promoted the drug for use in pediatric populations and to treat dementia and Alzheimer's in elderly patients, despite the fact that those were not FDA-approved uses.

=== Shire PLC: Kickbacks and Off-label promotion of Dermagraft, January 2017 ===
In January 2017, [[Shire PLC]] Subsidiaries entered into a global resolution under the civil FCA with federal and state governments for $350 million.  The settlement largely focused on payment of alleged kickbacks to induce clinics and physicians to use or overuse its product “Dermagraft,” a bioengineered human skin substitute approved by the FDA for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/shire-plc-subsidiaries-pay-350-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement also resolved allegations that Shire and its predecessor ABH unlawfully marketed Dermagraft for off-label uses not approved by the FDA, made false statements to inflate the price of Dermagraft, and caused improper coding, verification, or certification of Dermagraft claims and related services.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/shire-plc-subsidiaries-pay-350-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations resolved by the settlement were brought in six lawsuits filed under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act.

=== Celgene Corporation: Off-label promotion of Revlimid and Thalomid, July 2017 ===
In July 2017, [[Celgene]] agreed to pay $280 million to government agencies to settle allegations that it caused the submission of false claims or fraudulent claims for non-reimbursable uses of its drugs [[Revlimid]]  and [[Thalomid]] to Medicare and state Medicaid programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Celgene Agrees to Pay $280 Million to Resolve Fraud Allegations Related to Promotion of Cancer Drugs For Uses Not Approved by FDA |publisher=Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney’s Office, Central District of California |date=July 24, 2017 |author=Thom Mrozek |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/celgene-agrees-pay-280-million-resolve-fraud-allegations-related-promotion-cancer-drugs |accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to listing off-label promotion under the covered conduct, the settlement agreement separately covered alleged "false and misleading" statements Celgene made about the drugs, including by concealing or minimizing adverse events.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law360.com/articles/958949/recent-settlements-suggest-off-label-cases-aren-t-extinct&lt;/ref&gt;  In its July 2017 Form 10-Q, Celgene disclosed that it resolved the matter in full for $315 million, including fees and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/816284/000081628417000009/a2017063010q.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The case was brought under the [[False Claims Act]] by Beverly Brown, a former Celgene sales representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Celgene to Pay $280 Million to Settle Fraud Suit Over Cancer Drugs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/health/celgene-to-pay-280-million-to-settle-fraud-suit-over-cancer-drugs.html|work=The New York Times|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6568">'''''MacCormick v Lord Advocate''''' 1953 SC 396, 1953 SLT 255  was a [[UK administrative law]] and [[Scots law|Scottish legal action]] on whether Queen Elizabeth II was entitled to use the numeral "II" in her title in use in Scotland, there having never been an earlier Elizabeth reigning in Scotland.

==Facts==
[[John MacCormick]] (the [[Rector of the University of Glasgow|Rector]] of the [[University of Glasgow]]) and [[Ian Hamilton QC|Ian Hamilton]] (then part of the [[Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association]]) contested the right of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] to style herself 'Elizabeth II' within Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W0ZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=woQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1722%2C4938361 |title=Judge dismisses petition on Queen’s title. Covenant Association to Appeal |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=18 May 1953 |page=3 |accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed it was a breach of the [[Act of Union 1707]] between England and Scotland, since [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] had been [[Queen regnant|Queen of England]] but not of Scotland. The action was brought against [[the Crown]], which was represented by the [[Lord Advocate]], who is the most senior law officer in Scotland.

==Judgment==
The petition first came before Lord Guthrie, sitting as [[Lord Ordinary]] in the [[Outer House]] (the [[court of first instance]] in the [[Court of Session]]). He dismissed it; this was appealed to the [[Inner House]]. The appeal was heard by the [[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]] ([[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|Lord Cooper of Culross]]), Lord Carmont, and Lord Russell. There, MacCormick and Hamilton lost their case: it was held that the [[treaty]] had no provision concerning the numbering of [[monarch]]s—it was part of the [[royal prerogative]], and that they had no title to sue [[the Crown]]. The Lord President did give his opinion that "the principle of unlimited [[Parliamentary sovereignty|sovereignty of Parliament]] is a distinctively [[England|English]] principle and has no counterpart in [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[constitutional law]]". The case was thus constitutionally interesting{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} as "the Lord Advocate conceded this point by admitting that the Parliament of the United Kingdom 'could not' repeal or alter [certain] 'fundamental and essential' conditions" of the Act of Union.&lt;ref&gt;''MacCormick v Lord Advocate'' 1953 SC 396 at p 411&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Lord President also held that "there is neither precedent nor authority of any kind for the view that the domestic Courts of either Scotland or England have jurisdiction to determine whether a governmental act of the type here in controversy is or is not conform to the provisions of a Treaty" and "it has not been shown that the Court of Session has authority to entertain the issue sought to be raised".&lt;ref&gt;''MacCormick v Lord Advocate''1953 SLT 255 at p 263&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The outcome of this case has had continuing relevance, most notably in 1999, when the British Parliament discussed the creation of the [[Scottish Parliament]]. It has been discussed in a number of later decisions of the courts, notably ''Gibson v Lord Advocate'' 1975 SC 136, and the English case of ''Jackson v Attorney General'', [2005] 3 WLR 733.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/56.html |title= ''Jackson v Attorney General'' |publisher=Bailii.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] suggested that British sovereigns would use either the English or the Scottish number, whichever was higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1953/apr/15/royal-style-and-title |title=Winston Churchill, House of Commons Hansard, '&amp;#39;Royal Style and Title'&amp;#39;, cols 199-201, 15 April 1953 |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=1953-04-15 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as there has never been a regnant King Henry of Scotland (King Henry, husband of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was a King Consort) but there was a Henry VIII of England, a future King Henry of the United Kingdom would be Henry IX; but as there has been a James VII of Scotland but only a James II of England, a future King James of the United Kingdom would be James VIII. Also, England has never had a King David, but there was a King [[David II of Scotland]], so a future King David of the United Kingdom would be David III, and a future King Richard would be Richard IV, as England has had three monarchs of that name.

Established as early as 1826, the '''Ministry of Human Rights, Justice, Governance and Decentralization of Honduras''' was created from the territorial division of Honduras and was initially composed of seven departments. The ministry is responsible for matters pertaining to the internal government, which include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3AyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q|title=The memorias of the republics of Central America and of the Antilles|last=Childs|first=James Bennett|last2=Congress|first2=Library of|date=1932|publisher=U.S. Govt. print. off.|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICMXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA411&amp;dq|title=Compendio de la historia social y política de Honduras: aumentada con los principales acontecimientos de Centro-America; para uso de los colegios de 2a. enseñanza de la república de Honduras|last=Vallejo|first=Antonio R.|date=1882|publisher=Tipografia nacional|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSpGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA417&amp;dq|title=Honduras literaria: colección de escritos en prosa y verso, precedidos de apuntes biográficos por Rómulo E.

* Monitoring political parties with regard to their relationship with the government
* Publishing laws, regulations and general provisions
* The extrajudicial solution of conflicts and the coordination and liaison with the organs of the Judicial Power, Public Ministry, Attorney General of the Republic, National Electoral Court and the State Controlling Institutions

For instance, in 2014, President [[Juan Orlando Hernández]] announced plans to eliminate the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights and merge it with the Ministry of Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elboletin.com/internacional/92223/nuevo-presidente-honduras-elimina-juticia.html|title=El nuevo presidente de Honduras elimina el Ministerio de Justicia|last=Boletin|first=El|work=El Boletin|access-date=2018-06-29|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/alfrente/566625-209/honduras-desaparecen-cinco-ministerios|title=Honduras: Desaparecen cinco ministerios - Diario El Heraldo|work=Diario El Heraldo|access-date=2018-06-29|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain sources refer to the Minister of Human Rights, Justice, Governance and Decentralization as the Secretariat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Moses v Macferlan''''' (1760) 2 Bur 1005 is a foundational case in the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of restitution]] holding that in certain circumstances such as when money is paid by mistake, for failed consideration or under oppression; the law will allow the money to be recovered.

== Facts ==
Chapman Jacob had made out four [[promissory note]]s to Moses for 30s each.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Moses v Macferlan'' (1760) 2 Bur 1005 at 1005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses owed Macferlan £26, did not pay him and was sued. A settlement was reached at arbitration whereby Moses would pay Macferlan £20; and endorse to Macferlan the four promissory notes he had received from Jacob.&lt;ref&gt;Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Ltd [2001] HCA 68 at [76].
&lt;/ref&gt; Moses, endorsed these notes to Macferlan, thus transferring over rights to the money. Prior to Moses endorsement, Macferlan assured him that his endorsement would not prejudice him. In other words, Macferlan would not seek to get the value of the notes from Moses. There was also an agreement signed by Macferlan that Moses should "not be liable to the payment of the money or any part of it".

Despite Macferlan's assurances and agreement with Moses; he summoned Moses into the [[Middlesex]] Court of Conscience as the endorser of the four promissory notes.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

The lawyer for Moses put the agreement before the court and offered to give evidence of it in Moses defence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Moses v Macferlan'' (1760) 2 Bur 1005 at 1006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Court rejected this defence as beyond its jurisdiction, refused to receive evidence of it and gave judgment against Moses; holding that his endorsement establishing his liability. Moses paid the money, to the value of the four promissory notes, into court. Macferlan then withdrew the money at the order of the court.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the subsequent action of Moses in the King's Bench court to recover the £6, the jury found that Moses was entitled to the money subject to the opinion of the court on the question, "Whether the money could be recovered in the present form of action, or whether it must be recovered by an action brought upon the special agreement only".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[William Gummow]] has summarised the problem that the court had to deal with; &lt;blockquote&gt;"The root of the doctrinal problem presented to the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King’s Bench]] in ''Moses v. Macferlan'' was the absence of an accepted basis for the action for [[money had and received]]. Lord Mansfield gave a number of settled instances where the action lay, but the instant case did not fall within any of them. Lord Mansfield also sought to find a principle within which past, present, and future cases might be accommodated. Given what he saw as the rigidities of the common law, Lord Mansfield looked to equity for an appropriate analogy upon which the common law should draw."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://law2.wlu.edu/deptimages/law%20review/68-3n.3Gummow.pdf|title = Moses v. Macferlan 250 Years On|date = 2010|accessdate = 2 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Gummow|first = William}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Judgment ==
[[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]] CJ dealt with a number of objections to allowing the plaintiff's action in [[Assumpsit]].

Firstly, he noted the objection "That an Action of ''Debt'' would not lie here and no ''[[Assumpsit]]'' will lie, where an Action of Debt may not be brought"; and responded that the rule was "That an Action of ''Assumpsit'' WILL ''lie'' in many cases where ''Debt lies'' and in many where it does ''not'' lie."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Moses v Macferlan'' (1760) 2 Bur 1005 at 1008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, he dealt with the objection, "That no ''Assumpsit'' lies, except upon an ''express'' or ''implied'' Contract"; answering "If the Defendant be under an ''Obligation,'' from the Ties of ''natural Justice,'' to ''refund''; the Law ''implies a Debt,'' and ''gives this Action,'' founded in the Equity of the Plaintiff's Case, ''as it were upon a Contract''".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thirdly, Lord Mansfield rejected the assertion that a court's judgment could not be revised by a new action; "Money may be recovered by a right and legal judgment; and yet the iniquity of keeping that money may be manifest, upon grounds which could not be used by way of defence against the judgment."&lt;ref&gt;''Moses v Macferlan'' (1760) 2 Bur 1005 at 1009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Mansfield then held,&lt;blockquote&gt;"This kind of [[Equity (law)|equitable]] action, to recover back money, which ought not in justice to be kept, is very beneficial, and therefore much encouraged. It lies for money which, ''[[ex aequo et bono]]'', the defendant ought to refund; it does not lie for money paid by the plaintiff, which is claimed of him as payable in point of honour and honesty, although it could not have been recovered from him by any course of law; as in payment of a debt barred by the Statute of Limitations, or contracted during his infancy, or to the extent of principal and legal interest upon an usurious contract, or, for money fairly lost at play: because in all these cases, the defendant may retain it with a safe conscience, though by positive law he was barred from recovering. But it lies for money paid by mistake; or upon a [[consideration]] which happens to fail; or for money got through imposition, (express or implied) or [[extortion]]; or oppression; or an [[Undue influence|undue advantage]] taken of the plaintiff's situation, contrary to laws made for the protection of persons under those circumstances. In one word, the gist of this kind of action is, that the defendant, upon the circumstances of the case, is obliged by the ties of [[natural justice]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]], to refund the money."&lt;ref&gt;''Moses v Macferlan'' (1760) 2 Bur 1005 at 1012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Significance ==
Lord Mansfield's judgment in ''Moses v Macferlan'' is credited with founding the entire common law of [[English unjust enrichment law|unjust enrichment]]. It has been described in the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Supreme Court]] as "a corner-stone of common law restitution".&lt;ref&gt;''Zurich Insurance PLC UK Branch v International Energy Group Ltd'' [2015] UKSC 33 at [70].&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Peter Birks]] noted of Mansfield's statement of law (cited above), "This corresponds very closely to the modern structure of the law of unjust enrichment. The phrase "unjust enrichment" does not actually appear. But "money which ought not in justice to be kept" is "unjust enrichment", cut down to money as the form of action necessitated."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Foundations of Unjust Enrichment: Six Centennial Lectures|last = Birks|first = Peter|publisher = Victoria University Press``|year = 2002|isbn = |location = Wellington|pages = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birks observes that Mansfield's classification of unjust factors, "was endowed with the authority of scripture and broadcast to the world by [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]. He adopted it in the third volume of his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Commentaries]]'', which came out in 1768. Following Lord Mansfield almost verbatim, Blackstone says that the plaintiff is entitled to recover "where money is paid by mistake, or on a consideration which happens to fail, or through imposition, extortion, or oppression, or where undue advantage is taken of the plaintiff's situation".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Notice and take down''' is a process operated by [[Web hosting service|online hosts]] in response to court orders or allegations that content is illegal. Content is removed by the host following notice. Notice and take down is widely operated in relation to [[copyright infringement]], as well as for [[libel]] and other illegal content. In United States and European Union law, notice and takedown is mandated as part of [[limited liability]], or [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbour]], provisions for online hosts (see the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] 1998 and the [[Electronic Commerce Directive (EU)|Electronic Commerce Directive]] 2000). As a condition for limited liability online hosts must expeditiously remove or disable access to content they host when they are notified of the alleged illegality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Role of Internet Intermediaries in Advancing Public Policy Objectives| publisher = OECD Publishing| date = 4 October 2011| pages = 144| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1HcH18cqJh0C&amp;dq=notice+and+notice+canada&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9789264115637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
The [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]], passed into law in 1998 as part of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] provides safe harbour protection to "online service providers" for "online storage" in section 512(c). Section 512(c) applies to online service providers that store copyright infringing material. In addition to the two general requirements that online service providers comply with standard technical measures and remove repeat infringers, section 512(c) also requires that the online service providers: 1) do not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, 2) are not aware of the presence of infringing material or know any facts or circumstances that would make infringing material apparent, and 3) upon receiving notice from copyright owners or their agents, act expeditiously to remove the allegedly copyright infringing material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html Section 512(c)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An online service provider can be notified through the copyright owner's written notification of claimed infringement. Section 512(c) lists a number of requirements the notification must comply with, including:
* Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number and email address
* A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of [[perjury]], that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html 17 U.S.C. § (512(c)(3)(A)(i-vi))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Provided the notification complies with the requirements of Section 512, the online service provider must expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material, otherwise the provider loses its safe harbour and is exposed to possible liability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html  17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(1)(C)]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this the online service provider must take reasonable steps to promptly notify the alleged infringer of the action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html  17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(2)(A)]&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a counter notification from the alleged infringer, the online service provider must then promptly notify the claiming party of the individual's objection.&lt;ref&gt;[512(g)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; If the copyright owner does not bring a lawsuit in district court within 14 days, the service provider is then required to restore the material to its location on its network.&lt;ref&gt;[512(g)(2)(C)]&lt;/ref&gt; If the service provider receives a counter notice claiming that the material does not infringe copyrights, the service provider must also comply with requirements set out in Section 512, including:
* The subscriber's name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature.
* Identification of the material and its location before removal.
* A statement under penalty of perjury that the material was removed by mistake or misidentification.
* Subscriber consent to local federal court jurisdiction, or if overseas, to an appropriate judicial body.&lt;ref&gt;[512(g)(3)(A), (B), (C) and (D)]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the court determines that the copyright owner misrepresented the claim of copyright infringement, the copyright owner becomes liable for any damages that resulted to the online service provider from the improper removal of the material.&lt;ref&gt;[512(f)]&lt;/ref&gt; The online service provider is also required to appropriately respond to "repeat infringers", including termination of online accounts. On this basis online service providers may insert clauses into user service agreements which allow them to terminate or disable user accounts following repeat infringement of copyright. Identification of "repeat infringer" may occur through repeated notice and takedown requests, while other online service provider require a determination by a court.&lt;ref name="OECD Publishing"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Role of Internet Intermediaries in Advancing Public Policy Objectives| publisher = OECD Publishing| date = 4 October 2011| pages = 146| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1HcH18cqJh0C&amp;dq=notice+and+notice+canada&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9789264115637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Union ==
The basis for notice and takedown procedures under EU law is article 14 of the [[Electronic Commerce Directive (EU)|Electronic Commerce Directive]], adopted in 2000. Article 14 applies to content hosts in relation to all "illegal activity or information". Online hosts are not liable for the illegal activity, or information placed on its systems by a user, so long as the online host does not have "actual knowledge" of the activity or information. Upon obtaining such knowledge, the online host must act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information.&lt;ref name="OECD Publishing"/&gt; The Directive does not set out notice and takedown procedures but it envisaged the development of such a process because online hosts who fail to act expeditiously upon notification lose limited liability protection. The Directive suggests that voluntary agreements between trade bodies and consumer associations could specify notice and takedown processes, and that such initiatives should be encouraged by member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = E-Copyright Law Handbook | publisher = Aspen Publishers Online | year = 2002| pages = 13–53| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NMHEZ_TBBXgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780735529441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most EU countries at the national level, there are no explicit rules regarding notice of infringement, take-down process or counter notice and put back (statutory rules exist in smaller countries like Hungary and Finland). Where explicit rules do not exist (e.g. Germany), some aspects of notice requirements can be derived from common principles of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Notice and Take-Down-Verfahren als Teil der Providerhaftung ''[Notice and Takedown Procedures as a Part of Provider Liability]''| last = Holznagel | first = Daniel
| publisher = Mohr Siebeck | year = 2013| pages = 75–83, 125–220| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWCCamvdelkC | isbn = 978-3-16-152667-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By nature, this lack of explicit rules results in a lack of clarity and legal certainty when compared to legal regimes with statutory rules (e.g. United States).

In October 2013, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in the [[Delfi AS v. Estonia]] case that the Estonian news website Delfi was liable for defamatory comments by users in an article. The court stated that the company "should have expected offensive posts, and exercised an extra degree of caution so as to avoid being held liable for damage to an individual’s reputation" and its notice and take down comments moderation system was "insufficient for preventing harm being cause to third parties".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/37287/en/european-court-strikes-serious-blow-to-free-speech-online European Court strikes serious blow to free speech online] - Article 19, 14 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/9c0cf256-e197-11e3-b7c4-00144feabdc0.html The threat facing online comments] - Financial Times,  John Sunyer, 23 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Notice and takedown has been criticised for over-blocking or take down of non-infringing content. In 2001 the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] launched a collaborative clearinghouse for notice and takedown requests, known as ''[[Chilling Effects]]''.&lt;ref name='NYT'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/22/business/new-economy-copyright-dispute-with-church-scientology-forcing-google-some.html?src=pm | title = New Economy; A copyright dispute with the Church of Scientology is forcing Google to do some creative linking. | accessdate = 2011-04-07 | last = Gallagher | first = David | date = April 22, 2002 | publisher = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have been using the clearinghouse to study the use of cease-and-desist demands, primarily looking at [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] 512 takedown notices, but also non-DMCA copyright issues, and trademark claims.&lt;ref&gt;J. Urban &amp; L. Quilter, "Efficient Process or 'Chilling Effects'? Takedown Notices Under Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act," ''Santa Clara Computer &amp; High Technology Law Journal'' (March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fepproject.org/policyreports/WillFairUseSurvive.pdf "Will Fair Use Survive? Free Expression in the Age of Copyright Control" (2005).  ('''PDF''')] [[Free Expression Policy Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 study into the DMCA notice and take down process by Jennifer Urban and Laura Quilter from the [[Samuelson Law, Technology and Public Policy Clinic]] concluded that "some notices are sent in order to accomplish the paradigmatic goal of 512 – the inexpensive takedown of clearly infringing hosted content or links to infringing web sites". However, on the basis of data on such notices the study concluded that the DMCA notice and take down process "is commonly used for other purposes: to create leverage in a competitive marketplace, to protect rights not given by copyright (or perhaps any other law), and to stifle criticism, commentary and fair use".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rimmer| first = Matthew| title = Digital copyright and the consumer revolution: hands off my iPod | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2007| pages = 191| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;dq=notice+and+takedown+chilling+effects&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 978-1-84542-948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is misleading to conclude that these problems do not arise under the E-Commerce Directive, which does not provide for a statutory notice and take-down procedure, since these chilling effects are a specific problem of provider liability as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Holznagel | first = Daniel| title = Melde- und Abhilfeverfahren zur Beanstandung rechtswidrig gehosteter Inhalte | publisher = GRUR Int (2/2014), C.H.Beck | year = 2014| pages = 105–113 | url = http://beck-online.beck.de/default.aspx?typ=reference&amp;y=300&amp;z=GRURINT&amp;b=2014&amp;s=105&amp;n=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 numerous US based online service providers hosting [[user generated content]] implemented [[Enterprise content management#Recognition technologies|content recognition technology]] to screen uploaded content for possible copyright infringement. These content ID systems, such as operated by [[YouTube]], are outside the Digital Millennium Copyright Act mandated notice and takedown process. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, along with other civil society organisations published principles on user generated content, calling for the protection of legitimate use of copyright protected works, prior notification of the uploader before removal or the placement of ads on the content, use of the DMCA counter notice system, including reinstatement upon counter note and the failure of the copyright owner to bring a lawsuit.&lt;ref name="OECD Publishing"/&gt;

The Electronic Commerce Directive, unlike the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, did not define so called ''notice and action'' procedures under article 14 of the Directive. Member states implemented diverging approaches on the duty to act expeditiously and on when an online host obtains "actual knowledge" in relation to notifications. Inconsistent approaches to whether online service providers, such as search engines or social media networks, fall within the definition of [[Web hosting service|online host]], under article 14 developed across the EU. As a result, notice and takedown procedures are fragmented across EU member states and online hosts face considerable [[Legal certainty|legal uncertainty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = German News Article Removed From Search Results After DMCA Complaint | publisher = EDRI | date = 20 June 2012| url = http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.12/german-news-article-removed-DMCA-complaint| accessdate = 27 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] consulted on notice and action procedures under article 14 in 2010, and has launched a new initiative in June 2012. The European Commission observed that "Online intermediaries face high compliance costs and legal uncertainty because they typically have operations across Europe, but the basic rules of Article 14 are interpreted in different ways by different national courts (sometimes even within the same member state)." As part of the initiative the European Commission intends to clarify which online service providers fall within the article 14 definition of online hosts. The initiative assesses whether different categories of illegal content require different notice and action approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Gothard| first = Peter| title = European Commission to more closely define online content ‘host’| publisher = computing.co.uk| date = 7 June 2012| url = http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2182728/european-commission-closely-define-online-content-host| accessdate = 27 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = European Commission consults on notice and take-down procedures for online content | publisher = Practical Law Company | date = 4 June 2012| url = http://uk.practicallaw.com/7-519-7743?q=notice+and+take+down+action+5+september+2012| accessdate = 27 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It seems that in 2013 the European Commission's notice and action initiative has come to a halt. The reason for this is unclear. One aspect might be to avoid bad publicity, since notice and take down is associated with chilling effects on free speech as described above. The other reason might be the following problem: the EU Commission already made it quite clear that it does not want to change the Electronic Commerce Directive – while indeed it seems impossible to provide legal certainty in the take down process without a binding legal underpinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Holznagel | first = Daniel| title = Melde- und Abhilfeverfahren zur Beanstandung rechtswidrig gehosteter Inhalte | publisher = GRUR Int (2014), C.H.Beck | year = 2014| pages = 105–113 | url = http://beck-online.beck.de/default.aspx?typ=reference&amp;y=300&amp;z=GRURINT&amp;b=2014&amp;s=105&amp;n=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notice and stay down ==
The term '''notice and stay down''' is used to refer to the concept of additionally requiring that a service, after it has received a request to take down a certain copyrighted work, must also prevent the same work from becoming available on the service again in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Proposals for such concepts typically prescribe the implementation of automatic content recognition, similar to [[YouTube]]'s "Content ID" system, that would proactively filter identified works and prevent them from being re-uploaded. Proposals for notice and stay down rules have been made in the United States by pro-copyright lobbyists, and constitute Article 13 of the EU's proposed [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/notice-and-stay-down-really-filter-everything|title=“Notice-and-Stay-Down” Is Really “Filter-Everything”|last=Harmon|first=Elliot|date=2016-01-21|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Felipe|last1=Romero-Moreno|title=‘Notice and staydown’ and social media: amending Article 13 of the Proposed Directive on Copyright|url=http://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/portal/files/14552421/Notice_and_staydown_and_social_media_amending_Article_13_of_the_Proposed_Directive_on_Copyright.pdf|journal=International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology|date=2018-05-29|issn=1360-0869|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/13600869.2018.1475906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/24/bpi-british-music-labels-piracy-policy-google|title=British music labels demand 'notice and stay down' piracy policy from Google|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=2016-03-24|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140313/17470826574/rebranding-sopa-now-called-notice-staydown.shtml|title=The Rebranding Of SOPA: Now Called 'Notice And Staydown'|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of notice and stay down has faced criticism; it has been noted that the only way to reliably enforce such an obligation would be through automatic filtering, which is subject to the possibility of [[false positive]]s, and the inability to detect lawful uses of an affected work (such as [[fair use]]). The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] argued that requiring proactive monitoring of user content would place the burden of copyright enforcement on service providers (thus defeating the purpose of safe harbors), and would be too costly for [[Startup company|newly-established companies]] (thus bolstering incumbents such as [[Google]] and stifling innovation).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-sprigman-lemley-notice-and-takedown-dmca-20160621-snap-story.html|title=Why notice-and-takedown is a bit of copyright law worth saving|last=Lemley|first=Chris Sprigman and Mark|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Pure Theory of Law''''' ({{lang-de|Reine Rechtslehre}}) is a book by legal theorist [[Hans Kelsen]], first published in 1934 and in a greatly expanded "second edition" (effectively a new book) in 1960. The second edition appeared in English translation in 1967, as ''Pure Theory of Law'',&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley, U. California P., 1967. The title page has correctly ''Pure Theory of Law'', but the paperback cover has wrongly ''The&lt;!-- [sic] --&gt; Pure Theory of Law''. This has been corrected, for the paperback cover as well as the hardback dustjacket, in a reprint by another publisher "by arrangement with" the Hans Kelsen-Institut: Clark, NJ; The LawbookExchange&lt;!-- the non-spacing is correct --&gt;; 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-58477-578-2}} (p), {{ISBN|978-1-58477-206-4}} (h).&lt;/ref&gt; the first edition in English translation in 1992, as ''Introduction to the Problems of Legal Theory''. The theory proposed in this book has probably been the most influential theory of law produced during the 20th century. It is, at the least, one of the high points of modernist legal theory.&lt;ref&gt;Both editions will be included in forthcoming volumes in the [http://www.mohr.de/en/law/text-editions/buch/hans-kelsen-werke.html/ Hans Kelsen Werke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185519/http://www.mohr.de/en/law/text-editions/buch/hans-kelsen-werke.html/ |date=2013-10-29 }}. A fuller and more accurate translation of the second edition is also planned. The current translation, in omitting many footnotes, obscures the extent to which the Pure Theory of Law is both philosophically grounded and responsive to earlier theories of law.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The two editions of Kelsen's book were separated by twenty-six years, and the second edition (1960) was almost twice the length of the first in the detail of its presentation. The original terminology which was introduced in the first edition was already present in many of Kelsen's writings from the 1920s, and were also subject to discussion in the critical press of that decade as well, before it was first published in 1934. Although the second edition was significantly longer, the two editions had a great deal of similarity of content, and much of the material covered in the volumes is consistent not only with one another, but also with many of Kelsen's previous writings from the 1910s and 1920s. The following sections herein shall follow Kelsen's own preference for the presentation of his main topics of the pure theory of law as he presented them in the second edition of this book.

==Chapters==
===I. Law and Nature===
In the first paragraph of ''Pure Theory of Law'', Kelsen introduces his theory as being a theory of positive law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of positive law is then presented by Kelsen as forming a hierarchy of laws which start from a [[basic norm]] (''Grundnorm'') where all other norms are related to each other by either being inferior norms, when the one is compared to the other, or superior norms. The interaction of these norms is then further subject to representation as a static theory of law (Kelsen's chapter 4) or as a dynamic theory of law (Kelsen's chapter 5).

===II. Law and Morals===
Kelsen's strict separation of law and morality, in Chapter Two of ''Pure Theory of Law'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=59–69}}; Kelsen's ''Recht und Moral'' is more accurately translated as "Law and Morality".&lt;/ref&gt; was an integral part of his presentation of the Pure Theory of Law. The application of the law, in order to be protected from moral influence or political influence, needed to be safeguarded by its separation from the sphere of conventional moral influence or political influence. Kelsen did not deny that moral discussion was still possible and even to be encouraged in the sociological domain of intersubjective activity. However, the Pure Theory of Law was not to be subject to such influences.

===III. Law and Science===
In Chapter Three of ''Pure Theory of Law'', law is defined as the application of norms to its functions within the delineations of a science of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=70−107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science was generally the domain of the causal understanding of epistemological data and its primary logical and causally oriented technique was to be distinguished from the normative reasoning as was to be found in the Pure Theory of Law. Therefore, the legal sciences were to be normatively based in distinction from the physical sciences which were to be causally based.

===IV. The Static Aspect of Law===
In Chapter Four, Kelsen distinguishes the static theory of law from the dynamic theory of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=108-192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The static theory of law represents the law as a hierarchy of laws where the individual laws are related as being either superior or inferior the one to the other. This hierarchical theory was largely adopted from Adolf Merkl's research in the structural aspects of the law while Kelsen was still in Vienna. At nearly one hundred pages each, Kelsen's chapters on the static aspect of law and the dynamic aspect of law are the most extensively developed sections of this book.

===V. The Dynamic Aspect of Law===
In Chapter Five of ''Pure Theory of Law'', sections 34 and 35, Kelsen discusses the dynamic theory of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=193–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dynamic theory of law, the static theory of law comes into direct contact with the governmental administration of the state which must recognize the function of the legislature in the writing of new law. At the same time there is also the understanding of law as being affected by the accumulated standing law which represents the decisions of the courts which in principle become part of the hierarchical representation of the Pure Theory of Law. Importantly, Kelsen allows for the legislative process to recognize the law as the product of political and ethical debate which is the product of the activity of the legislature before it becomes part of the domain of the static theory of law. At nearly one hundred pages in length, this chapter on the dynamic aspect of law is the longest and most fully developed chapter in this book other than the chapter on the static aspect of law.

===VI. Law and State===
Chapter Six of ''Pure Theory of Law'' has Kelsen present his celebrated identity theory of law and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=279–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is Kelsen's highly functional theory of the state and the law as representing the same entity. It is not to be confused with the sociological domain or the cultural domain of intersubjective activity. Nor is it to be confused with the political or even the religious domain of intersubjective interaction among individuals.

===VII. State and International Law===
In Chapter Seven, Kelsen discusses the interaction of state law and international law as these are especially guided by the understanding of political sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=320–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Kelsen, the assessment of international law is that it represents a very primitive form of law in distinct contrast to the highly developed forms of law as may be found in individual nations and states. As a result, Kelsen emphasizes that international law is often prone to the conduct of war and severe diplomatic measures (blockade, seizure, internment, etc.) as offering the only corrective measures available to it in regulating the conduct between nations. For Kelsen, this is largely inevitable due to the relative primitiveness of international law in contemporary society.

===VIII. Interpretation===
Kelsen's final chapter, Chapter Eight, deals with the subject of interpretation in at least three of its most important aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=348-355}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kelsen discusses the nature and methodology of the interpretation of the law. Second, he discusses interpretation as an act of cognition and of voluntary will. Third, he discusses interpretation as it is to be understood as part of the science of law, as Kelsen has defined it as being 'purified' from the undue influences of politics, morals, and metaphysics.

==Supportive and supplementary commentary==
Kelsen attempted to reconstruct 'legal science (''Rechtswissenschaft'')' as a 'science of norms (''Normen'')', on analogy with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s conception of a science of 'causality' as used in natural science (Hans Kelsen, ''Society and Nature'', 1946, pages 249-262, Kegan Paul Press). This type of legal science would be 'pure' in two senses as described below.

===Defining 'purity' of legal science===
Firstly, it would be 'pure' in a sense analogous to that in Kant's ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science]]''. It would set out ''a priori'' a 'pure part' of legal science, consisting of a framework of fundamental concepts. Then, in an empirical part of legal science, this framework would be applied to empirical (sociological, historical and so on) material so as to understand that material as 'law'.&lt;ref&gt;To suppose, as is still sometimes done, that Kelsen's title ''Reine Rechtslehre'' should be translated into English not as 'Pure Theory of Law' but as 'Theory of Pure Law' is therefore wrong, conceptually as well as grammatically. Grammatically, ''Reine Rechtslehre'' translates exactly as 'Pure Theory of Law'—'Theory of Pure Law' would have been ''Lehre des reinen Rechts''. This theory of law is a pure theory; it is not a theory of pure law.&lt;/ref&gt;

The science, in both of its parts, would also be 'pure' in a second sense, in being solely descriptive—excluding from the science any element of evaluation. The core subject matter of legal science, for Kelsen, is legal norms. He defines a 'norm' as 'the meaning of an act of will'. Thus, for Kelsen a norm does not necessarily have any element of generality—hence not all norms are rules. Indeed, as the meaning of an act of will, a norm is not intrinsically rational; departing from Kant both back toward [[David Hume]] as well as in the direction of contemporary philosophical [[positivism]], Kelsen denies the existence of [[practical reason]].

Legal science, as Kelsen would like it to be, has to describe a legal norm without either evaluating it or adopting it as an evaluation. This can be done by distinguishing rigorously between the social statement that is the norm itself and the legal-scientific restatement of it that is, or is contained in, a description of the norm. Kelsen terms the norm itself a 'legal norm (''Rechtsnorm'')' and its descriptive restatement a 'legal proposition (''Rechtssatz'')'.&lt;ref&gt;Translators into English have not always served Kelsen well on this. One translation renders ''Rechtssatz'' as 'rule of law in a descriptive sense'. Yet one can have sympathy for the translators; though Kelsen's reasoning is rigorous, his style cannot be described as limpid.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a jurist (legal scientist) states that the law of a certain country contains the norm 'theft is to be punished with imprisonment', this legal proposition is not a comment on whether anybody in that country has a moral or other extra-legal obligation to impose, accept or evade such a penalty. In reading Kelsen, however, one has to bear in mind that, when he refers to a 'norm', he is usually speaking elliptically: he is uttering a legal proposition which stands for a legal norm, in much the same way that a picture of a dog shows the dog but does not bark.

This kind of 'purity' already excludes ideas of [[natural law]], in which description and evaluation are intimately connected. That leaves as the subject matter of legal science only [[positive law]]. Kelsen is a '[[legal positivist]]' both in that he excludes evaluation from legal science, through a strict separation of 'is' and 'ought', and in that he considers only positive law to be law. Although he never made much sense of the idea of 'custom', he included all public international law as 'law'.

At the same time, although it is not easy to reconcile with his rejection of practical reason, Kelsen was emphatic that politicians should support and make use of legal science. And legal scientists should assist them, for instance in law reform. Although if, when doing so, they go beyond the role of mere technician and recommend policy-based choices between possible norms, they will no longer be acting as legal scientists. For Kelsen, 'is' and 'ought' occupy separate worlds as a matter of logic, but not in practice. Their logical separation should be incorporated into practice.

Kelsen insisted that, if social scientists wished to deal with law, they would have to take their concept of law from legal science—that is, from the Pure Theory of Law. Kelsen made this point particularly against [[Max Weber]], whose philosophical orientation and legal background were similar to his own. And, indeed, although Weber had said much about what is socially called 'law', he had not developed a clear concept of it himself.

===Legal orders===
For Kelsen as for other central European contemporaries, norms occur not singly but in sets, termed 'orders'. The ordering principle of an order of moral norms—and of an order of natural law, if one could exist—would be logical, as deduction. From the general norm 'do not kill other human beings', it follows deductively that A must not kill any other human being. Kelsen calls this a 'static' order. An order of positive law, he maintains, is not, or not centrally, like that. Although it forms a hierarchy, it is 'dynamic', in that its ordering principle is authorisation. Each relatively 'higher' norm authorises someone (an individual or an organ, primarily of the state) to create further and relatively 'lower' norms. In this is found the specific characteristic of positive law, hence of all law, that it regulates its own creation. Even though positive legal norms do commonly contain elements of generality, those elements are not central to the relation between a higher and a lower norm. This is a relation of legal 'validity' (not to be confused with logical validity), which is that the creation of the lower norm has been authorised by the higher norm. Since this moment of creation always involves extraneous considerations, Kelsen does not need to supplement his model with a concept of 'discretion'.

What has to be consistent in a dynamic order of norms is only the process of authorising. This process can (and perhaps always does) result in multiple and mutually uneven strands of hierarchy, such as legislative, executive and judicial strands.&lt;ref&gt;The hierarchy does not have to be, and probably will not be, even-sided, like a pyramid—although that image has been used by one of Kelsen's French translators. ''Reine Rechtslehre'', 2nd ed sec. 35, refers to ''Stufenbau'', which the French translation renders as ''pyramide'' while the English translation has 'hierarchical structure'. 'Steps and stairs' has also been suggested, but it might be best not to attempt an image.&lt;/ref&gt; In each strand, at every point in the process of norm-creation, many types of extra-legal factor may be taken into account—moral, political, economic and others. Kelsen notes that, in this respect, the Pure Theory of Law has an affinity with American '[[legal realism]]'.

At the same time, the 'hierarchy' model does not readily fit a common-law system. It takes as its paradigm a single constitutional document under which codes and statutes are enacted, with both administration and adjudication in subordinate places. However, at least outside the United States, common-law systems are moving in the direction of that paradigm. The 'hierarchy' model also fits public law more readily than private law. It is difficult to be convinced by Kelsen's contention that, in private transactions, the parties are exercising legal authorisation.

===Basic norm (''Grundnorm'')===
Kelsen assumes, however, that the scientific representation of a positive-legal order, as a hierarchy of legal propositions, must have a guarantor of unity. This guarantor cannot be other than a component of the representation, hence a legal proposition. Being a legal proposition, it counts as a representation of an actual norm. So Kelsen calls it, elliptically, a '[[basic norm]] (''Grundnorm'')'.&lt;ref&gt;It is a 'basis (''Grund'')' in a logical sense. Once again, it might be best not to attempt an image.&lt;/ref&gt; A basic norm is 'presupposed' in legal science for each order of positive law, to make it possible to understand that material as an order of positive law. This norm is simply that 'the historically first constitution is to be obeyed'. That constitution may have become established by custom or by revolution: the jurist does not evaluate the circumstances.

Kelsen was always aware that a 'constitution' (''Verfassung'') might or might not be a single document. In some legal orders, indeed, it can be difficult to draw a line between 'constitutional' and other norms. In 1964, Kelsen relativised the idea of 'constitution', holding that each relatively higher legal norm is a 'constitution' in relation to any norm created under its authority. This need not, however, wholly supersede a narrower sense of 'constitution', which identifies those relatively 'high' legal norms that can be changed only through a specially onerous process such as a large parliamentary majority or a popular referendum.

To presuppose a basic norm for a particular positive-legal order does not involve any moral or other extra-legal evaluation of the basic norm's requirement of obedience. The jurist simply supposes that such a requirement has been stated. The jurist does so, irrespective of whether any such norm can be empirically discovered. At this point, serious difficulties emerge—with which Kelsen wrestled for much of his long life.

One part of the problem lay in his starting point, the question 'Why should the law be obeyed?'. He gives the idea of a basic norm two roles. In one role, it is the guarantor of unity in legal-scientific representation of a positive-legal order. In another role, it is an answer, for that legal order, to the obedience question—put in the more clearly descriptive form, 'Why is the law binding?'. One might think, rather, that to suppose for a particular positive-legal order simply that the historically first constitution (identified on this occasion) 'is to be obeyed' is instead to assume that a reason for obedience has already been established outside the legal order and beyond the ken of legal science. In that case, legal science would be seriously inadequate. On the other hand, if the reason for the bindingness of a legal norm is intrinsic to its 'legal' character, that reason might have to be sought in the 'legal' form of the individual norm and not in any kind of further guarantee.

Another part of the problem lay in the requirement that the 'basic' factor be, or count as, a norm. Early on, Kelsen may have supposed that there could be such a real norm. Later, however, the 'basic norm' was relegated to being only a 'hypothesis'. In a philosophical light, nonetheless, it had the status—in Kantian terms—of a 'transcendental-logical presupposition', a logical condition for the possibility of a certain kind of knowledge.

Eventually, Kelsen accepted the criticism that the concept of a basic norm involves an infinite regress. If the basic norm of a particular positive-legal order is an authorising norm, one can ask what is the source of the authority of the basic norm itself. If 'is' and 'ought' are to remain entirely separated, that can only be a still more 'basic' norm; and then the same question could be asked again, and so on infinitely. At this point, Kelsen took a further step back, accepting that the concept of a basic norm is doubly contradictory: it is self-contradictory in that it involves an infinite regress; in addition, since no such norm actually exists, to presuppose the existence of such a norm contradicts reality. The concept is a full 'fiction' in the sense to be found in [[Hans Vaihinger]]'s 'philosophy of "as if"'. But then not much remains of it, although Kelsen evidently considered that what remained was vital.
 
And there Kelsen ended, committed to an epistemology that was so radically relativistic as to challenge the very idea of authorisation. Nonetheless, if Kelsen does not provide an effective answer to the obedience question, he has posed that question—and many others—with exceptional sophistication.

===Metaphysics and persons===
Ideas of natural law are also excluded by Kelsen's rejection of 'metaphysics' in a strong sense, supposing something supra-human. He similarly rejects duplication in ideas of 'the state' as a supra-human entity—rather than a mere, fictional personification of the national legal order. His main target, in the 1930s, was fascist theories of state and law, such as that of [[Carl Schmitt]]. But, for Kelsen, it is also an illusion to think that, in a ''Rechtsstaat'' (roughly, 'rule of law state'), 'the state' is wholly subject to law: from a 'legal point of view', the state and the positive-legal order are the same. It is likewise an illusion to think of a 'legal person', whether relating in fact to a number of real people or to a single real individual, as anything other than a fictional personification of a bundle of norms that are rights and duties pertaining to such people. This is simply so, however, only in the 'pure part' of legal science. Kelsen is perfectly well aware that, in the empirical part, 'the state' will turn out to be a heavily armed real apparatus. One can make a similar extrapolation for the reality of legal persons, where corporate legal persons would turn out to be organisations and individual legal persons to have gender, class, ethnicity and so on.

===Law and power===
Descriptively, the Pure Theory of Law has always been about power. A positive-legal order can be identified when there are norms that regulate their own creation through a process of authorisation and, in addition, the order itself is 'by and large effective'. Kelsen does not closely specify 'by and large', but he does attribute effectiveness to coercion. In this respect, there is some affinity with [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s 'command' theory of law. But Kelsen's approach is quite different from Austin's. Austin finds the defining characteristic of law on the plane of the signifier, in imperative utterances. Kelsen has almost no interest in the signifier but focuses on the signified: a 'norm' is an utterance that, whatever its grammatical form, has the meaning 'ought (''Sollen'')'.

Austin and Kelsen also differ in that, for Kelsen, legal norms are addressed primarily to officials. Officials are directed to apply sanctions to individuals when the individuals' behaviour does not conform to a pattern specified in the norm. It is anticipated that individuals, in choosing how they will behave, will take into account the possibility that an official will apply the sanction. In that way, norms and the orders to which they belong can be effective. However, most if not all jurists now accept [[H. L. A. Hart]]'s point in ''[[The Concept of Law]]'', though directed principally against Austin, that not all legal norms are coercive—some, and some of the most important, are facilitative. The Pure Theory of Law can accommodate this by accepting that what matters most is not whether particular legal norms are coercive but whether, by containing coercive norms, the legal order as a whole is coercive—which Hart does not deny.

===International and national law===
Identification of law as characteristically coercive is more difficult with public international law, but Kelsen finds sufficient sanctions.

As to the relation between public international law and national law, however, his position changed dramatically. In the first edition of ''Reine Rechtslehre'', 1934, like many liberal contemporaries he was an internationalist monist: he looked to public international law as global law, subsuming all national or state legal orders. This had the happy consequence that, in its contemporary application, the universality of the Pure Theory (and Kelsen insisted that only universal truths could be 'scientific') would coincide with that of predominantly global law.

By the end of World War II, however, he gave up on this aspiration as unrealistic and, with evident reluctance, accepted a sort of optional monism. He found equally tenable the view that the public international legal order is supremely valid and the view that each national or state legal order is—for itself, in a kind of 'solipsism'—supremely valid. The story of the 'basic norm' might be read as a battle to come to terms with the 'solipsist' option. Kelsen needed not to adopt such solipsism but to provide an account of it.

===Toward a general theory of norms===
From the mid-1960s until his death in 1973, Kelsen branched out into general theory of norms. In a longer view, it was a return to his youthful passion for philosophy. His notes on this were published posthumously in 1979 as ''Allgemeine Theorie der Normen'' and appeared in English translation in 1990 as ''General Theory of Norms''. This work, however, neither offers a completed general theory of norms nor goes far toward locating the Pure Theory of Law within a general theory of norms.

'''Qaum''' ({{lang-ar|قوم}}, {{lang-ur|{{nq|قوم}}}}) or [[nation]] may refer to a community of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, and/or history. In this definition, a ''nation'' has no physical borders. However, it can also refer to people who share a common territory and government (for example the inhabitants of a sovereign state) irrespective of their ethnic make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged |title=Nation |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nation |accessdate=20 July 2012 |edition=11th |quote=1. an aggregation of people or peoples of one or more cultures, races, etc, organized into a single state: the Australian nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International relations in the nuclear age: one world, difficult to manage |first1=Henry L. |last1=Bretton |page=5 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=1986 |isbn=0-88706-040-4 |quote=It should be stated at the outset that the term ''nation'' has two distinctly different uses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41878">In [[common law]], a [[writ]] of '''''qui tam''''' is a writ whereby a private individual who assists a [[prosecution]] can receive all or part of any penalty imposed. Its name is an abbreviation of the [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase '''''qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hac parte sequitur''''', meaning "[he] who sues in this matter for the king as well as for himself."

The writ fell into disuse in [[England and Wales]] following the [[Common Informers Act 1951]] but remains current in the [[United States]] under the [[False Claims Act]], {{UnitedStatesCode|31|3729}} ''et seq.'', which allows a private individual, or "[[whistleblower]]," with knowledge of past or present [[fraud]] committed against the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to bring suit on its behalf. There are also ''qui tam'' provisions in {{UnitedStatesCode|18|962}} regarding arming vessels against friendly nations; {{UnitedStatesCode|25|201}} regarding violating Indian protection laws; 46a U.S.C. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode46a/usc_sec_46a_00000723----000-.html 723] regarding the removal of undersea treasure from the Florida coast to foreign nations; and {{UnitedStatesCode|35|292}} regarding false marking. In February 2011, the ''qui tam'' provision regarding false marking was held to be unconstitutional by [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio|a U.S. District Court]],&lt;ref name=Unique&gt;[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.ohnd.168384 Unique Product Solutions, Ltd. v.

== History ==

===England and Wales===
The historical antecedents of ''qui tam'' statutes lie in [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Anglo-Saxon law]].&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;J. Randy Beck, [http://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3855&amp;context=nclr The False Claims Act and the English Eradication of Qui Tam Legislation], 78 North Carolina Law Review 539 (March 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Roman criminal prosecutions were typically initiated by private citizens (''[[delatores]]'') and beginning no later than the ''[[Lex Pedia]]'', it became common for Roman criminal statutes to offer a portion of the defendant's [[wikt:forfeit|forfeited]] property to the initiator of the prosecution as a reward.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; Forerunners of ''qui tam'' actions also occurred in [[Anglo-Saxon England]]; in the year 656, [[Wihtred of Kent]] issued a decree that a [[Sabbath breaking|Sabbath-breaker]] would "forfeit his [[wikt:healsfang|healsfang]], and the man who informs against him shall have half the fine, and [the profits arising from] the labour."&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt;

The first ''qui tam'' statutes were enacted by the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] in the fourteenth century, some 250 years after the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; Such ''qui tam'' enforcement allowed enforcement of the legislative priorities of the king, especially in areas where and at times when such legislation  "undermined local officials' interests."&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt;

The 1318 Statute of York, which set [[Price controls|uniform prices]] for certain consumer goods, was an early English ''qui tam'' provision. The act prohibited city and borough officers from selling the regulated commodities (specifically, "wine and victuals"), and provided for forfeiture to the king of any prohibited merchandise.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; To ensure enforcement, the act provided that one-third of the forfeited merchandise "shall be delivered to the Party that sued the Offender, as the King's Gift. And in such Case he that will sue [for a thing so forfeited,] shall be received."&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt;

More ''qui tam'' provisions were enacted over the next two centuries, rewarding informers.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; For example, the 1328 Statute of Northampton penalized (by forfeiture and fine) the holding of [[fair]]s by lords and merchants for longer than the authorized length, and provided that "every man that will sue for our Lord the King, shall be received, and [also have] the Fourth Part of that which shall be lost at his Suit."&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; Two [[Ordinance of Labourers 1349|Statutes of Labourers]], enacted in 1349 and 1350, set [[Wage control|wage]] and price controls and provided for informers to seek forfeiture from the violator, or from mayors or bailiffs who failed to enforce the regulations.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; A large number of other statutes, mostly affecting commercial regulations, also included ''qui tam'' provisions.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt;

Some qui tam statutes were targeted at ensuring the integrity of officials. For example:

{{quote|In 1360, Parliament permitted informers to sue jurors who accepted bribes. Shortly thereafter, another law authorized ''qui tam'' suits if a person responsible for procuring and arranging for carriage of provisions for the King's household accepted a bribe. A 1391 statute permitted suits against mayors, sheriffs, and bailiffs who failed to implement a rule concerning measurement of grain. A 1442 statute prohibited customs officials and other public employees from engaging in businesses related to their public duties. The value of ''qui tam'' suits as a check on public officials had become so well accepted by 1444 that Parliament adopted no fewer than five such statutes in that single year.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt;}}

During the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], ''qui tam'' enforcement was reformed to avoid abuses, such as collusive suits between defendants and informers meant to avoid punishment.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; A 1487 statute, among other reforms, made it a crime (punishable by two years' imprisonment) to collude with a ''qui tam'' informer.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt;

The practice fell into disrepute in England in the 19th century by which time it was principally used to enforce laws related to [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christian Sunday observance]]. It was brought to an effective end by the [[Common Informers Act 1951]] but, in 2007, there were proposals to introduce legal provision on the U.S. model back to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fraud whistleblowers could get cash rewards | author=Walker, P | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/24/ukcrime.immigrationpolicy | work=The Guardian | accessdate=2008-03-12 | location=London | date=2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

'[[Whistleblower]]' can mean any person who reveals misconduct by his or her employer or another business or entity. The misconduct may be in the form of breaking the law, committing fraud, or corruption. In the United States, that type of fraud may be a violation of the [[False Claims Act]], or similar state and local laws, and a whistleblower who exposes fraud on the government may bring a ''qui tam'' lawsuit on behalf of the government and potentially receive a share of the recovery recovered by the government as a reward for bringing that action.

Whistleblower protections have existed in the United States in [[British empire|colonial]] times, and were embraced by the first U.S. Congress as a way to enforce the laws when the new federal government had virtually no law enforcement officers.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The case of [[Richard Marven]] and Samuel Shaw &lt;!-- Note that, as that article notes, this is NOT the Samuel Shaw who has a page in Wikipedia --&gt; led the [[Continental Congress]] to pass the first  whistleblower law in the new United States in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kohn, Stephen Martin|title="The Whistleblower's Handbook"|year=2011|publisher=Globe Pequot|page=199}}https://www.whistleblowers.org/resources/press-room/press-releases/2010/1251-the-whistleblowers-of-1777-the-origins-of-national-whistleblower-day-&lt;/ref&gt;  The Continental Congress was moved to act after an incident in 1777, when the two blew the whistle and suffered severe retaliation by [[Esek Hopkins]], the commander-in-chief of the Continental Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Honoring America’s Truth-Tellers|url=http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/honoring-america%E2%80%99s-truth-tellers|publisher=Office of United States Senator Charles Grassley|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Continental Congress  enacted the whistleblower protection law on July 30, 1778 by a unanimous vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journals of the Continental Congress: 1774–1789|year=1908|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=732–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Continental Congress declared it the duty of "all persons in the service of the United States, as well as all other the inhabitants thereof" to inform the Continental Congress or proper authorities of "misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any officers in the service of these states, which may come to their knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journals of the Continental Congress: 1774–1789, op. cit.|pages=732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/World/WOR-01-060813.html|title=Asia Times Online :: Welcome to the Post-Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress declared that the United States would defend the two whistleblowers against a libel suit filed against them by Hopkins, resolving that "the reasonable expences of defending the said suit be defrayed by the United States" and terminated the employment of Hopkins, who had misconducted himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc01172))|title=Journals of the Continental Congress--THURSDAY, JULY 30, 1778|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== False Claims Act ====
{{Main article|False Claims Act}}
The [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) was marked by fraud on all levels, especially with regard to Union War Department contracts.  Some say the False Claims Act came about because of bad mules.  During the Civil War, unscrupulous contractors sold the Union Army, among other things, decrepit horses and mules in ill health, faulty rifles and ammunition, and rancid rations and provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Larry D. Lahman, "Bad Mules: A Primer on the Federal False Claims Act", 76 Okla. B. J. 901, 901 (2005) {{cite web |url=http://www.okbar.org/obj/articles_05/040905lahman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120202259/http://www.okbar.org/obj/articles_05/040905lahman.htm |archivedate=2009-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''False Claims Act''' ({{usc|31|3729|3733}}, also called the "'''Lincoln Law'''") is an American [[federal law]] that was passed on March 2, 1863 during the [[American Civil War]], that allows people who are not affiliated with the government to file actions against federal contractors claiming fraud against the government. The law represented an effort by the government to respond to entrenched fraud in cases where the official Justice Department was reluctant to prosecute fraud cases. Importantly, a reward was offered in what is called the "''qui tam''" provision, which permits citizens to sue on behalf of the government and be paid a percentage of the recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=West|first1=Robin Page|title=How a Qui-Tam Whistleblower Case Works|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/qui-tam.html|website=ExpertLaw|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=15 August 2017|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was substantially weakened in 1943 during [[World War II]] while the government rushed to sign large military procurement contracts. It was strengthened again in 1986 after a period of military expansion at a time when there were many stories of defense contractor [[price gouging]]. Since then, ''qui tam'' provisions have helped recover more than $48 billion in taxpayer money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilmoth|first1=Mary J.|title=Today is the 30th Anniversary of the 1986 FCA Qui Tam Amendments|url=http://www.whistleblowingprotection.org/?q=node/69|website=Whistleblower Protection Blog|publisher=National Whistleblower Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund|accessdate=15 August 2017|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act of filing such actions is informally called "[[whistleblower|whistleblowing]]."  Persons filing under the Act stand to receive a portion (usually about 15-25 percent) of any recovered damages. The Act provides a legal tool to counteract fraudulent billings turned in to the federal government. Claims under the law have been filed by persons with insider knowledge of false claims which have typically involved health care, military, or other government spending programs.

The False Claims Act allows a private person, known as a "[[Relator (law)|relator]]," to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the United States, where the private detective or other person has information that the named [[defendant]] has knowingly submitted or caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the United States. In order to qualify as a "relator", pursuant to the Supreme Court's decision in [[Rockwell International Corp. v. United States]], in order to bring an action that is based upon publicly disclosed information the person bringing the claim must legally qualify as an "original source."

The relator need not have been personally harmed by the defendant's conduct; instead, the relator is recognized as receiving legal [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue by way of a "partial assignment" to the relator of the injury to the government caused by the alleged fraud.&lt;ref&gt;See Nathan D. Sturycz, ''The King and I?: An Examination of the Interest Qui Tam Relators Represent and the Implications for Future False Claims Act Litigation'', 28 St. Louis Pub. L. Rev. 459 (2009), ''available at'' http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1537749&lt;/ref&gt; The information must not be public knowledge, unless the relator qualifies as an "original source."&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'' ''Rockwell International Corp. v. United States'', No. 05-1272, 549 U.S. 457 (2007) {{caselaw source | case = ''Rockwell International Corp. v. United State''  | other_source1 = Official U.S. Supreme Court slip opinion | other_url1 = {{SCOTUS URL Slip|06|05-1272}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The False Claims Act provides incentive to relators by granting them between 15% and 25% of any award or settlement amount.&lt;ref name="USCodeFee"&gt;{{cite web|title=31 U.S. Code § 3730(d) - Civil actions for false claims|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3730|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the statute provides an award of the relator's attorneys' fees, making ''qui tam'' actions a popular topic for the [[plaintiff]]'s bar. An individual bringing suit pro se—that is, without the representation of a lawyer—may not bring a ''qui tam'' action under the False Claims Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States ex Rel. Lu v. Ou, 368 F.3d 773 (7th Cir. 2004)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16523080513816586834|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a relator brings suit on behalf of the government, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], in conjunction with a [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] for the district in which the suit was filed, have the option to intervene in the suit. If the government does intervene, it will notify the company or person being sued that a claim has been filed. ''Qui tam'' actions are filed under seal, which has to be partially lifted by the court to allow this type of disclosure. The seal prohibits the [[defendant]] from disclosing even the mere existence of the case to anyone, including its shareholders, a fact which may cause conflicts with the defendant's obligation under [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities &amp; Exchange Commission]] or [[stock exchange]] regulations that require it to disclose lawsuits that could materially affect stock prices. The government may subsequently, without disclosing the identity of the plaintiff or any of the facts, begin taking discovery from the defendant.

If the government does not decide to participate in a ''qui tam'' action, the relator may proceed alone without the Department of Justice, though such cases historically have a much lower success rate. Relators who do prevail in such cases may potentially receive a higher relator's share, to a maximum of 30%.&lt;ref name="USCodeFee"/&gt;  It is conventionally thought that the government chooses legal matters it would prosecute because the government would only want to get involved in what it believes are winning cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. Scott Oswald, "Questions and Answers About the Qui Tam Provision of the False Claims Act", (2009) https://www.employmentlawgroup.com/in-the-news/articles/questions-answers-qui-tam-provision-false-claims-act/&lt;/ref&gt;

====False patent marking====
It is an offense under {{usc|35|292}} (the "False Marking Statute") to falsely mark goods as "[[patent]]ed" or "[[patent pending]]". Before the enactment of the America Invents Act, any person could sue for breach, and the penalty of up to $500 was shared between the government and the person suing. Frequently, patentees fail to remove patent markings from their products following the expiration date of their patents and continue to mark goods sold after that date as patented. This behavior was largely overlooked until a court held that a separate penalty was due for each such article sold.&lt;ref&gt;(''The Forest Group, Inc. v. Bon Tool Co'', 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio]] held that the False Marking Statute was unconstitutional. Judge Dan Aaron Polster determined that it violated the [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Caring for the faithful execution of the law|Take Care Clause]] of [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the Constitution, because it represented "a wholesale delegation of criminal law enforcement power to private entities with no control exercised by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]".&lt;ref name=Unique /&gt;

The [[Leahy-Smith America Invents Act|America Invents Act]] made significant changes to false marking laws, that affected all pending and future false marking actions:&lt;ref name=Quinn /&gt;
* Only the U.S. government can now sue for the civil penalty authorized in §&amp;nbsp;292.
* Private entities can still sue, but only for compensatory damages. These plaintiffs must prove actual competitive injury from the false marking.
* It is no longer a violation to mark a product with an expired patent, as long as that patent once covered the product.

====Defense Criminal Investigative Service====
* From January 2006 to November 2011, [[Defense Criminal Investigative Service]] (DCIS) conducted 115 investigations involving ''qui tam'' matters. These ''qui tam'' investigations did not necessarily arise from reprisal complaints. Nonetheless, the person filing the complaint contributes to the mission of the Inspector General and is considered a [[whistleblower]] in the person's own right.&lt;ref name="dodig.mil"&gt;http://www.dodig.mil/pubs/sar.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, ''qui tam'' whistleblowers provided DCIS 102 information reports resulting in 57 regular investigations. In the following two years, 79 information reports resulted in 68 regular investigations and 71 information reports resulted in 43 regular investigations, respectively. In 2009 and 2010, 86 information reports generated 65 regular investigations and 108 information reports generated 73 regular investigations. At the close of 2011, DCIS had 82 information reports resulting in 56 regular investigations.&lt;ref name="dodig.mil" /&gt;

* In response to a complaint from whistleblower Jerry H. Brown II, the US Government filed suit against [[Maersk]] for overcharging for shipments to US forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In a settlement announced on 3 January 2012, the company agreed to pay $31.9 million in fines and interest, but made no admission of wrongdoing.  Brown was entitled to $3.6 million of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Maersk-Line-to-pay-US-31-9-million-in-settlement-2439693.php Egelko, Bob, "$31.9 Million Settlement In Shipping Suit"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 4 January 2012, P.

* Joe Faltaous worked as a Neuroscience Sales Specialist for [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] for two years before resigning after expressing concerns about Eli Lilly’s practices. Joe complained of Lilly’s illegal marketing, promotion and sale of Zyprexa to children and in higher-than-recommended dosages to adults. Joe also complained that, as part of the marketing and promotional schemes, Lilly encouraged physicians by means of monetary payments.   In 2009, Faltaous and 9 other whistleblowers won a settlement with Eli Lilly in a civil ''qui tam'' action in U.S. District Court.&lt;ref name="PandC_1"&gt;{{cite web|title=US v.

The government received an additional $600 million in criminal fines."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Delma Pallares, who rejected offers to be put in the witness protection program, worked for [[American Grocers]] as a logistics manager and general merchandise manager from 1996 through 2003. She gained extensive knowledge of the daily operations of American Grocers, including how the food products were invoiced, valued, and weighed prior to shipping and, according to the complaint, how the company and its employees changed expiration dates and forged accompanying documentation. Ms. Pallares’s efforts in locating persuasive evidence led to this successful prosecution and enabled the U.S. Government to intervene.&lt;ref name="PandC_2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Paul|title=Delma Pallares: Whistleblower Helped Feds Catch Guy Who Ripped Off Troops Is Still Fighting|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/news/delma-pallares-whistleblower-helped-feds-catch-guy-who-ripped-off-troops-is-still-fighting-6711432|accessdate=15 August 2017|agency=Houston Press|date=15 December 2010}} Without her knowledge, the alleged schemes would have gone unnoticed and she and the U.S. Government would not have received $13.7 million of the total settlement."]&lt;/ref&gt;
* During her employment with [[ROTECH]], Sheila Bell-Messier oversaw the operations of the company in twelve states. From 1995 to 2002, Bell’s responsibility grew from overseeing twelve locations to 220 locations nationwide. During this time she was the number one profit maker in the country. Bell took over the Medicare billing because of her great track record and success with cost efficiency. Bell later determined, however, that a significant percentage of patient files were not in compliance because they lacked the correct documentation. Bell also discovered that there was improper testing of oxygen patients. Bell instructed her billing department to “shut down the billing.” Compliance officers came to Texarkana. When they arrived, Bell told them the results of her audit. They informed Bell that they knew that they were significantly out of compliance. Bell told them that she “was not going to Medicare prison for ROTECH,” and refused to restart the billing. Bell was told that ROTECH was in the middle of a settlement agreement with the Government and could not do anything that might put up a “red flag.”  ROTECH paid $2 million to settle civil charges that it engaged in false or fraudulent conduct in billing Medicare for durable medical equipment. The government declined intervention. This settlement netted the client and government about $1.78 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rotech Settles Whistleblower Case for $2 Million|url=https://www.homecaremag.com/news/rotech-settles-whistleblower-case-0909|accessdate=15 August 2017|publisher=Home Care Magazine|date=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rotech Agrees to $2 Million Medicare Fraud Settlement|url=http://www.fdanews.com/articles/109832-rotech-agrees-to-2-million-medicare-fraud-settlement|website=FDA News|accessdate=15 August 2017|date=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 2, 2012 the British pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] agreed to pay the U.S. government $3 billion to settle civil and criminal charges in the largest healthcare fraud settlement in U.S. history and the largest payment ever by a pharmaceutical company.&lt;ref name="usdojgsk"&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/July/12-civ-842.html "GlaxoSmithKline to plead guilty and pay $3 billion to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data,"] Department of Justice Press Release, July 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement also resolved four lawsuits pending in federal court in the District of Massachusetts four separate ''qui tam'' cases brought by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act.&lt;ref name="usdojgsk"/&gt; The civil charges were settled for $2 billion of the total $3 billion resolution, a record number for civil settlements brought under the False Claims Act.&lt;ref name="nytimesrecord"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|last2=Schmidt|first2=Michael S.|title=Glaxo Agrees to Pay $3 Billion in Fraud Settlement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/business/glaxosmithkline-agrees-to-pay-3-billion-in-fraud-settlement.html|accessdate=16 October 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GSK pleaded guilty to promoting drugs for uses not approved by the FDA, also known as “off-label” marketing, and to failing to report key safety data regarding a product.&lt;ref name="nytimesrecord"/&gt; Others charges in the suit include false price reporting practices, Medicaid fraud, and paying illegal kickbacks to physicians.&lt;ref name="usdojgsk"/&gt;
* In April 2012, [[Alliant Techsystems Inc.]] agreed to a $36,967,160 settlement to resolve allegations that ATK sold dangerous and defective illumination flares to the [[Army]] and the [[Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Content|first1=Thomas|title=Alliant, WEC Energy agree to co-own $700 million power plant plus renewable projects|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/newswatch/362806461.html|accessdate=16 October 2017|agency=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government's allegations, from 2000 to 2006, ATK delivered LUU-2 and LUU-19 illuminating para-flares to the Defense Department. These flares, which burn in excess of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit for over five minutes, are used for nighttime combat, covert and search and rescue operations and have been used extensively by American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan in the global war on terror.  The government alleged that the flares delivered by ATK were incapable of withstanding a 10-foot drop test without exploding or igniting, as required by specifications, and that ATK was aware of this when it submitted claims for payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATK Launch Systems Inc.

* In April 2012, [[AmMed Direct LLC]] agreed to pay the United States and the state of Tennessee $18 million plus interest to settle allegations that it submitted false claims to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and Tennessee Medicaid. Both the United States and the state of Tennessee alleged that, from September 2008 through January 2010, the Antioch, Tenn.-based company submitted false claims to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[TennCare]] for diabetes testing supplies, vacuum erection devices and heating pads. Prior to learning of the United States' and Tennessee's investigation, AmMed disclosed to the Medicare Administrative Contractors its failure to refund monies for returned supplies and began paying the refunds to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[TennCare]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rttnews.com/1860244/ammed-direct-to-pay-18-mln-to-us-tennessee-to-resolve-false-claims-allegations.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2012,  [[LifeWatch Services Inc.]] agreed to pay the United States $18.5 million to resolve allegations that the company submitted false claims to federal health care programs. The settlement resolves two lawsuits filed under the whistleblower provisions of the [[False Claims Act]]. The two complaints allege that LifeWatch improperly billed Medicare for ambulatory cardiac telemetry (ACT) services.  ACT services are a form of cardiac event monitoring that use cell phone technology to record cardiac events in real time without patient intervention.   Traditional event monitoring requires the patient to press a button when he or she notices a cardiac event to record the cardiac rhythms.  Medicare reimbursed ACT services at between $750 and $1200 and traditional event monitoring services at roughly $250 during the relevant time period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov/usao/waw/press/2012/Mar/lifewatch.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2010, [[Special Agents]] from the [[Defense Criminal Investigative Service]] (DCIS)  worked jointly with the [[U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command]], Major Procurement Fraud Unit on an investigation of Samir Itani. The Texas businessman has agreed to pay $15 million to settle federal allegations that he and his company cheated the government by selling old and potentially dangerous food to the U.S. military to supply combat troops serving in Iraq and elsewhere. Prosecutors had alleged that Samir Mahmoud Itani and his company [[American Grocers Ltd]]. profited from the Middle East conflict by ripping off taxpayers and shortchanging U.S. soldiers in the mess hall. According to the government, Itani's firm bought deeply discounted products whose freshness dates had expired or were nearing expiration. His workers then altered those dates and resold those supplies to the government for hefty markups, prosecutors alleged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/20/business/la-fi-1120-military-food-fraud-20101116 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=P.J. | last1=Huffstutter | first2=Andrew | last2=Blankstein | title=Texas businessman settles military food mislabeling case for $15 million | date=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2009, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] announced [[The Boeing Company]] was ordered to pay the United States $25 million to resolve allegations that the company performed defective work on the entire [[KC-10 Extender]] fleet, today. The [[KC-10 Extender]] was a mainstay of the Air Force’s aerial refueling fleet in the Iraq and Afghanistan war theaters.

* In September 2009, a former [[Pfizer]] Inc. sales representative, John Kopchinski, was awarded $51.5 million for his role as a whistleblower in the investigation of Pfizer's marketing practices of [[Bextra]].  Pfizer pleaded guilty to various civil and criminal charges and paid in total $2.3 billion to the government.  The case netted the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States for any matter, $1.195 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice Department Announces Largest Health Care Fraud Settlement in Its History|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history|website=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest civil fraud settlement against any pharmaceutical company.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel09/justice_090209.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ''Qui tam'' "relators" are not eligible to receive shares of criminal fines.

April 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  A subsidiary of Quest, Nichols Institute Diagnostics Inc., was charged with marketing and selling faulty blood test kits to medical testing lab companies over a period of six years, despite substantial evidence that the product obtained inaccurate results. The “''qui tam''” case, which was brought under the [[False Claims Act]] by a California biochemist, launched a large-scale federal investigation and resulted in the record-setting resolution. The whistleblower was awarded $45 million of the $262 million civil settlement under the False Claims Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Significant False Claims Act Settlements &amp; Judgments - Fiscal Years 2009-2016|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/918366/download|website=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In the provinces of Canada that observed the English [[common law]], the ''qui tam'' action has had limited scope, although as recently as 1933 the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34 had language to the effect that ''qui tam'' was permitted in "suits for penalties or forfeiture as where the suit is on behalf of the Crown alone." (Bank of Montreal v. Royal Bank of Canada, [1933] SCR 311; see sec 75(a) of RSC 1886 v2 c.135 "Supreme and Exchequer Courts").  Lawyers have used the ''qui tam'' action to prevent unwarranted intrusion into their domain by unqualified practitioners (1871: Allen Qui Tam v. Jarvis, 32 UCR 56).  In cases like these, it would appear that the Crown is owed a bond from qualified practitioners, and the respondents—since they have not provided such a bond—are penalised by the courts.  Allen in this case would seem to gain a fraction of the penalty exacted from Jarvis, the balance to the Crown.

== Whistleblowers ==
'[[Whistleblower]]' can mean any person who reveals misconduct by his or her employer or another business or entity. The misconduct may be in the form of breaking the law, committing fraud, or corruption. In the United States, that type of fraud may be a violation of the [[False Claims Act]], or similar state and local laws, and a whistleblower who exposes fraud on the government may bring a ''qui tam'' lawsuit on behalf of the government and potentially receive a share of the recovery recovered by the government as a reward for bringing that action.

In order for a whistleblower (also known as a "relator" in the context of the FCA) to bring a ''qui tam'' action that is based upon publicly disclosed information, that person must legally qualify as an "original source." See ''[[Rockwell International Corp. v. United States]]''.

'''Regulation of [[acupuncture]]''' is done by governmental bodies to ensure safe practice.

== Japan ==
In Japan, acupuncture practitioners are licensed by the [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare|Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare]] after passing an examination and graduating from a technical school or university.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = WHO Global Atlas of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine|last = |first = |publisher = World Health Organization|year = 2005|isbn = 978-92-4-156286-7|location = |pages = 195|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VO8K9h9GvaoC&amp;pg=PA195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
In 2000, the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] (CMBV) was established as an independent government agency to oversee the practice of Chinese Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmrb.vic.gov.au |title=Welcome to the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of Victoria |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213104036/http://www.cmrb.vic.gov.au/ |archivedate=2008-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 the Parliamentary Committee on the Health Care Complaints Commission in the Australian state of [[New South Wales]] commissioned a report investigating Traditional Chinese medicine practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/CA78E168CE1B6FA2CA2570B400200A34 | title = Final Report, Report into Traditional Chinese Medicine | publisher = [[Parliament of New South Wales]] | date = 2005-11-09 | accessdate = 2013-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They recommended the introduction of a government-appointed registration board that would regulate the profession by restricting use of the titles "acupuncturist", "Chinese herbal medicine practitioner" and "Chinese medicine practitioner".  The aim of registration was to protect the public from the risks of acupuncture by ensuring a high baseline level of competency and education of registered acupuncturists, enforcing guidelines regarding continuing professional education and investigating complaints of practitioner conduct.  Currently acupuncturists in NSW are bound by the guidelines in the Public Health (Skin Penetration) Regulation 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/public-health/ehb/general/skinpen/skin_pen_reg_2000.pdf | format = pdf | title = Public health (skin penetration) regulation | year = 2000 | accessdate = 2013-05-25 | publisher = Health board of New South Wales }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is enforced at local council level.  In 2012 the CMBV became the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia, and in 2013 established an interim accreditation standard for the profession in partnership with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinesemedicineboard.gov.au/documents/default.aspx?record=WD13%2f10034&amp;dbid=AP&amp;chksum=9JNX1YgwCvaYR53Mq9FBuQ%3d%3d | format = pdf |title=Interim Accreditation Standard for Chinese Medicine | accessdate = 2013-05-25 | date = 2013-01-21 | publisher = Chinese Medicine Board of Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation put in place stipulates that only practitioners who are state-registered may use the following titles: Acupuncture, Chinese Medicine, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Registered Acupuncturist, Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioner, and Registered Chinese Herbal Medicine Practitioner.

== Canada ==
In Canada the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec have acupuncture licensing programs. In many provinces that are not subject to government regulation, employers will require candidates qualify for membership at the local chapter of the [[Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada]].&lt;ref name="Ramsay2009"/&gt; The province of [[Ontario, Canada]], created the [[Traditional Chinese Medicine Act]] in 2006, which created the [[College of Traditional Chinese Practitioners and Acupuncturists]].&lt;ref name="Ramsay2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cynthia Ramsay|title=Unnatural Regulation: Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5oPvK4QVwC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2009|publisher=The Fraser Institute|pages=43|id=GGKEY:0KK0XUSQASK}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be licensed in Ontario, acupuncturists need to register with the college, pass a series of tests and demonstrate an experience-equivalent of having seen more than 2,000 patients over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= CBC News |title= Traditional Chinese medicine now regulated in Ontario College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners begins regulation today|date=April 1, 2013|publisher=The Canadian Press|accessdate=May 11, 2015|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/traditional-chinese-medicine-now-regulated-in-ontario-1.1336269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec, the practice of acupuncture has been regulated since 1995 by the Ordre des acupuncteurs du Québec (OAQ).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== France ==
Since 1955, the French advisory body [[Académie Nationale de Médecine]] (''National Academy of Medicine'') has accepted acupuncture as part of medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bossy|first=Jean|title=Acupuncture in France|publisher=''Acupunct Med''|url=http://aim.bmj.com/content/5/1/6.full.pdf+html|quote=Since 1955, the French Academy of Medicine accetr ted and included Acupunchlre as a part of medicine because it includes both diagnosis and therapeutic treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acupuncture is also routinely reimbursed by social security when performed or prescribed by a  doctor or practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hampshire|first=David|title=The French National Health System|url=http://www.parisvoice.com/practical-paris/134-the-french-national-health-system|publisher=Paris Voice|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[German acupuncture trials]] from 2006 to 2007, the [[Federal Joint Committee (Germany)|Federal Joint Committee]] (an agency similar to the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the United States) passed a law which allows the reimbursement of acupuncture treatment by the public health insurance system for the following ailments: chronic [[Low back pain|lower back pain]]&lt;ref name="geracnlb"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cummings|first=Martin|title=Modellvorhaben Akupunktur--a summary of the ART, ARC and GERAC trials.|pmid=19369191|doi=10.1136/aim.2008.000281|volume=27|date=Mar 2009|journal=Acupunct Med|pages=26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chronic [[knee pain]] caused by [[osteoarthritis]].&lt;ref name="geracnlb"/&gt; In 2006, German researchers published the results of one of the first and largest randomized controlled clinical trials.&lt;ref name="He-2013" /&gt; As a result of the trial's conclusions, some [[insurance]] corporations in Germany no longer reimburse acupuncture treatments.&lt;ref name="He-2013" /&gt; The trials also had a negative impact on acupuncture in the international community.&lt;ref name="He-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 24024341 |year= 2013 |last1= He |first1= W. |last2= Tong |first2= Y. |last3= Zhao |first3= Y. |last4= Zhang |first4= L. |last5= Ben |first5= H. |last6= Qin |first6= Q. |last7= Huang |first7= F. |last8= Rong |first8= P. |displayauthors= 4 |title= Review of controlled clinical trials on acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in Germany |volume= 33 |issue= 3 |pages= 403–7 |journal= Journal of traditional Chinese medicine |doi=10.1016/s0254-6272(13)60187-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
Acupuncturists are not a nationally regulated profession in the [[United Kingdom]]. Acupuncture practice is regulated by law in England and Wales for health and safety criteria under The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, which has been recently amended by the Local Government Act 2003. Each local authority implements its own policy in accordance with the Act. For example, the London boroughs use the London Local Authorities Act, 1991/2000. Premises and each practitioner offering acupuncture must be licensed. As there is no formal certification of acupuncture, practitioners are exempted from licensing by virtue of being current members of approved acupuncture associations such as the British Acupuncture Council. Physiotherapists are also required to be current members of an approved acupuncture association as body piercing is not part of the entry level curriculum for state registered physiotherapists regulated by the Health Professions Council. The approved acupuncture organisations have rigorous codes of practice and educational requirements and members are covered by the appropriate indemnity insurance.  An estimated 7,500 practitioners practise acupuncture to some extent and belong to a relevant professional or regulatory body. About 2,400 are traditional acupuncturists who mostly belong to the [[British Acupuncture Council]], which requires its members to be trained in both traditional acupuncture and relevant biomedical sciences. Approximately 2,200 registered doctors and other statutorily regulated health professionals belong to the [[British Medical Acupuncture Society]]. Some 6,000 physiotherapists belong to the [[Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists]] and 250 nurses belong to the British Academy of Western Acupuncture. There are also practitioners of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] who belong to one or more associations.&lt;ref name=SRAP&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ehpa.eu/pdf/ARWG_report_2003.pdf|title=The Statutory Regulation of the Acupuncture Profession|date=September 2003|publisher=Acupuncture Regulatory Working Group|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001060524/http://www.ehpa.eu/pdf/ARWG_report_2003.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==

Acupuncturists in the United States are trained and licensed according to criteria set by three [[professional organizations]], all founded in the early 1980's:
* The Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM), which accredits acupuncture schools and programs; it is recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/FAQAccr.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM), a voluntary-membership organization for acupuncture schools and programs; its "primary mission is to support member institutions to deliver educational excellence and quality patient care."&lt;ref name=ccaom-home&gt;http://www.ccaom.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  It also administers the Clean Needle Technique (CNT) course, which trains acupuncturists in safe, [[Asepsis|sterile]] needling technique.&lt;ref name=ccaom-home/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccaom.org/cntprogram.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine]] (NCCAOM), which certifies acupuncturists nationally; its programs are certified by the [[Institute for Credentialing Excellence#National Commission for Certifying Agencies|National Commission for Certification Agencies]] (NCCA).&lt;ref name="nccaom.org"&gt;http://www.nccaom.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.credentialingexcellence.org/p/cm/ld/fid=121&lt;/ref&gt;  NCCAOM certification is contingent on completion of an approved educational program, completing the Clean Needle Technique (CNT) course, and passing the NCCAOM certification exams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nccaom.org/applicants/eligibility-requirements/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChanLee2001"/&gt;  NCCAOM certification, or in some cases passing the NCCAOM exams, suffices to demonstrate competency for licensure as an acupuncturist in 43 of the 44 states (plus the District of Columbia) that regulate acupuncture.&lt;ref name="nccaom.org"/&gt;  (California has its own examination and certification process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acupuncture.ca.gov/consumers/consumer_faqs.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;).

Acupuncture regulation in the US began in the 1970s, prompted by an article by New York Times reporter [[James Reston]].&lt;ref name="Bauer2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=L. Ac. Bauer|title=Making Acupuncture Pay: Real-World Advice for Successful Private Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14gC5MErex4C&amp;pg=PA42|date=1 April 2011|publisher=Dog Ear Publishing|isbn=978-1-4575-0279-8|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973, Nevada became the first US state in the nation to authorizing the practice of acupuncture, and many states thereafter followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/76th2011/Bills/ACR/ACR9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Drug Administration]] first regulated acupuncture needles in 1972 as "investigational devices" and later recognized needles for acupuncture uses in 1996.&lt;ref name="ChanLee2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kevin Chan|author2=Henry Lee|title=The Way Forward for Chinese Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5EIubrfg6wC&amp;pg=PA349|date=6 December 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-2423-4|pages=349–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] changed the status of acupuncture needles from [[Medical devices#Classification|Class III]] to [[Medical devices#Classification|Class II]] [[medical device]]s, meaning that needles are regarded as safe and effective when used appropriately by licensed practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/596_upd.html |title=Acupuncture Needles No Longer Investigational |publisher=[[FDA Consumer]] |accessdate=2007-12-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219041730/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/596_upd.html |archivedate=December 19, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pmapage.html US FDA/CDRH: Premarket Approvals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5908">The '''Restatement (Second) of the Law of Contracts''' is a legal treatise from the second series of the [[Restatements of the Law]], and seeks to inform judges and lawyers about general principles of contract common law. It is one of the best-recognized and frequently cited legal treatises&lt;ref name="Bluebook000"&gt;Acceptable citation format under the [[Bluebook]]: "Restatement (Second) of Contracts § ___ (1981)."

==Use and commentary==
Legal scholars and jurists have commented extensively on the Restatement, both in contrasting it with aspects of the first Restatement, and in evaluating its influence and effectiveness in reaching its stated objectives. It is in this context of ''direct review'' that one can find numerous arguments both favoring and criticizing some aspects of the Restatement as an independent source of legal scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interpretation and Legal Effect in the Second "Restatement of Contracts"&lt;/span&gt; Robert Braucher ''Columbia Law Review'', Vol. 81, No. 1 (Jan., 1981),  pp. 13-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs,'' Legal Realism or Legal Fiction? Impracticability Under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts'', 87 Com. L.J. 289 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braucher,'' Offer and Acceptance in the Second Restatement'', 74 Yale L.J. 302 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly,'' The Codification of Contract Law in the Twentieth Century'', 88 Dick. L. Rev. 289 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keyes,'' The Restatement (Second): Its Misleading Quality and a Proposal for Its Amelioration'', 13 Pepp. L. Rev. 23 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several sections of the Restatement contained new rules which sometimes contradicted existing law, courts citing these sections have predominantly adopted the Restatement's view, citing them as a court would cite statute or code.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory E. Maggs, ''[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/gmaggs/pubs/ipse.htm Ipse Dixit: The Restatement (Second) of Contracts and the Modern Development of Contract Law]'', 66 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 508 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Far more common, however, is the practice of citing the Restatement to clarify generally accepted doctrine in every major area of contract and commercial law. It is in this context of ''legal research'' that one can find the Restatement used as direct substantiation and [[persuasive authority]], to validate the arguments and interpretations of individual legal practitioners.&lt;!-- contrasting with the first restatement
on the legal doctrine of restitution--&gt;&lt;ref name="Perillo"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Restitution in the Second "Restatement of Contracts"&lt;/span&gt;Joseph M. Perillo''Columbia Law Review'',Vol. 81, No. 1 (Jan., 1981), pp. 37-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- expanded treatment of promissory estoppel 
(TODO: make sure to incorporate the following points into the article [excerpted from online article] GFDL-compatible wording is necessary, will have to get to it later.)
Section 90 has been described as the Restatement's "most notable and influential rule"(4) and as "perhaps the most radical and expansive development of this century in the law of promissory liability."(5) The section has had a profound influence on the law of contracts because it ratifies cases enforcing a promise in the absence of bargained-for consideration.(6) By giving its imprimatur to those cases, the Restatement has encouraged courts to expand contractual liability beyond the traditional doctrinal limits of consideration.(7)

==Legacy==

Although the Restatement of Contracts is still an influential academic work, certain aspects have been superseded in everyday legal practice by the [[Uniform Commercial Code]].  Specifically, the UCC has replaced the Restatement (Second) of Contracts in regard to the sale of goods.  The Restatement (Second) of Contracts remains the unofficial authority for aspects of contract law which find their genesis in the common law principles of the United States and, previously, England.

[[File:Teleskolan, Stockholm.JPG|thumb|The office in Stockholm]]
'''STIM''', ''Svenska Tonsättares Internationella Musikbyrå'', is a Swedish [[collecting society]] for [[songwriter]]s, [[composer]]s and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]]. Its role is to act as an agent for its members in order to collect license fees whenever their musical works are performed in public, broadcast or transmitted, and to pay out [[performing royalty|performing royalties]].

STIM was founded in 1923, a few years before [[Sveriges Radio]] began regular broadcasting. Initially an organization for collecting concert fees for composers of classical music, it has since expanded to all genres of music, and license fees from broadcasters have become an important source of income. The organization now has more than 71,000 members. In 2003-2007 the annual turnover was slightly more than 1000 million SEK.

Once an organization is set up, representing a majority of copyright holders within a type of works (as STIM is for composers of recorded music), Swedish copyright law (1960:729, chapter 3a, sections §42a–f) grants users of such works (e.g. broadcasters that use recorded music) the right to use all such works under a single contract with that organization. The collected fees are set by STIM, depending on the size of the audience but independent of the individual work or composer. An individual composer who disagrees, must actively opt out (§42b–e, 2nd paragraph) of this collective arrangement. A composer who wants a share of the fees has to join STIM as a member.

Copyrights are administered through another organization [[Nordisk Copyright Bureau|NCB]] of which STIM is part owner.

'''''Schalk and Kopf v Austria''''' (Application no. 30141/04) is a case decided in 2010 by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) in which it was clarified that the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) does not oblige member states to legislate for or legally recognize [[same-sex marriage]]s.

==Facts==
The applicants are a same-sex couple living in [[Vienna]], Austria. On 10 September 2002 they requested the Office for matters of Personal Status ([[Standesamt]]) to proceed with the formalities to enable them to contract marriage. By decision of 20 December 2002 the Vienna Municipal Office (Magistrat) refused the applicants’ request. Referring to Article 44 of the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code]] (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch), it held that marriage could only be contracted between two persons of opposite sex. According to constant case-law, a marriage concluded by two persons of the same sex was null and void. Since the applicants were two men, they lacked the capacity for contracting marriage.
The applicants then lodged an appeal with the Vienna Regional Governor ([[Landeshauptmann]]), which was also dismissed. In his decision of 11 April 2003, the Governor confirmed the Municipal Office’s legal view. In addition he referred to the [[Administrative Court of Austria|Administrative Court’s]] (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) case-law according to which it constituted an impediment to marriage if the two persons concerned were of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;para. 7-10 of the ECtHR judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate and final remedy for the applicants was a complaint to the [[Constitutional Court of Austria|Constitutional Court]] (Verfassungsgerichtshof). In this complaint the applicants alleged that the legal impossibility for them to get married constituted a violation of their constitutional right to respect for private and family life and of the principle of non-discrimination. (Austria treats the ECHR as part of its own constitutional law. The legal provisions referred to by the applicants were thus those set out in Articles 12, 8 and 14 of the Convention). They argued that the notion of marriage had evolved since the entry into force of the Civil Code in 1812. In particular, the procreation and education of children no longer formed an integral part of marriage. In present-day perception, marriage was rather a permanent union encompassing all aspects of life. There was no objective justification for excluding same-sex couples from concluding marriage, all the more so since the European Court of Human Rights had acknowledged that differences based on sexual orientation required particularly weighty reasons. Other European countries either allowed same-sex marriages or had otherwise amended their legislation in order to give equal status to same-sex partnerships.

On 12 December 2003 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants’ complaint. The relevant parts of its judgment read as follows:
“Neither the principle of equality set forth in the Austrian Federal Constitution nor the European Convention on Human Rights (as evidenced by “men and women” in Article 12) require that the concept of marriage as being geared to the fundamental possibility of parenthood should be extended to relationships of a different kind. 
(...)
"The fact that same-sex relationships fall within the concept of private life and as such enjoy the protection of Article 8 of the ECHR – which also prohibits discrimination on non-objective grounds (Article 14 of the ECHR) – does not give rise to an obligation to change the law of marriage.
"It is unnecessary in the instant case to examine whether, and in which areas, the law unjustifiably discriminates against same-sex relationships by providing for special rules for married couples. Nor is it the task of this court to advise the legislature on constitutional issues or even matters of legal policy."
"Instead, the complaint must be dismissed as ill-founded.”''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Vfgh&amp;Dokumentnummer=JFT_09968788_03B00777_00 Verfassungsgerichtshof (VfGH), B777/03, 13.12.2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==

=== No violation of Article 12 of the Convention ===
The applicants claimed that Austria's failure to legally recognise same-sex marriages constituted a violation of [[Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 12 ECHR]], which provides
as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court unanimously dismissed this claim:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Court notes that Article 12 grants the right to marry to “men and women”. The French version provides « l’homme et la femme ont le droit de se marier ». Furthermore, Article 12 grants the right to found a family. The applicants argued that the wording did not necessarily imply that a man could only marry a woman and vice versa. The Court observes that, looked at in isolation, the wording of Article 12 might be interpreted so as not to exclude the marriage between two men or two women. However, in contrast, all other substantive Articles of the Convention grant rights and freedoms to “everyone” or state that “no one” is to be subjected to certain types of prohibited treatment. The choice of wording in Article 12 must thus be regarded as deliberate. Moreover, regard must be had to the historical context in which the Convention was adopted. In the 1950s marriage was clearly understood in the traditional sense of being a union between partners of different sex."&lt;ref&gt;paras 54, 55 of the Judgment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== No violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention ===

As a subsidiary argument, the applicants complained under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention that they had been discriminated against on account of their sexual orientation, since they were denied the right to marry. 

Addressing this part of the complaint, the ECtHR pointed out the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Insofar as the applicants appear to contend that, if not included in Article 12, the right to marry might be derived from Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, the Court is unable to share their view. It reiterates that the Convention is to be read as a whole and its Articles should therefore be construed in harmony with one another. Having regard to the conclusion reached above, namely that Article 12 does not impose an obligation on Contracting States to grant same-sex couples access to marriage, Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, a provision of more general purpose and scope, cannot be interpreted as imposing such an obligation either."&lt;ref&gt;par. 101 of the Judgment&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;/blockquote&gt;                                                     

The applicants also saw these articles as violated by lack of legal recognition of same-sex couples in Austria before 2010. The Court responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Court cannot but note that there is an emerging European consensus towards legal recognition of same-sex couples. Moreover, this tendency has developed rapidly over the past decade. Nevertheless, there is not yet a majority of States providing for legal recognition of same-sex couples. The area in question must therefore still be regarded as one of evolving rights with no established consensus, where States must also enjoy a margin of appreciation in the timing of the introduction of legislative changes (..) [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Austria|The Austrian Registered Partnership Act]], which entered into force on 1 January 2010, reflects the evolution described above and is thus part of the emerging European consensus. Though not in the vanguard, the Austrian legislator cannot be reproached for not having introduced the Registered Partnership Act any earlier''&lt;ref&gt;par. 105-106 of the Judgment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Judges Rozakis, Spielmann and Tulkens dissented in this respect, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Having identified a “relevantly similar situation” (para. 99), and emphasised that “differences based on sexual orientation require particularly serious reasons by way of justification” (para. 97), the Court should have found a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention because the respondent Government did not advance any argument to justify the difference of treatment, relying in this connection mainly on their margin of appreciation (para. 80). However, in the absence of any cogent reasons offered by the respondent Government to justify the difference of treatment, there should be no room to apply the margin of appreciation. Consequently, the “existence or non-existence of common ground between the laws of the Contracting States” (para. 98) is irrelevant as such considerations are only a subordinate basis for the application of the concept of the margin of appreciation. Indeed, it is only in the event that the national authorities offer grounds for justification that the Court can be satisfied, taking into account the presence or the absence of a common approach, that they are better placed than it is to deal effectively with the matter&lt;ref&gt;Para. 8 of the joint dissent of Judges Rozakis, Jebens and Tulkens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Obiter dictum'' on same-sex relations to be considered a form of "family life" ===

The Court, for the first time, has accepted same-sex relationships as a form of "family life". The statement runs as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...the Court’s case-law has only accepted that the emotional and sexual relationship of a same-sex couple constitutes “private life” but has not found that it constitutes “family life”, even where a long term relationship of cohabiting partners was at stake. In coming to that conclusion, the Court observed that despite the growing tendency in a number of European States towards the legal and judicial recognition of stable de facto partnerships between gay people, given the existence of
little common ground between the Contracting States, this was an area in which they still enjoyed a wide [[margin of appreciation]].''
''(...)'' 
The Court notes that (...) a rapid evolution of social attitudes towards same-sex couples has taken place in many member States. Since then a considerable number of member States have afforded legal recognition to same-sex couples (see above, paragraphs 27-30). Certain provisions of EU law also reflect a growing tendency to include same-sex couples in the notion of “family”(...).
In view of this evolution the Court considers it artificial to maintain the view that, in contrast to a different-sex couple, a same-sex couple cannot enjoy “family life” for the purposes of Article 8. Consequently the relationship of the applicants, a cohabiting same-sex couple living in a stable de facto partnership, falls within the notion of “family life”, just as the relationship of a different-sex couple in the same situation would."&lt;ref&gt;paras 99-94 of the Judgment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this constitutes a mere [[obiter dictum]] that had no impact on the outcome of the case.

=== Obiter dictum on the scope of Article 12 in light of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights===

Another obiter dictum of the Court concerns Article 8 of the [[EU Charter of Fundamental Rights|EU Fundamental Rights Charter]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Regard being had to Article 8 of the Charter, therefore, the Court would no longer consider that the right to marry enshrined in Article 12 must in all circumstances be limited to marriage between two persons of the opposite sex. Consequently, it cannot be said that Article 12 is inapplicable to the applicants' complaint''&lt;ref&gt;para 61 of the Judgment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- The meaning of this remark remains somewhat obscure. This is due to the ambiguous relationship between the Charter and the Convention: on the one hand, the [[Preamble]] of the Charter clearly states an intention of "reaffirming" and "making more visible" existing fundamental rights - notably those enshrined in the ECHR - but it states no intention of expanding or modifying them;&lt;ref&gt;cf. the paras 4 and 5 of the Preamble: ''"It is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights  (...) by making those rights more visible in a Charter. This Charter reaffirms (...) the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to the Member States, the Treaty on European Union, the Community Treaties, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Social Charters adopted by the Community and by the Council of Europe and the case-law of the Court
of Justice of the European Communities and of the European Court of Human Rights."''&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, the wording of the Charter seems to contradict that of the Convention. The definition of the right to marry is an example for this: the Charter allows Member States to extend the term "marriage" to same-sex couples,&lt;ref&gt;cf. Art 8 of the Charter: "The right to marry and the right to found a family shall be guaranteed in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of these rights.". There is no more reference to "men and women of marriageable age", as in Art 12 of the ECHR. Moreover, the new definition is accompanied by the following remark: ''"This Article is based on Article 12 of the ECHR, which reads as follows: "Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family according to the national laws governing the exercising of this right." The wording of the Article has been modernised to cover cases in which national legislation recognises arrangements other than marriage for founding a family. This Article neither prohibits nor imposes the granting of the status of marriage to unions between people of the same sex. This right is thus similar to that afforded by the ECHR, but its scope may be wider when national legislation so provides.''" This commentary clearly acknowledges that there is ''similarity, but not identity,'' between the concepts of "marriage" used in the two documents.&lt;/ref&gt; but it creates no obligation to do so. The Convention, by contrast, does not foresee this option, and the obiter dictum in Schalk seems to indicate that the Court had until then considered that Art 12 prohibited such extension. {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

However, given that not all Signatory States of the ECHR are bound by the EU Fundamental Rights Charter, it is difficult to see how the ratification of the Charter by the 27 Member States of the EU can have changed the content or meaning of the Convention.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} --&gt;

Judge Malinverni in his concurrence has objected to this ''obiter dictum'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Article 12 is inapplicable to persons of the same sex. Admittedly, in guaranteeing the right to marry, Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union deliberately omitted any reference to men and women, since it provides that “the right to marry and to found a family shall be guaranteed in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of these rights”. In my opinion, however, no inferences can be drawn from this as regards the interpretation of Article 12 of our Convention. The commentary on the Charter does indeed confirm that the drafters of Article 8 intended it to be broader in scope than the corresponding articles in other international treaties. However, it should not be forgotten that Article 8 of the Charter guarantees the right to marry and to found a family “in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of these rights”.
By referring in this way to the relevant domestic legislation, Article 8 of the Charter simply leaves it to States to decide whether they wish to afford homosexual couples the right to marry. However, as the commentary quite rightly points out, “there is no obstacle to recognize same-sex relationships in the context of marriage. There is, however, no explicit requirement that domestic laws should facilitate such marriages.” In my view, Article 8 of the Charter should therefore have no bearing on the interpretation of Article 12 of the Convention as conferring a right to marry only on persons of different sexes&lt;ref&gt;para. 2 of the concurring opinion of Judge Malinverni&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Separate opinions===

Judges [[Christos Rozakis|Rozakis]], [[Sverre Erik Jebens|Jebens]] and [[Dean Spielmann|Spielmann]] submitted a joint dissenting opinion, arguing that lack of legal recognition of same-sex couples in Austria before 2010 constituted violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8.

Judge [[Giorgio Malinverni|Malinverni]], joined by judge [[Anatoly Kovler|Kovler]], submitted a concurring opinion, arguing that Article 12 could under no circumstances be construed as referring to same-sex couples.

=== Request for referral to Grand Chamber ===
A request of the unsuccessful applicants to refer the case to a Grand Chamber was rejected by the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=open&amp;documentId=877588&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR press release no. 906] 29.11.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Supreme Electoral Council''' ({{lang-tr|Yüksek Seçim Kurulu}}, YSK) is the highest electoral authority in [[Turkey]]. It was established by the Deputies Election Law no. 5545 on 16 February 1950.&lt;ref name="tarihce"/&gt; After the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 coup]], the Supreme Electoral Council gained constitutional authority by the [[Turkish Constitution of 1961|Constitution of 1961]]. Its duty is to ensure that the principles and rules of the constitution are upheld.

The Supreme Electoral Council consists of a president, six members and four substitute members from the [[Court of Cassation (Turkey)|Court of Cassation]] and the [[Turkish Council of State|Council of State]] judges.

'''Tafwid''' ({{lang-ar|تفويض}}) is an Arabic term meaning "relegation" or "delegation", with uses in theology and law.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

== In theology ==

In Islamic theology, ''tafwid'' (or ''tafwid al-amr li-llah'', relegation of matters to God) is a doctrine according to which the meanings of the ambiguous verses of the [[Qur'an]] should be consigned to God alone.&lt;ref name=ODOI&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VeCWQfVNjkC&amp;pg=PA310|title=Tafwid|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of Islam|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195125597|location=|pages=310|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IT88"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yosef|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=9780199402069|location=Oxford|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYzGAAAAQBAJ|title=Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam: The Muslim Brotherhood, Ash'arism, and Political Sunnism|last=Halverson|first=J.|date=2010-04-26|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9780230106581|location=|pages=36|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who follow this school do not utilize metaphorical interpretation, rather they leave problematic texts uninterpreted, believing that the reality of their meaning should be left to the one who said them,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htx8BAAAQBAJ|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of al-Bajuri|last=Spevack|first=Aaron|date=2014-09-09|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438453712|location=|page=36|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying their unknowability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SePRbkpXvMC|title=Politics, Law, and Community in Islamic Thought: The Taymiyyan Moment|last=Anjum|first=Ovamir|date=2012-03-19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107014060|location=|pages=154|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;	

The doctrine of ''tafwid'', which was held by a number of classical scholars such as [[al-Ghazali]] and whose origin they attributed to the ''[[salaf]]'' (exemplary early Muslims), states that the Quranic expressions such as 'God's hands' or 'face' do not carry the literal meanings like their counterparts in human beings. Rather they are attributes or qualities of God and not organs like the face or hands of human beings.&lt;ref name="Phd338"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. Dissertation|last=Shah |first=Zulfikar|date=March 1997 |title=A Study of Anthropomorphism and Transcendence in the Bible and Qur'an.

On this matter, we follow the early Muslims ([[salaf]]): [[Malik]], [[Awza'i]], [[Thawri]], [[Al-Layth ibn Sa'd|Layth ibn Sa'd]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh]], and others among the Imams of the Muslims, both ancient and modern that is, to let (the verse in question) pass as it has come, without saying how it is meant (min ghayr takyif), without likening it to created things (wa la tashbih), and without nullifying it (wa la ta'til): The literal meaning ([[zahir (Islam)|zahir]]) that occurs to the minds of anthropomorphists (al-mushabbihin) is negated of Allah, for nothing from His creation resembles Him: '''"There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing"''' (Qur'an 42:11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htx8BAAAQBAJ|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of al-Bajuri|last=Spevack|first=Aaron|date=2014-09-09|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438453712|location=|pages=129–130|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim|last=Ibn Kathir|first=Ismail|publisher=Maktabat Awlad al-Shaykh l'il Turath|year=2000|location=Cairo|pages=6:320}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise nature of ''tafwid'' has been subject to debate among Muslim scholars.&lt;ref name=Lauziere&gt;{{Cite book|first=Henri |last=Lauzière | year=2015 | title=The Making of Salafism: Islamic Reform in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Columbia University Press (Kindle edition)|page=6048 (Kindle location)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Ibn Taymiyya]], including contemporary [[Salafi]]s, hold that only the modality of the attributes should be consigned to God (''tafwid al-kayfiyya''), while the literal sense of the attributes should be accepted according to their lexical meaning in the Arabic language.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt; Thus they argue that the ''salaf'' accepted that God has a hand, because the meaning of the word "hand" (''yad'') was known, but without assuming that God's hand is comparable to a human hand, or asking how or why that is.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt; In contrast, anti-Salafi scholars reject this distinction and accept ''tafwid'' without qualification.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt;

== Divorce==

In Islamic personal status law, ''tafwid'' refers to a sub-type of divorce (''talaq al-tafwid'' or ''tafwid al-talaq'') in which the power of ''[[Divorce in Islam|talaq]]'' (the type of divorce normally initiated by the husband) is delegated to the wife. This delegation can be made at the time of drawing up the marriage contract or during the marriage, with or without conditions.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt; Classical jurists differed as to the validity of different forms of delegation.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt; Most modern Muslim-majority countries permit this type of divorce in some form.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

== Other uses==

The term ''tafwid'' has also been used in law with various other meanings related to delegation of power, authorization of an act, or issuance of a warrant for arrest.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

'''Testimony in Jewish law''' consists of [[testimony]] by eligible [[witness]]es to a [[Beit Din]] (court) authorized to render decisions according to ''[[halakhah]]'' (Jewish law). Eligible witnesses must in almost all cases be free men who are not deaf, mentally or morally unsuitable, or too young for [[Bar Mitzvah]]; in particular, women are in most cases not eligible. The principles of testimony in halakhah have been applied to [[Mishpat Ivri]] (Hebrew jurisprudence).

==Criteria for valid testimony==
A valid witness to an event in ''halakhah'' must have seen the event with his eyes or heard it with his ears.  Generally [[hearsay]] from another person is inadmissible, except in rare cases such as confirming that a missing husband has died (see [[Agunah]]).  A Beit Din may accept testimony only from a witness who speaks directly to the judges, not from a written deposition.  A witness may not [[recant]] his testimony.

===Two witnesses===

The [[Torah]] says ([[Deuteronomy]] 19:15): "One witness shall not arise against a man for any sin or guilt that he may commit; according to two witnesses or according to three witnesses a matter shall stand." Thus, two witnesses provide conclusive proof of reality, but one witness does not.  (However, the testimony of one witness can require a defendant to swear to his innocence or else pay the debt alleged against him.)

In monetary law two witnesses may absolutely require someone to pay a debt or absolve them from that obligation.  In capital cases two witnesses may testify that a person has committed a crime punishable by the [[Religion and capital punishment#Judaism|death penalty in Jewish law]], and the [[Sanhedrin]] may execute the person on their word; however capital punishment is no longer applied.

The testimony of two witnesses is equal in its force to the testimony of three or more witnesses.  Thus if two witnesses say an event occurred, and one hundred witnesses say it did not occur, the groups of witnesses are considered to contradict one another, but no more weight is given to the larger group; other evidence is needed to reach a judgment.  If one of the witnesses is disqualified, his entire group is disqualified, even if the other witnesses are themselves qualified and could present a valid testimony without his assistance.  (Source: [[Makkot]] chapter 1.)

In monetary law examination of witnesses is less stringent than in capital law, and testimony is accepted even despite minor contradictions that may exist in the testimony of two separate witnesses.  (If one witness says a defendant owes 100, and the other says the sum is 200, the judges accept that both witnesses agree to the existence of a 100 lien, even though only one witness testifies to each individual lien.  Similarly, if one witness says a defendant owes 100 based on a loan granted on Monday, and another witness says the debt is 100 based on a loan granted on Thursday, the defendant is considered to owe 100 by the combined testimony of the two witnesses even though they disagree as to the source of the obligation.)  In contrast, in capital cases the judges threaten the witnesses by warning of the consequences of [[perjury]] (source: Mishnah Sanhedrin chapter 4), and they ask many questions and will invalidate testimony even for minor inconsistencies, even if the contradiction seems substantively irrelevant to the case at hand.  The purpose of these stringencies is to prevent the killing of an innocent defendant.

===Ceremonial versus evidentiary witnesses===
In some instances two witnesses are required to perform a certain action, such as ''[[Erusin|kiddushin]]'' (betrothal).  If there are not two valid witnesses, the ''kiddushin'' does not take effect.  These are ceremonial witnesses (Hebrew: ''eidei kiyum'').  Likewise, a [[shtar]] requires two witnesses, and in particular a [[Get (divorce document)]] requires two witnesses to sign the document or see the delivery.

Witnesses in monetary cases are evidentiary: even if they do not witness a robbery, the robber is still obligated to compensate the owner for damages (although there may be no way to prove this fact){{Clarify|date=October 2010}}.  Evidentiary witnesses are known in Hebrew as ''eidei beirur''.

==Invalidation of a pair of witnesses==

A pair of witnesses may be invalidated if:
*Two other witnesses directly contradict their testimony. (In Hebrew, this is ''hakchasha'', הכחשה.)
*Two other witnesses testify that at the moment the original witnesses claim they saw the incident, those witnesses were with them and could not have witnessed an event elsewhere.  The second pair of witnesses knows nothing about the substance of the matter, but rather undermines the standing of the first pair of witnesses to claim they saw the incident.  This undermining is called ''hazama'', הזמה.  Witnesses found to have lied under this provision are punished with whatever punishment would have befallen their intended victim.  Thus, if they plotted to make a victim suffer capital punishment, the witnesses themselves must suffer capital punishment.
*Blood relatives are not allowed to be witnesses or judges in the same case (Sanhedrin chapter 3 lists which blood relatives are included).  This is a fundamental exclusion, without regard to the specific nature of a possible conflict of interest in a particular case.
*Any witness who is established by other witnesses as a liar or robber or other miscreant is invalid.  There is a general rule that if one person among a group of witnesses is disqualified, they are all disqualified, even if the original disqualification does not question the truthfulness of the disqualified witness, and even if there remain two other witnesses (Makkot chapter 1).

===Powers of a lone witness===

A lone witness cannot give testimony in capital cases.  His testimony is useless unless there is a second witness to join him.  In monetary cases a lone witness has limited powers.  He can require a defendant to take an oath stating that the defendant is in the right, and if the defendant refuses to take the oath he must pay instead{{Clarify|date=September 2010|reason=why would a witness have "powers", or require a defendant to swear? Is this someone who is both plaintiff and witness?}}.  (In most cases, it is at the defendant's discretion whether to swear but, in rare instances, the court may require the defendant to pay without the option of swearing [Shevu'ot chapter 7].)

In the case of a classical [[Agunah]], a woman whose husband has disappeared and it is not known whether the husband is still alive, a single witness (even a woman or slave, normally invalid as witnesses) may testify that the husband has died, and on that basis the woman may remarry.

==Ineligible witnesses==

Testimony of a deaf, mentally incompetent or young person (before [[Bar Mitzvah]]) is excluded.  Testimony from women is also generally excluded. Anyone who is caught guilty of a sin which demonstrates greed, i.e. who sins in order to acquire money, is also disqualified.

Tractate Sanhedrin lists other categories of witnesses who are disqualified.

The [[Talmud]], in the third chapter of [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]], delineates the rules governing who may provide written or oral testimony.  A valid witness in a Jewish [[Beit Din]] must be an adult (see [[Bar Mitzvah]]) free man, not a woman or a slave, and not be related to any of the other witnesses or judges.  The witness must be an honest person who can be trusted not to lie.

The [[Mishnah]] (Sanhedrin 24b) states: "The following people are disqualified: a gambler with dice, a lender who collects [[interest (finance)|interest]], a chaser of [[dove]]s, and a merchant who profits from produce of [[Shemittah]]."  The Talmud explains that each of these four activities falls within an expanded definition of theft because people who violate [[Torah]] laws or social norms in pursuit of money cannot be trusted to tell the truth. "Chasers of doves" are those training them for races (or to lure other people's birds away), as well as those who bet on them; it includes pigeons, and by extension the use and luring of any animals in such fashion, domesticated or otherwise.

Additionally, "one who eats in the street is comparable to a dog, and there are those who say that he is disqualified from serving as a witness." (Talmud, Kiddushin 40b)

===Reinstatement===
However, anyone who has engaged in these forbidden activities may be reinstated upon undertaking a complete reversal to demonstrate especially honest conduct by renouncing a permitted activity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Gamblers with dice...when are they reinstated?  When they destroy their dice and completely reverse themselves, so that they do not play even for free.
*Lenders who collect interest...when are they reinstated?  When they tear up their [[promissory note]]s and completely reverse themselves, so that they do not collect interest even from a non-Jewish lender.
*Chasers of doves...when are they reinstated?  When they destroy their tools for chasing and completely reverse themselves, so that they do not chase doves even in the desert [where there is nobody from whom to steal].
*Merchants who profit from produce of Shemittah...when are they reinstated?  When the next Shemittah year arrives [seven years later] and they withdraw.  
**[[Rabbi Nehemiah]] said: They required not only a reversal of words, but also a reversal of money.  How so?  A person proclaims, "I, [[Placeholder name|John Doe]], profited 200 [[Zuz (coin)|Zuz]] from selling fruits of Shemittah, and I am now giving this money to charity." (Sanhedrin 25b)

'''Tony Cliff''' (born '''Yigael Gluckstein''' ({{lang-he|יגאל גליקשטיין}}); 20 May 1917 – 9 April 2000) was a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] activist. Born to a Jewish family in what is now [[Israel]], he moved to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947 and by the end of the 1950s had assumed the pen name of Tony Cliff. A founding member of the Socialist Review Group, which eventually became the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]], in 1977 Cliff became effectively the leader.

== Biography ==

{{Trotskyism}}
Tony Cliff was born Yigael Gluckstein in [[Zikhron Ya'akov]] in the Ottoman Empire's [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]], now part of [[Israel]], during [[World War I]], one of four children born to Akiva and Esther Gluckstein, Jewish immigrants from [[Poland]] who had come to Palestine as part of the [[Second Aliyah]]. His father was an engineer and contractor. He had two brothers and a sister. His brother Chaim later became a notable journalist, theater critic, and translator. Through his sister Alexandra, he was the uncle of Israeli graphic designer [[David Tartakover]]. He grew up in British-ruled [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Notable Zionist activist and future Israeli Prime Minister [[Moshe Sharett]] was a family friend and frequent visitor to his family home, and he had two prominent uncles: the noted doctor [[Hillel Yaffe]] and agronomist and Zionist activist Chaim Margaliot Kalvarisky. In his youth, he came to identify with Communism, though he never joined the [[Communist Party of Palestine]], as he had not met any of its members before becoming a socialist activist. However, he did join the socialist-Zionist youth movement [[Hashomer Hatzair]], and soon became not only a Trotskyist in 1933, but also a confirmed opponent of [[Zionism]]. Along with other Hashomer Hatzair members, he joined the illegal Palestine [[Revolutionary Communist League (Palestine)|Revolutionary Communist League]], necessitating the use of several pseudonyms in three languages.

During [[World War II]], Gluckstein was imprisoned by the British authorities. After his release he moved to Britain in 1947, but was never able to become a citizen and remained a [[stateless person]] for the rest of his life. To the end of his life he spoke English with a distinct Israeli accent. He was for a while deported to the [[Republic of Ireland]] and was only permitted to take up British residency due to the status of [[Chanie Rosenberg]], his wife, as a British citizen. Living in London he again became active with the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (1944-1949)|Revolutionary Communist Party]], on to the leadership of which he had been co-opted. For most purposes Gluckstein was a supporter of the leadership of the RCP around [[Jock Haston]],&lt;ref&gt;The War and the International: A History of the British Trotskyist Movement, 1937–1949 (with Al Richardson), Socialist Platform, London 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and as such he was involved with the discussions concerning the nature of those states dominated by Russia and the Communist parties initiated by a faction within the RCP. This debate was linked to other discussions on the nationalised industries in Britain and the increasingly critical stance of Haston and the RCP as to the leadership of the [[Fourth International]] with regard to [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Tito's Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in particular.

On the break-up of the RCP his supporters joined [[Gerry Healy]]'s group [[The Club (Trotskyist)|The Club]] although, having been deported to Ireland, Gluckstein himself did not. In 1950 he helped launch the ''[[Socialist Review]]'' Group which was based around a journal of the same name. This was to be the main publication for which Gluckstein wrote during the 1950s, until it was superseded by ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]'' in 1960, eventually ceasing publication altogether in 1962.

By the time he gained permanent residency in Britain his supporters in The Club had been expelled due to differences on [[Birmingham Trades Council]] regarding socialist policy concerning the war in Korea, where Gluckstein's co-factionalists refused to take a position of support for either side in the war.

Owing to his lack of established residency rights in Britain and during his earlier exile in Ireland the name Roger or Roger Tennant was used as a pseudonym. The first edition of his short book on [[Rosa Luxemburg]] in 1959 was possibly the first use of the pen name 'Tony Cliff'. In the 1960s Cliff would revive many of his earlier pseudonyms in the pages of ''International Socialism'' in which journal reviews are to be found by Roger, Roger Tennant, Sakhry, Lee Rock and Tony Cliff, but none by Yigael or Yg'al Gluckstein.

His group was renamed the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] in 1962, and was to grow from fewer than 100 members in 1960 until it claimed in the region of 3,000 in 1977, at which point it was renamed the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP). Cliff remained a leading member until his death in 2000. He was central to the various reorientations carried out in the SWP from time to time to react to changes in the situation of the working class. In particular, after the high level of strike activity in the early seventies, he argued in the late seventies that the working class movement was entering a "downturn" and that the party's activity should be radically changed as a result. A fierce debate ensued, which Cliff's side eventually won. Trotskyist writer [[Samuel Farber]], a long-time supporter of the [[International Socialist Organization]] in the US, has argued that the internal party regime established by Cliff during this period is "reminiscent of the one established by [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] in the mid-twenties in the USSR" consequently leading to the various crises and splits in the group later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farber|first=Samuel|title=Tony Cliff as a Socialist Leader|url=http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/3989|publisher=Solidarity|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliff's biography is, as he himself remarked, inseparable from that of the groups of which he was a leading member.

Shortly before his death he underwent a major surgical operation on his heart.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bir10|Birchall 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==

Cliff was a revolutionary socialist in the Trotskyist tradition attempting to make Lenin's theory of the party effective in the present day. Much of his theoretical writing was aimed at immediate tasks of the Party at the time.

Since then the consensus in most Trotskyist groups has been that all the states dominated by Stalinist parties and characterised by state planning and state ownership of property are to be seen as '[[degenerated workers state|degenerated workers' states]]' (The Soviet Union) or '[[deformed workers state|deformed workers' states]]' (other Stalinist states, including much of Eastern Europe). In many ways Cliff was the main dissident from this idea although some of his opponents have sought to associate his state capitalist view with other ideas, for example the theory of '[[bureaucratic collectivism]]' associated with [[Shachtmanism|Shachtmanite]] [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]] in the United States. However Cliff himself was insistent that his ideas owed nothing to those of Max Shachtman, or earlier proponents of the theory such as Bruno Rizzi, and made this clear in his ''Bureaucratic Collectivism – A Critique.'' Nevertheless, in the 1950s his group distributed literature published by Shachtman's group and the theory of the '[[permanent arms economy]]' which was considered one of the pillars of what became the International Socialist Tendency originated with Shachtman's group though it is sometimes alleged that Cliff refused to acknowledge this publicly.&lt;ref&gt;This allegation seems to have originated from [[Jim Higgins (British politician)|Jim Higgins]] in his booklet ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/higgins/1997/locust/index.htm More Years for the Locusts]'', but it would seem to be contradicted by the fact that ''International Socialism'', Nos. 47 and 49 carried prominent ads for the book '''The Permanent War Economy''' by T.N. Vance, who is now acknowledged to be the originator of the theory. Both Higgins and Cliff are listed in [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj049 No. 49] as editors of that issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Cliff had little or no time for any activities not directly linked to the needs of building his party (with the exception of caring for his family). He did not drink or smoke, or socialise very much. Cliff's wife, [[Chanie Rosenberg]], was herself an active member successively of the SRG, IS and SWP, in which she remains active. As well as authoring many articles on social questions for the group's publications, she was an activist in the [[National Union of Teachers]] until her retirement. In addition, three of the couple's four children became members of the SWP, with one son, [[Donny Gluckstein]], co-authoring two books with his father.

Cliff is depicted as Jimmy Rock of the Rockers in [[Tariq Ali]]'s satire ''[[Redemption (1990 novel)|Redemption]]''.

The '''Unemployment Insurance Act 1924''' was passed when the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was in power in 1924. The Act arose from a dispute over the [[means testing]] of benefits. The Labour Cabinet disagreed on whether means testing should be abolished or whether such a move would prove too costly. The compromise was that the test for receiving benefits would be whether a person was "genuinely seeking work". The 1924 Act extended to "genuinely seeking work" test to all benefited claims.

The '''United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances''' of  1988 is one of three major drug control treaties currently in force. It provides additional legal mechanisms for enforcing the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The Convention entered into force on November 11, 1990. As of February 2018, there are 190 Parties to the Convention.&lt;ref name="unodc1"/&gt; These include 185 out of 193 [[United Nations]] member states (not [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Kiribati]], [[Palau]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Somalia]], [[South Sudan]], or [[Tuvalu]]) and the [[Holy See]], the [[European Union]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]].&lt;ref name = "ratifications"/&gt;

==Background==

The 1988 Convention was introduced following the political and sociological developments in the 1970s and 1980s. The growing demand for cannabis, cocaine, and heroin for recreational purposes, mostly in the developed world, triggered an increase of illicit production in geographical areas where cannabis, coca, and opium had been traditionally cultivated. With the rising size of the illicit drug trade, international drug trafficking became a multibillion-dollar business dominated by criminal groups, providing grounds for the creation of the 1988 Convention and the consequential escalation of the [[war on drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tni.org/en/publication/the-un-drug-control-conventions#5 A primer on the UN Drug Control Conventions. Transnational Institute, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[s:United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances#PREAMBLE|Preamble]] notes that previous enforcement efforts have not stopped drug use, warning of "steadily increasing inroads into various social groups made by illicit traffic in [[narcotic drugs]] and [[psychotropic substances]]." It cautions that the drug trade and related activities "undermine the legitimate economies and threaten the stability, security and sovereignty of States." The sense of urgency is underscored by the image of innocent boys and girls being exploited:
:''[C]hildren are used in many parts of the world as an illicit drug consumers market and for purposes of illicit production, distribution and trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, which entails a danger of incalculable gravity.''

==Drug manufacture and distribution==
[[File:Precursor chemicals2.gif|frame|right|A cache of precursor chemicals near a [[South America]]n [[cocaine]] processing lab.]]
Much of the treaty is devoted to fighting [[organized crime]] by mandating cooperation in tracing and seizing drug-related assets. [[s:United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances#Article 5: CONFISCATION|Article 5]] of the Convention requires its parties to confiscate proceeds from drug offenses. It also requires parties to empower its courts or other competent authorities to order that bank, financial, or commercial records be made available or seized. The Convention further states that a party may not decline to act on this provision on the ground of [[bank secrecy]].

[[s:United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances#Article 6: EXTRADITION|Article 6]] of the Convention provides a legal basis for [[extradition]] in drug-related cases among countries having no other extradition treaties. In addition, the Convention requires the parties to provide mutual legal assistance to one another upon request, for purposes of searches, seizures, service of judicial documents, and so on.

In addition, [[s:United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances#Article 12: SUBSTANCES FREQUENTLY USED IN THE ILLICIT MANUFACTURE OF NARCOTIC DRUGS OR PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES|Article 12]] of the Convention establishes two categories of controlled illicit drug precursor substances, Table I and Table II. The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] has power to decide whether to control a precursor substance, and which Table to place it in. The assessment of the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] is binding on the Commission, however, as to scientific matters. A two-thirds vote is required to add a substance to a Table.

Article 12 protects the interests of pharmaceutical and chemical companies by requiring the Board to take into account the "extent, importance and diversity of the licit use of the substance, and the possibility and ease of using alternate substances both for licit purposes and for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances."

Control of amphetamine-type stimulant precursors has become a major UN priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/res/1996/eres1996-29.htm |title=1996/29. Action to strengthen international cooperation to control precursors and their substitutes used in the illicit manufacture of controlled substances, in particular amphetamine-type stimulants, and to prevent their diversion |publisher=United Nations |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug possession==
[[File:Small time bust.gif|thumb|225px|right|The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] interprets the 1988 Convention as requiring Parties to criminalize simple drug possession.]]
[[s:United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances#Article 3: OFFENCES AND SANCTIONS|Article 3]] of the Convention may require nations to ban possession of drugs for personal use:
:''Subject to its constitutional principles and the basic concepts of its legal system, each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the possession, purchase or cultivation of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances for personal consumption contrary to the provisions of the 1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended or the 1971 Convention.''

Previous drug control treaties had targeted drug manufacturers and traffickers, rather than users. In their 2003 article, "The Mechanics and Dynamics of the UN System for International Drug Control," David Bewley-Taylor and [[Cindy Fazey]] explain that "[t]he 1988 Convention was an attempt to reach a political balance between consumer and producer countries. Consequently, it was not only the duty of producing countries (e.g. the developing countries of Asia and South America) to suppress illicit supply, but also the duty of consumer countries (e.g. the industrialized countries of Europe and North America) to suppress the demand for drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forward-thinking-on-drugs.org/review1.html |title=The Mechanics and Dynamics of the UN System for International Drug Control |publisher=Forward Thinking on Drugs |date= |accessdate=January 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152127/http://www.forward-thinking-on-drugs.org/review1.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is unclear whether this provision actually does mandate prohibition of drug possession for personal use, due to the caveat that such possession need only be prohibited if it is "contrary to the provisions of the 1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended or the 1971 Convention." The American [[National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse]] found that the provisions of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs against possession apply only to possession related to illicit trafficking, while the Canadian [[Le Dain Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs]] found otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfdp.ca/canrep/appendix_a.htm |title=Appendix A – Cannabis Report |publisher=Canadian Foundation for Drug Policy |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional issues==
Several of the Convention's provisions are prefaced with the words, "Subject to its constitutional principles and the basic concepts of its legal system, each Party shall ..." According to Fazey, "This has been used by the USA not to implement part of article 3 of the 1988 Convention, which prevents inciting others to use narcotic or psychotropic drugs, on the basis that this would be in contravention of their constitutional amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech."&lt;ref name="fuoriluogo2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fuoriluogo.it/arretrati/2003/apr_17_en.htm |title=The UN Drug Policies and the Prospect for Change |first=Cindy |last=Fazey |authorlink=Cindy Fazey |newspaper=Fuoriluogo |publisher=[[il manifesto]] |date=April 2003 |accessdate=December 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423160616/http://www.fuoriluogo.it/arretrati/2003/apr_17_en.htm |archivedate=April 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, if a national prohibition on drug possession violated a nation's constitution, those provisions would not be binding on that country.

==Proposed repeal==
In 2003, a [[European Parliament]] committee recommended repealing the 1988 Convention, finding that:
:''[D]espite massive deployment of police and other resources to implement the UN Conventions, production and consumption of, and trafficking in, prohibited substances have increased exponentially over the past 30 years, representing what can only be described as a failure, which the police and judicial authorities also recognise as such ... [T]he policy of prohibiting drugs, based on the UN Conventions of 1961, 1971 and 1988, is the true cause of the increasing damage that the production of, trafficking in, and sale and use of illegal substances are inflicting on whole sectors of society, on the economy and on public institutions, eroding the health, freedom and life of individuals.''&lt;ref name="B5-0541/2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+B5-2002-0541+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=PROPOSAL FOR A RECOMMENDATION on the reform of the Conventions on drugs – B5-0541/2002 |publisher=European Parliament |date=December 23, 2002 |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road to repeal would be difficult. Individual nations could withdraw from the treaty under the provisions of [[s:United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances#Article 30: DENUNCIATION|Article 30]]. However, as former UN drug official Cindy Fazey notes, the Convention has no termination clause, and therefore would remain in effect even if only one signatory remained.&lt;ref name="fuoriluogo2003"/&gt; The [[Transnational Radical Party]] report noted that denunciation is the only route to changing the control regime established by the treaty:
:''As regards the 1988 Convention, written with the main objective of strengthening all aspects of prohibition (also at the level of consumption, establishing the reversal of the burden of proof for persons suspected of carrying forbidden substances), it was deemed not amendable, therefore, the only possible way to go about it would be its denunciation by a substantial number of contracting Parties.''&lt;ref name="NRPTT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://servizi.radicalparty.org/documents/index.php?func=detail&amp;par=213 |title=Concept Paper For Campaign by the Transnational Radical Party and the International Antiprohibitionist League to Reform the UN Conventions on Drugs |author1=Cappato, Marco |author2=Perduca, Marco |publisher=[[Transnational Radical Party]] |date=June 8, 1998 |accessdate=December 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113145210/http://servizi.radicalparty.org/documents/index.php?func=detail&amp;par=213 |archivedate=January 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'''''&lt;ref&gt;A [[German compound|compound]] of ''die [[wikt:Vergangenheit#Geman|Vergangenheit]]'' "the past" and ''[[wikt:Bewältigung#German|Bewältigung]]'' "the overcoming of problems", often used in psychological contexts for coming to terms with repressed and incriminating mental injuries and guilt.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-de|fɛɐ̯ˈɡaŋənhaɪtsbəˌvɛltɪɡʊŋ|lang}}, "struggle to overcome the [negatives of the] past" or “working through the past”)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/german-english/vergangenheitsbew%C3%A4ltigung Collins German-English Dictionary: Vergangenheitsbewältigung]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[German language|German]] term describing processes that since the later 20th century have become key in the study of post-1945 [[German literature]], society, and [[German culture|culture]].

The German [[Duden]] lexicon defines ''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' as "public debate within a country on a problematic period of its recent history—in Germany on National Socialism, in particular"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung |title=Duden &amp;#124; Vergangenheitsbewältigung &amp;#124; Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition |language=de |publisher=Duden.de |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Auseinandersetzung einer Nation mit einem problematischen Abschnitt ihrer jüngeren Geschichte, in Deutschland besonders mit dem Nationalsozialismus"&lt;/ref&gt;—where "problematic" refers to traumatic events that raise sensitive questions of collective culpability. In Germany, and originally, the term refers to embarrassment about and often remorse for Germans' complicity in the [[war crimes of the Wehrmacht]], [[Holocaust]], and related events of the early and mid-20th century, including [[World War II]]. In this sense, the word can refer to the psychic process of [[denazification]]. With the absorption into the current [[Federal Republic of Germany]] of [[East Germany]] since 1989 and the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], ''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' can also refer to coming to terms with the excesses and human rights abuses associated with that former Communist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berdahl|first1=Daphne|title=Where the World Ended: Reunification and Identity in the German Borderland|date=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' describes the attempt to analyze, digest and learn to live with the past, in particular the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. The focus on learning is much in the spirit of philosopher [[George Santayana]]'s oft-quoted observation that "those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it". It is a technical term also used in English that was coined after 1945 in West Germany, relating specifically to the atrocities committed during the [[Third Reich]], when [[Adolf Hitler]] was in power in [[Germany]], and to both historical and contemporary concerns about the extensive compromise and [[wikt:co-opt|co-optation]] of many German cultural, religious, and political institutions by [[Nazism]]. The term therefore deals at once with the concrete responsibility of the German state ([[West Germany]] assumed the legal obligations of the Reich) and of individual Germans for what took place "under Hitler", and with questions about the roots of legitimacy in a society whose development of [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] collapsed in the face of [[Nazism#Nazi theory|Nazi ideology]].

More recently, the term ''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' has also been used in the former [[East Germany]] to refer to the process of working through the brutalities of [[Communism|Communist]] institutions.

===After denazification===
Historically, ''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' often is seen as the logical "next step" after a [[denazification]] driven at first under Allied Occupation and then by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] government of [[Konrad Adenauer]]. It dates from the late 1950s and early 1960s, roughly the period in which the work of the ''Wiederaufbau'' (reconstruction) became less absorbing and urgent. Having replaced the institutions and power structures of Nazism, the aim of liberal Germans was to deal with the guilt of recent history. ''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' is characterised in part by learning from the past. This includes honestly admitting that such a past did indeed exist, attempting to remedy as far as possible the wrongs committed, and attempting to move on from that past.

===Role of churches and schools===
The German churches, of which only a minority{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} played a significant role in the [[German Resistance|resistance to Nazism]], have led the way in this process. They have developed a specifically German post-war [[theology]] of [[repentance]]. At the regular mass church rallies, the [[Lutheran church|Lutheran]] [[Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag|Kirchentag]] and the [[Catholic church|Catholic]] ''Katholikentag'', for example, have developed this theme as a [[leitmotiv]] of Christian youth.

''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' has been expressed by the society through its [[school]]s, where in most [[States of Germany|German states]] the centrally-written [[wikt:curriculum|curriculum]] provides each child with repeated lessons on different aspects of Nazism in German [[history]], [[politics]] and [[religion]] classes from the [[fifth grade]] onwards, and related to their maturity. Associated school trips may have destinations of [[concentration camp]]s. [[Jew]]ish Holocaust survivors are often invited to schools as guest speakers, though the passage of time limits these opportunities as their generation has aged.

===In philosophy===
In philosophy, [[Theodor Adorno]]'s writings include the lecture "Was bedeutet: Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit?" ("What is meant by 'working through the past'?"), a subject related to his thinking of "after Auschwitz" in his later work. He delivered the lecture on November 9, 1959, at a conference on education held in Wiesbaden.&lt;ref name="Boos-Adorno-media-suppl"&gt;Boos, Sonja (2014). [http://signale.cornell.edu/multimedia/30/item/49 Introduction] to Theodor W. Adorno's "Was bedeutet: Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit" (The Meaning of Working through the Past). A media supplement to: Boos, ''Speaking the Unspeakable in Postwar Germany: Toward a Public Discourse on the Holocaust''. Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University Press]]. The website (under the banner of the "Signale" book series on modern German literature and culture) includes the audio recording of Adorno's lecture, along with links to the German text and an English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the context of a new wave of anti-Semitic attacks against synagogues and Jewish community institutions occurring in West Germany at that time, Adorno rejected the contemporary [[catch phrase]] "working through the past" as misleading. He argued that it masked a denial, rather than signifying the kind of critical self-reflection that Freudian theory called for in order to "come to terms" with the past.&lt;ref name="Boos-Adorno-media-suppl"/&gt;

Adorno's lecture is often seen as consisting in part of a variably implicit and explicit critique of the work of [[Martin Heidegger]], whose formal ties to the Nazi Party are well known. Heidegger, distinct from his role in the Party during the Third Reich, attempted to provide a historical conception of [[Germania]] as a philosophical notion of German origin and destiny (later he would speak of "the West"). [[Alexander Garcia Düttman]]'s "Das Gedächtnis des Denkens. Versuch über Heidegger und Adorno" (''The Memory of Thought: An Essay on Heidegger and Adorno'', translated by Nicholas Walker) attempts to treat the philosophical value of these seemingly opposed and certainly incompatible terms "Auschwitz" and "Germania" in the philosophy of both men.

===The cultural sphere===
In the cultural sphere, the term ''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' is associated with a movement in [[German literature]], characterised by such authors as [[Günter Grass]] and [[Siegfried Lenz]]. Lenz's novel ''[[The German lesson|Deutschstunde]]'' and Grass's ''[[Danzig Trilogy|Danziger Trilogie]]'' both deal with childhoods under Nazism.

The erection of public [[monument]]s to Holocaust victims has been a tangible commemoration of Germany's ''Vergangenheitsbewältigung''. [[Concentration camp]]s, such as [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Buchenwald]], [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] and [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]], are open to visitors as memorials and [[museum]]s. Most towns have plaques on walls marking the spots where particular atrocities took place.

When the seat of government was moved from [[Bonn]] to [[Berlin]] in 1999, an extensive [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe|"Holocaust memorial"]], designed by architect [[Peter Eisenman]], was planned as part of the extensive development of new official buildings in the district of [[Berlin-Mitte]]; it was opened on 10 May 2005.  The informal name of this memorial, the ''Holocaust-Mahnmal,'' is significant. It does not translate easily: "Holocaust Cenotaph" would be one sense, but the noun ''Mahnmal,'' which is distinct from the term ''Denkmal'' (typically used to translate "memorial") carries the sense of "admonition", "urging", "appeal", or "warning", rather than "remembrance" as such. The work is formally known as ''Das Denkmal für die ermordeten Juden Europas'' (English translation, "The Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe"). Some controversy attaches to it precisely because of this formal name and its exclusive emphasis on Jewish victims. As Eisenman acknowledged at the opening ceremony, "It is clear that we won't have solved all the problems — architecture is not a panacea for evil — nor will we have satisfied all those present today, but this cannot have been our intention."

==Actions of other European countries==

In [[Austria]], ongoing arguments about the nature and significance of the [[Anschluss]], and unresolved disputes about legal expressions of obligation and liability, have led to very different concerns, and to a far less institutionalized response by the government. Since the late 20th century, observers and analysts have expressed concerns about the ascent of "[[Jörg Haider|Haiderism]]".{{efn|Haider's growing popularity was protested by many Austrians as proto- or [[neo-fascism]] after electoral successes in the [[Austria legislative election, 1999|Austrian legislative election of 1999]] and his entry into coalition government with the [[ÖVP|Austrian People's Party]].}}

[[Poland]] has maintained a museum, [[archive]], and research centre at [[Oświęcim]], better known by its German name of [[Auschwitz]], since a July 2, 1947 act of the [[Polish Parliament]]. In the same year, [[Czechoslovakia]] established what was known as the "National Suffering Memorial" and later as the Terezín memorial in [[Terezín]], [[Czech Republic]]. This site during the Holocaust was known as the concentration camp of [[Theresienstadt]]. In the context of varying degrees of Communist orthodoxy in both countries during the period of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] domination of [[Eastern Europe]] through much of the late 20th century, historical research into the Holocaust was politicised to varying degrees. [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrines of [[class struggle]] were often overlaid onto generally received histories, which tended to exclude both acts of collaboration and indications of abiding [[antisemitism]] in these nations.

The advance of the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', ''[[Operation Reinhard|Aktion Reinhardt]]'', and other significant events in the Holocaust did not happen in the Third Reich proper (or what is now the territory of the Federal Republic). The history of the memorials and archives which have been erected at these sites in eastern Europe is associated with the Communist regimes that ruled these areas for more than four decades after [[World War II]]. The Nazis promoted an idea of an expansive German nation extending into territories where ethnic Germans had previously settled. They invaded and controlled much of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], unleashing violence against various [[Slavic peoples|Slav]]ic groups, as well as Jews, [[Communist]]s, [[homosexuals]], [[gypsies]], [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and so-called partisans. There were millions of victims in addition to Jews. After the war, the eastern European nations expelled German settlers as well as long settled ethnic Germans (the ''[[Volksdeutsch]]e'') as a reaction to the Reich's attempt to claim the eastern lands on behalf of ethnic Germans.

[[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]] described their process as ''[[lustration]]''{{Citation needed|reason=Lustration was a process of protecting society from the former collaborators with the Communist institutions, nothing to do with Nazism|date=December 2017}}.

==Analogous processes elsewhere in the world==
{{main article|Truth and reconciliation commission}}
In some of its aspects, ''Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' can be compared to the attempts of other democratic countries to raise consciousness and come to terms with earlier periods of governmental and social abuses, such as the [[South Africa]]n process of ''[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|truth and reconciliation]]'' following the period of [[apartheid]] and suppression of African groups seeking political participation and freedom from white oppression.

Some comparisons have been made with the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] process of ''[[glasnost]],'' though this was less focused on the past than achieving a level of open criticism necessary for progressive reform to take place. (It generally assumed that the Communist Party monopoly on power would be maintained.) Since the late 20th century and the fall of the Soviet Union, the continuing efforts in nations of eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union to reinterpret the communist past and its abuses is sometimes referred to as a post-socialist ''Vergangenheitsbewältigung.''

The World War II history of Japan's involvement in [[Japanese war crimes]] is something the future Emperor, Crown Prince [[Naruhito]], [[Japanese war crimes#Japanese Imperial Family's concerns|has had his own concerns about]] with how accurately such events are remembered in the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-war-ii-should-not-be-forgotten-japans-prince-naruhito-n311561 |title=World War II Should Not Be Forgotten, Japan's Prince Naruhito Says |last=Itasaka |first=Kiko |date=February 24, 2015 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=NBC News |access-date=April 9, 2015 |quote=Japan’s Crown Prince has spoken about the need to “correctly” remember World War II in an extremely rare public statement that comes amid a chorus of calls to play down the country’s war crimes...“It is important to look back on the past humbly and correctly,” Crown Prince Naruhito said during a press conference marking his 55th birthday. }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the occasion of his own 55th birthday,  and not known to be related to the more recently-revealed future event of his expected ascendancy to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], itself likely to occur [[Japanese imperial transition, 2019|on April 30, 2019]].

'''''WPIX, Inc. v. ivi, Inc.''''', was a [[copyright infringement]] case heard before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. The [[appeals court]] affirmed the decision of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|district court]] to grant an [[injunction]] for the [[plaintiff]]s, barring [[ivi, Inc.]] from broadcasting television programming over the [[Internet]]. This decision set a precedent that broadcast television material can be protected by copyright and cannot be re-transmitted on the Internet without permission.

==Background==
[[ivi, Inc.]] is a [[Seattle]]-based company that began retransmitting [[broadcast television]] content via the Internet to paid subscribers on September 13, 2010.{{R|ivi-pr-announcement}} Designed to be an improvement over more expensive traditional cable services, viewers could watch local broadcast TV from New York City and Seattle, and later Chicago and Los Angeles, from anywhere in the world for a monthly subscription of $4.99 without any special equipment.  A recording service could be added for $0.99 per month.
Shortly after beginning operations, ivi and CEO Todd Weaver received [[cease-and-desist]] notices from a group of affected [[copyright holder]]s and [[television station]]s, who calculated that ivi's services severely decreased the value of their programming and decrease advertisement revenue.

==Legal proceedings==
On September 20, 2010, ivi filed a [[declaratory judgment]] action in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington|District Court for the Western District of Washington]], seeking a declaration of non-infringement on the grounds that §111 of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] authorizes retransmission of broadcast television content for cable companies.{{R|declaratory-judgment-complaint}} The same day, ivi issued a press release calling their legal action "a preemptive move to discourage needless litigation from big media," and expressing their desire to "work with content owners [to help] them to realize new revenue streams and reach more viewers from around the globe."{{R|ivi-pr-declaratory-judgment}}

On September 28, a group of copyright holders and broadcasters, including [[Disney Consumer Products|Disney]], [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Television Stations|Fox]], [[The CW]], [[Telemundo]], and others, filed a copyright infringement action against ivi in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|District Court for the Southern District of New York]].{{R|district-court-complaint-media1}}  ivi's earlier declaratory action was subsequently dismissed by the Washington district court on the grounds that it was improperly anticipatory.{{R|declaratory-judgment-decision}}

On January 31, 2011, [[Public Knowledge]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[Media Access Project]], and the [[Open Technology Institute]] filed an [[amicus brief|''amici'' brief]] with the court in support of ivi.{{R|amici-brief-pk}}{{R|ivi-pr-amici-brief}} Noting that "''amicus briefs'' are unusual at the district court level," the brief argued that ivi should be considered a cable system under §111, and that granting a preliminary injunction against ivi would not serve the [[public interest]].{{R|amici-brief-pk}}

On February 20, 2011, the New York district court granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction against ivi, finding that ivi was not a "cable system" and hence not entitled to a compulsory license under §111 of the Copyright Act.{{R|district-court-decision}} ivi appealed the district's court decision{{R|appeals-court-complaint-media1}}.

==Opinion of the Appeals Court==
ivi admitted that they had broadcast the plaintiff's copyrighted content, but offered an [[affirmative defense]] by arguing that §111 of the Copyright Act grants cable systems a compulsory license to retransmit broadcast television content. Hence, the principal issue to be decided by the court was whether ivi qualified as a "cable system" according to the Copyright Act.{{R|appeals-court-decision}}

In deciding whether ivi qualified as a cable system under the Copyright Act, the court applied the two-step test from ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]''. ''Chevron'' dictates that courts should first consider the text of the relevant legislation and the intent of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. If the relevant legislation does not directly address the issue at hand, ''Chevron'' then instructs that courts should defer to the interpretation of the government agency that administers the statute, provided that the agency's interpretation is deemed to be "reasonable."

===Chevron Step One===
§111 of the Copyright Act defines a "cable system" as:
{{quote|a facility, located in any State, territory, trust territory, or possession of the United States, that in whole or in part receives signals transmitted or programs broadcast by one or more television broadcast stations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, and makes secondary transmissions of such signals or programs by wires, cables, microwave, or other communications channels to subscribing members of the public who pay for such service.}}
The court found that "it is simply not clear" whether the text of the Copyright Act would include ivi as a cable system.{{R|appeals-court-decision}}

Next, the court considered whether it was the [[legislative intent]] of Congress to include Internet-based retransmission as a type of cable system. The court observed that Congress' original intent in enacting §111 was to encourage cable systems to provide better [[television reception]] for remote communities that were poorly served by over-the-air broadcast television. Drawing upon ''[[Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission]]'', the court found that "Congress intended to support localized&amp;mdash;rather than nationwide&amp;mdash;systems that use cable or optical fibers to transmit signals."{{R|appeals-court-decision}} Because Internet-based retransmission is not intended to deliver content to remote regions and is not a localized transmission service, the court found that "Congress did not intend for &amp;sect;111's compulsory license to extent to Internet retransmissions."{{R|appeals-court-decision}}

The court noted that it intentionally interpreted §111 of the Copyright Act "as narrowly as possible" according to ''[[New York Times Co. v. Tasini]]'', in order to minimize government interference on the market; exceptions to the exclusive [[property rights]] of copyright holders should be granted sparingly.{{R|appeals-court-decision}}

===Chevron Step Two===
Although the court found that step one of the Chevron test was sufficient to conclude that ivi is not entitled to a compulsory license, the court also provided a step two analysis to see if the [[United States Copyright Office]] has interpreted the Copyright Act in a way that would treat ivi as a cable system. The court found that this was not the case; the Copyright Office has repeatedly stated their view that Internet-based transmission not eligible for a compulsory license because it is "so vastly different from other retransmission industries now eligible for compulsory licensing."{{R|copyright-office-retransmission-review}}  The court found the Copyright Office's position to be a reasonable interpretation of the statute.

===Irreparable Injury===
The appeals court also ruled that if the injunction against ivi were not upheld, then the plaintiff broadcast companies would lose significant amounts of revenue.  For instance, ivi's live broadcasting feature would allow viewers to watch programs earlier than would otherwise be available in their timezone.  This is different from other services such as [[Hulu]], which delays Internet re-transmission of broadcast television.  Additionally, advertisers pay large sums to place commercials for specific demographics for broadcast television; ivi's services make this targeting far less effective.{{R|appeals-court-decision}}

===Public Interest===
The appeals court reasoned that protection of copyright of broadcast television is in the public interest, by giving incentive to parties willing to create new works.  The court opinion also states that ivi's services provide convenience and do not necessarily improve access to broadcast television.{{R|appeals-court-decision}}

Therefore, on August 27, 2012, the appeals court affirmed the district court's opinion, ruling that ivi's retransmitting of broadcast television without obtaining licenses constituted copyright infringement.{{R|appeals-court-decision}}

==Service termination==
ivi was forced to suspend their operations when the district court granted a preliminary injunction, and has not resumed operations since then.{{R|appeals-court-complaint-media1}}  After the appeals court decision supporting the injunction, an ivi spokesperson commented that "This is not the final chapter to this story", leading some to speculate that the company continued to work on litigation after the appeals ruling.{{R|appeals-court-decision-media1}} The decision has been called a "major victory for broadcasters."{{R|appeals-court-decision-blog1}}

In light of this ruling, some have become frustrated that courts' and the FCC's interpretation of what constitutes a cable company has not kept up with modern technology, and that a clear Internet TV policy has not been established.  However, as shown in the court case ''[[Aereo#Legal controversy|ABC v. Aereo]]'', which provides VCR-like services rather than re-transmitting services as ivi attempted, it is possible to legally make TV available on the Internet for a profit.{{R|reaction article}}
