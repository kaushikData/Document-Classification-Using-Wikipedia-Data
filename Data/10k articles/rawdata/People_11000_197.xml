'''''100 Greatest African Americans''''' is a [[biographical dictionary]] of one hundred [[greatness|historically great]] [[African American|Black American]]s (in alphabetical order; that is, they are not ranked), as assessed by [[Temple University]] professor [[Molefi Kete Asante]] in 2002.

==Criteria==
Asante used five factors in establishing the list:

*"significance in the general progress of African-Americans toward full equality in the American social and political system"
*"self-sacrifice and a willingness to take great risks for the collective good"
*"unusual will and determination in the face of great danger and against the most stubborn odds"
*"a consistent posture toward raising the social, cultural and economic status of African Americans"
*"personal achievement that reveals the best qualities of the African American people"

It was positively reviewed in [[Reference and User Services Quarterly]] in 2003, while noting the subjectivity in judging greatness, particularly for contemporary individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=M.

'''Amos Hind''' (1 February 1849 &amp;ndash; 27 April 1931) was an English [[cricket]]er. who played first-class cricket for [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] between 1876 and 1877.

Hind was born at [[Calverton, Nottinghamshire]], the son of John Hind, a framework knitter and his wife Hannah.

Hind debuted for [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1876|Derbyshire in the 1876 season]], against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]], batting in two very steady innings, in the first of which he scored half of Derbyshire's run total. He made his highest score of 77 in his third match for the club, an innings victory over [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). Hind continued to play steadily in the upper-middle order for most of the rest of the 1876 season. At the start of the  [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1876|1877 season]], Hind hit a rough patch in his batting form, and was at times replaced in the batting order by [[Charles Regan]]. However he achieved his best bowling performance with 4-9 against MCC and managed an innings of 43 against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in his penultimate first-class fixture.

Hind was a right-handed batsman and played 30 innings in 16 first-class matches with a top score of 77 and an average of 13.06. He was also a right-arm round-arm medium pace bowler who took 24 wickets at an average of 17.45 and a best performance of 4-9.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/30/30262/30262.html Amos Hind at Cricket Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Hind took eight wickets in total for [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in a match against Gentlemen of Canada, a team which included former [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] player [[Walter Wright (cricketer)|Walter Wright]]. He was a framework knitter and in 1881 was unmarried and living with his parents at Calverton.&lt;ref&gt;British Census 1881&lt;/ref&gt;

Hind died in Calverton at the age of 82.

Hind's younger brother, [[Samuel Hind]], played first-class cricket between 1877 and 1878 for [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14068">The '''Architectural Technologist''', also known as a '''Building Technologist''', provides technical [[building design]] services  and solutions and is trained in [[architectural technology]], building technical design and [[construction]]. Architectural Technologists apply the science of [[architecture]] and typically concentrate on the technology of building, design technology and construction. They can or may negotiate the [[construction project]], and manage the process from conception through to completion, typically focusing on the technical aspects of a building project. The training of an architectural technologist concentrates on the ever-increasingly complex technical aspects in a building project, but matters of aesthetics, space, light and circulation are also involved within the technical design, leading the professional to assume decisions which are also non-technical.&lt;ref&gt; Breakfast with Arup: Tuesday 11 December 2012, Paul Nuttall, Director, Building Engineering London, Arup In this talk, Paul Nuttall shares his insights on designing buildings in the 21st Century. The presentation explains how the work of the architect, engineer and technologist are related / similar with a different optic and a different approach / philosophy of the project.  The video is widely available on youtube and other websites. &lt;/ref&gt;
    
Most architectural technologists are employed in architectural and engineering firms, or with municipal authorities; but many provide independent professional services directly to clients,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workingincanada.gc.ca/report-eng.do?noc=2251&amp;action=search_occupation_confirm Architectural Technologists and Technicians], Working in Canada, Government information website&lt;/ref&gt; although restricted by law in some countries. Others work in product development or sales with manufacturers.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Hong-Kong]] (Chartered Architectural Technologist), [[Canada]] (Architectural Technologist or Applied Science Technologist), [[Argentina]] (M.M.O Maestro Mayor de Obras / Chartered Architecture &amp; Building Science Technologist) and other nations, they have many abilities which are extremely useful in a technological sense to work alongside architects, engineers and other professionals - the training of a technologist  provides skills in building and architectural technology. It is an important role in the current building climate. Architectural technologists may be directors or shareholders of an architectural firm (where permitted by the jurisdiction and legal structure). To become an architectural technologist, a four-year degree (or equivalent) in Architectural Technology is required, which can be followed by a Master's Degree, with structured professional and occupational experience.

==By country==

===Canada===
Most [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] in Canada have an association representing architectural technologists and technicians. On behalf of the public, the [[provincial government]]s have granted the provincial architect's associations with the privilege to regulate the profession.

In the province of [[Ontario]], there were protracted efforts by the Association of Architectural Technologists of Ontario (AATO) to persuade the provincial government and the Ontario Association of Architects (OAA) that the public may be served by having technicians and technologists also design small buildings. In 2003, OAA's efforts to work with AATO failed and, instead, OAA established a relationship with the Ontario Associated of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists (OACETT). This joint effort resulted in the creation of a new association called the Ontario Association for Applied Architectural Sciences (OAAAS). Through OAAAS, a qualified technologist can be licensed by the OAA as a Licensed Technologist OAA, with authority to design small buildings. In 2011, OACETT withdrew and OAA embraced OAAAS as its Technology Program.   
&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the OAA [http://www.oaa.on.ca/client/oaa/OAAHome.nsf/object/OAAAS+News/$file/Why+OAAAS.pdf website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the OAA [http://www.oaa.on.ca/client/oaa/OAAHome.nsf/object/OAAAS+News/$file/Five+Steps+to+becoming+an+OAAAS+Member++Licensed+Technologist+OAA.pdf website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the OAAAS link: {{cite web|url=https://www.oaa.on.ca/the%20oaa/allied%20organizations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315013855/http://www.oaa.on.ca/the%20oaa/allied%20organizations |archivedate=2015-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland|RIAI]] declares being the leading professional body for Architectural Technologists in Ireland. The RIAI recognises the professional Architectural Technologist as a technical designer, skilled in the application and integration of construction technologies in the building design process. RIAI Architectural Technologists are recognised as professional partners to Architects in the delivery of exemplary buildings in the Republic of Ireland and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riai.ie/uploads/files/RIAI_Standard_Knowledge_Skill_Competence_Architectural_Technologist_2010.pdf RIAI Standard of Knowledge, Skill and Competence for Practice as an Architectural Technologist (2010)], as published on RIAI website&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland has always prevented its technician members to provide a full architectural service. Many qualified architectural technologists believe that a conflict of interest exists, that the RIAI represents architects and cannot adequately defend the interests of architectural technologists: "The RIAI acts as the Registration Body and Competent Authority for "Architects" in Ireland and only provides support services for Irish AT'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Irish-register-Architectural-Technologists-3788787.S.116501217 "An Irish Register for Architectural Technologists" Linkedin conversation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another representative body is the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists [[Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists|(CIAT)]]. The technical membership of the RIAI (RIAI tech) is equivalent to the technician membership of CIAT (TCIAT). Chartered members of CIAT (MCIAT) are qualified and recognised to lead a project from inception through to completion. The RIAI and the CIAT were represented within the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB) which advised the Minister for the Environment on matters relating to the Building Regulations. BRAB is no longer active.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to BRAB (Building Regulations Advisory Body) as per the [http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/BuildingStandards/BRAB/ Irish Minister for the Environment website]&lt;/ref&gt;  CIAT is now challenging the Building Control Regulations 2014, which are depriving its members from providing full architectural services in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.si.2014.0009.pdf Building Control Regulations 2014] as published by the Irish Government&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish Government appears to have no valid reason to prevent CIAT members from practising in the Republic of Ireland. The restrictions imposed on members of the CIAT are viewed as anti-competitive and in breach of European Law for free movement of services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2014-000236+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=en Parliamentary question from MEP Mairead McGuinness as published on the European Commission website: "On 1 March 2014 national legislation, the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013, will come into force in Ireland. The new legislation precludes chartered architectural technologists(1) from providing their current professional services within the building environment. In anticipation of the implementation of the regulations, chartered architectural technologists are reporting a number of difficulties, such as restrictions reducing the number of members of the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) who can bid for projects due to commence after March 2014. They say that this results in a loss of potential clients as well as economic loss. Does the Commission interpret the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013 as a breach of EC law, specifically legislation relating to competition and the free market? Does the Commission feel that the new legislation prevents chartered architectural technologists from earning a living in their field of training and expertise(2)?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The CIAT is awaiting for an opinion from the European Commission on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140321022820/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2014-000236&amp;language=EN Answer to parliamentary question] given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission as published on the European Commission website: "The Commission is aware of the introduction of a register for architects and building surveyors by the Building Control Act of 2007. On 1 March 2014 this regulation will be amended to circumscribe the profile of professionals who can design, inspect and certify for compliance all buildings greater than 40 square meters. Such regulatory protection, for a profession with not only significant safety but also environmental and urban impacts, is common across many Members States and as such Ireland is not a minority in seeking to reassure that standards are made, met and maintained.
The Commission has received a number of complaints raising concerns that the actions of the Irish government and the impact of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulation 2013 pose a breach of EC law in areas on the recognition of professional qualifications, freedom of movement and, with specific regard to its impact on Architectural Technologists.
Commission services are currently examining the issues raised to determine any possible contraventions of EC law and if any actions may be necessary in such cases."&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]] the profession is by the South African Institute of Architectural Technologists SAIAT.&lt;ref&gt;Website of the South African Institute of Architectural Technologists [http://www.saiat.org.za/ SAIAT]&lt;/ref&gt; Senior architectural technologists (10 years or more in practice) enjoy the same statute than architects. The [[South African Institute of Architects]] (SAIA) explains that: "Architecture can be practiced in one of four categories of registered person, namely professional architect, professional senior architectural technologist, professional technologist or professional draughtsperson.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, chartered architectural technologists enjoy the same status as architects. They deliver similar services with a different orientation. The Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists [[Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists|CIAT]] regulates the profession. CIAT defines chartered architectural technologists as follow: Chartered Architectural Technologists provide architectural design services and solutions. They are specialists in the science of architecture, building design and construction and form the link between concept and construction. They negotiate the construction project and manage the process from conception through to completion. Chartered Architectural Technologists, MCIAT, may practise on their own account or with fellow Chartered Architectural Technologists, architects, engineers, surveyors and other professionals within the construction industry. As professionals adhering to a Code of Conduct, they are required to obtain and maintain mandatory Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) if providing services directly to clients.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Lancashire County Council website: "[http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/consumer-advice/consumer-advice-information/details.aspx?doc_id=292603&amp;cat_id=12 Consumer Advice]"&lt;/ref&gt; They specify products with reference to the ''[[RIBA Product Selector]]'', ''Architects Standard Catalogue'', ''Barbour Index''&lt;ref name="Yeomans2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David T Yeomans|author2=Stephen Emmitt|title=Specifying Buildings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ota1ylQwWjwC&amp;pg=PT207|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=23 April 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-36538-6|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trade literature.

'''Bolivians''' ({{lang-es|Bolivianos}}) are the people that inhabit [[Bolivia]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] lived in what is now called Bolivia for several millennia before the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century. [[Spaniards]] mixed with enslaved [[Africans]] in steady numbers, mixing widely with each other and with indigenous peoples.

The Bolivian population, estimated at 10.9 million is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. The main language spoken is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], although the [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua language]]s are also common and all three, as well as 34 other [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s, are official. The many cultures in Bolivia have contributed greatly to a wide diversity in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.

The ethnic composition of Bolivia includes a great diversity of cultures. Most of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] have assimilated a [[mestizo]] culture, diversifying and expanding their indigenous heritage. Consequently, there is in Bolivia a mix of cultures, which joins together [[Hispanic]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] cultures.

The ethnic distribution of Bolivia is estimated to be 30% [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-speaking and 25% [[Aymara language|Aymara]]-speaking. The largest of the approximately three dozen native groups are the [[Quechuas]] (2.5&amp;nbsp;million), [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] (2&amp;nbsp;million), then Chiquitano (180,000), and [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] (125,000). So the full [[Amerindian]] population is at 55%; the remaining 30% are [[mestizo]] (mixed Amerindian and white), and around 15% are white.&lt;ref name="cia-factbook"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bl.html Bolivian people]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous===
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]], also called ''"originarios"'' ("native" or "original") and, less frequently, ''Amerindians''. This ethnic group is composed by the descendents of the [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Hispanic cultures]]. They can be [[Andes|Andean]], as the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] and [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] (which formed the ancient [[Inca Empire]]), which concentrate in the western departments of [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz]], [[Potosí Department|Potosí]], [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]] and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]. There also is an important oriental ethnic population, composed by the [[Chiquitano]], [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] and [[Moxo people|Moxos]], among others, and that inhabit the departments of [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], [[Tarija Department|Tarija]] and [[Pando Department|Pando]]. The indigenous people compose 60% of the Bolivian population.

===Mestizo===
[[Mestizo]] are an ethnic mix of indigenous people and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] or Europeans descendants. They are distributed throughout the entire country and compose the 26% of the Bolivian population. Most people assume their ''mestizo'' identity while at the same time identifying themselves with one or more Indigenous cultures.

===European===
White Bolivians composed 12.72% or 231,088 of the total population in the 1900 census, the last official census that collected data of racial origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bolivia.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/Censo_Poblacion_1900_T2.pdf Censo National De La Poblacion de la Republica] 1900 Census of Bolivia. "Segunda parte" - (Page: 25 - 32)&lt;/ref&gt; Most people of European origin are second-generation descendants of [[Criollo people|criollos]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] or [[Arab people|Arabs]], coming mostly from [[Spain]], [[Croatia]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="cia-factbook" /&gt; They are usually concentrated in the largest cities &amp;mdash; [[La Paz]], [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and [[Cochabamba]] &amp;mdash; and in some minor cities like [[Tarija]]. In the [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz Department]] there is an important colony (70.000 inhabitants) of German-speaking [[Mennonite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/world/americas/21bolivia.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Bolivian Reforms Raise Anxiety on Mennonite Frontier]. ''The New York Times''. 21 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black African===
[[Afro Bolivian]]s are descendants of [[African slave trade|African slaves]], who arrived in the times of the [[Spanish Empire]]. They inhabit the [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|department of La Paz]] and in the provinces of [[Nor Yungas Province|Nor Yungas]] and [[Sud Yungas Province|Sud Yungas]].

===Other===
* [[Asian people|Asians]]. Mainly [[Japan]]ese (14.000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/area/bolivia/data.html ボリビア多民族国基礎データ]&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] (12.900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theidentitychef.com/2009/09/06/lebanese-diaspora-worldwide-geographical-distribution/ |title=Geographical Distribution of the Lebanese Diaspora |work=The Identity Chef}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 
* Other: There are small amounts of European citizens of [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]], as well as coming from other American countries, as [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], [[United States]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]], among others. There are important [[Peru]]vian colonies in [[La Paz]], [[El Alto]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]]. Bolivia is home to about 500 [[History of the Jews in Bolivia|Jews]], located mainly in the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

==== Indigenous peoples ====
The [[Indigenous peoples of Bolivia]] are divided into two ethnic groups: the Andeans, who are in the [[Andes|Andean]] [[Altiplano]] and the valley region, and the ethnic culture of the oriental Llanos region, who inhabit the warm regions of eastern Bolivia ([[Gran Chaco]]).

* '''Andean ethnicities'''
**[[Aymara people|Aymaras]]. They live on the high plateau of the departments of La Paz, Oruro and Potosí, as well as some small regions near the tropical flatlands.
**[[Quechua people|Quechuas]]. They inhabit mostly the valleys on [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]] and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]. They also inhabit some mountain regions in [[Potosí Department|Potosí]] and [[Oruro Department|Oruro]]. They divide themselves into quechua nations, as the Tarabucos, Ucumaris, Chalchas, Chaquies, Yralipes, Tirinas, among others.
* '''Ethnicities of the Oriental Llanos'''
**[[Guaraní people|Guaraníes]]. Formed by Guarayos, Pausernas, Sirionos, Chiriguanos, [[Wichí people|Wichí]], Chulipis, {{ill|Tapiete|lt=Tapietes|es|Tapietes}}, [[Toba people|Tobas]] and Yuquis.
** '''[[:es:Lenguas tacanas|Tacanas]]''': Formed by Tacanas, Lecos, [[Ese Ejja|Ese Ejas]], Araonas, Reyesanos and Maropas.
** '''Panos''': Formed by Chacobos, Caripunas, Sinabos, Capuibos and Guacanaguas.
** '''Aruacos''': Formed by Apolistas, Baures, [[Moxo people|Moxos]], [[Chané people|Chané]], Movimas, Cayabayas, Carabecas, Paiconecas or Paucanacas.
** '''Chapacuras''': Formed by Itenez or More, Chapacuras, Sansinonianos, Canichanas, Itonamas, Yuracares, Guatoses and [[Chiquitano language|Chiquitos]].
** '''Botocudos''': Formed by Bororos y Otuquis.
** '''Zamucos''': Formed by [[Ayoreo people|Ayoreos]].

{{further|Religion in Bolivia}}
The [[Roman Catholic]] church has a dominant religious presence in Bolivia. While a vast majority of Bolivians are Catholic Christians, a much smaller portion of the population participates actively. In the decades following the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65), the Church tried to make religion a more active force in social life.

{{further|Culture of Bolivia}}
Some cultural development of what is now Bolivia is divided into three distinct periods: pre-Columbian, colonial, and republican. Important archaeological ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, [[ceramic art|ceramics]], and weavings remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include [[Tiwanaku]], [[Samaipata, Bolivia|Samaipata]], [[Inkallaqta]] and [[Iskanwaya]]. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and hardly explored by archaeologists.

The Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local indigenous and ''mestizo'' builders and artisans, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, literature, and sculpture known as "Mestizo Baroque." The colonial period produced the paintings of Perez de Holguin, Flores, Bitti, and others, and also the works of skilled but unknown [[Stonemasonry|stonecutters]], woodcarvers, [[goldsmith]]s, and [[silversmith]]s. An important body of native baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered in recent years and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994. Bolivian artists of stature in the 20th century include, among others, [[Guzman de Rojas]], [[Arturo Borda]], [[María Luisa Pacheco]], [[Master William Vega]], [[Alfredo Da Silva]], and [[Marina Núñez del Prado]].

===Dances===
Many dances and songs contain elements from both the native and European cultures. ''[[Caporales]]'' seems to be the most popular Bolivian dance of present times — in a few decades it has developed into an enormously popular dance, not only in the Highlands where it originated, but also in the Lowlands and in Bolivian communities outside the country. In the Highlands, other traditional and still very popular dances are:
* ''[[Morenada]]''
* ''[[Kullawada]]''
* ''[[Diablada]]''
* ''Ch'utas''
* ''[[Waka waka (dance)|Waka waka]]'' 
* ''[[Siklla]]'' ''(Wayra, Doctorcitos)''
*''Suri Sikuri''
* ''[[Tinku]]''
* ''[[Pukllay]]''
* ''[[Tobas (dance)|Tobas]]''
* ''[[Awki awki]]''
* ''[[Llamerada]]''
* ''Cambitas''
* ''[[Chacarera]]''
* [[Afro-Bolivian]] ''Saya''

In the Lowlands, there are:
* ''Macheteros''
* ''Taquirari''
* ''Chovena chiquitana''
* ''Brincao''
* ''Carnavalito"
* ''El Sarao"
* ''Los moperas''
* ''La Paica''
* ''Danzas del Sol y de la Luna''
* ''Danza de la Saraza''
* ''Danzas de los pescadores''
* ''Danzas del cazador amazónico''
* ''Danza Rosita Pochi''
* ''Arete guazú''
* ''Toritos''
* ''Danzas Vallegrandinas de Santa Cruz''
* ''Cueca Cruceña''

===Clothing===
It is fashionable among Bolivian Andean women of indigenous descent to wear a skirt called a ''[[pollera]]''. It was originally a Spanish peasant skirt that the colonial authorities forced indigenous women to wear. Now it is a symbol of pride in being indigenous and is considered a status symbol.

Another fashion is the [[bowler hat]], which was adopted from the British. The position of the hat can indicate a woman's marital status and aspirations.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Bolivian cuisine}}

Bolivian cuisine stems mainly from the combination of [[Spanish cuisine]] with traditional indigenous Bolivian ingredients, with later influences from [[Argentines]], [[Germans]], [[Italians]], [[Basques]], [[Croats]], [[Russians]], and [[Poles]], due to the arrival of immigrants from those countries.

The traditional staples of Bolivian cuisine are [[corn]], [[potatoes]], and [[beans]]. These ingredients have been combined with a number of staples brought by the Spanish, such as [[rice]], [[wheat]], and meat, such as [[beef]], [[pork]], and [[chicken]]

A conditional jockey is entitled to a reduction, known as an allowance, in the weight carried by his horse, dependent on the type of race, which varies according to the number of races the jockey has won. A jockey who has ridden fewer than twenty winners can claim an allowance of seven [[Pound (mass)|pounds]], one who has ridden between twenty and forty winners can claim a five pound allowance and one who has ridden less than seventy-five winners can claim a three pound allowance. A conditional jockey with fewer than five winners is allowed a further three pounds when riding for the stable which employs him. Allowances cannot be claimed when riding in races restricted to conditional jockeys and in some other instances, for example the [[Grand National]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rules of Racing - 141.

'''José Daniel Ortega Saavedra''' ({{IPA-es|daˈnjel oɾˈteɣa}}; born November 11, 1945) is a Nicaraguan politician serving as [[President of Nicaragua]] since 2007; previously he was leader of Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, first as Coordinator of the [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] (1979–1985) and then as President (1985–1990). A leader in the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (''Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional'', ''FSLN''), his policies in government have seen the implementation of leftist reforms across Nicaragua.

Born into a working-class family, from an early age Ortega opposed ruling President [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], widely recognized as a [[dictator]], and became involved in the underground movement against his regime. Joining the Sandinistas as a student in 1963, Ortega's urban resistance activities led to his arrest in 1967.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ortega Saavedra, Daniel|last=|first=|work=The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather Guide|publisher=Helicon|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Helicon|location=Abington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release in 1974, he also travelled to Cuba to receive training in [[guerilla warfare]] from [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] government. He played a crucial role in forming the Insurrectionist faction, which united the FSLN and sparked the mass uprisings of 1978-1979.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ortega, Daniel|last=|first=|work=Encyclopedia of Nationalism: Leaders, Movements, and Concepts|publisher=Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|year=2000|isbn=|editor-last=Motyl|editor-first=Alexander|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] resulted in the overthrow and exile of Somoza's government, Ortega became leader of the ruling multipartisan [[Junta of National Reconstruction]]. In 1984, Ortega, the FSLN candidate, won Nicaragua's free presidential election with over 60 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt; A Marxist–Leninist, his first period in office was characterized by a controversial program of nationalization, [[land reform]], [[wealth redistribution]] and [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign|literacy programs]].

Ortega's relationship with the United States was never very cordial, due to U.S. support for Somoza prior to the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McClintock|first=Michael|title=The American Connection|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Turning the Tide|year=1985|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the U.S. supplied post-revolution Nicaragua with tens of millions of dollars in economic aid,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/02/world/us-halts-economic-aid-to-nicaragua.html "U.S. halts economic aid to Nicaragua"], ''The New York Times'', April 2, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; relations broke down when the Sandinistas supplied weapons to leftist Salvadoran rebels (something which Ortega later admitted occurred).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/world/salvador-rebels-where-do-they-get-the-arms.html "Salvador Rebels: Where Do They Get the Arms"], ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1988,&lt;/ref&gt; His government was opposed by the [[Contras]] in a vicious civil war; the Contras were funded by the [[Reagan administration]] of the United States. A joint peace proposal by the Democratic Speaker of the House [[Jim Wright]] and Ronald Reagan helped precipitate a peace agreement at a meeting of five Central American chiefs of state in July 1987, which won Costa Rican President [[Óscar Arias]] the Nobel Peace Prize. This led to free elections in which Ortega was defeated by [[Violeta Chamorro]] in the [[Nicaraguan general election, 1990|1990 presidential election]], but he remained an important figure in Nicaraguan opposition politics, gradually moderating in his political position from Marxism–Leninism to [[democratic socialism]]. Also, he restored relations with the [[Catholic Church]], with adoption of [[anti-abortion]] policies.

Ortega was an unsuccessful candidate for president in 1996 and 2001, before winning the [[Nicaraguan general election, 2006|2006 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6117704.stm "Ortega wins Nicaraguan election"], BBC News, November 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In office, he made alliances with fellow Latin American socialists, such as Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], and under his leadership, Nicaragua joined the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]].

As of April 19, 2018, [[Amnesty International]] and the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|IACHR]] of the [[Organization of American States]] stated that Ortega has engaged in a violent oppression campaign against protesters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr43/8470/2018/en/|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2018/128.asp|title=Document|website=www.oas.org|access-date=2018-06-14|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while government officials and government-owned media have denied such actions.

==Early life==
Ortega was born in [[La Libertad, Chontales|La Libertad]], department of [[Chontales Department|Chontales]], [[Nicaragua]]. His parents, Daniel Ortega Cerda and Lidia Saavedra, were opposed  to the regime of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]. His mother was imprisoned by Somoza's National Guard for being in possession of "love letters" which the police stated were coded political missives. Ortega and his two brothers, [[Humberto Ortega]], former [[general]], military leader, and published writer, and Camilo Ortega, grew to become revolutionaries. He also had a sister named Germania who is also deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diario.lajornadanet.com/archivo/2005/mayo/05_05_05.html|title=La Jornada – Jueves, 5 de Mayo de 2005|work=lajornadanet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PANAM16"&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's Rising Dictator|url=https://panampost.com/editor/2016/08/16/meet-daniel-ortega-nicaraguas-rising-dictator/|accessdate=November 4, 2017|work=[[PanAm Post]]|date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for stable employment took the family from [[La Libertad, Chontales|La Libertad]] to the provincial capital of [[Juigalpa, Chontales|Juigalpa]], and then on to a working-class neighborhood in Managua.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=186}} Daniel Ortega Cedra detested U.S. military intervention in Nicaragua and Washington's support for the [[Somoza family|Somoza]] dictatorship, and he imparted the anti-American sentiment to his sons.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=186}}

Ortega was arrested for political activities at the age of 15,&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Five facts about Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N01359367.htm |work=Reuters|accessdate=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly joined the then-underground [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN).&lt;ref name="LP"&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=Daniel Ortega Saavedra, candidato presidencial del FSLN |date=2007-05-10 |publisher= |url=http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2006/septiembre/15/elecciones/candidatos/143891.shtml |work=La Prensa |pages= |accessdate=2007-05-11 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520180905/http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2006/septiembre/15/elecciones/candidatos/143891.shtml |archivedate=2007-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Ortega travelled to [[Guatemala]], where the police arrested him and turned him over to the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]].{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=187}} After his release from detainment, Ortega arranged the assassination of his torturer, Guardsman Gonzalo Lacayo, in August 1967.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=187}} He was imprisoned in 1967 for taking part in [[bank robbery|robbing]] a branch of the [[Bank of America]] while brandishing a machine gun, telling collaborators that they should be killed if they did not partake in the robbery.&lt;ref name="PANAM16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LO"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ed |last=Vulliamy |title=Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega; In the Lions' Den Again |date= |publisher= |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0902-05.htm |work= |pages= |accessdate=2008-01-15 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223093439/http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0902-05.htm |archivedate=2007-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortega was released in late 1974 along with other Sandinista prisoners in exchange for [[Somocista]] hostages. While he was imprisoned at the El Modelo jail, just outside [[Managua]], he wrote poems, one of which he titled ''"I Never Saw Managua When Miniskirts Were in Fashion"''.&lt;ref name="LO"/&gt; During his imprisonment, Ortega was severely tortured.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Diederich]], ''Somoza and the Legacy of U.S. Involvement in Central America'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; While at El Modelo, his mother helped stage protests and hunger strikes for political prisoners, which improved the treatment of incarcerated Sandinistas.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=188}} After his release, Ortega was exiled to [[Cuba]], where he received several months of [[guerrilla]] training.

==Sandinista revolution (1979–1990)==
{{For|more details on Ortega's past presidency|Sandinista National Liberation Front}}
When Somoza was overthrown by the FSLN in July 1979, Ortega became a member of the five-person [[Junta of National Reconstruction]], which also included Sandinista militant [[Moisés Hassan]], novelist [[Sergio Ramírez]], businessman [[Alfonso Robelo]], and [[Violeta Barrios de Chamorro]], the widow of a murdered journalist. In September 1979, United States President [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] hosted Ortega at the White House, and warned him against arming other Central American leftist guerrilla movements.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=80}} At the time, Ortega spoke truthfully by denying Sandinista involvement in neighboring countries.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=80}} When Ortega questioned the Americans about C.I.A. support for anti-Sandinista groups, Carter and Deputy Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher]] called the reports false.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=80}} After the meeting, Carter asked Congress for $75 million in aid to Nicaragua, contingent on the Sandinista government's promise not to aid other guerrillas.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=81}}

The FSLN came to dominate the junta, Robelo and Chamorro resigned, and in 1981 Ortega became the coordinator of the Junta.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Daniel Ortega|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1993|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the only member of the FSLN National Directorate in the Junta, he was the effective leader of the country. The FSLN embarked upon an ambitious programme of social reform upon attaining power. 5 million acres of land were redistributed to about 100,000 families, a literacy drive was launched, and health improvements were carried out which got rid of polio and reduced other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition&lt;/ref&gt; The Sandinista nationalization efforts mostly affected banks and industries owned by the Somoza family.{{sfn|DeFronzo|2011|p=263}} More than half of all farms, businesses, and industries remained in private hands, as the revolutionary government still wanted to preserve a mixed economy and support private sector investment.{{sfn|DeFronzo|2011|p=263}} The Superior Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP) opposed the Sandinistas’ economic reform.{{sfn|DeFronzo|2011|p=264}} The main organization of Nicaraguan big business was composed of prosperous families from the Pacific coast cities, who dominated commerce and banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=Baumeister|first=Eduardo|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=250|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortega took a very hard line against opposition to his policies: On February 21, 1981, the Sandinista army killed 7 Miskito Indians and wounded 17.&lt;ref name="OAS"&gt;[http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/Miskitoeng/part1.htm "ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROVERSY"], Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

[[Anthropologist]] Gilles Bataillon termed this "politics of ethnocide" in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jsa_0037-9174_1983_num_69_1_3063 "3 – Le Nicaragua (French)"], Gilles Bataillon.

They were joined in the north by Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) and in the south by former Sandinistas and peasantry who under the leadership of [[Edén Pastora]] were resisting forced collectivization.&lt;ref name="OAS" /&gt;

In 1980 the Sandinista government launched the massive [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign]], and claimed the illiteracy rate fell from 50% to 13% in the span of five months; these figures are disputed, as many "unteachable" illiterates were omitted from the statistics, and because many people declared literate turned out to be unable to read or write a simple sentence. The UNESCO rewarded Nicaragua the Nadezhda K. Krupskaya prize in recognition of its efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001460/146007e.pdf Dr. Ulrike Hanemann, ''Nicaragua’s literacy campaign'', UNESCO Institute for Education, March 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Specifically states "The views and opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author(s) and should not be attributed to the EFA Global Monitoring Report or to UNESCO"|date=September 2016}} The FSLN also focused on improving the Nicaraguan health system, particularly through vaccination campaigns and the construction of public hospitals, and halved child mortality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/23/world/casualties-in-nicaragua-schools-and-health-care.html?pagewanted=all|title=CASUALTIES IN NICARAGUA: SCHOOLS AND HEALTH CARE|first=Stephen Kinzer and Special To the New York|last=Times|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1987-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 40 deaths per thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lecourrier.ch/141179/la_sante_c_est_d_abord_un_choix_politique_et_gouvernemental | title=La santé c'est d'abord un choix politique et gouvernemental| date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, the [[World Health Organization]] deemed Nicaragua a model for primary health care.{{sfn|DeFronzo|2011|p=264}}

In 1981, United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] accused the FSLN of joining with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed [[Cuba]] in supporting [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary movements in other [[Latin America]]n countries such as [[El Salvador]]. People within the [[Reagan administration]] authorized the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to begin financing, arming and training rebels, some of whom were former officers from Somoza's National Guard, as anti-Sandinista guerrillas. These were known collectively as the [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]]. This also led to one of the largest political scandals in US history, (the [[Iran–Contra affair]]), when [[Oliver North]] and several members of the Reagan administration defied the [[Boland Amendment]], selling arms to [[Iran]] and then using the proceeds to fund the [[Contras]]. The Contra war would claim 30,000 lives.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Walker, ''Nicaragua: Living in the Shadow of the Eagle'', 4th Ed. (Westview Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The tactics used by the Sandinista government to fight the Contras have been criticized by some historians for their suppression of civil rights. On March 15, 1982, the Junta declared a state of siege, which allowed it to close independent radio stations, suspend the right of association and limit the freedom of trade unions. Nicaragua's Permanent Commission on Human Rights condemned Sandinista human rights violations, accusing them of killing and disappearing thousands in the first few years of the war.&lt;ref&gt;John Norton Moore, The Secret  War in Central America (University  Publications  of  America, 1987), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Miranda and William Ratliff, The Civil War in Nicaragua (Transaction, 1993), p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some historians accuse the Contras of having a far poorer Human Rights Record during the same period, with documented cases of murder, rape and torture used to terrorize the rural population. The Contras engaged in destruction of schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure, in order to disrupt the social reform programs of the Sandinistas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Turning the Tide|year=1985|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grandin &amp; Joseph|first=Greg &amp; Gilbert|title=A Century of Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Nicaraguan general election, 1984|1984 general election]] Ortega won the presidency with 67% of the vote and took office on January 10, 1985. In the early phases of the campaign, Ortega enjoyed many institutional advantages, and used the full power of the press, police, and Supreme Electoral Council against the fractured opposition.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=242}}  In the weeks before the November election, Ortega gave a U.N. speech denouncing talks held in Rio de Janeiro on electoral reform.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=244}} But by October 22, the Sandinistas signed an accord with opposition parties to reform electoral and campaign laws, making the process more fair and transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=McConnell|first=Shelley|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=127|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; While campaigning, Ortega promoted the Sandinistas’ achievements, and at a rally claimed that “Democracy is literacy, democracy is land reform, democracy is education and public health.”{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=246}} International observers judged the election to be the first free election held in the country in more than half a century.  A report by an [[Irish government]]ary delegation stated: "The electoral process was carried out with total integrity. The seven parties participating in the elections represented a broad spectrum of political ideologies." The general counsel of New York's [[Human Rights Commission]] described the election as "free, fair and hotly contested." A study by the US [[Latin American Studies Association]] (LASA) concluded that the FSLN (Sandinista Front) "did little more to take advantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere (including the U.S.) routinely do." However some people described the election as "rigged". According to a detailed study, since the 1984 election was for posts subordinate to the Sandinista Directorate, the elections were no more subject to approval by vote than the Central Committee of the Communist Party is in countries of the East Bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kriele, “Power and Human Rights in Nicaragua,” German Comments, April 1986, pp. 56–7, 63–7, a chapter excerpted from his Nicaragua: Das blutende Herz Amerikas (Piper, 1986).

Leiken, "The Nicaraguan Tangle", ''The New York Review of Books'', December 5, 1985 and "The Nicaraguan Tangle: Another Exchange", ''The New York Review of Books'', June 26, 1986; Alfred G. Cuzan, Letter, Commentary, December 1985 and "The Latin American Studies Association vs. the United States", ''Academic Questions'', Summer 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-three percent of the Nicaraguan voters cast ballots for one of six opposition parties—three to the right of the Sandinistas, three to the left—which had campaigned with the aid of government funds and free TV and radio time. Two conservative parties captured a combined 23 percent of the vote. They held rallies across the country (a few of which were disrupted by FSLN supporters) and blasted the Sandinistas in harsh terms. Most foreign and independent observers noted this pluralism in debunking the Reagan administration charge—ubiquitous in the [[US media]]—that it was a "Soviet-style sham" election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2479 'The Sandinistas won't submit to free elections'] Article from "Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting".

==In opposition (1990–2007)==
In the 1990 presidential election, Ortega lost his reelection bid to [[Violeta Barrios de Chamorro]], his former colleague in the junta. Chamorro was supported by the US and a 14-party anti-Sandinista alliance known as the [[National Opposition Union]] (Unión Nacional Oppositora, UNO), an alliance that ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists. She ran an effective campaign, presenting herself as the peace candidate and promising to end the US-funded Contra War if she won.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Leslie E. and Lawrence C. Dodd, Learning Democracy:  Citizen Engagement and Electoral Choice in Nicaragua, 1990-2001, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2005, esp Chapter 3.  &lt;/ref&gt;  Ortega campaigned on the slogan, "Everything Will Be Better," and promised that, with the Contra war over, he could focus on the nation's recovery.{{sfn|Kinzer|1991|p=389}}  Contrary to what most observers expected,&lt;ref&gt;Alma Guillermoprieto, The Heart That Bleeds: Latin America Now, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; Chamorro shocked Ortega and won the election. Chamorro's UNO coalition garnered 54 percent of the vote, and won 51 of the 92 seats in the [[National Assembly (Nicaragua)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=Marti i Puig|first=Salvador|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=30|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the loss, the Sandinistas tried to maintain unity around their revolutionary posture.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=Baltodano|first=Andres Perez|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=70|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ortega's concession speech the following day he vowed to keep "ruling from below" a reference to the power that the FSLN still wielded in various sectors. He also stressed his belief that the Sandinistas had the goal of bringing "dignity" to Latin America, and not necessarily to hold on to government posts. In 1991, Ortega claimed elections were “an instrument to reaffirm” the FSLN's “political and ideological positions,” and also “confront capitalism.”&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; However, the electoral loss led to pronounced divisions in the FSLN. Some members adopted more pragmatic positions, and sought to transform the FSLN into a modern social democratic party engaged in national reconciliation and class cooperation.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Ortega and other party insiders found common ground with the radicals, who still promoted anti-imperialism and class conflict to achieve social change.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Possible explanations for his loss include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless [[Violeta Chamorro]] won.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1222025.html "Bush Vows to End Embargo if Chamorro Wins"], ''The Washington Post,'' November 9, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras,&lt;ref&gt;"The policy of keeping the contras alive ... also has placed in jeopardy the holding of elections by encouraging contra attacks on the electoral process. Thus, while the Bush administration proclaims its support for human rights and free and fair elections in Nicaragua, it persists in sabotaging both." As seen at: [https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm "Nicaragua"] Human Rights Watch, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; with a Canadian observer mission claiming that 42 people were killed by the contras in "election violence" in October 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/471113751.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+27%2C+1989&amp;author=%28CP%29&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=U.S.+trying+to+disrupt+election+in+Nicaragua%2C+Canadians+report&amp;pqatl=google "U.S. trying to disrupt election in Nicaragua, Canadians report"] ''[[The Toronto Star]]'', October 27, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; This led many commentators to assume that Nicaraguans voted against the Sandinistas out of fear of a continuation of the contra war and economic deprivation.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

From July 19–21, 1991, the FSLN held a National Congress to mend the rifts between members and form a new overarching political program.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marti i Puig|first=Salvador|last2=Wright|first2=Claire|date=2010|title=The Adaptation of the FSLN: Daniel Ortega's Leadership and Democracy in Nicaragua|jstor=40925837|journal=Latin American Politics and Society|volume=52|issue=4|pages=79–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort failed to unite the party, and intense debates over the internal governance of the FSLN continued. The pragmatists, led by the former vice president [[Sergio Ramírez|Sergio Ramirez]], formed the basis of a "renovating" faction, and supported collaboration with other political forces to preserve the rule of law in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; Under the leadership of Ortega and [[Tomás Borge|Tomas Borge]], the radicals regrouped into the "principled" faction, and branded themselves the Izquierda Democratica (ID), or Democratic Left (DL).&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; The DL fought the [[Violeta Chamorro|Chamorro]] government with disruptive labor strikes and demonstrations, and renewed calls for the revolutionary reconstruction of Nicaraguan society.{{sfn|DeFronzo|2011|p=276}} During the May 20–23, 1994, extraordinary congress, Ortega ran against a fellow National Directorate member, Henry Ruiz, for the position of party secretary-general.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=Marti i Puig|first=Salvador|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=35|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortega was elected with 287 to Ruiz's 147 votes, and the DL secured the most dominant role in the FSLN.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

On September 9, 1994, Ortega gained more power after taking over Sergio Ramirez's seat in the Asamblea Sandinista (Sandinista Assembly).&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; Ramirez had served as chief of the FSLN's parliamentary caucus since 1990, but Ortega came to oppose his actions in the [[National Assembly (Nicaragua)|National Assembly]], setting the stage for Ramirez's removal.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Historic leaders, such as [[Ernesto Cardenal]], a former minister of culture in the Sandinista government, rejected Ortega's consolidation of power: “My resignation from the FSLN has been caused by the kidnapping of the party carried out by Daniel Ortega and the group he heads.”&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; The party formally split on January 8, 1995, when Ramirez and a number of prominent Sandinista officials quit.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt;

Ortega ran for election again, in October 1996 and November 2001, but lost on both occasions to [[Arnoldo Alemán]] and [[Enrique Bolaños]], respectively. In these elections, a key issue was the allegation of corruption. In Ortega's last days as president, through a series of legislative acts known as "The [[Piñata]]", estates that had been seized by the Sandinista government (some valued at millions and even billions of US dollars) became the private property of various FSLN officials, including Ortega himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Shirley Christian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/08/world/managua-journal-victor-s-lament-to-the-losers-belong-the-spoils.html |title=Managua Journal; Victor's Lament: To the Losers Belong the Spoils – New York Times |location=Nicaragua |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= 1991-06-08|accessdate=2014-08-18|newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1996 campaign, Ortega faced the Liberal Alliance (Alianza Liberal), headed by [[Arnoldo Alemán|Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo]], a former mayor of Managua.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=Baltodano|first=Andres Perez|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=72|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sandinistas softened their anti-imperialist rhetoric, with Ortega calling the U.S. “our great neighbor,” and vowing to cooperate “within a framework of respect, equality, and justice.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The image change failed, as Aleman's Liberal Alliance came first with 51.03 percent of the vote, while Ortega's FSLN secured 37.75 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=Baltodano|first=Andres Perez|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=73|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ortega's policies became more moderate during his time in opposition, and he gradually changed much of his former [[Marxist]] stance in favor of an agenda of [[democratic socialism]]. His [[Roman Catholic]] faith has become more public in recent years as well, leading Ortega to embrace a variety of [[socially conservative]] policies; in 2006 the FSLN endorsed a strict law banning all [[abortion]]s in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/20/world/americas/20nicaragua.html|title=Nicaragua Eliminates Last Exception to Strict Anti-Abortion Law|date=November 20, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=August 5, 2016|last1=Jr|first1=James C.

Ortega was instrumental in creating the controversial strategic pact between the FSLN and the [[Constitutional Liberal Party]] (Partido Liberal Constitucionalista, PLC). The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising. After sealing the agreement in January 2000, the two parties controlled the three key institutions of the state: the Comptroller General of the Republic, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Electoral Council.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; ''"El Pacto,"'' as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Alemán greatly, while constraining then-president Bolaños. One of the key accords of the pact was to lower the percentage necessary to win a presidential election in the first round from 45% to 35%, a change in electoral law that would become decisive in Ortega's favor in the 2006 elections{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

At the Fourth Ordinary Congress of the FSLN, held March 17–18, 2002, Ortega eliminated the National Directorate (DN).&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; Once the main collective leadership body of the party, with nine members, the DN no longer met routinely, and only three historic members remained.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; Instead, the body just supported decisions already made by the secretary-general.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; Ortega sidelined party officials and other members while empowering his own informal circle, known as the ring of iron.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt;

=== 2001 presidential election ===

Under Ortega's direction, the FSLN formed the broad National Convergence (Convergencia Nacional) coalition to defeat the PLC in the 2001 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=Baltodano|first=Andres Perez|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=76|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortega abandoned the revolutionary tone of the past, and infused his campaign with religious imagery. In speeches, he gave thanks to “God and the Revolution” for the post-1990 democracy, and claimed a Sandinista victory would enable the Nicaraguan people to “pass through the sea and reach the Promised Land.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=Baltodano|first=Andres Perez|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=77|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. opposed Ortega's candidacy from the beginning.

===2006 presidential election===
{{Main|Nicaraguan general election, 2006}}
In 2006, Daniel Ortega was elected president with 38% of the vote. This occurred despite the fact that the breakaway [[Sandinista Renovation Movement]] continued to oppose the FSLN, running former Mayor of Managua  [[Herty Lewites]] as its candidate for president. Ortega personally attacked [[Herty Lewites|Lewites]]’ Jewish background, compared him to Judas, and warned he “could end up hanged.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sandinistas &amp; Nicaragua Since 1979|last=Baltodano|first=Andres Perez|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Close|editor-first=David|location=Boulder|pages=83|editor-last2=Marti i Puig|editor-first2=Salvador|editor-last3=McConnell|editor-first3=Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lewites died several months before the elections.

Ortega emphasized peace and reconciliation in his campaign, and selected a former Contra leader, [[Jaime Morales Carazo|Jaime Morales Corazo]], as his running mate.{{sfn|DeFronzo|2011|p=281}} The FSLN also won 38 seats in the congressional elections, becoming the party with the largest representation in parliament. The split in the Constitutionalist Liberal Party helped allow the FSLN to become the largest party in Congress; however, the Sandinista vote had a minuscule split between the FSLN and MRS, and that the liberal party combined is larger than the Frente Faction. In 2010, several liberal congressmen raised accusations about the FSLN presumably attempting to buy votes to pass constitutional reforms that would allow Ortega to run for office for the 6th time since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;News  Paper Article: La Prensa {{cite web |url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/06/15/politica/27852 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019083239/http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/06/15/politica/27852 |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the National Sandinista Council held in September 2009, Lenin Cerna, the secretary of the party organization, called for diversifying its political strategies.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; He declared the FSLN's future depended on implementing new plans, “so that the party can advance via new routes and in new ways, always under Ortega’s leadership.”&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Ortega gained power over the selection of candidates, allowing him to personally choose all candidates for public office.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

Ortega himself denies that the abortion legislation outlaws medical procedures necessary to save the woman's life if they result in the termination of pregnancy. "The medical Procedural Code, he says, is not affected by the law, and requires doctors to do what is necessary to save a woman's life if it is threatened by conditions related to her pregnancy."{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} He claims that the accusations that the abortion laws outlaw medical procedures necessary to save the life of the mother are part of "a media war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/jan/08010804.html |title=Nicaraguan President Denounces International Media for Campaign Against Country's Anti-Abortion Laws|accessdate= August 5, 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081109225911/http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/jan/08010804.html |archivedate= November 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 the National Assembly, dominated by the FSLN, approved constitutional amendments that abolished term limits for the presidency and allowed a president to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms.  Although billed{{by whom|date=May 2016}} as a measure to ensure stability, critics{{Which|date=May 2016}} charged that the amendments threatened Nicaraguan democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-25937292|title= Nicaragua: Ortega allowed to run for third successive term|newspaper= BBC News|accessdate= April 25, 2015|date= 2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutional reforms also gave Ortega the sole power to appoint military and police commanders.&lt;ref name="Thaler2017"/&gt;

As of 2016, Ortega's family owns three of the nine free-to-air television channels in Nicaragua, and controls a fourth (the public Channel 6). Four of the remaining five are controlled by Mexican mogul [[Remigio Ángel González|Ángel González]], and are generally considered to be aligned with Ortega's ruling FSLN party. There are no government restrictions on Internet use; the Ortega administration attempted to gain complete control over online media in 2015, but failed due to opposition from civil society, political parties, and private organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicaragua Country report/Freedom of the Press/2016|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/nicaragua|website=freedomhouse.org|accessdate=August 4, 2016|date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the Nicaraguan supreme court ruled to oust [[Eduardo Montealegre]], the leader of the main opposition party, leaving the main opposition coalition with no means of contesting the November 2016 national elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lakhani|first1=Nina|title=Nicaragua suppresses opposition to ensure one-party election, critics say|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/nicaragua-opposition-daniel-ortega-presidential-election|accessdate=August 4, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Ortega chose his wife, [[Rosario Murillo]], as his vice-presidential running-mate for re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicaragua's President Picks Wife as Running Mate|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nicaragua-s-daniel-ortega-picks-wife-running-mate-pledges-joint-n622201|accessdate=August 4, 2016|work=[[NBC News]]|date=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Washington Post'', figures announced on November 7, 2016 put Daniel Ortega in line for his third consecutive term as President, also being his fourth term overall. The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) reported Ortega and Murillo won 72.4 percent of the vote, with 68 percent turnout.&lt;ref name="Thaler2017"/&gt; The opposition coalition had called the election a "farce" and had called for the boycott of the election. International observers were not allowed to observe the vote. Nevertheless, according to the BBC, the autocratic Ortega was the most popular candidate by far, possibly due to Nicaragua's stable economic growth and lack of violence compared to its neighbours El Salvador and Honduras in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicaragua's Ortega re-elected president|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37892477|accessdate=November 29, 2017|work=BBC News|date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, student protests over a nature reserve fire expanded to cover an unpopular social security decree. The protesters were violently set upon by the state sponsored Sandinista Youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peaceful Protests against Nicaraguan Social Security Reforms Violently Repressed|url=https://www.havanatimes.org/?p=132219|date=April 19, 2018|work=the Havana Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts by Ortega's government to hide the incident through censorship off all private-owned news outlets, photos and videos of the violence made their way to social media where they sparked outrage and urged more Nicaraguans to join in on the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nicaragua Roiled by Protests Over Social Security Benefits |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/world/americas/nicaragua-protests-ortega.html |work= The New York Times |date= April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog |url= https://ijnet.org/en/blog/facing-censorship-nicaraguan-journalists-and-citizens-turn-social-media|title=Facing censorship, Nicaraguan journalists and citizens turn to social media|work=ijnet|date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|title=Amidst unrest, Nicaraguan journalists use digital innovation to share information|url=https://ijnet.org/en/blog/amidst-unrest-nicaraguan-journalists-use-digital-innovation-share-information|work=ijnet|date=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions escalated quickly, as police began using mustard gas canisters and rubber bullets, and eventually live ammunition on unarmed protesters.&lt;ref name="the Miami Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Nicaragua, the political battle is moving from the streets to the negotiating table|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article210129639.html|work=the Miami Herald|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities were also seen arming Sandinista Youth members with weapons to serve as paramilitary forces.&lt;ref name="the Miami Herald"/&gt; Dozens of student protesters were subsequently killed. Despite the withdrawal of the unpopular decree, the [[2018 Nicaraguan protests|protests continue]], with most protesters demanding Ortega's and his cabinet's resignations. As the protests continue, support for the Ortega-Murillo regime dwindles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As Nicaragua Death Toll Grows, Support for Ortega Slips|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/world/americas/nicaragua-protests-ortega.html|accessdate=May 7, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, Nicaragua's Mother's Day, a march attended by over 300,000 people took place. It was held to honor the mothers of students killed in the recent protests. The demonstration was peaceful, attended by children, mothers and retirees. Yet Ortega's regime ordered sharpshooters, perched at the National Stadium to shoot indiscriminately at the marchers, resulting in the deaths of 15 civilians, one of them in the hands of his own mother. This event has been dubbed by Nicaraguans as the "Mother's Day Massacre".&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicaragua Protests Grow Increasingly Violent, 100 Killed Since April|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/world/americas/nicaragua-protests-killings.html|accessdate=May 31, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protests on Nicaragua's Mother's Day turn deadly|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/31/americas/nicaragua-mothers-day-deadly-violence/index.html|accessdate=May 31, 2018|work=CNN|date=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicaragua: Violent attack on mass Mother's Day march in Managua|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/nicaragua-violento-ataque-a-multitudinaria-marcha-de-las-madres-en-managua/|accessdate=May 30, 2018|work=CNN|date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Estados Unidos condena masacre del Día de las Madres y pide una investigación inmediata|url=https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2018/05/31/politica/2428258-estados-unidos-condena-masacre/|accessdate=June 23, 2018|work=La Prensa|date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 3, 2018, the Death Toll has reached 309 people.

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 18 December 2008-6.jpg|thumb|Ortega with [[Russian Prime Minister]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in [[Russia]] on December 18, 2008.]]
On March 6, 2008, following the [[2008 Andean diplomatic crisis]], Ortega announced that Nicaragua was breaking diplomatic ties with [[Colombia]] "in solidarity with the [[Ecuador]]ian people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/03/06/nic.colombia/index.html "Nicaragua breaks diplomatic relations with Colombia"] March 6, 2008 ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ortega also stated, "We are not breaking relations with the Colombian people. We are breaking relations with the terrorist policy practiced by [[Álvaro Uribe]]'s government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Xuequan |last= Mu |title= Nicaragua breaks off relations with Colombian gov't |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-03/07/content_7734634.htm |work= Xinhua News |accessdate= 2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relations were restored with the resolution at a [[Rio Group]] summit held in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Dominican Republic]], on March 7, 2008. At the summit Colombia's Álvaro Uribe, Ecuador's [[Rafael Correa]], Venezuela's [[Hugo Chávez]] and Ortega publicly shook hands in a show of good-will. The handshakes, broadcast live throughout Latin America, appeared to signal that a week of military buildups and diplomatic repercussions was over. After the handshakes, Ortega said he would re-establish diplomatic ties with Colombia. Uribe then quipped that he would send him the bill for his ambassador's plane fare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://voanews.com/english/2008-03-07-voa73.cfm |title= Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela Agree to End Border Crisis |publisher= [[VOA]] |date= 2008-03-07 |accessdate= 2008-03-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080309093506/http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-03-07-voa73.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On May 25, 2008, Ortega, upon learning of the death of [[FARC]] guerrilla leader [[Manuel Marulanda]] in Colombia, expressed condolences to the family of Marulanda and solidarity with the FARC and called Marulanda an extraordinary fighter who battled against profound inequalities in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.miamiherald.com/519/story/546814.html |title= Colombian rebels' loss of leader ends an era |first= Tyler |last= Bridges |publisher= Miami Herald |date= 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://espanol.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/080525/latinoamerica/latinoamerica_farc_marulanda_ortega_sol |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-05-25 |language=Spanish |title=Ortega expresa condolencias a FARC por muerte líder |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527052757/http://espanol.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/080525/latinoamerica/latinoamerica_farc_marulanda_ortega_sol |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The declarations were protested by the [[Colombian government]] and criticized in the major Colombian media outlets.

[[File:Ortega Lula - ABr 28.07.20102225.JPG|thumb|Ortega with [[President of Brazil|Brazilian President]] [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] at [[Itamaraty Palace]] in [[Brasília]], July 28, 2010.]]
On September 2, 2008, during ceremonies for the 29th anniversary of the founding of the [[Sandinista Popular Army|Nicaraguan army]], Ortega announced that "Nicaragua recognizes the independence of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]] and fully supports the [[Russian government]]'s position". Ortega's decision made Nicaragua the second country (after [[Russia]]) to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://en.rian.ru/world/20080904/116538071.html|title= Nicaragua recognizes South Ossetia and Abkhazia|work= rian.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day after [[Venezuela]] recognised the two Republics, Nicaragua established diplomatic relations with Abkhazia, and followed this by establishing diplomatic links with South Ossetia. Embassies have been mooted, but as of 2013 these had not opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://en.rian.ru/world/20100603/159280095.html|title= Abkhazia, S. Ossetia may soon open embassies in Nicaragua|work= rian.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When seeking office, Ortega threatened to cut ties with the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) in order to restore relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] (as in the period from 1985 to 1990). But he did not do so. In 2007 Ortega stated that Nicaragua did not accept the [[One China Policy]] of the PRC government and that Nicaragua reserved the right to maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. He reassured President Chen Shui Bian in 2007 that Nicaragua would not break diplomatic relations with Taiwan. He explained that during the Reagan administration the United States imposed sanctions on Nicaragua. But cutting ties with Taiwan was a sad and painful decision because of the friendship between Nicaragua and Taiwan's people and government. Ortega met with Taiwan's President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] in 2009 and both agreed to improve the diplomatic ties between both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/joe-hung/2009/06/09/211402/Ma-Ying-jeou.htm|title=Ma Ying-jeou shouldn't meet Daniel Ortega|publisher=|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with a trade show from China in Managua in 2010, he is attempting a two-track policy to get benefits from both sides. In 2016 Nicaragua and Taiwan signed an air services agreement and Ortega stated that Nicaragua's  free trade deal with Taiwan had benefited both nations. Taiwan increased its investment in Nicaragua. In 2017 Ortega reaffirmed Nicaragua's diplomatic relations with Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://solpropertygroup.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/nicaragua-seeks-economic-relations-with-china-the-nica-times-the-nica-times-costa-rica-newspaper-the-tico-times/ |title=Nicaragua seeks economic relations with China |author=Tim Rogers |date=January 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721183306/http://solpropertygroup.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/nicaragua-seeks-economic-relations-with-china-the-nica-times-the-nica-times-costa-rica-newspaper-the-tico-times/ |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, after a US report listed Nicaragua as a "major" drug-trafficking centre, with Costa Rica and Honduras, Ortega urged the US Congress and [[Obama administration]] to allocate more resources to assist the fight against drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/09/21/1834482/us-adds-three-nations-to-drug.html|title=U.S. adds three nations to drug-traffic-hub list – Americas – MiamiHerald.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"transshipment point for cocaine destined for the US and transshipment point for arms-for-drugs dealing" {{citation|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2086.html|title= Field Listing :: Illicit drugs|publisher= CIA|accessdate= 2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], Ortega was among the [[International reactions to the 2011 Libyan civil war|very few leaders]] who spoke out in clear defense of the embattled [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa/2011/02/22/live-blog-libya-feb-22|title= Live Blog – Libya Feb 22|work= Al Jazeera Blogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a telephone conversation between the two, Ortega told  Gaddafi that he was "waging a great battle to defend his nation"&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera (February 24, 2011). {{YouTube|u-HvdqjsqXM|''Latin America divided over Gaddafi''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that "it's at difficult times that loyalty and resolve are put to the test."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/22/AR2011022203086.html|title=Washington Post article|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ortega has said that Assad's victory in the [[Syrian presidential election, 2014|2014 election]] is an important step to "attain peace in Syria and a clear cut evidence that the Syrian people trust their president as a national leader and support his policies which aim at maintaining Syria's sovereignty and unity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriatimes.sy/index.php/presidential-elections/13206-nicaragua-s-ortega-congratulates-president-al-assad-on-winning-elections|title=syriatimes.sy - Nicaragua's Ortega Congratulates President Al-Assad on Winning Elections|work=syriatimes.sy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental policy===
In 2016, Daniel Ortega did not sign the [[Paris Agreement]] because he felt the deal did not do enough to protect the climate, although he later changed his mind. Moreover, [[Nicaragua]] rejected projects of mining of the Canadian group B2 Gold which could represent a threat to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2017/04/28/en-premiere-mondiale-le-salvador-interdit-les-mines-de-metaux_5118997_3244.html|title=Le Salvador devient le premier pays au monde à interdire les mines de métaux|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to government estimates, Nicaragua has passed from 25 percent renewable energy to 52 percent between 2007 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4799844/nicaragua-paris-climate-agreement-countries/|title=Nicaragua Didn't Sign the Paris Agreement Because It Didn't Go Far Enough|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In Nicaragua, reviews of Ortega's presidency have not always been glowing, with many considering him a dictator. Many Nicaraguans, including prominent former Sandinista leaders, such as Daniel Ortega's own brother [[Humberto Ortega]], have accused him of forgetting where he came from and catering to his own capitalist interests; calling his government monopolistic and authoritarian and denouncing him as a "Bloody Dictator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/andres-oppenheimer/article210536964.html|title=Ortega’s repressive regime cannot survive — even his younger brother, a former Sandinista leader, says so|date=May 5, 2018|first=Associated|last=Press|website=the Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2018 Nicaraguan protests|2018 protests]] are symbolic of these tensions &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/nicaragua-withdraws-social-security-changes-after-people-killed-in-riots|title=Nicaragua abandons social security changes after dozens killed in riots|first=Associated|last=Press|date=April 23, 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr43/8470/2018/en/|title=Nicaragua: Shoot to kill: Nicaragua's strategy to repress protest}}&lt;/ref&gt; with nearly 70% of Nicaraguans thinking Ortega should resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nicaragua-protest-analysis/nicaraguas-unlikely-opposition-faces-rocky-road-to-defeat-ortega-idUSKBN1JK11Y|title=Nicaragua's unlikely opposition faces rocky road to defeat Ortega}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2636">'''David Solomon Eibeschutz''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''דוד שלמה אייבשיץ''') (alternate English: David Shlomo Eibeschitz) was born in [[Ozerjany]], [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (now in [[Ukraine]]) in 1755.

==Biography==
His father's name was Yerachmiel. He was a [[Jews of Russia|Russian]]-born rabbi and author, a pupil of Rabbi [[Moses Tzvi Heller]], the author of ''Geon Tzvi.'' He was the first Rabbi of the [[shtetl]] of Chorostkov, Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth (now [[Chorostkiv]], Ukraine). From 1790 to 1800, he occupied the position of Rabbi in Bodzanov (now [[Budaniv]], Ukraine). Thereafter, he served as the Rabbi for Soroki, Bessarabia (now Soroca, [[Moldova]]), and in Jassy (now [[Iaşi]], [[Romania]]). From Iasi, he made ''[[aliyah]]'' and went to the [[Land of Israel]] in 1810 and remained in [[Safed]] until his death on 19 November 1813.

He was the author of many [[kabalistic]] and [[Talmudical]] works, which still exist in manuscript. He also wrote ''Levushei Serad,'' in two parts. The first part contains a commentary on the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', ''Orach Chayim'', with comments on [[David ben Samuel]]'s ''Turei Zahav'' and [[Abraham Abele Gumbiner]]'s ''Magen Avrohom''; at the end of this part is added the plan of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] as described by [[Ezekiel]] (Mohilev, 1818, and frequently reprinted). The second part is on ''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' (Mohilev, 1812). His ''Ne'os Deshe'' is a compilation of 138 ''[[responsa]],'' in two parts, the first of which was published in Lemberg, 1861, while the second is in manuscript. ''Arvei Nachal'' is also in two parts, the first being a treatise on the [[Pentateuch]], the second consisting of sermons (Kopust, Sdilkov, 1835; Krotoschin, 1840; Jitomir, 1850; Lemberg, 1856).

Franck Muller [[timepiece]]s are famous for their fusion of "modern" style, mostly inspired by American watches from the thirties, like "Elgin tonneau", and traditional Swiss watch manufacturing.

==Biography==
Franck Muller was born in 1958. He spent his childhood in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]] with his Italian mother and Swiss-born father. When 15, he enrolled in a watchmaking school.
In the early 1980s, he graduated from the Watchmaking School of Geneva ({{lang-fr|Ecole d'Horlogerie de Genève}}). Afterwards, he began repairing top-quality pocket [[watch]]es. Close to an independent watchmaker by the name of [[Svend Andersen]], Franck Muller became responsible for handling watches from the collection of [[Patek Philippe]]. 
Most of the clientele were private individuals and museums. While he was working with complicated timepieces, he became passionate about their mechanisms and began to think of building his own workshop.

Soon after, in 1984, Franck Muller designed his own [[tourbillon]] [[wristwatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hourology.com/store/franck-muller.html |title=Franck Muller |publisher=Hourology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211234543/http://www.hourology.com/store/franck-muller.html |archivedate=2011-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, few watchmakers were capable of creating such complicated timepieces, among them [[Patek Philippe]] and [[Vacheron Constantin]]. The private clients of Franck Muller continued to come for new timepieces, and thus his business started growing. 
The House of Franck Muller opened in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterjackson.co.uk/franckmuller.html FRANCK MULLER] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713163033/http://www.peterjackson.co.uk/franckmuller.html |date=July 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his ultra complicated timepieces instantly became famous in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. Today, his factory, which is also the headquarters of Franck Muller, produces a limited number of watches for private clientele. Franck Muller's collections include a variety of designs and price ranges.
Now the company has five sites ([[Genthod]], [[Lajoux (Switzerland)|Lajoux]], [[Les Bois]], [[Plan-les-Ouates]], [[Meyrin]]) and 570 official retailers.

The company's estimated total sales (in 2010/2011) were €290 million in watches with an average unit price of €38,000.&lt;ref name="Luxury"/&gt;

==World premieres==
Franck Muller is also known for its "World Premiers". Each year, the manufacturer launches at least one new line of timepieces, featuring something special and exclusive, that has never been seen before in the watchmaking industry. The first such world premiere was launched in 1993. The watches had a [[double chronograph|split seconds]] [[chronograph]], a [[minute repeater]], and a [[perpetual calendar]]. In addition, the watches included an indicator showing the internal temperature.

==Notable products==
Notable{{who|date=June 2013}} timepieces include ''Revolution2'', ''Revolution3'', ''Crazy Hours'', and ''Colour Dreams''. Further examples of Franck Muller's watches include the Endurance, which is a simple chronograph, the ''Master Banker'', which is a tonneau-shaped watch capable of multiple time zone indication, and the ''Curvex Minute Repeater Tourbillon'', whose production is limited to 25 pieces.

'''George Bailey''' is a [[fictional character]] and the protagonist in [[Frank Capra]]'s 1946 film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. The character is a [[building and loan]] banker who sacrifices his dreams in order to help his community, to the point where he feels life has passed him by.  Eventually, due to a cruel business rival's manipulations, Bailey falls into despair so deep that he contemplates suicide, until his [[guardian angel]], [[Clarence Odbody]], gives him a valuable perspective on the worth of his life.

The character was listed ninth on the [[American Film Institute]]'s 2003 list of the 50 greatest screen heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey is played by [[James Stewart]] as an adult and [[Bobby Anderson (actor and production associate)|Bobby Anderson]] as a child, and is loosely based on George Pratt, a character in [[Philip Van Doren Stern]]'s "[[The Greatest Gift (story)|The Greatest Gift]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Stern__Phillip_Van_Doren.html |title=Phillip Stern Library |access-date=2013-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063214/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Stern__Phillip_Van_Doren.html |archive-date=2013-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

In the [[winter]] of 1919, George (aged 12, portrayed by [[Bobby Anderson (actor)|Bobby Anderson]]) and his friends Bert, Ernie Bishop, Marty Hatch, Sam Wainwright, and his brother Harry are sledding on a frozen river. Harry breaks through the ice and George jumps into the freezing water to save him. George develops an infection which deafens him in his left ear.

In May 1920, George returns to his job at Mr. Gower's drug store, where he finds a telegram informing Gower that his son has died in the [[Spanish flu pandemic]]. A shaken Gower directs George to deliver medicine to a customer, but George realizes that in his distress Gower has inadvertently put poison into the capsules. He seeks advice from his father, who is president of the Bailey Brothers Building &amp; Loan, but his father is meeting with miserly banker [[Henry F. Potter]]. When he returns to the store, Gower angrily upbraids him for not delivering the capsules until George blurts out the mistake. Gower suddenly understands, and is tearfully grateful; George promises he will keep the incident a secret: "I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't."

==Young adult==

In June 1928, George (played by [[James Stewart]]) is preparing for an overseas trip. He drops by his brother Harry's [[graduation party]] at the [[high school]], where he is re-introduced to his friend Marty's eighteen-year-old sister, Mary Hatch. While walking Mary home a car pulls up and George is informed that his father has had a [[stroke]].

Three months later, George is in a meeting with the [[board of directors]] of the Building &amp; Loan to appoint a new successor to the late Peter Bailey. Potter argues that the Building &amp; Loan should be dissolved. The directors tell George that the Building &amp; Loan will only stay open if he agrees to remain and carry on his father's work. George foregoes a trip to Europe and his plans for college, giving the funds saved toward tuition to his younger brother.&lt;ref name=msn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie-synopsis/it's-a-wonderful-life/|title=Showtimes, reviews, trailers, news and more - MSN Movies|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, George and Uncle Billy are waiting at the Bedford Falls railroad station for Harry to come home from college, when Harry arrives with his new wife, Ruth. Her father has offered Harry a job, which means he would not be taking George's place at the Building &amp; Loan. Although Harry vows to turn the offer down for George's sake, George cannot bear to allow his brother to throw away such an opportunity, so he remains in Bedford Falls. While the family is celebrating Harry's return, Ma Bailey mentions to George that Mary Hatch is back from college and he should pay her a visit. He eventually goes to Mary's home to visit her, only to find that she is being courted by his friend, the now wealthy but absent, Sam Wainwright.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;

==Pre-war==

A few months later, George and Mary are married. Their plans for a honeymoon in [[New York City]] and [[Bermuda]] are interrupted by a [[bank run|run on the banks]] which also affects the Building &amp; Loan. Potter's bank calls their loan, and panicked depositors want their money, threatening to take their business to the bank. As a stockholder, Potter threatens to shut the Building &amp; Loan if they are forced to close early. Mary and George use the money saved for their honeymoon to keep the Building &amp; Loan solvent.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;

In 1934, thanks to the Building &amp; Loan, the Martini family move out of 'Potter's Field' to the new 'Bailey Park', a residential development created by George that proves successful enough to seriously threaten Mr. Potter's rental interests. Potter offers George a job. Although this would bring a significant increase in salary George declines. George returns home to learn that Mary is pregnant. Their first child is a son, whom they name Pete after George's late father. Their second child is a daughter, Janie.

==The war years==

;1939–1945

During the war years, George and Mary had another two children, a girl, Zuzu, born in 1940, and a son, Tommy, born in 1941. Due to George's deaf ear, he was given a 4-F draft classification and had to stay in Bedford Falls. His friend Bert the Cop went to [[Africa]] to fight, was wounded, and received the [[Silver Star]]. Ernie was a member of the airborne, and parachuted into France on [[D-Day]]. Marty helped capture [[Ludendorff Bridge|the Bridge at Remagen]], Sam made a lot of money making plastic hoods for planes, and Harry fought as a naval flyer and shot down fifteen planes, two of which were attacking a troop transport. For his bravery Harry Bailey was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] by the U.S. president, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. While all of this happened, George served as an [[Air Raid Precautions|Air Raid Warden]]. Despite having to look after four children, Mary still had time to run the [[United Service Organizations]] in the town, and Mr. Potter became head of the draft board.

==Post war==

;Christmas Eve 1945

On Christmas Eve morning, Uncle Billy is on his way to the bank to deposit $8,000 of the Building &amp; Loan's cash funds. Holding a [[newspaper]] which has Harry on the front page he greets Potter saying, "Well, good morning, Mr. Potter. What's the news?" Billy grabs Mr. Potter's newspaper and says, "Well, well, well, Harry Bailey wins Congressional Medal. That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys? You just can't keep those Baileys down, now, can you, Mr. Potter?" Potter angrily snatches the paper, but Billy inattentively allows the money to be snatched with it. After returning to his office, Potter opens the paper, notices the money and keeps it, knowing that displacement of bank money would result in [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] for the Building &amp; Loan and criminal charges for George. Billy goes back to the Building &amp; Loan and tells George the news. George is extremely worried, especially with the bank examiner just outside the room. George and Billy go through the town taking every step Billy took in the morning and it goes to a dead end. George later goes home, and Mary knows straight away something is wrong with him. To add to his anger, he finds out his youngest daughter Zuzu has come home with a cold, George blames it on her teacher. When she calls he berates her on the phone, and her husband, as well. He then gets frustrated with his family and ends up smashing up the models of buildings and bridges he had made.

[[Image:Guardian angel clarence.jpg|155px|left|thumbnail|Henry Travers as guardian angel [[Clarence Odbody]], after "rescuing" George]]
A desperate George appeals to Potter for a loan. Potter sarcastically turns George down, and then swears out a warrant for his arrest for [[bank fraud]]. George, now completely depressed, gets drunk at the bar owned by his friend, Martini, where he silently prays for help. He also gets a  full punch to the face from Zuzu's teacher's husband, who is drinking there. Again George runs out, and drives his car into a tree. He comes to a bridge intending to commit suicide, feeling he is "worth more dead than alive" because of a life insurance policy. Before he can leap, another man jumps in first and pretends to be drowning. After George rescues him, the man reveals himself to be George's [[guardian angel]], [[Clarence Odbody]].

George does not believe him, and he bitterly wishes he had never been born. Inspired by this comment, Clarence shows George what the town would have been like without him, with the snow outside stopping as the change is made. In this alternative scenario Bedford Falls is instead named Pottersville, and is home to sleazy [[nightclub]]s, [[pawn shop]]s, and amoral people. Bailey Park was never built, and remains an old [[cemetery]]. Mr. Gower was sent to prison for poisoning the child and is despised and homeless. Martini does not own the bar. George's friend Violet Bick is a [[taxi-dancer]] who gets arrested. Ernie is hopelessly poor, with his family having forsaken him. Uncle Billy has been in an [[insane asylum]] for many years since he lost his brother and the family business. Harry is dead as a result of George not being there to save him from drowning, and the servicemen he would have saved also died. (A deleted scene exists in which George finds Martini's grave near Harry's, as Martini and his family died in a fire because they couldn't move out of Potter's slums.) Ma Bailey is a bitter widow, and Mary a shy, single [[spinster]] librarian.

[[File:It's A Wonderful Life.jpg|thumb|George, Mary and their youngest daughter Zuzu.]]
George runs back to the bridge and begs to be allowed to live again. His prayer is answered, shown as the snow restarts, and he runs home joyously, where the authorities are waiting to arrest him. Mary, Uncle Billy, and a flood of townspeople arrive with more than enough donations to save George and the Building &amp; Loan. George's friend Sam Wainwright sends him a $25,000 line of credit by [[telegram]]. Harry also arrives to support his brother, and toasts George as "The richest man in town". In the pile of donated funds, George finds a copy of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' inscribed, "Dear George: Remember no man is a failure who has friends. P.S. Thanks for the wings! Love, Clarence." A bell on the Christmas tree rings, and his daughter Zuzu says, "Teacher says every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings!" George agrees and looks up to [[heaven]] and says, "Attaboy, Clarence." George realizes that he truly has a wonderful life.

==Accolades==
Citing generosity as Bailey's most admirable trait, ''Time'' magazine lists George Bailey among their top ten movie dads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/15/best-men-the-top-10-movie-dads-wed-use-to-build-the-perfect-father/slide/george-bailey-its-a-wonderful-life/ Kim, Wook.

'''Henry Vinton Plummer, Jr.''' (b. 1876) was an American lawyer, real estate agent, civil rights activist, and black nationalist. In the 1920s he became involved in [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] (UNIA), leading the organizations publicity and propaganda wings, Garvey's secret service, and its militia.

==Early life and family==
Henry Vinton Plummer, Jr. was born in 1876 in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]] to [[Henry V. Plummer]], a [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister and future Army chaplain. Plummer's father was stationed at forts in the Western United States from 1884 to 1894, and Plummer attended schools in or near these forts. He attended high school in [[Wyoming]], where he was valedictorian of his class, in which he was the lone black student, graduating in 1889. He enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska]] from 1897–1900 and afterwards was admitted to the bar in [[Omaha]].&lt;ref name="Bair1988"&gt;Bair 1988 p419-420&lt;/ref&gt; Plummer's wife, Zora B. Rucker graduated from the [[Armour Institute]] in [[Chicago]] in about 1905 and worked as a lecturer in [[home economics]], often traveling throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16793726/to_show_south_value_of_gas_omaha_daily/ To Show South Value of Gas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124071043/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16793726/to_show_south_value_of_gas_omaha_daily/ |date=January 24, 2018 }}, ''Omaha Daily Bee'' (Omaha, Nebraska) February 11, 1909, page 5, accessed January 23, 2018 at [[Newspapers.com]] {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(also main article xliv. 413)&lt;/ref&gt; He died in France around March 1659.

==Biography==
Henry Percy, the younger son of [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]], was educated at a school at Isleworth, under Mr. Willis,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: Fontblanque, ''House of Percy'', ii. 368; Foster, ''Alumni Oxon''. 1st ser. p. 1146).&lt;/ref&gt;  and subscribed at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] on 7 December 1624.&lt;ref name=Alumni&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=119377  'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500-1714: Peach-Peyton', Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714 (1891), pp. 1131-1154.  Date accessed: 3 June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1628 he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Marlborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Marlborough]] and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to [[Personal Rule|rule without parliament for eleven years]]. On 21 March 1631 he unsuccessfully applied for the post of secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: ''Report on Lord Cowper's MSS''. i. 428).&lt;/ref&gt; Stratford designed to appoint him captain of a company in the Irish army, but the influence exerted for Lorenzo Gary frustrated the intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: ''Strafford Letters'', i. 128, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; As a courtier Percy was more fortunate; he obtained great influence with Queen [[Henrietta Maria]], and employed it to further the interests of his brother, the [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], and his brother-in-law, the [[Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: ''Strafford Letters'' i. 363; Collins, ''Peerage; Sydney Papers'', ii. 506, 527, 642).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1633 Percy acted as [[Jerome Weston, 2nd Earl of Portland|Lord Weston's]] friend in the quarrel between him and the [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland|Earl of Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: ''Cal. State Papers'', Dom. 1633-4, x. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His favour, however, continued to increase; in November 1639 he was appointed master of the horse to the Prince of Wales, and on 6 June 1640 he was appointed captain and [[governor of Jersey]] for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: Collins, ''Peerage'' (Brydges), ii. 344, ''Sydney Papers'', ii. 620).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1640, Percy was elected MP for [[Portsmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Portsmouth]] in the [[Short Parliament]]. He was elected MP for [[Northumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|Northumberland]] for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.  Percy was one of the originators of what was termed the "[[Army Plots (1641)|First Army Plot]]" in March 1641, but according to his own story simply designed to procure a declaration from the army in support of the king's policy, and was innocent of the plan to bring it up to London in order to put force on the parliament. When the plot was discovered he endeavoured to flee to France, but was set upon and wounded by the country people in Sussex, and remained for some time in hiding. To facilitate his own escape, he was induced to write a letter to his brother, giving an account of the conspiracy, which furnished the popular leaders with conclusive proof of the reality of the design, and was held by the Royalists to be a treacherous betrayal of his duty to the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: Claredon, ''Rebellion'', iii. 223, 228; Rushworth, iv. 255).&lt;/ref&gt; The sole punishment inflicted upon him for his share in the plot was his expulsion from the House of Commons, which took place on 9 December 1641.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: ''Commons' Journals'', ii. 337; Evelyn, ''Diary,'' ed. Wheatley, iv. 75).&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy went to France, but at the outbreak of the war made himself useful to Queen Henrietta Maria, who employed him as an agent to King Charles, and obtained his restoration to favour. "Truly", she wrote, "I think him very faithful, and that we may trust him". Thanks to her support, he became on 22 May 1643 general of the ordnance in the king's army, and was created on 28 June of the same year Baron Percy of Alnwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: Green, ''Letters of Henrietta Maria'', p. 138; Black, ''Oxford Docquets'', pp. 40, 52).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A volume of Percy's correspondence as general of the ordnance is preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]] ({{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: Rawlinson MS. D. 395).&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy fought at the [[Battle of Cropredy Bridge]] on  29 June 1644, and accompanied the king into Cornwall in his pursuit of the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]; but, having taken part in [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Henry Wilmot's]] intrigue to force the king to make peace, he fell into disgrace, and was obliged to resign his [[Sir Henry Bard's regiment of Foote|command]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=413}}. Cites: 14 August 1644; ''Diary of Richard Symonds'', p. 64).&lt;/ref&gt; "His removal" says Clarendon, "added to the ill-humour of the army; for though he was generally unloved as a proud and supercilious person, yet he had always three or four persons of good credit and reputation, who were esteemed by him, with whom he lived very well; and though he did not draw the good fellows to him by drinking, yet he eat well, which in the general scarcity of that time drew many votaries to him, who bore very ill the want of his table, and so Avere not without some inclination to murmur even on his behalf."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=414}}. Cites: ''Rebellion'', viii. 98).&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1645 Percy and two other Royalist peers were placed under arrest by the King on the charge of holding correspondence with his enemies and uttering disrespectful speeches, but in reality on account of the persistency with which they urged him to open negotiations with Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=414}}. Cites: Gardiner, ''Great Civil War'', ii. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Percy was released a few weeks later, and, having procured a pass from Essex, sought to take ship for the continent. On his way he was taken prisoner by [[William Waller]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]] at [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]]. Among Percy's party "there was a youth of so fair a countenance that Cromwell doubted of his condition, and, to confirm himself, willed him to sing, which he did with such a daintiness that Cromwell scrupled not to say to Lord Percy that being a warrior he did wisely to be accompanied by Amazons, on which that lord in some confusion did acknowledge that she was a damsel; this afterwards gave cause for scoff at the king's party".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=414}}.  Cites: ''Recollections by Sir William Waller'', 1788, p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; Percy arrived at Paris at the end of March 1645, and, though the King had cautioned the Queen not to trust him too much, was speedily as great a favourite with Henrietta as before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=414}}. Cites: ''Cal. State Papers'', Dom. 1644-5, pp. 372, 390, 483).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1648 he was wounded in a duel with [[Prince Rupert]], and in the following October was put under arrest for giving the lie to [[John Colepeper, 1st Baron Colepeper|Lord Colepeper]] in the presence of the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=414}}. Cites: ''Hamilton Papers'', i. 178; Whitelocke, ''Memorials'', ii. 423).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Percy belonged to the queen's party and to the faction of Secretary [[Sir Robert Long, 1st Baronet|Robert Long]], he is spoken of with great severity in the correspondence of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]] and [[Edward Nicholas]]. They regarded him as an atheist because he favoured [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], and advised Charles II to comply with the demands of the Presbyterians or any other party which would undertake to restore his throne. When he was made Lord Chamberlain and admitted to the Privy Council, their disgust knew no bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=414}}. Cites: ''Nicholas Papers'', i. 172, 213, 285, 293, ii. 18, 20, 113).&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde, however, was subsequently reconciled to Percy, who brought about a meeting between the queen and the chancellor of the exchequer, and is praised in the ''History of the Rebellion'' for his economical administration of the king's household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=414}}. Cites: ''History of the Rebellion'' xiv. 89, 93).&lt;/ref&gt; When Percy thought of making his peace with the Protector, Hyde dissuaded him, and told him that few men were so fit to be about the king's person, or engaged in the counsels likely to carry him home.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=414}}. Cites: ''Cal. Clarendon Papers'', iii. 161, 330).&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy died unmarried at Paris in France&lt;ref name=Alumni/&gt; in around March 1659.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1895|p=414}}. Cites: ''Cal. State Papers'', Dom. 1658-9, pp. 115, 335, 562).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isa Gendargenoevsky''' ([[Chechen language|Chechen]]: Iийса Гендаргно) (born 1784, [[Gendergen]], [[Chechnya]] – died 1845, [[Urus-Martan]], [[Chechnya]]) the famous Chechen commander of the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Kavkaz/XIX/1840-1860/Samil/Pisma2/text.htm АРАБСКИЕ ПИСЬМА ШАМИЛЯ ИЗ АРХИВА Б.

==Biography==
He was born in the mountainous Chechen village of Gendergen. When he was 10 years old, members of his family, persecuted by the bloodshed, left Gen- dergen and moved to Urus-Martan.

According to Yusup Elmurzayev, in the mid-10's. XIX century. despite his age, Isa was promoted to the leader of one of the detachments of Urus-Martan, and his role in the people's liberation struggle of the mountain people was already quite appreciable.

In the years 1820–1830, together with Beibulat Taimiev, took part in battles against the colonialists.
It is known that on February 27, 1826, Beibulat Taimiev, Ismaili Duda and Isa gave battle for Urus-Martan, which ended with the retreat of the Cossacks. Major battles with their participation took place in Urus-Martan and in 1831, and in August 1832 the village was attacked by 10 thousand army of Baron Rosen.

In 1834, Mr .. headed the shock forces of the Chechens, covering the main ways of the enemy movement. The talents shown to him brought him not only the glory of the commander, but also raised him to the very top of the hierarchical staircase of the imamate.

In early 1840, when the imam of Dagestan Shamil was defeated in Dagestan and moved to Chechnya, Isa was the first to volunteer to receive him. However, Shamil, as a guarantee of his security, demanded to send him hostages. The Urus-Martan people sent small children to Shamil. In an embarrassing situation, he presented the children and immediately returned them. March 7 in 1840, Shamil arrived in Urus-Martan. Together with him there were such famous personalities as Tashev-Hadji, Shoip Mulla,
Javatkhan from Dargo Akhberdil Muhammad, who appealed to Isa Gendergenoyevsky with an appeal to support the insurgents. The next day, on March 8, 1840, a congress of the Chechen people was held in Isa's house, where Shamil was proclaimed the imam of Chechnya and Dagestan.

During the period 1840–1842, Isa Hendergenoevsky acted under the leadership of Akhverdi-Magoma and, being his closest associate, took an active part in all the events he undertook. Imed by Isa at the same time, courage, enterprise and ability to get out of any difficult situations, created him a reputation as a gifted commander, put him among the most popular and influential figures of the Imamate.

1842 Isa was appointed naibom of Greater Chechnya, and his residence was determined by the village of Shali. After a while under the same management was transferred to the region of Auch, which previously constituted a self-pity. While in office, Isa, at the head of the troops entrusted to him, led the defense of Eastern and Central Chechnya, helped strengthen Shamil's power in Dagestan. The successes achieved in this process allowed Isa to enter the circle of the Imam's closest circle, to become his confidant. Being a general of the mountain army, he, in the opinion of the well-known Chechen writer and historian Abuzar Aydamirov, along with the naibs Shu'aib Mulla, Talhig Shalinsky, Goytemir, Akhverdi-Magoma, Yusup-Khadzhi and others, was the color of the Shamil general staff.

In 1843, after the death of Akhberdil Muhammad, Naib of Malaya Chechnya, which surpassed all the other high places in the territory and the number of inhabitants, Isa Hendergenoevsky was replaced in his place.

In 1845, Mr .. participated in the battle of Dargo. In this battle between the detachment of Isa Gendargenoy and the detachment of General Klugenau, the Russians lost 1,700 people killed and missing, including the Passek generals
and Viktorov.

In 1846, Isa continued to play a prominent role in the political life of the imamate and even distinguished himself with the famous campaign of the 10,000-strong Shamil army to Kabarda. But even then his name begins to disappear from official documents, and in subsequent years it is not mentioned in them at all.

'''James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Order of St Patrick|KP]], [[Privy Council of Ireland|PC (I)]] (23 August 1730 – 6 February 1798), was an [[Anglo-Irish]] peer, styled '''Viscount Limerick''' from 1756 to 1758.

Lord Clanbrassil was the son of [[James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil (1719)|James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil]], and Lady Harriet Bentinck. The Hamilton dynasty were an [[Ulster-Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] family by origin.

He sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as the Member of Parliament for [[Midleton (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Midleton]] between 1755 and 1758, and served as [[High Sheriff of Louth]] in 1757. On 17 March 1758, he succeeded to his father's titles and became [[Earl of Clanbrassil]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland: The peerage of Ireland'' (W. Owen [and 2 others], 1790), 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; As his title was in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], he was not barred from election to the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]]. As such, he served as the MP for [[Helston (UK Parliament constituency)|Helston]] from 1768 to 1774. On 4 July 1766 he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] and was ''[[Custos Rotulorum]]'' of County Louth between 1769 and 1798. On 5 February 1783 he was made a Knight of the [[Order of the Garter]] and on 11 March that year he was appointed a Knight Founder of the [[Order of St Patrick]].

'''John Willard'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717193305/http://willardfamilyassn.org/witch001.htm WFA Genealogy Report on John Willard], willardfamilyassn.org; accessed August 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the people executed for [[witchcraft]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], during the [[Salem witch trials]] of 1692. He was [[hanging|hanged]] on Gallows Hill, Salem on August 19, 1692.

At the time of the first allegations of witchcraft Willard was serving as a [[constable]] in the village of Salem and his duties included bringing the accused before the court. Soon, however, he began to doubt the truth of the accusations and in May 1692 he refused to make any more arrests. In retaliation [[Ann Putnam, Jr.]] and others accused him of witchcraft, and of murdering thirteen citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goss|first=K. D.|title=The Salem Witch Trials: a reference guide|publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, CT|date=December 30, 2007|pages=105–106|isbn=0-313-32095-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his in-laws made accusations. Benjamin Wilkins would tell the court that Willard had previously beat his wife. Samuel Wilkins testified that he had repeatedly been irritated and afflicted by something in a dark colored coat—and that it was John Willard. John Wilkins would blame the death of his wife, after having delivered a baby, on John Willard... [p]atriarch, Bray Wilkins, would say that he came down with his illness after John Willard had looked at him with an evil eye. Willard was found guilty of witchcraft on August 5, 1692. On August 19, 1692, he was hanged, along with [[John Proctor (Salem witch trials)|John Proctor]], [[George Burroughs]], [[George Jacobs, Sr.]], and [[Martha Carrier (Salem witch trials)|Martha Carrier]]. Willard maintained his innocence until the very end.&lt;ref name="legendsofamerica"&gt;[http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ma-johnwillard.html Profile of John Willard], legendsofamerica.com; accessed September 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Most of the information on John Willard's early life is relatively obscure. However, most scholars conclude that he probably came from Lancaster, MA. Indeed, it was Lancaster where Willard fled to after being accused of witchcraft. During his youth John Willard lived in Lancaster and worked under a Major Simon Willard, one of the most prominent Massachusetts land speculators of the mid-seventeenth century. Some scholars have concluded that John Willard was either the son, or grandson of Major Willard.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Salem Possessed: The Social Origins of Witchcraft|last=Boyer, Paul|first=Nissenbaum Stephen|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1974|isbn=0-674-78526-6|location=Cambridge,MA|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Devil Discovered: Salem Witchcraft 1692|last=Robinson|first=Enders A.|publisher=Hippocrene Books Inc|year=1991|isbn=0-87052-009-1|location=New York|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with the Wilkins Family ==
The Wilkins disapproved of John Willard immediately after Margaret Wilkins decided to marry him. This was partly due to Willard's chosen profession and the failure of a business venture by Bray Wilkins decades earlier. In 1658 Bray Wilkins, the future grandfather-in law of John, had teamed up with the father of his daughter-in-law, a tailor named John Gengell, to purchase, on credit, a 700 acre tract of land around Will's Hill. Soon Wilkins and Gengell put up houses and moved their entire families to the remote region. Wilkins and Gengell soon began logging  and timber-processing operations. At first the duo prospered, as one of Wilkins' son would boast to a friend that the family operation produced 20,000 barrel staves and 6,000 feet of boards. In terms of profitability, however, the operation was a marginal one. In 1661, Bray Wilkins, in an embarrassing episode, would be arrested and admit to stealing hay in order to feed his oxen with which he transported his timber to Salem Town. Later, his business would suffer an even greater setback during the winter of 1664-1665 when his house burned down. Eventually, Wilkins and Gengell would be unable to keep up with the mortgage payments and would return two-thirds of the land they had been attempting to purchase, however, even with the reduced mortgage they were still unable to pay their debts. In June 1666, Robert Bellingham, the man they had purchased the land from and the Royal governor of Massachusetts, won a foreclosure judgement against Wilkins and Gengell. Bellingham's lawyers would seize the stock of shingles and other goods that belonged to Wilkins and Gengell. After some time, Wilkins would pay off the mortgage and hang on to his land but the experience left him with the view that farming was the only reliable way to have a secure living. Thus, seeing one of his daughters marry a man who had interest in land speculation, made him uneasy. ''&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Nissenbaum, 1974, p. 196-197&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially after arriving at Salem Village, John Willard worked as a hired hand on the Putnam farm. One of his many tasks on the farm was looking after the young children living there. [[Ann Putnam, Sr.]] had recently given birth to a baby girl and Willard was usually asked to watch the infant. However, the infant, who was named Sarah, would die after a few months. The distraught parents would blame Willard for her untimely death. Despite this, the Putnams did not let the conflict affect their relationship with rest of the Wilkins clan. The Putnams and the Wilkins shared many similarities and experiences. Both families would band together in an attempt to break away from Salem Town and establish their own church in the village, and both families suffered setbacks from  mercantile enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Death in Salem: The Private Lives Behind the 1692 Witch Hunt|last=Foulds|first=Diane E.|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7627-8497-4|location=Guilford, Connecticut|pages=119–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accusations ==
Towards the end of April, after Willard had abandoned his post as a constable and publicly doubted the girls' accusations, Ann Putnam Jr. began to see visions of John Willard's specter. Willard's specter would reveal to her his culpability in several murders. Ann Jr. claimed that she told the apparition of John Willard "I am very sorry to see you so. You were the one that helped to tend me, and now you have come to afflict me." ''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1991, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; '' During her testimony, she would claim that Willard "sett (sic) upon me most dreadfully" and had admitted to her that "he had whiped (sic) my little sister Sarah to death and he would whip me to death if I would not write (sic) in his book." Ann Jr. would later see the apparition of her dead sister Sarah who was "crieing (sic) out for vengance (sic) against John Willard" along with the specter of "John Wilkins first wife" who also declared that Willard had caused her death (John Wilkins, the cousin of Willard's wife Margaret, wife Lydia died in January 1688) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Devil's Snare: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692|last=Norton|first=Mary Beth|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2003|isbn=0-375-70690-9|location=New York|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing about these disturbing reports, Willard would seek help from his wife's grandfather, [[Bray Wilkins]]. Wilkins would later testify that Willard, after Ann Jr. began to accuse him, "came my house greatly troubled" and wanted him and other villagers to pray for him. Wilkins would tell his grandson-in-law that unfortunately, he was on his way out for business but if Willard would come home before night then he would pray with him. Willard however was unable to make it before night and Wilkins would not honor the request for prayers. ''&lt;ref&gt;Norton, 2002, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Tuesday May 3, 1692, Willard asked his uncle-in-law Henry Wilkins (one of Bray's sons) to accompany him to Boston for election week. Henry's Son, Daniel Wilkins, who was seeing [[Mercy Lewis]] at the time, warned his father not to go with Willard saying "It would be well if Willard were hanged". Though he was taken back by the comment, Henry Wilkins decided to go with Willard anyway. At the same time Willard and Henry Wilkins were planning on going to Boston, Bray Wilkins had also made plans to travel there and was staying at his brother-in-law's house. Typically, many family members would meet there for dinner and on one of those nights Willard and Henry Wilkins would arrive. Upon Willard's entry to the home Bray would later testify that "Willard looked upon me in such a sort as I have never before discerned in anybody." Bray continued to suffer painful attacks throughout the day "I cannot express the misery I was in, for my water was suddenly stopped, and i had no benefit of nature, but was like a man on a rack" he told his wife "I am afraid that Willard has done me wrong". Meanwhile in Salem Village, Daniel Wilkins had also fallen ill. Dr William Griggs, who was attending young Daniel "affirmed that his sickness was by some preternatural cause, and would make no application of any physic". Mercy Lewis, who was also there, "affirmed that she saw the apparition of John WIllard afflicting Daniel. Quickly came Ann Putnam Jr, who also saw the same apparition attacking Daniel. Soon after this episode, Bray's son Benjamin Wilkins Sr. took legal action and charged John Willard with afflicting Bray and Daniel Wilkins. An Arrest warrant would soon be issued for John Willard.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1991, p. 183-184&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest ==
On May 11, 1692 a warrant was issued for the arrest of John Willard. John Putnam Jr, a constable who would search for Willard, reported that "I went to the house of the usual abode of John Willard and made search for him, and in several other houses and places but could not find him." John Willard had fled. Willard had escaped to Lancaster. After Willard's escape, Bray Wilkins, returned to his home in Salem Village. Once Wilkins arrived home, some friends came to see him including the afflicted Mercy Lewis. Lewis told Wilkins that she saw the apparition of John Willard on Wilkins' belly. Upon hearing this, Wilkins stated that he was in "grievous pain in the small of my belly". Lewis also stated that she saw Willard's apparition attacking Daniel Wilkins and "John Willard tells me he will kill him within two days." Mercy's prediction came true and two days later on May 16, 1692 Daniel Wilkins died. A second arrest warrant was issued. A short time afterwards constable John Putnam Jr. would capture John Willard attending to his meadows in Lancaster and bring him back to Salem Village. ''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1991, p. 184-185&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interrogation and Hanging ==
Once Willard was in custody, he was brought forth to undergo his examination. On May 18, 1692, the magistrates began to castigate him for fleeing by saying "That you were fled from Authority....is an acknowledgment of guilt....but yet notwithstanding we require you to confess the truth in this matter." Willard admitted that he believed "by my withdrawing it might be better" but also proclaimed that he was innocent. The magistrates confronted him with testimonies not only from the current afflictions that was happening in the village but also the dreadful murders he had been charged with, reading to him statements from Mercy Lewis, Ann Putnam Jr., and Susannah Sheldon. Other witnesses would also come forward and attack his character. Benjamin Wilkins Sr, testified that Willard "abused his wife much &amp; broke sticks about her in beating of her." Another man stated that Willard was "very cruel to poor creatures." After hearing this, Willard asked that his wife be called so that she can refute the charges, however, the justices denied his request. The justices next employed physical tests. When Susannah Shelton was asked to approach Willard she fell down immediately and explained that she could not go towards Willard because "the black man stood between us." Willard then took her hand, which drew no effect from Susannah. Next, Mary Warren was brought to Willard in a "great fit" he then clasped his hand upon her arm and she recovered from her fits. Willard, noticing the contradiction, asked the justices "why....was it not before so with Susannah Sheldon?" Those standing by would answer his question by claiming "because...you did not clasp your hand before."

At the close of his examination, the justices asked Willard to recite the Lord's prayer, which he could not do. Willard "laught" nervously and said "it is a strange thing, I can say it at another time. I think I am bewitcht as well as they," finally he declared "it is these wicked ones that do so overcome me." On August 5, 1692, John Willard was sentenced to death by hanging and on August 19, Willard along with George Burroughs, John Proctor, George Jacobs Sr, and Martha Carrier were hanged on Gallow's hill. ''&lt;ref&gt;Norton, 2002, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
Pairin began his active political career in 1975. He was elected a Member of the Sabah Legislative Assembly for the Tambunan electorate in 1976 under the [[Sabah People's United Front]] (BERJAYA) party ticket, a party which was led by [[Harris Salleh]] (Chief Minister 1976–1985) and was appointed as a Minister in the cabinet of the ruling party. [[Tambunan]] has become his stronghold ever since.

Over time, Pairin became disillusioned with the party's leadership, and opposed some of the party's policies. He felt that the party had deviated from its original struggle. He however, remained firm with the party and subsequently, he was forced to leave the ruling party coalition in 1984.

== Leadership ==
In December 1984, he challenged as an Independent candidate against the ruling party to defend his seat in the Tambunan by-election. His leadership in a state within a federation which had the official religion of Islam, was also questioned because of his religion. Pairin easily won and defended his seat with significant majority.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In March 1985, Pairin formed [[United Sabah Party|Parti Bersatu Sabah]] (PBS). Despite overwhelming odds, he succeeded in registering PBS as a political party in the eleventh hour; thus paving the way for the party to contest against the incumbent state government in the [[Sabah state election, 1985]] in April.

PBS won a majority of 25 out of the 48 seats contested in the [[Sabah state election, 1985|1985 state elections]]. However, BERJAYA and the [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO) joined forces submit their candidate as the chief minister, but after riots by BN followers, the newly formed coalition between BERJAYA and USNO was dissolved giving PBS the majority government.&lt;ref name=asiansurvey&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2644213|author=K. Ramanathan Kalimuthu|title=The Sabah State Elections of April 1985|publisher=Asian Survey, Vol. 26, No. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pairin was sworn in as the seventh Chief Minister of the state of Sabah. He held the post of Sabah Chief Minister from April 1985 to March 1994, during which he spearheaded his party's triumphant outings in four successive state elections (1985, 1986, 1990 and 1994).

In the [[Sabah state election, 1994|1994 state election]], PBS won the election, however shortly after being announced the winner, almost all PBS assemblymen [[defection|defected]] to Barisan Nasional. Pairin was not allowed to be sworn in as Chief Minister. [[Sakaran Dandai|Tun Sakaran Dandai]] of UMNO was then sworn to be the eighth Chief Minister of Sabah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New Straits Times |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/Columns/2086779/Article/index_html |author=Kalimullah Hassan |title=OPINION: Reforms yes, but not through violence in the streets |accessdate=18 January 2008 |date=18 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221225545/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/Columns/2086779/Article/index_html |archivedate=21 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2015, Pairin asserted a "clear connection of the incident to the [[2015 Sabah earthquake]] that has brought about so much damage and loss of lives" by a group of European nude tourists on Mount Kinabalu &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/pairin-naked-tourist-brought-on-mountains-wrath|title=Pairin: Naked tourist brought on mountain’s wrath|author=Julia Chan|publisher=The Malay Mail|date=6 June 2015|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pairin is also the ''Huguan Siou'' or Paramount Leader of the [[Kadazan-Dusun]] community for being the President of the [[Kadazandusun Cultural Association]] (KDCA), the community's principal cultural association. However, there is a growing concern that Pairin is no longer suitable to hold the Huguan Siou title and that he should give way to the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bobohizan.com/?p=1050|title=Pairin Need to Cease from becoming the Huguan Siou!|author=Bobohizan|publisher=Bobohizan Press|date=27 September 2015|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19264">'''Juvenile life insurance''' is [[permanent life insurance]] that insures the life of a child (generally under age 18). It is a financial planning tool that provides a tax advantaged savings vehicle with potential for a lifetime of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;http://juvenilelifeinsurance.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile life insurance, or [[child life insurance]], is usually purchased to protect a family against the sudden and unexpected costs of a funeral and burial with much lower face values. Should the juvenile survive to their college years it can then take on the form of a financial planning tool.

Life insurance policies for children became popular in the 19th century to pay funeral and burial costs during a time of high [[infant mortality]]. Initially controversial, life insurance for children eventually gained broad acceptance. Unlike traditional [[life insurance]], burial insurance policies were marketed typically to the poorer classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/podcasts/burial-clubs.htm|title=The National Archives|website=www.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mutual aid societies]] sponsored burial insurance policies for immigrants and religiously affiliated groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mutually Beneficial – The Guardian and Life Insurance In America. Robert E. Wright &amp; George David Smith. New York University Press 2004. Page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Such groups had their origins in ancient Rome, and were similar to [[burial societies]], common in England during the [[industrial revolution]] and Jewish communities since the 13th-14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Carroll, Spirits of the dead: Roman funerary commemoration in Western Europe (Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, funeral and burial policies ("child life insurance") typically have a face value ranging from $5,000 to $50,000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buy-globe-life.com/?gclid=CMfi0vunh6UCFQo65QodECPuQQ|title=Globe Life Official Site: $1* buys up to $100,000 life insurance|website=www.buy-globe-life.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gerberlife.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerberlife.com/gl/view/index.jsp|title=Life Insurance for the Whole Family - Gerber Life Insurance Company|website=Gerber Life Insurance Company|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101185115/http://www.gerberlife.com/gl/view/index.jsp|archivedate=2010-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not require a medical exam, and provide the owner of an unused policy the choice of a distribution of the accumulated cash value or the option to convert the policy into a permanent whole life policy.&lt;ref name="gerberlife.com"/&gt; There are several companies well known for promoting and offering child life insurance. Funeral and burial insurance is similar to [[whole life insurance]], but with lower face values, fewer rider options, and no [[medical underwriting]].

== Juvenile life insurance as a financial planning tool ==
In recent years, juvenile life insurance has become a popular college savings, lifetime savings, investment, and estate planning tool. It is increasingly popular with financial planners and insurance professionals for the following benefits:&lt;ref name="juvenilelifeinsurance.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juvenilelifeinsurance.org/what_is_it.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301014638/http://www.juvenilelifeinsurance.org/what_is_it.html |archivedate=2011-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Buildup of tax-deferred cash value inside the insurance policy.
*A policy can be fully paid in as little as five years.
*Flexible access to cash value. Cash can be withdrawn or received as a guaranteed loan at any time, without a credit check or lender approval.
*Face value is received free of income tax.
*In most states the cash value of a juvenile life insurance policy is protected from creditors and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Loury, The PPLI Solution (Bloomberg Press2005). Chapter 4, written by: Gideon Rothschild and Daniel S. Rubin. Pages 41-61.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If structured using a trust, the ultimate payout of a policy may not be subject to estate tax, or the public and contestable [[probate]] process.&lt;ref name="trustbuilders.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustbuilders.net/estate-taxes.asp|title=TrustBuilders Law Group|website=www.trustbuilders.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Can be funded using gift tax or generation-skipping tax exclusion amounts.

Most insurance carriers require that a parent have a life insurance policy in place prior to purchasing a policy for a child. A policy purchased for a child can have a face value up to half that in place for the parent (in New York it is up to a quarter of that which is in place for the parent up to the child's fifth year). A grandparent is eligible to purchase a policy for a grandchild with fewer limits.&lt;ref name="trustbuilders.net"/&gt;

=== Cash value ===
The growth of the cash value inside an insurance policy in a tax-deferred environment (through guaranteed [[interest]] and credited [[dividends]]) creates lifetime saving opportunities that can be used for any purpose: to pay for college, finance the purchase of a home, establish a supplemental source of retirement income, or provide security, maintenance and support for future generations.&lt;ref name="juvenilelifeinsurance.org"/&gt;

=== Premium ===
A juvenile life insurance policy typically requires a minimum of $700 of annual premium, which provides approximately $100,000 of face value. The policy owner may utilize the [[gift tax]] exclusion amount (up to $15,000 per person per year per child, in 2018) to help pay the annual premium and avoid gift tax liability. Face amounts for juvenile life insurance policies of this type range from $100,000 to $10,000,000.&lt;ref name="juvenilelifeinsurance.org"/&gt;

=== Guaranteed growth ===
Many insurance companies offer policies with a guaranteed [[interest]] rate plus a non-guaranteed [[dividend]]. Each insurance company’s dividend is determined by its claims, [[investment performance]], and administrative expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/insurance-dividend|title=Answers|website=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies have a record of consistently paying annual dividends for over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://financialballgame.com/2009/11/guardian-announces-2010-dividend-rate/&lt;/ref&gt; Several insurance companies offer the option of having a portion of the return based on the performance of an [[equity index]].&lt;ref name="juvenilelifeinsurance.org"/&gt;

=== Lifetime benefit ===
The tax-free buildup of guaranteed interest and non-guaranteed dividends within an insurance policy provides a source of funds that are accessible within a week, at any time, for any purpose, and without penalty. The policy owner (typically a parent) controls access to funds and their use. After a child has reached adulthood he or she can be given ownership and control of the policy or it can remain in a trust. In either case, it provides coverage to meet the future insurance needs of the child, and a source of cash for the child's family.&lt;ref name="juvenilelifeinsurance.org"/&gt;

=== Intergenerational wealth transfer ===
A grandparent or parent can pay the annual premiums for a juvenile life insurance policy using gift tax or generation-skipping tax excluded funds. The eventual face value will pass to the children or grandchildren of the insured income tax-free. Grandparents or parents wishing to reduce their taxable estate may choose to use juvenile life insurance, so that the cash value is not included in the grantor’s [[estate (law)|estate]]. If the policy is held by a trust, the face value may be excluded from the estate of the insured as well.&lt;ref name="juvenilelifeinsurance.org"/&gt;

=== Insurability ===
Many juvenile life insurance policies can be written without the need for a medical exam. In the case of larger policies, a doctor or insurance agent may have to confirm the age, sex, height, weight, and apparent healthiness of the child. There are optional riders to the basic policy that can add up to $2,000,000 of guaranteed coverage.&lt;ref name="juvenilelifeinsurance.org"/&gt;

=== Privacy ===
A policy owner is not required to disclose the existence of a policy to the insured. Furthermore the policy owner can determine when or if the insured is told of, or has access to, the cash value of a juvenile insurance policy.&lt;ref name="juvenilelifeinsurance.org"/&gt; 

If held within a [[trust law|trust]] the terms of the trust will govern access to, and use of policy funds. A juvenile life insurance policy in a trust may be free of estate taxes and not subject to the public and contestable [[probate]] process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.will-trust-probate.com/trust-living.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asset protection ===
A parent wishing to protect assets intended to benefit a child may purchase juvenile life insurance, as the cash value of a life insurance policy is usually protected by [[state law]] against [[creditors]] and [[lawsuits]].&lt;ref name="trustbuilders.net"/&gt;

=== Indexed juvenile life insurance and whole juvenile life insurance ===

Whole Juvenile Life is permanent [[whole life insurance]] that has a minimum guaranteed interest rate, plus a non-guaranteed dividend declared annually by the insurance company.

Indexed Juvenile Life is permanent [[universal life insurance]] that has cash value increases linked to the performance of an equity index (e.g., [[S&amp;P 500]]) up to a certain percentage (a “cap”) with downside protection (a “floor”).  Certain Indexed Juvenile Life products have a guaranteed minimum interest rate of up to 2%.

=== Example illustration ===
The illustration shown is a Whole Juvenile Life policy, based on a three-year-old girl and a 2010 dividend and interest scale (combined rate of 6.85%) of an insurance company rated AA+ by [[Standard &amp; Poor's|S&amp;P]] and [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Company: Guardian Life Insurance Company Of  America. Product: Whole life 99 policy. Parameters: 2010 dividend and interest scale, female aged 3. Annual contribution (premium and PUA combined) of $3,600.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual premium of $3,600 or monthly premium of $305 is paid into the policy from age three to age seventeen inclusive. The initial face value of the juvenile life insurance policy is approximately $500,000. 

When the insured is age eighteen, an annual withdrawal of $10,000 (shown in bold) for four years is illustrated. This is to pay for [[tuition]], room and board, and any other costs associated with [[college]]. When the insured is age thirty, the policy owner withdraws $14,000 (shown in italics) towards the wedding of the insured. Withdrawals can be used by the policy owner for any purpose.

The policy owner could transfer the policy to the newly married insured. The insured, who is now the owner of the policy, would be able to withdraw up to the remainder of the cash value ($56,565). If no withdrawals are taken, the designated beneficiaries are also protected by a fully paid policy of $500,275, which grows to $1,129,967 when the policy owner is eighty years old. Cash value would be $800,225 when the insured is eighty years old.

&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Criticisms and responses ===

Critics assert that juvenile life insurance is unnecessary due to the low likelihood of child mortality and that the insurance premiums should be used for other purposes. Proponents of juvenile life insurance argue that a well-structured policy minimizes the initial death benefit and maximizes cash value growth to provide a savings vehicle with a lifetime of benefit.

Critics also claim that investing in [[stocks]], [[bond (finance)|bonds]] or [[mutual funds]] can provide higher [[return (finance)|returns]] with lower [[fees]] than a comparable juvenile life insurance policy. Although juvenile life insurance is not an [[investment]] product, proponents point to many juvenile life insurance products where cash value is 100% linked to equity indexes. This allows a policy owner to participate in stock market growth and do this in a tax advantaged environment. In addition, some of these products offer a growth floor, meaning the cash value of a juvenile life insurance product will never decrease.

Some question the fees associated with life insurance products. They note that approximately half of the first year premium and an ongoing percentage of future premiums are paid as [[commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to the insurance agent. Juvenile life insurance advocates note that over the long term, management fees for other financial products typically will exceed juvenile life insurance policy commissions. For example in the illustration above, typical management fees of 1% annually would exceed, in every year following the 6th year, the $900–$1,800 one-time commission payment paid to the insurance agent.

=== Choosing a company ===

Life insurance is a promise between the policy owner and the insurance company. A life insurance policy is expected to perform many years into the future; therefore the long-term financial viability of a firm is important when selecting an insurance company. The credit rating of an insurance company can be used to determine the financial health of an insurance company. [[Moody’s]], [[A.M. Best Company]], [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]], and [[Standard and Poor’s]] provide such ratings.

== Taxation ==

=== Taxation of cash value ===
The cash value of a juvenile life insurance policy can be borrowed or withdrawn at any time. Borrowing using the policy as the sole collateral is typically not a taxable event, although interest must be paid or accrued. A withdrawal up to the cumulative premium (also known as basis) paid into a policy is not subject to taxation. Withdrawals over the cumulative premium are taxable in the year that the money is withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axa-equitable.com/life-insurance/plan/tax-free-withdrawals.html|title=Are withdrawals from a cash value life insurance policy ever tax free?|website=www.axa-equitable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://juvenilelifeinsurance.org/faq.html&lt;/ref&gt; If money is intended to be withdrawn, the policy is often transferred to the juvenile, who generally is in a lower income tax bracket than the policy owner.

=== Taxation of death benefit ===
Death proceeds of a juvenile life insurance policy are received by a beneficiary of the insured free of income tax. Proceeds are included in the estate of the deceased and may be subject to estate tax if the policy is not owned by a trust.

== Use of trusts ==

Trusts are used extensively in conjunction with many forms of life insurance. A trust, such as a Crummey trust, allows for the cash value of a juvenile life insurance policy to be withdrawn and used without incurring federal or state income tax. For example, a Crummey trust for the purpose of paying for college and providing lifetime benefits could function as follows: 

* Parents create a Crummey trust for the purpose of providing for a child’s health, education, maintenance or support.
* Parent A writes an annual check under the gift tax exclusion amount to the Trust for the insurance premium due. Parent B is the trustee authorized to administer the trust assets. The beneficiary must be given a chance to claim the gift of the premium. However, since the beneficiary is a minor, Parent B has 30 days to ‘claim’ the funds (on behalf of their child). Parent B signs a release to state that the funds will not be claimed and after 30 days the funds pass to the trust without any further action by either the parent or beneficiary.
* Trust receives annually a check from Parent A and pays the annual premium due.
* When the minor incurs educational costs, parent B, as the trustee, withdraws money from the cash value of the juvenile insurance policy to pay tuition, room and board, and other permitted costs. Later, funds may be used for ongoing education, maintenance and support.
*Policy remains in force for the life of the child.

In this scenario, neither the child nor the parent ever have “control” or “ownership” of the policy and therefore distributions are excluded from any gift tax or estate tax and will be received at the insured’s income tax rate. The cash value of the juvenile life insurance policy is generally not included in a financial-aid assessment since the policy is owned by the trust, and is not considered as an asset of either the parents or the insured.{{Citation needed|reason=A child's trust interest would generally be reported as an asset  on financial-aid assessments.|date=May 2017}}

== Life ==

Katherine was born in 1272 in [[Brimpsfield|Brimpsfield, Gloucestershire]], to [[John Giffard, 1st Baron Giffard]], the owner of [[Brimpsfield Castle]].

According to the [[antiquarian]] Rotha Mary Clay, Katherine gave away part of her maternal inheritance in 1312, and based on the location and signatory of the deed, it is likely she was already living in Ledbury and that the bishop had enclosed her as an anchoress in the church of St. Michael and All Angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clay |first1=Rotha Mary |title=The Hermits and Anchorites of England |date=1914 |publisher=Methuen |location=London |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1323, Katherine was receiving £30 a year through the sheriff of Ledbury, “the sums being paid,” according to Clay, “out of lands which were in the custody of her husband’s executor.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clay |first1=Rotha Mary |title=The Hermits and Anchorites of England |date=1914 |publisher=Methuen |location=London |page=74-75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay concluded that Katherine had made arrangements about her property in order to obtain a pension that would fund her life as an anchoress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clay |first1=Rotha Mary |title=The Hermits and Anchorites of England |date=1914 |publisher=Methuen |location=London |page=74-75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends have attributed clairvoyance and a miraculous power of prayer to Katherine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="CATHERINE, SAINT," in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 5, Slice 5, "Cat" to "Celt" |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33239/33239-h/33239-h.htm |website=Project Gutenberg |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clay |first1=Rotha Mary |title=The Hermits and Anchorites of England |date=1914 |publisher=Methuen |location=London |page=74-75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allies |first1=Jabez |title=Observations on Certain Curious Indentations in the Old Red Sand-Stone of Worcestershire and Herefordshire Considered as the Tracks of Antedeluvian Animals |date=1835 |publisher=William Edwards |location=London |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A woman Ledbury will never forget |url=https://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/7726572.A_woman_Ledbury_will_never_forget/ |website=Worcester News |publisher=Newsquest |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; One Ledbury legend has it that Katherine chose to come to Ledbury because a vision had shown her she must not rest until she arrived at a place where the church bells rang unaided. According to Rotha Mary Clay, the legend narrates that Katherine and her maid Mabel “wandered from place to place, following out of [[Worcestershire]] into [[Herefordshire]] the hoof-marks of [Katherine's] mare which had been stolen.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clay |first1=Rotha Mary |title=The Hermits and Anchorites of England |date=1914 |publisher=Methuen |location=London |page=74-75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquarian [[Jabez Allies]] recounted that, in the version of the legend he'd heard, Katherine had prayed in response to the theft, and both the thief's footprints and the horse's hoof-prints had become "deeply indented, not only in the earth, but also in the stones wherever they trod."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allies |first1=Jabez |title=Observations on Certain Curious Indentations in the Old Red Sand-Stone of Worcestershire and Herefordshire Considered as the Tracks of Antedeluvian Animals |date=1835 |publisher=William Edwards |location=London |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquarian later drew a sketch of the supposed marks, which he claimed to have found in the sandstone rocks of Whelpley Brook in Herefordshire and which the locals called the "tracks of St. Catherine's Mare and Colt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allies |first1=Jabez |title=Observations on Certain Curious Indentations in the Old Red Sand-Stone of Worcestershire and Herefordshire Considered as the Tracks of Antedeluvian Animals |date=1835 |publisher=William Edwards |location=London |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed that local people also said the marks in the stones were a "representation of the loaves which Saint Catherine used to give to the poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allies |first1=Jabez |title=Observations on Certain Curious Indentations in the Old Red Sand-Stone of Worcestershire and Herefordshire Considered as the Tracks of Antedeluvian Animals |date=1835 |publisher=William Edwards |location=London |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stones themselves were for many years used by local people as charms or safeguards against robbery, and according to the [[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|Saturday Review]], people continued to believe the story of Katherine and her mare into the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title="The Origin of Local Tradition," in The Saturday Review, vol. 46 |date=November 16, 1878 |publisher=John W. Parker and Son |location=London |page=619 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAxjOcOaaTQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA619#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Having continued her journey and reached the village of [[Bosbury]], Katherine heard the bells ringing and sent Mabel to identify the cause. She said she knew "she was to end her days at some place whose name terminated with bury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allies |first1=Jabez |title=Observations on Certain Curious Indentations in the Old Red Sand-Stone of Worcestershire and Herefordshire Considered as the Tracks of Antedeluvian Animals |date=1835 |publisher=William Edwards |location=London |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Mabel returned and said the bells were being rung for a wedding, Katherine said this was not the place, and they continued on their journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allies |first1=Jabez |title=Observations on Certain Curious Indentations in the Old Red Sand-Stone of Worcestershire and Herefordshire Considered as the Tracks of Antedeluvian Animals |date=1835 |publisher=William Edwards |location=London |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only upon reaching Ledbury that Katherine finally heard the church bells ringing of their own accord and decided to remain “under the shadow of the bell-tower” as an anchoress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clay |first1=Rotha Mary |title=The Hermits and Anchorites of England |date=1914 |publisher=Methuen |location=London |page=74-75}}&lt;/ref&gt; After building a hermitage at the church, she was said to have lived on herbs and milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parr |first1=Frank |title="Katherine Audley, of Ledbury," in The Antiquary, vol. 3 |date=1881 |publisher=E. Stock |location=London |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend, repeated in the [[Worcester News]], suggests that the fortunes of the town of Ledbury are linked to a prophecy of Katherine's:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Legend has it that, before her death, [Katherine] declared that the door to the [St. Katherine] chapel should never be opened by human hands, but should always be allowed to open by itself. If this direction had been followed, Ledbury would have become "the richest town in England." But drunken revellers disobeyed her instructions, and the town had to make do with a more modest, though not an unprosperous future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A woman Ledbury will never forget |url=https://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/7726572.A_woman_Ledbury_will_never_forget/ |website=Worcester News |publisher=Newsquest |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Cult ===

The Chapter House of St. Michael and All Angels Church in Ledbury may have been built as a shrine to Katherine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Church |url=http://www.ledburyparishchurch.org.uk/history.html |website=Ledbury Parish Church, St. Michael and All Angels |publisher=St Michael &amp; All Angels Ledbury |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] mentioned the following feast day of a "St Catherine Audley": "In Celtic and English martyrologies (November 25) there is also commemorated St Catherine Audley (c. 1400), a recluse of Ledbury, Hereford, who was reputed for piety and clairvoyance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="CATHERINE, SAINT," in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 5, Slice 5, "Cat" to "Celt" |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33239/33239-h/33239-h.htm |website=Project Gutenberg |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rotha Mary Clay has suggested that Katherine's sainthood came about as a result of confusion between her identity and that of Catherine of Alexandria, for whom a chapel, hospital, and almshouse in the town were named many years before Katherine de Audley was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clay |first1=Rotha Mary |title=The Hermits and Anchorites of England |date=1914 |publisher=Methuen |location=London |page=74-75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wordsworth's sonnet ==

In 1835, Wordsworth wrote the sonnet “St. Catherine of Ledbury” after taking a trip to Ledbury from [[Brinsop Court]] in Herefordshire, 20 miles away, where he was staying with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A woman Ledbury will never forget |url=https://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/7726572.A_woman_Ledbury_will_never_forget/ |website=Worcester News |publisher=Newsquest |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The poem immortalized the legend of Katherine and the bells:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
ST. CATHERINE OF LEDBURY 
When human touch (as monkish books attest)
Nor was applied nor could be, Ledbury bells
Broke forth in concert flung adown the dells,
And upward, high as Malvern's cloudy crest;
Sweet tones, and caught by a noble lady blest
To rapture! Mabel listened at the side
Of her loved mistress; soon the music died.
And Catherine said, Here I set up my rest.
Warned in a dream, the wanderer long had sought
A home that by such miracle of sound
Must be revealed: she heard it now, or felt
The deep, deep joy of a confiding thought;
And there, a saintly anchoress, she dwelt
Till she exchanged for heaven that happy ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wordsworth |first1=William |title=St. Catherine of Ledbury |url=https://www.bartleby.com/270/1/222.html |website=Bartleby |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence Clive Shove''' (5 November 1923 – 2 April 1995) was a British [[sound recordist]], specialising in field recordings of wildlife.

The "Shove collection of British wildlife" at the [[National Sound Archive]] (NSA), part of the [[British Library]] comprises 243 reels of his recordings, on [[magnetic tape]].&lt;ref name="NSA-1"&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 1997|title=Acquisitions 1995-6|journal=Wildlife Section Newsletter|publisher=tional Sound Archive/ British Library|issue=1|page=2|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/wildsounds/newsletter/wildnews1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Shove was one of the first contributors to the NSA's wildlife collection, and their wildlife recording number 00001 is his 1966 recording of a [[Eurasian bittern]] at [[Hickling Broad]], in Norfolk.&lt;ref name="NSA-1" /&gt; The NSA acquired his complete collection of wildlife recordings in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="NSA-1" /&gt;

In 1968, he was described by the BBC as "the only full-time freelance recordist of wildlife sounds in Britain".&lt;ref name="LOOK"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/626158a655d74db78369e0ada84532e1|title=LOOK|date=23 May 1968|work=[[BBC Online]]|page=19|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the subject of a BBC television ''[[The World About Us]]'' episode, screened on 9 April 1972,&lt;ref name="TWAU"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/48d8dbbf678b49d892a3dfaf7f5f5ec8|title=The World About Us|date=6 April 1972|work=[[Radio Times]]|page=23|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared on several other BBC television and radio programmes in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Genome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=0&amp;q="Lawrence+Shove"&amp;media=all&amp;yf=1923&amp;yt=2009&amp;mf=1&amp;mt=12&amp;tf=00%3A00&amp;tt=00%3A00#search|title=Search Results - Lawrence Shove|work=[[BBC Genome Project]]|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, he was manager of the [[Minack Theatre]], [[Porthcurno]], Cornwall.

The NSA have put most of Shove's recordings online, and as of November 2013 will extend access as part of a [[Europeana]] project.&lt;ref name="Tipp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/sound-and-vision/2013/11/europeana-creative-the-wildlife-recordings-of-lawrence-shove.html|title=Europeana Creative: the wildlife recordings of Lawrence Shove|last=Tipp|first=Cheryl|date=2013-11-01|work=Sound and vision blog|publisher=National Sound Archive/ British Library|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} '''Merle Sande'''(September 2, 1939 – November 4, 2007) was a leading American infectious-diseases expert whose early recognition of the looming public health crisis posed by [[HIV|AIDS]] led to the development of basic protocols for how to handle infected patients. He graduated from [[Washington State University]] and received his MD degree from the [[University of Washington]], School of Medicine in Seattle.
Sande was a professor of Internal Medicine from 1971–1980 at the [[University of Virginia]], where he performed research in mice on bacterial [[meningitis]] therapies such as novel antibiotics and corticosteroids. Dr Sande was Chief of Medical Services at [[San Francisco General Hospital]] in 1981 when he recognized a pattern of gay men being admitted with the rare [[pneumocystis]] pneumonia. His efforts on behalf of these patients resulted in the formation of an AIDS ward at [[San Francisco General Hospital]] and later an AIDS outpatient clinic. Teaming with such experts as [[Julie Gerberding]] and [[Paul Volberding]] he helped to craft what became known as the ''San Francisco model'' of AIDS therapy, a comprehensive, rational approach to care that avoided the fear and paranoia surrounding the disease at that time. The model addressed a need for infection-control guidelines, clinical studies and research financing and became a template for AIDS centers nationwide. Sande helped found to the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, which performed trials on some of the first anti-retrovirals such as [[zidovudine]]. He also helped to found the [[Infectious Diseases Institute]] at the [[Makerere University]] College of Health Sciences in [[Kampala]], Uganda a major center for HIV education and research in Africa. Sande was a professor of Medicine at [[University of California, San Francisco]] from 1980–1996, chairman of the department internal medicine at [[University of Utah]] from 1996–2005 and Professor of medicine at [[University of Washington]] from 2005 until his death and president of the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] from 1993–4. He was also the editor of two highly regarded medical references "The Medical Management of AIDS." and "The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy". He also gave the always popular and well attended annual update in Infectious Diseases at the [[American College of Physicians]] annual meeting as well as the clinical case presentations at the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] annual meeting.
Sande died from complications of [[Multiple Myeloma]] in 2007.

'''Michael Louis Doucet''' (born February 14, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter and musician best known as the founder for the Cajun band [[BeauSoleil]].

==Career==
Doucet was born in [[Scott, Louisiana|Scott]], Louisiana. He learned banjo at age six, guitar at eight, and belonged to a Cajun rock band with his cousin, [[Zachary Richard]], at twelve. In his early 20s, Doucet and his cousin went to France, and when he got home he added violin to his music studies. Violin became his primary instrument, though he also plays accordion and mandolin.&lt;ref name="Humphrey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humphrey|first1=Mark A.|title=Michael Doucet|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-doucet-mn0000886101/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he started the Cajun band Coteau, and two years later he started [[BeauSoleil]] with Kenneth Richard and Sterling Richard. Beausoleil plays an eclectic combination of traditional [[Cajun music]], blues, country, jazz, and [[zydeco]]. Doucet has been a member of a more traditional Cajun band, the Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band with [[Ann Savoy]] and [[Marc Savoy]], and Fiddlers 4 with [[Darol Anger]], [[Rushad Eggleston]], and [[Bruce Molsky]]. He began teaching in 1977 at the University of Southwestern Louisiana.&lt;ref name="Humphrey" /&gt;

==Awards and honors==
[[File:AccordionMichaelDoucet.jpg|thumb|upright|Doucet on accordion]]
In 1975, Doucet received an NEA Folk Arts Apprenticeship Grant to study Cajun fiddle styles from masters such as [[Varise Conner]], Hector Duhon, [[Canray Fontenot]], Lionel LeLeux, and [[Dennis McGee]].

Doucet is a recipient of a 2005 [[National Heritage Fellowship]] awarded by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/year/2005 |title=NEA National Heritage Fellowships 2005 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;  |website=www.arts.gov |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |access-date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Humphrey" /&gt; Two years later, he was named a USA Collins Family Foundation Fellow and awarded a $50,000 grant by [[United States Artists]], a public charity that supports and promotes the work of American artists.

In the 1980 presidential election, she voted for [[Ronald Reagan]] and worked for his campaign.&lt;ref name="GOP-09-07-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =Zoe | last =Sandvig | title =High-minded and high-heeled|date=October 4, 2008 | website=[[World (magazine)|World]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011| url = http://www.worldmag.com/articles/14445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her political activism gained media attention at a pro-life protest in 1991. She and approximately 30 other pro-life citizens went to a [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] Board meeting where a $3&amp;nbsp;million appropriation was to go to build a morgue for the county at St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center (now [[Regions Hospital]]). The Medical Center performed abortions and employed [[pro-choice]] activist [[Jane Elizabeth Hodgson|Jane Hodgson]]. Bachmann attended the meeting to protest public tax dollars going to the hospital; speaking to the ''Star Tribune'', she said that "in effect, since 1973, I have been a landlord of an abortion clinic, and I don't like that distinction".&lt;ref name=CP20050223 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Pat (December 18, 1991), "Abortion issue clouds med center lease plan", ''Star Tribune'' (Minneapolis, MN)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, she and other parents started the K-12 New Heights Charter School in Stillwater. The publicly funded school's charter mandated that it be non-sectarian in all programs and practices, but the school soon developed a strong Christian orientation. Parents of students at the school complained and the superintendent of schools warned Bachmann that the school was in violation of state law. Six months after the school's founding Bachmann resigned and the Christian orientation was removed from the curriculum, allowing the school to keep its charter.&lt;ref name="dailybeast614"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/06/14/michele-bachmanns-unrivaled-extremism-gay-rights-to-religion.html | title=Bachmann's Unrivaled Extremism | website=[[Daily Beast]] | date=June 14, 2011 | accessdate=June 23, 2011 | author=Goldberg, Michelle | authorlink=Michelle Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lizza|first=Ryan|title=Leap of Faith: The making of a Republican front-runner|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/15/110815fa_fact_lizza?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all|accessdate=August 10, 2011|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT622"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/us/politics/22bachmann.html?_r=0| title=Roots of Bachmann's Ambition Began at Home | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 21, 2011 | accessdate=April 26, 2015 | author=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann began speaking against a state-mandated set of educational standards, which propelled her into the world of politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Full Transcript: Michele Bachmann Speaks To NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/29/137496659/full-transcript-michele-bachmann-speaks-to-npr|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=August 14, 2011|date=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachmann became a critic and opponent of Minnesota's [[School-to-work transition|School-to-Work]] policies. In a 1999 column, she wrote: "School-to-Work alters the basic mission and purpose of K-12 academic education away from traditional broad-based academic studies geared toward maximizing intellectual achievement of the individual. Instead, School-to-Work utilizes the school day to promote children's acquisition of workplace skills, viewing children as trainees for increased economic productivity."&lt;ref name="MB99"&gt;{{cite web | last =Bachmann | first =Michele | title = School-to-Work: The Heart of Educational Reform| publisher=Minnesota Family Institute |date=October 8, 1999 | url = https://groups.yahoo.com/group/mn-politics-announce/message/412 |accessdate=November 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1999, she and four other Republicans were candidates, as the "Slate of Five", in an election for the school board of Stillwater. All five lost.&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt;

==Minnesota Senate==
In 2000, Bachmann defeated 18-year incumbent [[Gary Laidig]] for the Republican nomination for State Senator for Minnesota District 56. In the November 2000 general election, she defeated Ted Thompson of the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL) and Lyno Sullivan of the [[Minnesota Independence Party]], to win the seat. Two years later, in November 2002, after redistricting due to the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], Bachmann defeated another incumbent, State Senator Jane Krentz of the DFL, in the newly drawn State Senate District 52. In office, Bachmann's agenda focused on the cultural conservative issues of opposition to abortion and gay marriage.&lt;ref name=Roots /&gt;

=== Same-sex marriage constitutional amendment ===
On November 20, 2003, Bachmann and Representative [[Mary Liz Holberg]] proposed a constitutional amendment that would bar the state from legally recognizing [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="ST-11-21-03"&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Brunswick | title = Keeping gay marriage outside law; Legislators propose constitutional prohibition|date=November 21, 2003 |work=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Bachmann and a coalition of religious leaders announced plans for a "Minnesota for Marriage" rally.&lt;ref name="ST-03-12-04"&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Brunswick | title = Same-sex marriage bill heads to House floor|date=March 12, 2004 |work=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann's effort to place a marriage amendment on a referendum ballot in 2004 ultimately failed.

=== Assistant Minority Leader ===
In November 2004, Republican Senate Minority Leader [[Dick Day]] appointed Bachmann as Assistant Minority Leader in charge of Policy for the Senate Republican Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=St. Paul Pioneer Press | title = Minnesota Bachmann named to Senate post |date=November 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, the Republican Caucus removed her from her leadership position. Bachmann said that disagreements with Day over her anti-tax stance were the reason for her ouster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bachmann's Anti-Tax, Pro-Life Stance Leads To Ouster From Senate Leadership | publisher=Michele Bachmann for U.S. Congress |date=July 20, 2005 | url = http://www.michelebachmann.com/article.asp?ARTICLEID=29 |accessdate=December 16, 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061213205607/http://www.michelebachmann.com/article.asp?ARTICLEID=29| archivedate = December 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. House of Representatives==
From January 2007 to January 2015 Bachmann represented {{ushr|MN|6}}, which includes the northernmost and eastern suburbs of the [[Twin Cities]] and [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]]. She is the first Republican woman to be elected to the U.S. House from Minnesota.&lt;ref name="USHRBio" /&gt;

===110th Congress===

====Foreign affairs====
In January 2007, a resolution was approved in the House of Representatives opposing [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|plan to increase troop levels]] in [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Bachmann voted "No". But before supporting the proposed surge, Bachmann called for a full hearing, saying, "The American people deserve to hear and understand the merits of increasing U.S. troop presence in Iraq. Increased troop presence is justifiable if that measure would bring a swift conclusion to a difficult conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Diaz |first=Kevin |title=Minnesota delegation offers cool response |website=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis|date=January 8, 2007 |url=http://www.startribune.com/587/story/923881.html |accessdate=January 9, 2007}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hesitated to give a firm endorsement, calling the hearings "a good first step in explaining to the American people the course toward victory in Iraq".&lt;ref name="weighs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota delegation weighs in on Bush plan for more troops|first=Brady|last=Averill|url=http://www.startribune.com/587/story/931746.html|work=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis|date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=January 15, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pressed, she said she had not come to any conclusion on the matter,&lt;ref name="weighs" /&gt; saying, "I don't believe we have all of the information in front of us.

===== Member of Congressional delegation =====
In July 2007, Bachmann joined a Congressional delegation visiting [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Pakistan]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Iraq]]. Bachmann met briefly (due to security concerns) with U.S. personnel in the [[Green Zone]] and upon her return she said she "was encouraged by reports of progress from Crocker, Gen. David Petraeus and other personnel in Iraq linked to the surge".&lt;ref name="Bach and Croc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bachmann: Surge needs time|url=http://www.sctimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070710/NEWS01/107090061/1009|first=Lawrence|last=Schumacher |date=July 10, 2007|work=St. Cloud Times}}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said the surge "hasn't had a chance to be in place long enough to offer a critique of how it's working. (Gen. Petraeus) said [[al-Qaida in Iraq]] is off its plan and we want to keep it that way. The surge has only been fully in place for a week or so."&lt;ref name="Bach and Croc" /&gt;

Bachmann also spoke of the delegation's visit to [[Islamabad]] to meet [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Pakistani Prime Minister]] [[Shaukat Aziz|Aziz]] at the same time as the [[Lal Masjid siege|siege of Islamic fundamentalists]] at the [[Lal Masjid, Islamabad|Lal Masjid]] mosque elsewhere in the city.&lt;ref name="Bach and Croc" /&gt; She reported that "The group [of U.S. Legislators] had to travel in armored vehicles and was constantly accompanied by Pakistani military&amp;nbsp;... We were all able to see extremely up close and personal what it's like to be in a region where fighting is occurring. We constantly felt like we were in need of security."&lt;ref name="Bach and Croc" /&gt; Bachmann told reporters upon her return that "the dangers posed by Islamic terrorism in Iraq, Britain and Pakistan justified the continued American military presence in Iraq."&lt;ref name="Bach and Croc" /&gt; She said "We don't want to see [[al-Qaida]] get a presence in the United States. Al-Qaida doesn't seem to show any signs of letting up. We have to keep that in mind."&lt;ref name="Bach and Croc" /&gt;

====Higher education====
On July 11, 2007, Bachmann voted against the College Cost Reduction and Access Act that raised the maximum [[Pell grant]] from $4,310 to $5,200, lower interest rates on subsidized student loans to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent, raise loan limits to $30,500 from $7,500, disfavor married students who file joint tax returns, provide more favorable repayment terms to students who fail to use their education to prosper financially&lt;ref&gt;University of Michigan Law School, [http://www.law.umich.edu/currentstudents/financialaid/Documents/ccrafaq.pdf CCRA faq's] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310122835/http://www.law.umich.edu/currentstudents/financialaid/Documents/ccrafaq.pdf |date=March 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and favor public sector over private sector workers with much more favorable loan forgiveness benefits.&lt;ref&gt;FinAid [http://www.finaid.org/loans/publicservice.phtml guide to financial aide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104053645/http://www.finaid.org/loans/publicservice.phtml |date=November 4, 2016 }} (obtained April 19, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the bill said "it would allow more students to attend college".&lt;ref name="Pell"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bachmann votes against Pell grants bill| first=Pamela| last= Brogan| work=St. Cloud Times|date=July 12, 2007|url=http://www.sctimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070712/NEWS01/107110049/1009}}{{Dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann said her opposition was because "it fails students and taxpayers with gimmicks, hidden costs and poorly targeted aid. It contains no serious reform of existing programs, and it favors the costly, government-run direct lending program over nonprofit and commercial lenders."&lt;ref name="Pell"/&gt; The bill passed the House&lt;ref name="Pell"/&gt; and was signed by President Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fact Sheet: College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007|date=September 27, 2007|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/09/20070927-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy and environment====
During the summer of 2008, as national gasoline prices rose to over $4 a gallon, Bachmann became a leading Congressional advocate for increased domestic oil and natural gas exploration in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (ANWR) and the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Bachmann seeks House vote on oil exploration|first=Kevin|last=Diaz|work=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis|date=July 29, 2008|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/26081114.html| accessdate =January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined ten other House Republicans and members of the media on a Congressional Energy Tour to the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] in [[Golden, Colorado]], and to Alaska. The trip was set up by Arctic Power, an Alaskan [[lobbying]] group that advocates for [[ANWR drilling|ANWR development]]. The purpose of the trip was to receive a firsthand account of emerging renewable energy technologies and the prospects of increased domestic oil and natural gas production in Alaska, including ANWR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean |last=Cockerham |title=GOP Hopefuls get close look at ANWR |work=[[Anchorage Daily News]] |date=July 18, 2008 |url=http://www.adn.com/2008/07/18/468146/gop-hopefuls-get-close-look-at.html |accessdate=May 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504184642/http://www.adn.com/2008/07/18/468146/gop-hopefuls-get-close-look-at.html |archivedate=May 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachmann has said that [[global warming]] is "all voodoo, nonsense, hokum, a hoax"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scheck|first1=Tom|title=Bachmann doesn't like McCain or global warming|url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2008/03/bachmann_doesnt/|accessdate=April 12, 2016|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called "one of the GOP's loudest global warming skeptics".&lt;ref&gt;Diaz, Kevin; McAuliffe, Bill (May 3, 2009).

Retrieved January 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She has said that [[carbon dioxide]] is "a natural byproduct of nature" and a beneficial gas required by plant life. She stated that because life requires carbon dioxide and it is part of the planet's life cycle, it cannot be harmful. In a statement she made on the House floor on [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2009, Bachmann stated she was against the [[cap and trade]] climate legislation, stating: "Carbon dioxide is not a harmful gas, it is a harmless gas. Carbon dioxide is natural; it is not harmful&amp;nbsp;... We're being told we have to reduce this natural substance to create an arbitrary reduction in something that is naturally occurring in the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmelzer |first=Paul |title=On climate science, Bachmann accused of 'making things up' on the House floor |website=[[Center for Independent Media|Minnesota Independent]] |date=April 24, 2009 |url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/33294/on-climate-science-bachmann-accused-of-making-things-up-on-the-house-floor |accessdate=July 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630061044/http://minnesotaindependent.com/33294/on-climate-science-bachmann-accused-of-making-things-up-on-the-house-floor |archivedate=June 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008 Bachmann introduced H.R. 849, the [[U.S. Lighting Energy Policy#Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act|Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act]]. The bill would have repealed two sections of the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] signed into law by [[George W. Bush]]. The 2007 Energy Act mandates energy efficiency and labeling standards for [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent]] and [[Fluorescent light bulb|fluorescent bulbs]]. Bachmann's bill would have required the [[Government Accountability Office]] to show that a change to fluorescent bulbs would have "clear economic, health and environmental benefits" before enforcing lighting efficiency regulations. The bill would have allowed these standards to remain in place if the comptroller general found they would lead to consumer savings, reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and pose no health risks to consumers (such as risks posed by the presence of mercury in fluorescent bulbs). The bill languished in the House and became inactive at the end of the 110th Congress. Bachmann reintroduced the bill in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kasperowicz |first=Pete |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/147007-bachmann-let-there-be-incandescent-light |title=Bachmann: Let there be (incandescent) light – The Hill's Floor Action |publisher=Thehill.com |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20038472-503544.html |title=Bachmann to Democrats: Don't tell Americans what light bulbs to buy – Political Hotsheet |publisher=CBS News |date= March 2, 2011|accessdate=December 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211125743/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20038472-503544.html|archivedate=February 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetthe112th.com/latest-news/bachmann-reintroduces-light-bulb-freedom-of-choice-act/ |title=Bachmann reintroduces Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act |publisher=Meet the 112th |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426023437/http://www.meetthe112th.com/latest-news/bachmann-reintroduces-light-bulb-freedom-of-choice-act/ |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lawsuit reform====
On June 3, 2008, President Bush signed the Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act (H.R. 4008) into law. The bipartisan bill, which Bachmann cosponsored with Congressman [[Tim Mahoney]] (D-[[Florida|Fla.]]), removes statutory damages for violations of a 2003 federal law prohibiting merchants from printing consumers' credit card numbers and expiration dates on sales receipts, in order to end [[class-action]] lawsuits aimed at businesses that violated the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bachmann helps simplify credit card math|work=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis|first=Kevin|last=Diaz|date=June 3, 2008|url=http://politicalblogs.startribune.com/bigquestionblog/?p=1016|accessdate=January 23, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817094406/http://politicalblogs.startribune.com/bigquestionblog/?p=1016|archivedate=August 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financial sector====
Bachmann opposed both versions of the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Wall Street bailout bill]] for America's financial sector.

She voted against the first proposed $700&amp;nbsp;billion bailout of financial institutions, which failed to pass, 205–228. She also advocated breaking up [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] and barring executives from excessive compensation or [[golden parachute]]s, and advocated a plan that would suspend [[mark-to-market]] accounting rules and suspend the [[capital gains tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Bachmann Statement on the Failure of the Bailout Bill| publisher=The Office of Rep.

====Auto industry====
{{See also|Effects of the 2008–10 automotive industry crisis on the United States}}
The American auto companies approached Congress to ask for roughly $15&amp;nbsp;billion in loans to keep them operational into 2009. Bachmann criticized that bill, fearing that the initial sum of money would be followed by subsequent ones without the companies making changes to revive their business. Bachmann supported an alternative rescue for the American auto companies and the rest of the auto industry that would have set benchmarks for reducing their debt and renegotiating labor deals and have set up the financial assistance as interim insurance instead of a taxpayer-financed bailout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Bachmann Opposes Auto Industry Bailout| publisher=The Office of Rep.

On October 17, 2008, Bachmann gave an interview on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' in support of the presidential campaign of Senator [[John McCain]] that brought the Minnesota 6th Congressional District race national attention. During the interview she criticized [[Barack Obama]] for his association with [[Jeremiah Wright]] and [[Bill Ayers]], saying "...&amp;nbsp;usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are&amp;nbsp;... I am very concerned that he [Barack Obama] may have [[anti-American]] views." She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by [[Bill Ayers]] before discussing his association with Obama, arguing that "Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with."&lt;ref name="October 17, 2008"&gt;{{Cite AV media|publisher=msnbc.com|title=Interview with Rep.

How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?" Bachmann answered, "What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look&amp;nbsp;... I wish they would&amp;nbsp;... I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they pro-America, or anti-America.

Bachmann brought up the interview before business leaders and Republicans during a campaign stop in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]], on October 21, 2008. She stated that she never intended to question Obama's patriotism. "I made a misstatement. I said a comment that I would take back. I did not, nor do I, question Barack Obama's patriotism&amp;nbsp;... I did not say that Barack Obama is anti-American nor do I believe that Barack Obama is anti-American&amp;nbsp;...

====Global currency====
On March 26, 2009, following comments by China proposing adoption of a [[global reserve currency]], Bachmann introduced a resolution calling for a Constitutional amendment to bar the dollar from being replaced by a foreign currency. Current law prohibits foreign currency from being recognized in the U.S., but Bachmann expressed concerns relating to the president's power to make and interpret treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/41919847.html?page=1&amp;c=y|title=Bachmann: No foreign currency|date=March 26, 2009|website=[[Star Tribune]]|accessdate=April 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819095026/http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/41919847.html?page=1&amp;c=y|archivedate=August 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that month, at a [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Financial Services Committee]] hearing, Bachmann asked both Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] and Federal Reserve Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] whether they would reject calls for the U.S. to move away from the [[U.S. dollar]] and they replied that they would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2009/03/26/bachmann-bill-would-ban-global-currency/|title=Bachmann bill would ban global currency|date=March 26, 2009|publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=May 3, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713220825/http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2009/03/26/bachmann-bill-would-ban-global-currency/|archivedate=July 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010 Census====
In a June 17, 2009, interview with ''[[The Washington Times]]'', Bachmann expressed concern that the questions on the [[2010 United States Census]] had become "very intricate, very personal" and that [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]], a community organizing group that had [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy|come under fire]] the previous year, might be part of the [[Census Bureau]]'s door-to-door information collection efforts. She stated, "I know, for my family, the only question we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that."&lt;ref&gt;Dinan, Stephen.

====Cap and Trade legislation====
In March 2009, Bachmann was interviewed by the [[Northern Alliance Radio Network]] and promoted two forums she was hosting the next month in St. Cloud and Woodbury about Obama's proposed cap-and-trade tax policy to limit [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Bachmann said she wanted Minnesotans "armed and dangerous on this issue of the energy tax because we need to fight back." Bachmann's office quickly clarified that she was speaking metaphorically, meaning "armed with knowledge." According to the ''[[Star Tribune]]'', her quote went viral across the Internet.&lt;ref name="Revolt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/house/42478007.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUo8cyaiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU |title=The Messenger: Michele Bachmann: |work=Star Tribune |location=Minneapolis |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818100042/http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/house/42478007.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUo8cyaiUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaUU |archivedate=August 18, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/MediaPlayer/AudioPlayer.aspx?ContentGuid=2c59827d-9fb9-46da-9127-c839e6d5ac85 |title=Audio Player |publisher=Townhall.com |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527041322/http://townhall.com/mediaplayer/audioplayer.aspx?ContentGuid=2c59827d-9fb9-46da-9127-c839e6d5ac85 |archivedate=May 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====AmeriCorps====
In 2009, Bachmann became a critic of what she characterized as proposals for mandatory public service.&lt;ref name="paul harris"/&gt; Of the [[Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act]], an expansion to [[AmeriCorps]] (a federal community service organization), she said in April:
{{quote|It's under the guise of—quote—volunteerism. But it's not volunteers at all. It's ''paying'' people to do work on behalf of government&amp;nbsp;...

I believe that there is a very strong chance that we will see that young people will be put into mandatory service. And the real concerns is that there are provisions for what I would call re-education camps for young people, where young people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward and then they have to go to work in some of these politically correct forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/31237/bachmann-reedcuation-camps|title=Bachmann fears 'politically correct re-education camps for young people{{'-}}|last=Steller|first=Chris|date=April 6, 2009|work=[[Minnesota Independent]]|accessdate=April 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The original bill called for an exploration of whether a mandatory public service program could be established, but the section on creating a "Congressional Commission on Civic Service" was stripped from the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.factcheck.org/2009/03/mandatory-public-service/|title=Is Congress creating a mandatory public service system?|last=Robertson|first=Lori|date=April 21, 2009|publisher=[[FactCheck]]|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Bachmann's political opponents publicized in the local media and the [[blogosphere]] what they described as the "ironic" fact that her son, Harrison, joined [[Teach for America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/41747/bachmann-son-teach-america-americorps-reeducation-camps |title=Bachmann's son signed on with AmeriCorps program she abhors |website=Minnesota Independent |last=Steller |first=Chris |date=August 12, 2009 |accessdate=September 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816183758/http://minnesotaindependent.com/41747/bachmann-son-teach-america-americorps-reeducation-camps |archivedate=August 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/53002167.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUgOy9cP3DieyckcUsI |title=Bachmann's wayward son up and joins AmeriCorps |last=Tevlin |first=Jon |date=August 12, 2009 |accessdate=September 10, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815205305/http://www.startribune.com/local/53002167.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O%3ADW3ckUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaUgOy9cP3DieyckcUsI |archivedate=August 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the AmeriCorps program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachforamerica.org/why-teach-for-america/compensation-and-benefits| title=Teach for America Financial Compensation and Benefits |year=2012|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health care====
Bachmann contributed to the "[[death panel]]" controversy when she read from a July 24 article written by [[Betsy McCaughey]] from the floor of the House. [[Sarah Palin]] said that her "death panel" remark was inspired by what she called the "[[George Orwell|Orwellian]]" opinions of [[Ezekiel Emanuel]] as described by Bachmann,&lt;ref name="SarahFacebookOne"&gt;Sarah Palin's Facebook page, August 7, 2009, [https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=113851103434 Sarah Palin: Statement on the Current Health Care Debate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122201238/https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=113851103434 |date=November 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SarahFacebookTwo"&gt;Sarah Palin's facebook page, August 12, 2009, [https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=116471698434 Sarah Palin: Concerning the "Death Panels"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228195112/https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=116471698434 |date=February 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCTapper"&gt;ABC News, Jake Tapper, August 7, 2009, Palin Paints Picture of 'Obama Death Panel' Giving Thumbs Down to Trig, [http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/08/palin-paints-picture-of-obama-death-panel-giving-thumbs-down-to-trig.html Palin Paints Picture of 'Obama Death Panel' Giving Thumbs Down to Trig] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wHfBwvG0?url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/08/palin-paints-picture-of-obama-death-panel-giving-thumbs-down-to-trig.html |date=February 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Atlantic |first=Marc |last=Ambinder |date=August 11, 2009 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/08/zeke-emanuel-the-death-panels-and-illogic-in-politics/23088/ |title=Zeke Emanuel, The Death Panels, And Illogic In Politics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124055714/http://politics.theatlantic.com/2009/08/the_death_panel.php |archivedate=November 24, 2009 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlyDoctors"&gt;{{cite news | last = McCaughey | first = Betsy | title = Deadly doctors: O [sic] advisors want to ration care | newspaper=''[[New York Post]]'' | date = July 24, 2009 | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/07242009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/deadly_doctors_180941.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/23/betsy-mccaughey/mccaughey-claims-end-life-counseling-will-be-requi/ |title=McCaughey claims end-of-life counseling will be required for Medicare patients |publisher=Politifact.com |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who accused him of advocating health care rationing by age and disability.&lt;ref name=BachmannSpeech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanarchives.org/congress/?q=node/77531&amp;id=9022203 |title=Congressional Chronicle – C-SPAN Video Library |publisher=C-spanarchives.org |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310050241/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/congress/?q=node%2F77531&amp;id=9022203 |archivedate=March 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''PolitiFact''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/12/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-obama-health-adviser-thinks-health-c/ "Bachmann says Obama health adviser thinks health care ought not to be extended to the disabled"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520051800/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/12/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-obama-health-adviser-thinks-health-c/ |date=May 20, 2016 }}, ''PolitiFact'', July 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''TIME'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1915835,00.html "Ezekiel Emanuel, Obama's 'Deadly Doctor,' Strikes Back"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826152705/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0%2C8599%2C1915835%2C00.html |date=August 26, 2013 }}, ''TIME'', August 12. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann's euthanasia remarks [[Ezekiel J.

On August 31, 2009, Bachmann spoke at an event in Colorado, saying of Democratic health care overhaul proposals that: {{quote|This cannot pass. What we have to do today is make a covenant, to slit our wrists, be blood brothers on this thing. This will not pass. We will do whatever it takes to make sure this doesn't pass.&lt;ref name="coloradoindependent.com"/&gt;}} She outlined ideas for changing the health care system, including: "Erase the boundaries around every single state when it comes to health care", enabling consumers to purchase insurance across state lines; increase the use of [[health savings account]]s and allow everyone to "take full deductibility of all medical expenses", including insurance premiums; and [[tort reform]].&lt;ref name="coloradoindependent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloradoindependent.com/36840/bachmann-slit-our-wrists-be-blood-brothers%E2%80%99-to-beat-health-care-reform |title=Bachmann: 'Slit our wrists, be blood brothers' to beat health care reform|first=Ernest|last=Luning|website=[[The Colorado Independent]]|date=August 31, 2009|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachmann denounced the government-run health insurance [[public option]], calling it a "government takeover of health care" that would "squeeze out private health insurance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pat| last=Doyle |url=http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=52318332 |title=Health insurers fighting overhaul plan with cash |website=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis |date=August 2, 2009 |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of President Obama's visit to Asia====
In an interview with [[Anderson Cooper]] on November 3, 2010, when discussing cuts in government spending for Medicare and Social Security suggested by Congressman [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]], Bachmann was asked what cuts in government spending she would make to reduce the deficit. She cited President Obama's then-upcoming visit to Asia as an example, saying it "is expected to cost the taxpayers $200&amp;nbsp;million a day. He's taking two thousand people with him.

===112th Congress===

====Leadership run====
{{see also|List of Tea Party politicians}}
[[File:Michele Bachmann by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Bachmann in February 2011]]

After the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010 elections]] and the announcement from Rep. [[Mike Pence]] that he was stepping away from his leadership position in the House, Bachmann announced on her Facebook page her intention to seek the position of [[House Republican Conference Chair]]. As Bachmann is the founder of the House's Tea Party Caucus, her announcement caused some to see the leadership election as "an early test of how GOP leaders will treat the antiestablishment movement's winners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bradenton.com/2010/11/04/2712987/bachmann-bid-for-gop-leadership.html|first=Laurie |last=Kellman|agency=Associated Press|title=Bachmann bid for GOP leadership gets cool reaction|date=November 4, 2010|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5u7CQOYif?url=http://www.bradenton.com/2010/11/04/2712987/bachmann-bid-for-gop-leadership.html |archivedate= November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many among the House's Republican leadership, including [[Eric Cantor]] and the retiring Mike Pence, were quick to endorse Rep. [[Jeb Hensarling]] for the position; [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker-to-be]] [[John Boehner]] remained neutral on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 3, 2010|title=Republicans Start Jockeying for Leadership Posts|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/11/03/republicans-start-jockeying-for-leadership-posts/|first=Patrick |last=O'Connor|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5u7Cj1c7u?url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/11/03/republicans-start-jockeying-for-leadership-posts/ |archivedate= November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Bachmann's run include Reps. [[Steve King]], [[John Kline (politician)|John Kline]], [[Louie Gohmert]], [[Chip Cravaack]], [[Erik Paulsen]], as well as media personality and political commentator [[Glenn Beck]].&lt;ref name="gavel"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/44872.html|title=Michele Bachmann: I helped put gavel in Boehner's hands|first=Marin |last=Cogan|work=Politico|date=November 9, 2010|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5u7CqpRWi?url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/44872.html |archivedate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listing her qualifications for the position Bachmann noted "I've done an effective job speaking out at a national and local level, motivating people with our message, calling attention to deficits in Obama's policy. I was instrumental in bringing tens of thousands of people to the U.S. capitol to rally against Obama care and to attend our press conference."&lt;ref name="gavel"/&gt; She noted her work to keep the Tea Party within the GOP rather than having it become a third party thereby helping the party capture the House, stating "I have been able to bring a voice and motivate people to, in effect, put that gavel in John Boehner's hands, so that Republicans can lead going forward. …It's important that leadership represents the choice of the people coming into our caucus….I think I have motivated a high number of people to get involved in this cycle who may have sat it out and that have made a difference on a number of these races. I gave a large amount of money to NRCC and individual candidates and started Michele PAC, which raised $650,000 for members since July, so I was able to financially help about 50 people out."&lt;ref name="gavel"/&gt;

Bachmann's bid suffered a setback when she was passed over for the GOP's transition team on which Hensarling was placed.&lt;ref name="shaky"&gt;{{cite news|title= Michele Bachmann leadership bid looking shaky|first=Rachel |last=Weiner|url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/11/michele-bachmann-leadership-bi.html|date=November 8, 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|archivedate=November 9, 2010|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5u7D0XXsu?url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/11/michele-bachmann-leadership-bi.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Bachmann's leading all other Representatives in fund raising, a Republican aide stated some "members are getting resentful of Bachmann, who they say is making the argument that you're not really a Tea Party supporter unless you support her. That's gone through the formation of the Tea Party Caucus and the formation of this candidacy of hers. It's just not so."&lt;ref name="shaky"/&gt; Sarah Palin, with whom Bachmann had campaigned earlier in the year, declined to endorse her leadership bid, while other Tea Party favorites Reps Adam Kinzinger and Tim Scott were placed on the transition team.&lt;ref name="shaky"/&gt;  According to some senior House staff members, the party leadership was concerned about some of Bachmann's high profile faux pas, the high rate of turnover among her staff, and how willing she would be to advance the party's messaging rather than her own.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Parker [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/20/us/politics/20bachmann.html Michele Bachmann's Popularity Puts G.O.P. on the Spot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807082849/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/20/us/politics/20bachmann.html |date=August 7, 2016 }} ''[[The New York Times]]'' November 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, Bachmann released a statement ending her campaign for Conference Chair and giving her "enthusiastic" support to Hensarling.&lt;ref name="campaignend"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Campaign Ends |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/253059/campaign-ends-nro-staff# |date=November 10, 2010 |website=The National Review Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111165731/http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/253059/campaign-ends-nro-staff |dead-url=no |archivedate=November 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Committee assignment====
Bachmann was selected by House Speaker John Boehner for a position "on the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]], giving her a new role as overseer of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[National Security Agency]] and the rest of the U.S. intelligence community."&lt;ref name="intl com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rep.

====Repeal of Dodd-Frank reform====
Soon after being sworn into her third term, Bachmann introduced legislation to repeal the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank financial reform law]]. She stated, "I'm pleased to offer a full repeal of the job-killing Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill. Dodd-Frank grossly expanded the federal government beyond its jurisdictional boundaries. It gave Washington bureaucrats the power to interpret and enforce the legislation with little oversight. Real financial regulatory reform must deal with these lenders who were a leading cause of our economic recession. True reform must also end the bailout mind-set that was perpetuated by the last Congress." She also took issue with the law for not addressing the liabilities of the tax-payer funded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mattingly|first=Phil|title=Tea Party Caucus Founder Bachmann Pushes Measure to Repeal Dodd-Frank Law|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/tea-party-caucus-founder-bachmann-pushes-measure-to-repeal-dodd-frank-law.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=January 7, 2011|date=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann's bill was endorsed by conservative groups such as the [[Club for Growth]] and [[Americans for Prosperity]]. It gained four other Republican co-sponsors, including Rep. [[Darrell Issa]], who became the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee at the start of the 112th Congress.&lt;ref name="WatchCompletly"&gt;{{cite web|title=GOP's Bachmann seeks to repeal Dodd-Frank…completely|date=Jan 6, 2011|url=http://blogs.marketwatch.com/election/2011/01/06/gops-bachmann-seeks-to-repeal-dodd-frankcompletely/|publisher=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann's call for total repeal was seen as more drastic than the approach advocated by her fellow Republican [[Spencer Bachus]] who became the House Financial Services Committee Chairman with the change of majority in the House. Bachus "plans to provide 'vigorous' oversight of regulators efforts to reform banking and housing&amp;nbsp;... reform Fannie and Freddie", and "dismantle pieces of [the] Dodd-Frank Act that he believes 'unnecessarily punish small businesses and community banks.'"&lt;ref name="WatchCompletly"/&gt; In response to Bachmann's legislation Rep [[Barney Frank]] stated, "Michele Bachmann, the Club for Growth, and others in the right-wing coalition have now made their agenda for the financial sector very clear: they yearn to return to the thrilling days of yesteryear, so the loan arrangers can ride again—untrammeled by any rules restraining irresponsibility, excess, deception, and most of all, infinite leverage."&lt;ref name="WatchCompletly"/&gt; The chances of Bachmann's legislation passing were viewed as unlikely, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' wrote that "Like the Republican move to repeal healthcare reform, Ms Bachmann's bill could be passed by the House of Representatives but be blocked by the Senate or White House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank set for fight to defend regulatory overhaul|author=Tom Braithwaite|date=January 6, 2011|website=The Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/370e0ec6-19e0-11e0-b921-00144feab49a.html#axzz1AIe4kCgf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State of the Union response====
Bachmann responded to President Obama's 2011 State of the Union speech for the Tea Party Express website; this speech was broadcast live by [[CNN]]. She insisted that her response was not intended to counter the official Republican party response by Rep. [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]] of Wisconsin. When asked if the speech was an indication of competition with Ryan and Speaker Boehner's leadership team, Bachmann dismissed such a view as "a fiction of the media", she had alerted Ryan and the leadership team that her response might go national and no objections were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bachmann's State of the Union response raises her profile|agency=Associated Press|date=January 27, 2011|url=http://www.sctimes.com/article/20110127/NEWS01/101270036/Bachmann-s-State-of-the-Union-response-raises-her-profile}}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health care====
Bachmann has characterized the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] as "ObamaCare", and has continually called for its repeal.&lt;ref name="defund"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/rep-michele-bachmann-house-republicans-s |title=Rep.

[[Steve King]] she introduced "the Bachmann-King repeal of health care bill" stating that it "is our intent in our heart to make sure that Obamacare is completely repealed."&lt;ref name="defund"/&gt; In light of a Democratic held Senate and Presidency that oppose repeal, Bachmann called on the Republican held House of Representatives to not provide any funds for the implementation of the act "But until we can see that [repeal] happen, we want to fully defund this bill so that, like, it would be akin to a helium balloon that gets no helium inside so that it can't take off the ground, and that's what we're planning to do. I'm very, very grateful for nothing else; having a majority in the House of Representatives so that we have the ability of the power of the purse to not fund Obamacare, and this is exactly the right way to go."&lt;ref name="defund"/&gt;

On March 4, 2011, Bachmann (who was one of the six House Republicans to vote against the continuing resolution) expressed her unhappiness with the move that gave a two-week reprieve to the fear of government shutdown, stating "I am vowing to vote 'no' on future Continuing Resolutions to fund the government unless there is specific language included to defund Obamacare and rescind the funding that has already been appropriated. Defunding Obamacare, along with defunding Planned Parenthood, must be non-negotiable planks in our budget negotiations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bachmann to vote against any funding bill that does not defund health-care law| url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/03/04/bachmann-to-vote-against-any-funding-bill-that-does-not-defund-health-care-law/#ixzz1G9eFDuVa |first=Chris | last=Moody|publisher=The Daily Caller|date=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bachmann joins Tea Party supporters in plan to defund health care law|first=Derek| last= Wallbank|date=March 3, 2011| url=http://www.minnpost.com/derekwallbank/2011/03/03/26275/bachmann_joins_tea_party_supporters_in_plan_to_defund_health_care_law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an appearance on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' on March 6, 2011, and during a March 7, 2011, interview with [[Sean Hannity]], Bachmann declared that the Obama administration and the Congressional Democrats had hidden $105&amp;nbsp;billion in spending in the overhaul of the American Health Care System. She portrayed the Democratic leadership as timing the release of the bill's text to avoid detection of the spending "We didn't get the bill until a literally couple of hours before we were supposed to vote on it."&lt;ref name="$105B"&gt;{{cite news|title=GOP Lawmakers Target $105B in Spending Found in Health Care Law|date=March 8, 2011|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/03/08/gop-lawmakers-target-105b-spending-health-care-law/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated the spending was split up within different portions of the bill to mask its total cost. Bachmann was alerted of the situation by the conservative Heritage Foundation which read the tallies of the Congressional Research Service and Congressional Budget Office.

Reports listed a partial breakdown of the costs which include "about $40&amp;nbsp;billion would go to the Children's Health Insurance Program, $15&amp;nbsp;billion would go to Medicare and Medicaid innovation programs, and $9.5&amp;nbsp;billion would go to the Community Health Centers Fund."&lt;ref name="$105B"/&gt; As the funds are designated mandatory spending (they are not controlled by the annual appropriations acts), the funds would remain even if the move to defund the reform law succeeded.

Bachmann stated that $16&amp;nbsp;billion of the money gives Health and Human Services Secretary [[Kathleen Sebelius]] a "slush fund&amp;nbsp;... [to do] whatever she wants with this money."&lt;ref name="$105B"/&gt; She called on the bills supporters to return the money, "I think this deception that the president and [former House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi and [Senate Majority Leader Harry] Reid put forward with appropriating over $105&amp;nbsp;billion needs to be given back to the people."&lt;ref name="billions"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bachmann accuses White House of hiding billions in health bill |author=Jeremy Herb |newspaper=Star Tribune |date=March 7, 2011 |url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/117500223.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310152110/http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/117500223.html |archivedate=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during the Meet the Press interview if she would take back her previous comments that Obama "may have anti-American views" and that his administration had "embraced something called gangster government", Bachmann backed her statements, saying "I do believe that actions that have been taken by this White House—I don't take back my statements on gangster government. I think that there have been actions taken by the government that are corrupt&amp;nbsp;... I said I have very serious concerns about the president's views, and I think the president's actions in the last two years speak for themselves."&lt;ref name="billions"/&gt;

In response to Bachmann's charges Chief Deputy Democratic Whip Rep. [[Jan Schakowsky]], who serves on the House health subcommittee, pointed out that the report Bachmann refers to is an update of a report that came out in October 2010 and that the costs were spelled out in both the bill and the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of its cost, "Michele Bachmann obviously didn't read the bill, because there was absolutely nothing hidden in that legislation." Schakowsky held that the costs were not kept secret, citing the $40&amp;nbsp;billion for the Children's Health Insurance Program as an example "There was a robust debate about whether or not that should be included, etc. So this idea of somehow, now at the last minute, there was a secret addition to some kind of funding&amp;nbsp;... is absolute nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was $105&amp;nbsp;billion Really 'Hidden' In The Health Law?|first=Julie | last=Rovner| publisher=National Public Radio |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/03/09/134398471/was-105-billion-really-hidden-in-the-health-law?ps=sh_sthdl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2011 Republican presidential debate in Tampa, FL, Bachmann criticized [[Rick Perry]] for his support for the [[Human papilloma virus|humanpapilloma virus]] (HPV) vaccine and his support for mandating the HPV vaccine for all sixth-grade Texas girls.&lt;ref name="Weiner, Rachel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiner|first1=Rachel|title=Bachmann claims HPV vaccine might cause 'mental retardation'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/michele-bachmann-continues-perry-attack-claims-hpv-vaccine-might-cause-mental-retardation/2011/09/13/gIQAbJBcPK_blog.html|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] and other medical organizations worldwide are in favor of immunizing girls and boys against HPV.&lt;ref name="Grady, Denise"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grady|first1=Denise|title=Remark on HPV vaccine could ripple for years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/health/20hpv.html?_r=0|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steenhuysen, Julie (2011)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steenhuysen|first1=Julie|title=Analysis: Bachmann vaccine comments toxic, doctors say|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/15/us-cancer-hpv-idUSTRE78E5YM20110915|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=Reuters|date=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; HPV can cause lesions and genital warts, and has been linked to cervical cancer as well as genital and oral cancers in people of any gender.&lt;ref name="Gann, Carrie (2011)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gann|first1=Carrie|title=Michele Bachmann's HPV Vaccine Safety and 'Retardation' Comments Misleading, Doctors Say|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/michele-bachmanns-hpv-vaccine-safety-retardation-comments-misleading/story?id=14516625|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=ABC News|date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the vaccine is effective only if given before the onset of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to the virus, medical groups recommend the three dose vaccine be given to 11- and 12-year-olds.&lt;ref name="Grady, Denise" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gann, Carrie (2011)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hensley, Scott"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hensley|first1=Scott|title=Pediatricians fact-check Bachmann's bashing of HPV vaccine|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/michele-bachmanns-hpv-vaccine-safety-retardation-comments-misleading/story?id=14516625|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=NPR|date=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann, during the debate and in interviews following the event, accused Perry of "crony capitalism" (because Perry's former chief of staff was chief lobbyist for a drug company manufacturing the vaccine), and claimed that the HPV vaccine was dangerous and caused mental retardation.&lt;ref name="Weiner, Rachel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gann, Carrie (2011)" /&gt; She repeatedly referred to an anecdotal account from a mother of a girl who been immunized for HPV. "She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered mental retardation thereafter," Bachmann said. "There is no second chance for these little girls if there is any dangerous consequences to their bodies."&lt;ref name="Weiner, Rachel" /&gt; Shortly after Bachmann's statements at the debate, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement: "The American Academy of Pediatrics would like to correct false statements made in the Republican presidential campaign that HPV vaccine is dangerous and can cause mental retardation. There is absolutely no scientific validity to this statement. Since the vaccine has been introduced, more than 35 million doses have been administered, and it has an excellent safety record."&lt;ref name="Steenhuysen, Julie (2011)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gann, Carrie (2011)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hensley, Scott" /&gt; Fewer than one percent of those receiving the vaccine reported neurological side effects or, in rare cases, severe allergic reactions, none linked to changes in cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="Weiner, Rachel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grady, Denise" /&gt; Bachmann later acknowledged that she was not a doctor or a scientist.&lt;ref name="Grady, Denise" /&gt;

They requested formal investigations into what Bachmann called "influence operations" by the Brotherhood.&lt;ref name=fierce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/mccain-defends-clinton-aide-huma-abedin-against-house-gop-charges-of-muslim-brotherhood-scheme/ McCain Defends Clinton Aide Huma Abedin Against Bachmann Accusation About Muslim Brotherhood] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116201028/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/mccain-defends-clinton-aide-huma-abedin-against-house-gop-charges-of-muslim-brotherhood-scheme/ |date=November 16, 2016 }} abcnews&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachmann also accused [[Huma Abedin]], an aide to Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] and former Rep. [[Anthony Weiner]]'s wife, of having family connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Bachmann's comments have drawn what the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' calls "fierce criticism from fellow lawmakers and religious groups."&lt;ref name=fierce/&gt; In a speech on the Senate floor, 2008 Republican presidential candidate Senator [[John McCain]] denounced Bachmann's charges as "specious and degrading".

===Global economy===
In a discussion about the [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit|G-20 summit in Toronto]], during an interview with conservative radio host Scott Hennen, Bachmann stated that she does not want America to be part of the international global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/39193.html |title=Bachmann wary of G-20|first=Andy|last=Barr|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|date=June 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.streamaudio.com/podcast/1666/bachmann62910.mp3 "Congresswoman Michele Bachmann (R-MN)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032806/http://content.streamaudio.com/podcast/1666/bachmann62910.mp3 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, (MP3 file), ''The Scott Hennen Show'', [[WZFG]], June 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration policy===
Bachmann believes that strengthened enforcement of immigration laws is required for the growth of the American job market. She supports amending the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] to allow only the immediate family of legal immigrants (not extended family members) priority consideration in the immigration process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bachmann.house.gov/Issues/Issue/?IssueID=4316 |title=Congresswoman Michele Bachmann House web page |publisher=Bachmann.house.gov |date= |accessdate=December 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101082630/http://bachmann.house.gov/Issues/Issue/?IssueID=4316|archivedate=January 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She voted against the DREAM Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.6497 |title=Bill Text – 111th Congress (2009-2010) – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also stated that the current law does not need modification but proper enforcement.

Bachmann said: "...&amp;nbsp;the immigration system in the United States worked very, very well up until the mid-1960s when liberal members of Congress changed the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|immigration laws]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Perry defends law allowing in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants|first=Lucy |last=Madison|publisher=CBS News|date=September 12, 2011|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20105183-503544.html|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is against the 2013 immigration reform bill, indicating that passing it would mean the end of the Republican Party. On [[WorldNetDaily]] she stated "This is President Obama's number one political agenda because he knows we will never again have a Republican president ever if amnesty goes into effect."&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|last=Philip|first=Abby D.|title=Will Republicans Listen to Jeb Bush About Immigration Reform?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/06/will-republicans-listen-to-jeb-bush-about-immigration-reform/|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=June 14, 2013|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, the Minneapolis ''[[Star Tribune]]'' reported that, in March 2006, Bachmann was on a Minneapolis radio show advocating for a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. A caller asked her to explain how he, a heterosexual, would be harmed if his gay neighbors were allowed to marry. Bachmann replied by saying: "Public schools would have to teach that homosexuality and same-sex marriage are normal, natural and that maybe children should try them." The ''Star Tribune'' also reported that Bachmann has publicly referred to homosexuality as "sexual dysfunction", "sexual identity disorders", and "personal enslavement" that leads to "sexual anarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Black, Eric (August 20, 2006). "Sixth Congressional District Race; It's what they say and how they say it; For each main candidate, style and substance will be important factors in the race for this wide-open congressional seat". ''Star Tribune'' (Minneapolis): p. 1.B.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2014 radio interview, Bachmann claimed that [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] activists want to abolish [[age of consent]] laws in the United States so that adults can "prey on little children sexually."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/07/25/rep-michele-bachmann-slams-gay-agenda-on-radio-show/|title=Rep.

=== Federal-backed home loans ===
According to an article in the ''Washington Post'', in 2008 Bachmann may have taken advantage of a federal program for a home loan, then called for dismantling the program, though the article notes that the public and other members of Congress have taken advantage of such loans despite seeing reasons to criticize them.&lt;ref&gt;Kindy, Kimberly.

On January 25, 2012, Bachmann announced that she would run for reelection for her seat in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/138038593.html |title=Michele Bachmann says she'll seek 4th term in Congress after failed presidential bid |date=January 25, 2012 |work=Minneapolis Star Tribune |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=June 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129000838/http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/138038593.html |archivedate=January 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Politico.com, as of July 2012, Bachmann has "raised close to $15 million" for the 2012 election, a figure it called "astounding&amp;nbsp;... more than some Senate candidates will collect this year."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/charlie-mahtesian/2012/07/is-michele-bachmann-toast-129571.html Is Michele Bachmann toast?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115170122/http://www.politico.com/blogs/charlie-mahtesian/2012/07/is-michele-bachmann-toast-129571.html |date=November 15, 2014 }} By CHARLES MAHTESIAN | July 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; From July to the end of September, Bachmann raised $4.5 million. This amount put her ahead of all other members of congress (including [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] who was in second place with $4 million) for the third quarter. Bachmann said that she was "humbled by the enormous outpouring of grassroots support for my campaign focused on keeping America the most secure and prosperous nation in the world."

Despite a more favorable district Bachmann only narrowly won re-election, receiving just 4,298 more votes than her DFL challenger [[Jim Graves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Diaz|first=Kevin|title=Close call for Bachmann|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/177789861.html?refer=y|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral history==
{{Main|Electoral history of Michele Bachmann}}

==Autobiography==
In November 2011 Bachmann published her autobiography, ''Core of Conviction'', in which she outlines the events and people who have shaped her values and beliefs including her parents' divorce when she was in the ninth grade. She describes the financial struggles her mother suffered as a single parent in trying to provide for her family and the work ethic she developed as a result of it. She writes of that time, "I took every baby sitting job I could get, because by ninth grade, I was growing conscious of my appearance. In those days, girls had to wear dresses to public school, and if I wanted pretty dresses, I had to buy them, because mom couldn't afford them for me; she couldn't afford lunch money."

Bachmann writes about her political conversion as a young adult when [[Jimmy Carter]], whom she voted for, let her down.
"It was in the perilous fires of the Carter administration that my ideology was forged," she wrote. "In the seventies, Carter taught me what I was against, and then in the eighties, Reagan taught me what I was for." She also details why she went to work for the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. She says it was because she wanted to change the tax code, "from the inside out." She also commented on her role as a [[Tea Party Movement|Tea Party leader]]. "I once said that the Tea Party represents 90 percent of Americans. I now realize that I misspoke," she admitted. "I should have said 100 percent, because I believe that nearly all Americans retain faith in the ordered liberty that the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] offers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/45356522/ns/today-books/t/core-conviction-michele-bachmann-tells-her-story/#.TuQcAE-iIiw |title='Core of Conviction': Michele Bachmann tells her story – books – TODAY.com |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date=November 21, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123155957/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/45356522/ns/today-books/t/core-conviction-michele-bachmann-tells-her-story/#.TuQcAE-iIiw |archivedate=November 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/1123/Michele-Bachmann-shares-her-life-story-with-voters-in-Core-of-Conviction/%28page%29/2 |title=Michele Bachmann shares her life story with voters in 'Core of Conviction' |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=November 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/novemberweb-only/michele-bachmann.html |title=Michele Bachmann: 'It's High Time We Have a Mother in the White House' &amp;#124; Christianity Today &amp;#124; A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction |publisher=Christianity Today |date=November 22, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noble Consort Ying''' (7 March 1731 – 14 March 1800), of the [[Mongols|Mongol]] [[Eight Banners|Bordered Red Banner]] Barin clan, was a consort of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].

==Life==
===Family background===
Noble Consort Ying's personal name was not recorded in history.

* Father: Naqin (納親), served as a first rank military official (都統), and held the title of a master commandant of light chariot (輕車都尉)

===Yongzheng era===
The future Noble Consort Ying was born on the 29th day of the first [[Lunar calendar|lunar]] month in the ninth year of the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], which translates to 7 March 1731 in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

===Qianlong era===
It is not known when Lady Barin entered the Forbidden City and was granted the title "Noble Lady" by the [[Qianlong Emperor]]. In January or February 1748, she was demoted to "First Attendant Na". In May or June 1748, she was restored as "Noble Lady Na". She was elevated on 30 July 1751 to "Concubine Ying", and on 4 February 1760 to "Consort Ying".

===Jiaqing era===
On 9 February 1796, the Qianlong Emperor abdicated in favour of his 15th son Yongyan, who was enthroned as the [[Jiaqing Emperor]]. However, the Qianlong Emperor remained in power as a [[Taishang Huang|Retired Emperor]]. In November or December 1798, the Qianlong Emperor issued an imperial decree promoting Lady Barin to "Noble Consort Ying". The Jiaqing Emperor honoured Lady Barin as "Dowager Noble Consort Ying" and let her and [[Noble Consort Wan|Dowager Noble Consort Wan]] live in Shoukang Palace (壽康宮).

In 1800, during Lady Barin's 70th birthday, [[Yonglin]], the Jiaqing Emperor's only full brother who was raised by Lady Barin, sent her birthday gifts. Lady Barin had no children of her own and had been leading a rather lonely life in the palace, so she was very happy to see Yonglin. However, the Jiaqing Emperor was furious when he found out, and he scolded his brother for not seeking his permission first. Lady Barin's birthday celebrations were thus rendered meaningless. She died on 14 March 1800. In 1801, she was interred in the Yu Mausoleum of the [[Eastern Qing tombs]].

* During the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] (r. 1722–1735):

'''Kenneth Hsien-yung Pai''' ({{zh|c=白先勇|p=Bái Xiānyǒng|w=Pai Hsien-yung}}), born July 11, 1937) is a [[Taiwan]]ese writer who has been described as a "melancholy pioneer."  He was born in [[Guilin]], Guangxi, China at the cusp of both the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]]. Pai's father was the famous [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) general [[Bai Chongxi]] (Pai Chung-hsi), whom he later described as a "stern, [[Confucian]] father" with "some soft spots in his heart."  Pai was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] at the age of seven, during which time he would have to live in a separate house from his siblings (of which he would have a total of nine).  He lived with his family in [[Chongqing]], Shanghai, and [[Nanjing]] before moving to the British-controlled [[Hong Kong]] in 1948 as [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] forces turned the tide of the Chinese Civil War. In 1952, Pai and his family resettled in [[Taiwan]], where the KMT had relocated the [[Republic of China]] after defeat by the Communists in 1949.

==Chronology==
Pai studied in [[La Salle College]], a Hong Kong Catholic boys' high school, until he left for Taiwan with his family.  In 1956, Pai enrolled at [[National Cheng Kung University]] as a [[hydraulic engineering]] major, because he wanted to participate in the [[Three Gorges Dam]] Project. The following year, he passed the entrance examination for the foreign literature department of [[National Taiwan University]] and transferred there to study [[English literature]]. In September 1958, after completing his first year of study, he published his first short story "Madame Ching" in the magazine ''Literature''.  Two years later, he collaborated with several NTU classmates—e.g., [[Chen Ruoxi]], [[Wang Wenxing]], [[Ouyang Tzu]]—to launch ''Modern Literature'' ([[Xiandai wenxue]]), in which many of his early works were published.  He was also known to frequent the [[Cafe Astoria]] in [[Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=70623&amp;CtNode=428 History of Cafe Astoria]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pai went abroad in 1963 to study literary theory and creative writing at the [[University of Iowa]] in the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. That same year, Pai's mother, the parent with whom Pai had the closest relationship, died, and it was this death to which Pai attributes the [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] that pervades his work.  After earning his M.A. from Iowa, he became a professor of [[Chinese literature]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and has resided in Santa Barbara ever since. Pai retired from UCSB in 1994.  Pai's cousin is Hong Kong radio personality [[Pamela Peck]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/international/20120911/34500952/ Family Relations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
Pai's most famous work of fiction, ''[[Taipei People]]'' (臺北人, ''Táiběirén'', 1971), is a seminal work of Chinese [[modernism]] that mixes both [[literary Chinese]] and experimental modernist techniques. In terms of his choice of themes, Pai's work is also far ahead of its time. His novel, ''[[Crystal Boys]]'' (孽子, ''Nièzǐ'', 1983), tells the story of a group of homosexual youths living in 1960s [[Taipei]], largely from the viewpoint of a gay youth who is thrown out of his father's home.  The novel's comparison of the dark corners of Taipei's [[228 Memorial Park|New Park]], the characters' main cruising area, with the cloistered society of Taiwan of that period proved quite unacceptable to Taipei's then KMT-dominated establishment, though Pai has generally remained a loyal KMT supporter.

==Influence==
Among other [[List of Taiwanese authors|Taiwanese writers]], Pai is appreciated for sophisticated narratives that introduce controversial and groundbreaking perspectives to Chinese literature. His major works, discussed above, have been widely influential.

Further, Pai's writings while in the US in the early 1960s have greatly contributed to an understanding of the Chinese experience in postwar America. "Death in Chicago" (1964) is a semi-autobiographical account of a young Chinese man who, on the eve of his graduation from the English Literature department of the University of Chicago, discovers that his mother has died back home. "Pleasantville" (1964) explores the depressed state of a Chinese mother in the upper-class New York suburbs who feels alienated by the Americanization of her Chinese husband and daughter. Both "Death in Chicago" and "Pleasantville" subtly criticize America as a superficial and materialistic culture that can cause immigrant Chinese to feel lonely and isolated.

In recent years, Pai has gained some acclaim in Mainland Chinese literary circles. He has held various lectures at Beijing Normal University, among others. In the ''Beijing University Selection of Modern Chinese Literature: 1949–1999'' published in 2002, three of Pai's works are included under the time period 1958–1978.&lt;ref&gt;''Zhongguo Dangdai Wenxue Zuopin Jingxuan: 1949–1999''. Beijing Daxue Chubanshe, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These stories reflect the decadence of Shanghai high society in the Republican era. This subject matter constitutes only a small segment of Pai's diverse work, yet it fits particularly well with orthodox renditions of pre-1949 history taught on the Mainland.

In April 2000, a series of five books representing Pai's lifework was published by Huacheng Publishing House in Guangzhou. This series is widely available in Mainland bookstores. It includes short stories, essays, diary entries, and the novel ''Niezi''. A lengthy preface in Volume 1 was penned by Ou Yangzi, a fellow member of the group that founded the journal ''Xiandai Wenxue'' in Taiwan in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Bai Xianyong: ''Bai Xianyong Wenji''. Huacheng Chubanshe, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pai was born [[Muslim]], attended missionary [[Catholic]] schools and embraced [[Buddhist meditation]] practices in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.com/news/2006/sep/28/peony-dreams/ Peony Dreams] Retrieved June 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''patten''' is a London-based project renowned for hi-tech immersive AV shows and multi-platform approach, tracing a boundary-irreverent path through outlets ranging from design as 555-5555, to installation, film, software programming, music, live performance, and publishing. patten started performing at underground venues and releasing music on limited edition CDRs and minidiscs in 2006.  Over the years there have been numerous live line ups and stylistic approaches, including [[computer music]], all-acoustic ensemble compositions, immersive [[audiovisual]] shows, DJ sets, and full bass, drums, and guitar band formations. The most recent recordings and live shows reach the outer edges of techno, hip hop, ambient, club music, grime, pop and industrial.&lt;ref name="fox-charlie-the-quietus"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thequietus.com/articles/07075-patten-glaqjo-xaacsso-review/ | date = 29 September 2011 | accessdate = 4 February 2014 | last = Fox | first = Charlie | publisher = [[The Quietus]] | title = patten GLAQJO XAACSSO | quote = but patten (always lower case, apparently) seems like the proper inheritor of Aphex's crazed, childlike approach to music-making}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="justyna-wichowska-160grams"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.160grams.com/music/encounters-patten/ | date = 26 June 2014 | accessdate = 4 August 2017 | last = Wichowska | first = Justyna | publisher = 160grams | title = Encounters: patten | quote = ‘One of the key ideas embedded in the whole project in all of its different forms – visible forms, audible forms, spatial forms – is that there is the third person involved in the production of what the work is, and that’s the person on the other side of it – the audience member, listener, video watcher, yourself,’ [...] ‘One of the key aims is to produce materials that are open enough for those people to really become engaged with it in a creative way. So the production of something doesn’t really end with the record, or with the video, or with whatever else it might be. It’s really once this thing finds its way out into the world, that’s when something really begins.’ The work that occurs is two-directional: patten invites the audience to co-create the project, and considers the reception and any thoughts or action that result from that reception an inherent part of it.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074950/http://www.160grams.com/music/encounters-patten|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hari-ashurst-pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16008-patten-glaqjo-xaacsso/ | date = 7 November 2011 | accessdate = 25 December 2013 | last = Ashurst | first = Hari | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]] | title = patten GLAQJO XAACSSO | quote = GLAQJO XAACSSO feels like it could exist in a parallel universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006-11: Early History, GLAQJO XAACSSO==

The first patten performances took place across London at alternative music venues like East London rock club [[The Spitz]], Hackney Road's 291 Gallery and South London's Utrophia project space.  Recordings were circulated among friends and at shows on minidisc and home-burnt CDR in limited editions.

In 2011, after a series of increasingly intense live performances ranging from the Tate Modern Turbine Hall to Corsica Studios, patten released the album GLAQJO XAACSSO on London-based label No Pain In Pop.&lt;ref name="hari-ashurst-pitchfork"/&gt; GLAQJO XAACSSO featured 12 tracks of lo-fi shoegaze-inflected electronic music, with heavily processed but still recognizable guitar and vocals featuring widely. The record was put together through writing in liminal states between waking and sleeping, then test-driving material live over the course of a number of months, and finessing in the studio to arrive at final versions.  On release, the album was met with widespread acclaim from a broad spectrum of music fans from techno across to the experimental and indie.  Interviews and press images from this period extended the exploration into reflecting on the way artists are presented and present themselves to a public of strangers, with obscured faces and non-standard interview approaches.  The project’s tradition in creative use of media spaces has continued through until the present, in materials like a playlist of silent tracks available on Spotify, the submission and publishing of identical answers to two different interviews, and a Q&amp;A for Dazed answered entirely in Wikipedia links.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=patten interview: "Trying to describe dreams|url=http://www.dummymag.com/features/patten-interview-trying-to-describe-dreams/|publisher=Dazed|date = 29 September 2011 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=patten interview: "patten Exclusive Mix|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/11160/1/patten-exclusive-mix/|publisher=Dazed|date = 25 Aug 2011 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011-13: Kaleidoscope Imprint==
After the success of GLAQJO XAACSSO, patten began to rapidly release music by other underground artists through their Kaleidoscope imprint, drawing wider attention to the work of others.  The 2012-13 Limited Dubs cassette and digital series included Sculpture’s ‘Slime Code’, the I’ve Been You Twice’ EP, Karen Gwyer’s debut release, the double album ‘Cracked Lacquer/Vanadium’ by Yearning Kru and ‘Guardian Petted’ by California musician Jocelyn Noir’s ALAK.  These were met with various accolades from BBC Radio 1 to Wire Magazine, with many of the artists going on to sign with key independent labels such as Planet Mu, Software and No Pain In Pop. 2015 saw a cassette (Chrome Series) from visual artist Benedict Drew in and a split vinyl release (50/50) including Aldous RH (ex-Egyptian Hip Hop) and Tel Aviv's Vanilla Hammer. Recent releases on the imprint’s 2017 Aether Editions digital-first series have been from The Newcomer, Actual Magic (a moniker of patten), and Japanese producer and DJ, Sapphire Slows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=patten interview: "patten’s Kaleidoscope label announce Karen Gwyer EP|url=http://www.factmag.com/2012/04/23/pattens-kaleidoscope-imprint-announces-super-limited-karen-gwyer-release/|publisher=Fact Magazine|date = 23 April 2012 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yearning Kru Copper Vale, Planet Mu|url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/yearning-kru-copper-vale/|publisher=Fact Magazine|date = 23 April 2012 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sapphire Slows is getting more vocal, and not just in her music|url=

==2013-14: ESTOILE NAIANT, RE-EDITS==
In November 2013 the signing of patten to Warp Records was announced, with the EOLIAN INSTATE EP released soon after in a limited edition picture disc, echoing the project’s beginnings and experimentation with formats.  Weeks later patten performed a live audiovisual set in front of thousands at Tate Britain as part of the Warp x Tate event in December 2013.
The first LP for Warp, ESTOILE NAIANT was released in February 2014, supported by an extensive live audiovisual tour across Europe, North America and Japan.

It was during this period that patten began to release free RE-EDITS EPs, sampling, layering and restructuring fragments of existing music into new textural compositions. Tracks featured were from across musical worlds, fusing Sade, Drexciya, Siouxie and The Banshees, Pixies, Burial and Joy Division, The tracks were underpinned by dancefloor rhythms and the 2014 series were specifically created so as to produce an ‘endless generative mix’ when played on shuffle.  Later RE-EDITS series eschewed this method for a more freeform approach, with ‘vol2’ remixing tracks by Death Grips, Rihanna, Tim Hecker, Julianna Barwick and Cypress Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=patten ESTOILE NAIANT|url=http://warp.net/records/releases/patten/estoile-naiant|publisher=Warp Records|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=patten reveals psychedelic new album ESTOILE NAIANT|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/01/07/patten-reveals-psychedelic-new-album-estoile-naiant/|publisher=FACT Magazine|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Download patten's RE-EDITS vol 3|url=https://dotheastralplane.com/2014/01/21/download-pattens-re-edits-vol-3/|publisher=Do The Astral Plane|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=patten releases RE-EDITS vol 8|url=http://www.dummymag.com/news/download-patten-re-edits-vol.-8/|publisher=DummyMag|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=patten offers new RE-EDITS collection for download|url=https://www.xlr8r.com/news/2014/05/patten-offers-new-re-edits-collection-for-download/|publisher=XLR8R|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014-15: 555-5555, Tron, June 30th, Björk Remix==
In 2014, patten threw a series of club nights with live electronic music and DJs at Dalston’s [[Power Lunches]] under the name 555-5555.  The events were held in the basement venue with the group’s signature heavy smoke machine and a minimal single video projection as lighting.  The lineups featured sets from artists such as Logos, Karen Gwyer, Slackk, SFV Acid, Darkstar, Visionist, Fotomachine and Max Tundra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=555-5555 at Power Lunches, 27/06/14|url=http://www.dummymag.com/Read/555-5555-at-power-lunches-27-06-14/|publisher=DummyMag|date = 11 July 2014 | accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="justyna-wichowska-160grams"/&gt; Across late 2015 and early 2016, numerous design works attributed to 555-5555 with it expanding in 2017 into a creative agency including members of patten, and visual collaborator Jane Easlight.  555-5555 work unrestricted across forms, creating anything from graphic design for Disney’s Tron run/R soundtrack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giorgio Moroder’s 'Tron Run/r Original Soundtrack' Out Now|url=http://www.emusician.com/artists/1333/giorgio-moroders-tron-runr-original-soundtrack-out-now/58319/|publisher=emusician|date = 2 June 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 555-5555 branded apparel, events, software, an NTS radio show, ongoing art direction for Dan Snaith (Caribou)’s Daphni and Jiaolong label, and pointed online videos encouraging their fans to engage in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen to patten’s mind-altering new album|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/32810/1/patten-psi-album-stream-interview/|publisher=Dazed|date = 12 September 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

patten contributed to Doug Aitken's Station to Station project, recording 'June 30th', an EP of new music created from found sound and improvised percussion made in one day at the [[Barbican Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch LoneLady and patten create Brutalist Music at the VF Studio|url=http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-films/watch-lonelady-and-patten-create-brutalist-music-at-the-vf-studio/|publisher=Vinyl Factory|date = 30 July 2015 | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, patten created several remixes for artists like [[Giorgio Moroder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giorgio Moroder’s 'Tron Run/r Original Soundtrack' Out Now|url=http://www.emusician.com/artists/1333/giorgio-moroders-tron-runr-original-soundtrack-out-now/58319/|publisher=E Musician|date = 2 June 2016 | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Björk]]. Their remix of her song Stonemilker was released as a single-sided 12" clear vinyl single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Björk Shares Third Installment of Vulnicura Remixes|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/60247-bjork-shares-third-installment-of-vulnicura-remixes/|publisher=Pitchfork|date = 1 October 2015 | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016-17: Ψ (Psi) LP &amp; Requiem EP==
On September 16, 2016, their third album Ψ [[Psi (letter)|(Psi)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=patten announces new album Ψ - shares razor-sharp 'Sonne'|url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/07/14/patten-new-album-%CF%88-psi-sonne/|publisher=Fact Magazine|date = 14 July 2016 | accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=patten Return With New Album Ψ|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/07/15/patten-return-with-new-album-ii/|publisher=The Fader|date = 15 July 2016 | accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released with the vocals of a member known as A featured heavily across the record. A first appeared publicly in Jane Eastlight’s 2014 ‘Winter Strobing’ video and was later seen performing in patten at the Warp25 concert in Poland (alongside Battles, Autechre, LFO and others) and later Baleapop in France, Fields Moscow and [[Electrowerkz]] London for a [[Alexander McQueen (brand)#McQ|McQ]] launch event.  A number of highly distinctive videos were released for album tracks Sonne (Matilda Finn), Epsilon (Werkflow), Dialler (555-5555), along with animation and video for each track made by 555-5555 for their immersive AV show which had at this point expanded to include a full custom video system, lasers, LEDs, smoke machines, live electronic drums and digitally processed vocals. In December 2016, patten released the first in a two part series of live session videos directed by Greg Barnes capturing their live AV show in a cinematic style echoing the sci-fi [[Science fiction]] feel of their performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commute Through Dystopia With patten’s Unnerving New Video|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/09/21/patten-epilson-video/|publisher=The Fader|date = 21 September 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch patten face the future in an exclusive video|url=https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/watch-an-exclusive-music-video-with-warp-signed-duo-patten/|publisher=Red Bull|date = 30 Nov 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, following Psi by 6 months patten released Requiem, a four track digital-only EP.  Music videos for each of the tracks were made available on release day via YouTube.  Requiem saw a further distillation of their sound, with dry sonics and heavily treated hip-hop-inflected vocals coming to the fore.  The EP preceded a headline show at London’s ICA, where the group programmed screenings and installations and a 555-5555 pop up store alongside their AV performance. Screenings of art films at the event included [[Turner Prize]] winner [[Mark Leckey]], Muntean/Rosenblum, and others.  In late summer, an autumn AV tour across the UK, Europe, and Mexico was announced.

In September, they announced their contribution to work on beta testing spectral processing software created by U.S.-based software developers Unfiltered Audio for Plugin Alliance.  patten produced a number of presets bundled with the software download alongside electronic composers such as [[Richard Devine]], and [[Arovane|Uwe Zahn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Duo patten’s New EP Is an Agitated ‘Requiem’ for the World|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/785exg/pattens-requiem-stream-interview/|publisher=Red Bull|date = 12 May 2017 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warp duo patten headline a night of leftfield electronics at London's iconic ICA|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/915655/|publisher=Resident Advisor|date = 19 April 2017 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfiltered Audio says that SpecOps can help you to achieve ‘full spectrum dominance’|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/unfiltered-audio-says-that-specops-can-help-you-to-achieve-full-spectrum-dominance|publisher=Music Radar|date = 19 September 2017 | accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Penobscot''' (''Panawahpskek'') are an indigenous peoples in North America with members who reside in the United States and Canada. They are organized as a [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized tribe]] in [[Maine]] and as a [[First Nations]] [[band government]] in the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]] and [[Quebec]]. 

The ''Penobscot Nation'', formerly known as the ''Penobscot Tribe of Maine,'' is the federally recognized [[Tribe (Native American)|tribe]] of Penobscot in the United States.&lt;ref name=ncai&gt;[http://www.ncai.org/tribal-directory?letter=P "Tribal Directory"]. ''National Congress of American Indians''. Retrieved 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They are part of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]], along with the [[Abenaki]], [[Passamaquoddy]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Mi'kmaq]] nations, all of whom historically spoke [[Algonquian languages]]. Their main settlement is now the [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation]], located within the state of Maine along the [[Penobscot River]].

==Name==

The word "Penobscot" originates from a mispronunciation of their name for themselves: ''Penawapskewi.'' The word means "rocky part" or "descending ledges," and originally referred to their territory on the portion of the [[Penobscot River]] between present-day [[Old Town, Maine|Old Town]] and [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]]. 

==Government==
The Penobscot Nation is headquartered in [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation]], Maine. The tribal chief is Kirk Francis.&lt;ref name=ncai/&gt; The vice-chief is Bill Thompson.

==History==
===Pre-contact===

Little is known about the Penobscot before their contact with [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonizers]]. Indigenous peoples are thought to have inhabited Maine and surrounding areas for at least 11,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wabanakis of Maine and the Maritimes''. [[American Friends Service Committee]], 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; They had a hunting-gathering society, with the men hunting beaver, otters, moose, bears, caribou, fish, seafood (clams, mussels, fish), birds, and possibly marine mammals such as seals. The women gathered and processed bird eggs, berries, nuts, and roots, all of which were found locally.&lt;ref name="wmm"&gt;''Wabanakis of Maine and the Maritimes''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The people practiced some agriculture but not to the same extent as that of indigenous peoples in southern [[New England]], where the climate was more temperate.&lt;ref&gt;James Francis. "Burnt Harvest: Penobscot People and Fire", ''Maine History'' 44, 1 (2008) 4-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Food was potentially scarce only toward the end of the winter, in February and March. For the rest of the year, the Penobscot and other Wabanaki likely had little difficulty surviving because the land and ocean waters offered much bounty, and the number of people was sustainable.&lt;ref name="wmm"/&gt; The bands moved seasonally, following the patterns of game and fish.

===Contact and colonization===
[[File:Sarah molasses penobscot.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Sarah Molasses, c.1886, daughter of [[Old John Neptune|John Neptune]] and Molly Molasses, collection of [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]]]]

During the 15th century the Penobscot had contact with Europeans through the [[fur trade]]. It was lucrative and the Penobscot were willing to trade pelts for European goods such as metal axes, guns, and copper or iron cookware. Hunting for fur pelts reduced the game, however, and the European trade introduced alcohol to Penobscot communities for the first time. It has been argued that the people are genetically vulnerable to alcoholism, which Europeans frequently tried to exploit in dealings and trade. Penobscot people and other nations made pine beer, which had vitamin C; in addition to being an alcoholic beverage, it had the benefit of allaying the onset of [[scurvy]].  

When Europeans arrived, they brought alcohol in quantity. Europeans may have slowly developed enzymes, metabolic processes, and social mechanisms for dealing with a normalized high intake of alcohol, but Penobscot people, though familiar with alcohol, had never had access to the gross quantity of alcohol that Europeans offered. 

The Europeans carried endemic infectious diseases of Eurasia that were new to the Native Americans, and the Penobscot had no acquired immunity. Their fatality rates from the introduction of [[measles]], [[smallpox]] and other infectious diseases was high. The population also declined due to fighting between the Wabanaki Federation and the powerful [[Mohawk people]] of the [[Iroquois]] League, which struggled to control the fur trade. This catastrophic population depletion may have contributed to Christian conversion (among other factors); the people could see that the European priests did not suffer from the pandemics. The latter said that the Penobscot had died because they did not believe in Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name="wmm"/&gt;

At the beginning of the 17th century, Europeans began to live year-round in Wabanaki territory.&lt;ref name="wmm"/&gt; At this time, there were probably about 10,000 Penobscot (a number which fell to below 500 by the early 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penobscotnation.org/museum/pana'wahb'skk'eighistory.htm "History"], ''Penobscot Nation''.&lt;/ref&gt; As contact became more permanent, after about 1675, conflicts arose through differences in cultures, conceptions of property, and competition for resources. Along the Atlantic Coast in present-day Canada, most settlers were French; in New England they were generally English speaking. 

The Penobscot sided with the French during the [[French and Indian War]] in the mid-18th century (the North American front of the [[Seven Years' War]]) after the English refusal to respect the Penobscots' intended neutrality. With the [[Spencer Phips]] proclamation of 1755,&lt;ref&gt;[https://upstanderproject.org/firstlight/phips/ Phips Bounty Proclamation]&lt;/ref&gt; the British colonies put a bounty on the scalps of all Penobscot. With a smaller population and greater acceptance of intermarriage, the French posed a lesser threat to the Penobscots' land and way of life.&lt;ref name="wmm"/&gt;

After the English defeated French colonists in the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Battle of Quebec]] in 1759, the Penobscot were left in a weakened position. During the [[American Revolution]], the Penobscot sided with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] and played an important role in defending against British offensives from Canada. But, the new American government did not seem to recognize their contributions. Anglo-American settlers continued to encroach on Penobscot lands. &lt;ref name="wmm"/&gt;

In the following centuries, the Penobscot attempted to make treaties in order to hold on to some form of land, but, because they had no power of enforcement in [[Massachusetts]] or Maine, Americans kept encroaching on their lands. From about 1800 onward, the Penobscot lived on [[Indian reservation|reservations]], specifically, Indian Island, which is an island in the Penobscot River near Old Town, Maine. The Maine state government appointed a [[Indian agent|Tribal Agent]] to oversee the tribe. The government believed that they were helping the Penobscot, as stated in 1824 by the highest court in Maine that "...imbecility on their parts, and the dictates of humanity on ours, have necessarily prescribed to them their subjection to our paternal control."&lt;ref name="wmm"/&gt; This sentiment of "imbecility" set up a power dynamic in which the government treated the Penobscot as wards of the state and decided how their affairs would be managed. The government treated as charitable payments those Penobscot funds derived from land treaties and trusts, which the state had control over and used as it saw fit.&lt;ref name="wmm"/&gt;

===Land claims===
In 1790, the young United States government enacted the [[Nonintercourse Act]], which stated that the transfer of reservation lands to non-tribal members had to be approved by the [[United States Congress]]. Between the years of 1794 and 1833, the Penobscot and [[Passamaquoddy]] tribes ceded the majority of their lands to Massachusetts (then to Maine after it became a state in 1820) through treaties that were never ratified by the US Senate and that were illegal under the constitution, as only the federal government had the power to make such treaties. They were left only the [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation]]. 

In the 1970s, at a time of increasing assertions of sovereignty by Native Americans, the Penobscot Nation sued the state of Maine for [[Aboriginal title in the United States|land claims]], calling for some sort of compensation in the form of land, money, and autonomy for the state's violation of the Nonintercourse Act in the 19th century. The disputed land accounted for 60% of all of the land in Maine, and 35,000 people (the vast majority of whom were not tribal members) lived in the disputed territory. 

The Penobscot and the state reached a settlement, [[Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton#Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act|Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act]] (MICSA), in 1980, resulting in an $81.5-million-dollar settlement that the Penobscot could use to acquire more tribal land. The terms of the settlement provided for such acquisition, after which the federal government would hold some of this land in trust for the tribe, as is done for reservation land. The tribe could also purchase other lands in the regular manner. The act established the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission, whose function was to oversee the effectiveness of the Act and to intervene in certain areas such as fishing rights, etc. in order to settle disputes between the state and the Penobscot or Passamaquoddy.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Scully. "Maine Indian Claims Settlement: Concepts, Contexts, and Perspectives". 14 February 1995, Abbe Museum. {{cite web |url=http://www.abbemuseum.org/d_scully_landclaims.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015125618/http://abbemuseum.org/d_scully_landclaims.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is a federally recognized sovereign nation with direct relations with the federal government, the Penobscot have disagreed with state assertions that it has the power to regulate hunting and fishing by tribal members. The Nation filed suit against the state in August 2012, contending in ''Penobscot Nation v. State of Maine,'' that the 1980 MICSA settlement gave the Nation jurisdiction and regulatory authority over hunting and fishing in the “Main Stem” of the Penobscot River as well as on its reservation.&lt;ref name="ict"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/05/congress-members-support-penobscot-v-maine-unprecedented-court-filing-160253 Gale Courey Toensing, "Congress Members Support 'Penobscot v. Maine' in Unprecedented Court Filing."], ''Indian Country Today'', 5 May 2015, accessed 5 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the request of the Nation, the US Department of Justice has joined the suit on behalf of the tribe. In addition, in an unprecedented step, five Native American congressional representatives from other jurisdictions filed an ''[[Amicus curiae|amici curiae]]'' brief in support of the Penobscot in this case. In addition to its reservation, the Nation owns islands in the river extending {{Convert|60|mi|abbr=on}} upriver; it also acquired hundreds of thousands of acres of land elsewhere in the state, as a result of the 1980 settlement of its land claim. Some analysts predict that this case will be as significant to [[Native American civil rights|Indian law and sovereignty]] as the fishing rights cases of Native American tribes in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the 1970s, which resulted in the [[United States v. Washington|1974 Boldt decision]] affirming their rights to fishing and hunting in their former territories.&lt;ref name="ict"/&gt; The five members of the Congressional Native American Caucus who filed are [[Betty McCollum]] (D-MN), co-chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus with [[Tom Cole]] (R-OK) ([[Chickasaw]]); [[Raúl Grijalva]], (D-AZ), vice chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus; [[Ron Kind]] (D-WI), vice chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus; and [[Ben Ray Luján]] (D-NM), vice chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus.

==Language==
Penobscot people historically spoke a dialect of [[Abenaki language|Eastern Abenaki]], an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]]. It is very similar to the languages of the other members of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. There are no fluent speakers and the last known Penobscot speaker of Eastern Abenaki died in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt; A dictionary was compiled. The elementary school and the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]] on Indian Island are making an effort to reintroduce the language by teaching it to the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url= http://www.penobscotnation.org/PNBGC/index.htm
 |title=Penobscot Nation Boys &amp; Girls Club
 |work=penobscotnation.org
 |accessdate=14 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The written Penobscot language was developed with a modified [[Latin script|Roman alphabet]]; distinct characters have been developed to represent sounds that do not exist in the Roman alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iis.bia.edu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012093150/http://www.iis.bia.edu/ |archivedate=2009-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1643, [[Roger Williams]] wrote ''[[A Key into the Language of America]]''. In this work, Williams explained that the [[Narragansett language|language of the Narragansett]] people (and tribes they'd overtaken or forced into submission) used a language differing only from the northern Algonquian people, in dialect. He wrote that if one tribe's language was known, communication with the other tribe was possible; this was the case all the way north to remote areas of [[Labrador]]. Natives in Labrador spoke Algonquian and the Labrador neighbors were of same linguistic stock as the Narragansett tribe. (Williams wrote that this was not the case with the drastically different [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois language]].) Fluent in many languages, Williams explained his knowledge of the native tongue developed due to a childhood move with his family to a native settlement in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]] where his playmates were all natives. Later he lived with native people to improve his native language skill before embarking on missionary work and authoring prayer conversion booklets. His opinion, Williams wrote, was that the Narragansett (hence the Algonquian) in many cases had words that were Hebrew or in a few cases Greek that he recognized from his work in old Hebrew and Greek biblical text translations. His book ''A Key into the Language of America'' includes a phonetic English dictionary that Williams wished to publish so that his knowledge of this [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American language]] would not die with him.&lt;ref&gt;A Key into the Language of America. Roger Williams &amp; Howard Chapin. 1643 Gregory Dexter,London. Publisher,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual art==

===Baskets===
The Penobscot traditionally [[Basket weaving|made baskets]] out of [[Hierochloe odorata|sweet grass]], [[Fraxinus nigra|brown ash]], and [[birch bark]]. These materials grow in wetlands throughout Maine. However, the species are threatened due to habitat destruction and the [[emerald ash borer]]. This insect threatens to destroy all ash trees in Maine, much as it already has devastated ash forests in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. 

The baskets were traditionally made for practical use, but after European contact, the Penobscot began making "fancy baskets" for trade with the Europeans. Basket-making is traditionally a woman's skill passed down in families. Many members of the tribe have been learning traditional forms and creating new variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penobscotnation.org/culture/Index.htm|title=Penobscot Nation|first=Super|last=User|website=www.penobscotnation.org|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birchbark canoes===
The [[birch bark]] canoe was at one time an important mode of transportation for all nations of the Wabanaki Confederacy. Each nation makes a characteristic shape of canoe. The vessels are each made from one piece of bark from a [[Betula papyrifera|white birch]] tree. If done correctly, the large piece of bark can be removed without killing the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penobscotriver.org/content/4060/Birch_Bark_Canoe/|title=Penobscot River Restoration Project - Birch Bark Canoe|website=www.penobscotriver.org|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Penobscot tradition describes [[Glooscap|Gluskabe]] as the creator of man and women. Legends which explained phenomena such as the wind and the growing of corn were passed down by oral tradition among the generations. The French missionaries and colonists converted many Penobscot people to [[Christianity]]. In the 21st century, some members practice traditional religion; others on Indian Island are Catholic or Protestant.&lt;ref name="wmm"/&gt;

==Gambling==
In 1973 the nation opened Penobscot High Stakes Bingo on Indian Island. This was one of the first commercial gambling operations on a reservation in the United States. Bingo is open one weekend every six weeks. The Penobscot tribe has pushed for state legislation allowing them to add slot machines to their bingo hall, but it has not been granted it thus far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penobscotbingo.com/|title=Townsquare Interactive|website=penobscotbingo.com|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre-Clément de Laussat''' (23 November 1756 &amp;ndash; 10 April 1835) was a [[France|French]] politician, and the 24th Colonial [[List of colonial governors of Louisiana|Governor of Louisiana]], the last under French rule. He later served as colonial official in [[Martinique]] and [[French Guiana]], as well as an administrator in France and Antwerp.

== Biography ==
Laussat was born in the town of [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]. After serving as ''receveur général des finances'' in Pau and [[Bayonne]], he was imprisoned during [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]], but was released and recruited in the ''armée des Pyrénées''. On April 17, 1797, he was elected to the [[Council of Ancients]]. After the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]], he entered the [[Tribunat#French revolutionary tribunat|Tribunat]] on December 25, 1798.

He was appointed by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] to be colonial prefect (governor) of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] in 1802 and arrived in the colony on March 26, 1803, just two weeks before Bonaparte made his decision to sell Louisiana to the [[United States]].  Laussat was initially only to be the interim head of Louisiana until arrival of the Governor General [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]] appointed by Bonaparte. However, when Bonaparte rejected Bernadotte's request for additional settlers and support for the posting, Bernadotte declined the governorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00974220/document | title = Bernadotte, Bonaparte, and Louisiana: the last dream of a French Empire in North America | first = Jean-Marc | last = Olivier | date = 2010 | editor-last = Belaubre | editor-first = Christope | editor-last2 = Dym | editor-first2 = Jordana | editor-last3 = Savage | editor-first3 = John | book-title = Napoleon's Atlantic: The Impact of Napoleonic Empire in the Atlantic World | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden, Netherlands | pages = 141–150 | format = PDF | isbn = 978-9004181540 | access-date = 11 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This left Laussat ruling as governor for several months, during which time he abolished the local ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' and then published the [[Napoleonic Code]] in the colony.

Within several months, Laussat heard that [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana had been sold to the U.S.]] but he did not believe it. On July 28, 1803, he wrote to the French government to inquire whether the rumor was true. On August 18, 1803, he received word from Bonaparte that France had declared war on [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and that he was to transfer [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] to the United States.&lt;ref name="Langlois2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langlois|first1=Gilles-Antoine|title=La Nouvelle Orleans: Etat Sommaire des Espaces Urbains et Sociaux a l'Époque de Pierre Clement des Laussat (Mars 1803-Avril 1804)|trans-title=New Orleans: Summary of the State of Urban and Social Spaces at the Time of Pierre Clement de Laussat (March 1803-April 1804)|language=French|journal=French Colonial History|volume=5|issue=1|year=2004|pages=111–124|issn=1543-7787|doi=10.1353/fch.2004.0009|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/168098|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodriguez|first=Junius P.|title=The Louisiana Purchase: A Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qs7GAwwdzyQC|accessdate=2 November 2018|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-1-57607-188-5|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 1803, Laussat served as commissioner of the French government in the retrocession of Louisiana from [[Spain]] to [[French First Republic|France]]. A few weeks later, on December 20, 1803, Laussat transferred the colony to the U.S. representatives, [[William C.C. Claiborne]] and [[James Wilkinson]].

On April 21, 1804, Laussat left Louisiana to become colonial prefect of [[Martinique]], serving until 1809 when he was captured and imprisoned by the British. 

In 1810, Laussat returned to France and sought a new governmental posting. He was sent to the [[French Netherlands]] to oversee the port of occupied Antwerp (1810–1812) and then to serve as prefect of [[Jemmape (department)|Jemmape]] (1812–1814). During the [[Hundred Days]], he served as prefect of [[Pas-de-Calais]] until the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Une Lettre de Pierre-Clément de Laussat Concernant la Situation Religieuse en Béarn (1788)|language=French|trans-title=A Letter from Pierre-Clément de Laussat Concerning the Religious Situation in Béarn (1788)|last=Staes|first=Jacques|date=April 2003|url=http://www.cepb.eu/Accueil/Articles/BULL33_J_Staes.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Centre d'Etude du Protestantisme Béarnais|issue=33|pages=23-25|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''religious views of William Shakespeare''' are the subject of an ongoing scholarly debate dating back more than 150 years. The general assumption about [[William Shakespeare]]'s religious affiliation is that he was a conforming member of the established [[Anglican Church]]. However, many scholars have speculated about his personal religious beliefs, based on analysis of the historical record and of his published work, with claims that Shakespeare's family may have had [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] sympathies and that he himself was a secret Catholic. Other scholars have speculated that he was an atheist.  Due to the paucity of direct evidence, no general agreement has been reached.

==Shakespeare's known religious affiliation==

Shakespeare and his immediate family were conforming members of the established [[Church of England]]. When Shakespeare was young, his father, [[John Shakespeare]], was elected to several municipal offices, serving as an [[alderman]] and culminating in a term as [[bailiff]], the chief magistrate of the [[Town council#United Kingdom|town council]], all of which required being a church member in good standing, and he participated in whitewashing over the Catholic images in the chapel and taking down the [[rood screen]]. Shakespeare's birth and that of his siblings were entered into the church register, as were the births of his three children and the burials of his family members. His brother [[Edmund Shakespeare|Edmund]], who followed him to London as an actor and died there, was buried in [[Southwark Cathedral|St Saviour's]] in [[Southwark]] "with a forenoone knell of the great bell", most likely paid for by the poet. As leaser of the parish tithes in Stratford, he was a [[Laity |lay]] [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]] of the church. He and his wife were buried in the church chancel, and a [[Shakespeare's funerary monument|monument]] that included a half-figure bust of the poet was set into the north wall of the chancel.

Shakespeare failed twice to pay his taxes for [[St Helen's Church, Bishopsgate|St Helen's parish]], Bishopsgate, London, where he is listed by name for the year 1596/7, and he is not among those “in any of the annual lists of residents of the Clink parish (St Saviour’s) compiled by the officers who made the rounds to collect tokens purchased by churchgoers for Easter Communion, which was compulsory.”&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Schoenbaum, William Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life, 221-23.&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation is offered by historian [[Walter Godfrey]], who suggests that the playwright's default at Bishopsgate was simply because he had moved to the Clink parish at the end of that year, where taxes were collected by the landowner (the bishop of Winchester) and not parish officials. The bishop then remitted the outstanding sum to Shakespeare's former parish "as a matter of convenience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Godfrey|first1=Walter|editor1-last=Roberts|editor1-first=Howard|title=Survey of London|date=1950|publisher=London County Council|location=London|chapter=The Bankside Playhouses and Bear Gardens|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakespeare's family==
In 1559, five years before Shakespeare's birth, the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] finally severed the [[Church of England]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In the ensuing years, extreme pressure was placed on England's Catholics to accept the practices of the Church of England, and [[recusancy]] laws made illegal any service not found in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', including the Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)#Mass in the Roman Catholic Church|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars also believe there is evidence that several members of Shakespeare's family were recusant Catholics. The strongest evidence is a tract professing secret Catholicism signed by [[John Shakespeare]], father of the poet. The tract was found in the 18th century in the rafters of a house which had once been John Shakespeare's, and was seen and described by the reputable scholar [[Edmond Malone]]. Malone later changed his mind and declared that he thought the tract was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Schoenbaum (1977: 49) "In my conjecture concerning the writer of that paper I certainly was mistaken".&lt;/ref&gt; Although the document has since been lost, Anthony Holden writes that Malone's reported wording of the tract is linked to a testament written by [[Charles Borromeo]] and circulated in England by [[Edmund Campion]], copies of which still exist in Italian and English.&lt;ref name="holdshak"&gt;Holden, Anthony. [http://www.hbgusa.com/books/64/0316518492/chapter_excerpt10046.html ''William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215022745/http://www.hbgusa.com/books/64/0316518492/chapter_excerpt10046.html |date=15 December 2007 }} Little, Brown (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Other research, however, suggests that the Borromeo testament is a 17th-century artefact (at the earliest dated from 1638), was not printed for missionary work, and could never have been in the possession of John Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;Bearman, R., "John Shakespeare's Spiritual Testament, a reappraisal", ''Shakespeare Survey 56 [2003]'' pp 184–204.&lt;/ref&gt; John Shakespeare was listed as one who did not attend church services, but this was "for feare of processe for Debtte", according to the commissioners, not because he was a recusant.&lt;ref&gt;Mutschmann, H. and Wentersdorf, K.,  ''Shakespeare and Catholicism'', Sheed and Ward: New York, 1952, p.&amp;nbsp;401.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's mother, [[Mary Shakespeare|Mary Arden]], was a member of a conspicuous and determinedly Catholic family in [[Warwickshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Shakespeare's schooling ==

Four of the six schoolmasters at the grammar school of Shakespeare's youth, King's New School in Stratford, were Catholic sympathisers,&lt;ref name=ackroy2&gt;Ackroyd (2005: 63–64)&lt;/ref&gt; and Simon Hunt, who may have been one of Shakespeare's teachers, later became a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest.&lt;ref name="hhh20023"&gt;[[Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel|Hammerschmidt-Hummel, H.]] [http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/nec/ham-hu1223.htm "The most important subject that can possibly be": A Reply to E. A. J. Honigmann], ''Connotations'', 2002-3. Retrieved 3 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Jenkins, who succeeded Hunt as teacher in the grammar school, was a student of [[Edmund Campion]] at [[St John's College, Oxford]].  Jenkins's successor at the grammar school in 1579, John Cottam, was the brother of Jesuit priest [[Thomas Cottam]].

== The "lost years" (1585–1592) ==

[[John Aubrey]], in 1693, reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster,&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum (1977: 110–11)&lt;/ref&gt; a tale augmented in the 20th century with the theory that his employer might have been Alexander Hoghton of [[Lancashire]],&lt;ref name="oakshaf2"&gt;Oakes, Edward T. [http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=3249 "Shakespeare’s Millennium"] ''First Things'', December 1999. Retrieved 3 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent Catholic landowner who left money in his will to a certain "William Shakeshafte", referencing theatrical costumes and paraphernalia.&lt;ref&gt;Honigmann E. A. J. (1999). ''Shakespeare: The Lost Years.'' Revised Edition. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1. {{ISBN|0-7190-5425-7}}; Wells, ''Oxford Shakespeare'', xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's grandfather Richard had also once used the name Shakeshafte. [[Peter Ackroyd]] adds that examinations of the marginal notes in the Hoghton family copy of [[Edward Hall]]'s ''Chronicles'', an important source for Shakespeare's early histories, "indicate the probability that Shakespeare and the annotator were the same man, but do not by any means prove it."&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (2005: 76)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catholic sympathies ==

=== Possible Catholic wedding ===
Shakespeare's marriage to [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare's wife)|Anne Hathaway]] in 1582 may have been officiated by, amongst other candidates, John Frith in the town of [[Temple Grafton]] a few miles from Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum (1977: 87)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1586 the crown named Frith, who maintained the appearance of Protestantism, as a Catholic priest.&lt;ref name="William marries Anne Hathaway"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/shakespeare/events/event92.html William marries Anne Hathaway] ''In Search of Shakespeare'', PBS. (MayaVision International 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Some surmise Shakespeare married in Temple Grafton rather than the Anglican church in Stratford in order for his wedding to be performed as a Catholic sacrament. He was thought to have rushed his marriage ceremony, as Anne was three months pregnant.&lt;ref name="William marries Anne Hathaway"/&gt;

===Historical sources===
In 1611 the historian [[John Speed]] asserted Shakespeare's links with Catholicism, accusing him of satirising in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' the [[Lollard]] (or proto-Protestant) martyr [[John Oldcastle]] (first portrayed by Shakespeare under his character's real name, then the alias [[John Falstaff]] after complaints from Oldcastle's descendants) and linking the playwright with Jesuit [[Robert Persons]], describing them together as "the Papist and his poet". Modern critics have attributed other motives for Shakespeare's portrayal; the story of Oldcastle was a popular one and telling the tale from the "Papist" perspective (while acknowledging that perhaps this was a perspective with which Shakespeare already had some affinity) was an effective and familiar way to bring it to his audience.&lt;ref name=rvy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnlocke.org/acrobat/articles/rvyoung.pdf|title=Decoding Shakespeare: The Bard as Poet or Politician|last=Young|first=Robert V.|authorlink=Robert V.

[[Archdeacon]] Richard Davies, a 17th-century Anglican cleric, wrote of Shakespeare: "He dyed a Papyst". The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1912) states that "Davies, an Anglican clergyman, could have had no conceivable motive for misrepresenting the matter in these private notes and as he lived in the neighbouring county of Gloucestershire he may be echoing a local tradition" but concludes that Davies' comment "is by no means incredible, but it would obviously be foolish to build too much upon an unverifiable tradition of this kind".&lt;ref name="CErelshakes"&gt;Thurston, Herbert.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13748c.htm "The Religion of Shakespeare"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1912).

Following E. K. Chambers and Ian Wilson, [[Joseph Pearce]] maintains that one of the most compelling pieces of evidence is Shakespeare's purchase of Blackfriars Gatehouse, a place that had remained in Catholic hands since the time of the Reformation, and was notorious for Jesuit conspiracies, [[priest hole]]s to hide fugitives, and covert Catholic activity in London.&lt;ref&gt;E.

Shakespeare's daughter Susanna, who inherited the house, continued his tenancy until 1639.&lt;ref&gt;Beauregard, David (2008). Catholic Theology in Shakespeare’s Plays. Newark: U Delaware P. p. 87. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-002-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Schoenbaum|Schoenbaum]], however, assigns a purely fiscal motive to the purchase: after examining the complex financial arrangements surrounding the transaction he concludes, "an investment, pure and simple".&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum (1977: 272)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textual evidence===
An increasing number of scholars look to evidence from Shakespeare’s work, such as the placement of young Hamlet as a student at [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]] while old Hamlet's ghost is in [[purgatory]], as suggestive of a Catholic worldview,&lt;ref name="oakshaft"&gt;Oakes, Edward T.

Richard Desper, Elizabethan Review, Spring/Summer 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and many other instances.

More recently it has been suggested that Shakespeare was simply playing upon an English Catholic tradition, rather than actually being Catholic, and was using the symbolic nature of Catholic ceremony to embellish his own theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Groves|first=Beatrice|title=Texts and Traditions: Religion in Shakespeare, 1592–1604|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=2007|pages=4–6|isbn=0-19-920898-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary scholar [[David Daniell (author)|David Daniell]] arrives at a similar conclusion, but from the opposite direction: as a good Protestant Shakespeare used many [[Biblical allusions in Shakespeare|biblical allusions]] and quotations in his works, but only because his audience, well versed in the Bible in English, would quickly take his meaning.&lt;ref name="Daniell2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daniell|first=David|year=2001|title=Shakespeare and the Protestant Mind|journal=Shakespeare Survey|volume=54|pages=1–12|doi=10.1017/CCOL0521803411.001|quote=Shakespeare knew his English Bible well ... that suggests he was a good Protestant. [His] use of Bible references implies that he expected his audience and readers to take them on the spot, because they knew their English Bibles. The references were not intended to wait for explication by clever scholars}} Daniell cautions that Shakespeare's religious inclinations are not reliably deduced from his use of sources: Shakespeare knew [[Ovid]] and [[Plutarch]] well, but that didn't make him a [[Paganism|Pagan]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, David Beauregard points out that the plays echo both Protestant and Catholic translations of the Bible, with some forty verbal correspondences to the 1582 [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Rheims New Testament]], and they also conflict with the [[The Books of Homilies|Elizabethan Homilies]] on at least ten theological topics, such as purgatory, prayers for the dead, indulgences, pilgrimages, merit, auricular confession and satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Beauregard, David (2008), pp. 24–39, 157–85&lt;/ref&gt; Schoenbaum suspects Catholic sympathies of some kind or another in Shakespeare and his family, but considers the writer himself to be a less than pious person with essentially worldly motives: "...the artist takes precedence over the votary".&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum (1977: 60–61):&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary scholar and Jesuit Father [[Peter Milward]] and the writer [[Clare Asquith]] are among those who have written that Catholic sympathies are detectable in Shakespeare's works.&lt;ref&gt;Milward, Peter. ''The Catholicism of Shakespeare's Plays''. Tokyo: Renaissance Institute, Sophia University (1997); reprinted Southampton: Saint Austin Press (1997). {{ISBN|1-901157-10-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milward, Peter. ''Shakespeare the Papist''. Ann Arbor, MI: Sapientia Press (2005). {{ISBN|1-932589-21-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Asquith believed that Shakespeare uses terms such as "high" when referring to Catholic characters and "low" when referring to Protestants (the terms refer to their [[altar]]s) and "light" or "fair" to refer to Catholic and "dark" to refer to Protestant, a reference to certain clerical garbs. Asquith also detects in Shakespeare's work the use of a simple code used by the [[Jesuit]] underground in England which took the form of a mercantile terminology wherein priests were 'merchants' and souls were 'jewels', those pursuing them were 'creditors', and the [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] gallows, where the members of the underground died, was called 'the place of much trading'.&lt;ref name = shadow&gt;''Shadowplay: The Hidden Beliefs and Coded Politics of William Shakespeare'' (2005) by [[Clare Asquith]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuit underground used this code so their correspondences looked like innocuous commercial letters, and Asquith believed that Shakespeare also used this code.&lt;ref name = shadow/&gt; Asquith's conclusions, however, have met with considerable criticism and evidence of a hidden code has been called "dubious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackett|first=Helen |title=Shakespeare and Elizabeth: The Meeting of Two Myths|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|year=2009|page=236|isbn=978-0-691-12806-1|quote=Asquith's book received damning reviews from eminent academics...her assertion of a hidden code in his plays is highly dubious.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to professor Jeffrey Knapp, the work of scholars like Peter Milward, who believe that "the deepest inspiration in Shakespeare's plays is both religious and Christian", has had "little influence on recent Shakespeare scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knapp|first=Jeffrey|title=Shakespeare and Religions|editor=Holland, Peter|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2001|series=Shakespeare Survey|volume=54|page=61|chapter=The religion of players|isbn=978-0-521-80341-0|quote=Some scholars do assert that 'the deepest inspiration in Shakespeare's plays is both religious and Christian' (Peter Milward, ''Shakespeare's Religious Background'' (Chicago, 1973). p.274), but they have had little influence on recent Shakespeare scholarship, in large part because they tend to allegorize the plays crudely, as [[Debora Shuger|Shuger]] says.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Finnis]] and Patrick Martin have argued more recently that Catholic martyr [[Anne Line]] is the eponymous phoenix of ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]]'' and her husband Roger is the eponymous turtle.&lt;ref&gt;''Times Literary Supplement'', 18 April 2003, p.12-14&lt;/ref&gt; They believe, with Asquith, that the poem's 'bird of loudest lay' represents the composer [[William Byrd]] and that the crow is the Jesuit [[Henry Garnet]].&lt;ref&gt;Asquith, Clare, ''Shakespeare Newsletter'', 50, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revision of older plays===
Although Shakespeare commonly adapted existing tales, typically myths or works in another language, Joseph Pearce claims that ''King John'', ''King Lear'' and ''Hamlet'' were all works that had been done recently and in English with an anti-Catholic bias, and that Shakespeare's versions appear to be a refutation of the source plays.&lt;ref name=pearce181&gt;Pearce (2008: 181–182)&lt;/ref&gt; Pearce believes otherwise he would not have "reinvented the wheel", revisiting recent English plays.&lt;ref name=pearce181/&gt; Peter Milward is among those who hold the view that Shakespeare engaged in rebuttal of recent English "anti-Papist" works.&lt;ref name=pearce181/&gt; Again, David Beauregard points out that, in the Italian source for ''Measure for Measure,'' the secular heroine is seduced and finally married, but Shakespeare revises his characterisation, so that her counterpart Isabella becomes a Poor Clare novice who maintains her virginity and does not marry.&lt;ref&gt;Beauregard, David (2008: 71–74)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Jonathan Bate]] describes the process of ''[[King Leir|Leir]]''{{'s}} transformation into ''Lear'' as replacing the "external trappings of Christianity" with a [[pagan]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bate|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age: the Life, Mind and World of William Shakespeare|publisher=Penguin|location=London|year=2008|page=394|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that the devils plaguing "Poor Tom" in Shakespeare's version have the same names as the evil spirits in a book by [[Samuel Harsnett]], later Archbishop of York, that denounces the "fake" Catholic practice of [[exorcism]].&lt;ref&gt;From [[Samuel Harsnett|Harsnett, Samuel]] (1603). ''A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures'', quoted in Bate (2008: 154)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inscriptions at the Venerable English College===
The names "Arthurus Stratfordus Wigomniensis" and "Gulielmus Clerkue Stratfordiensis" are found within ancient inscriptions at the [[Venerable English College]], a seminary in Rome which has long trained Catholic clergy serving in Britain. Scholars have speculated that these names might be related to Shakespeare, who is alleged to have visited the city of Rome twice during his life.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Richard. [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1946356.ece "Cryptic signatures that ‘prove Shakespeare was a secret Catholic’"] ''The Times'', 22 December 2009.

One critic states, "One cannot quite speak of a consensus among Shakespeare scholars on this point, though the reluctance of some to admit the possibility of Catholicism in Shakespeare's family is becoming harder to maintain."&lt;ref&gt;Shell, Alison. "Why Didn't Shakespeare Write Religious Verse?", in Kozuka, Takashi and J. R.

T, Davidson, P.,  "Shakespeare and the Jesuits" ''Times Literary Supplement 16 March 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestantism==
In 1843, a presentation of Shakesperean religious extracts was published by Sir [[Frederick Beilby Watson]] and [[Frederic Dan Huntington]] as the ''[https://archive.org/details/religiousmoralse00shakiala Religious and Moral Sentences Culled from the Works of Shakespeare, Compared with Sacred Passages Drawn from Holy Writ]'''&lt;ref&gt;Hannibal Hamlin (2013), The Bible in Shakespeare, Oxford University Press. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an early work that, in contrast to Catholic-directed studies, sought for Protestant and Biblical allusions in the works of the writer. In Watson's words, this was carried out ''"by proving from Shakespeare's own writings, that he lived and died as a true protestant,"'' collecting ''"presumptive evidence that the tenets of the religion which he professed were not of the Roman Catholic persuasion."''

A century later, Shakespeare editor and historian [[A. L. Rowse]] wrote a biography of Shakespeare, where, similarly, he firmly asserted that the writer was not a secret Catholic, but a Protestant: "He was an orthodox, confirming member of the Church into which he had been baptised, was brought up and married, in which his children were reared and in whose arms he at length was buried".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowse|first=A. L.|title=William Shakespeare: a biography|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1963|page=43|isbn=0-06-013710-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare had also become the [[Godparent|godfather]] of William Walker in the Church of England, and he remembered his godson in his will with twenty shillings.&lt;ref&gt;Dympna Callaghan (2012), "Who Was William Shakespeare: An Introduction to the Life and Works", John Wiley &amp; Sons: ''"What we do know is that he was baptized in the Protestant Church of England, as everyone was after the accession of Elizabeth in 1558, that he was married in and buried in it, as were they. In 1608, Shakespeare found himself once again at the baptismal font when he became the godfather of William Walker, whom he remembered in his will with twenty shillings.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowse identifies anti-Catholic sentiment in [[Sonnet 124]], taking "the fools of time" in the last lines of this sonnet "To this I witness call the fools of time, which die for goodness who have lived for crime." to refer to the many Jesuits who were executed for treason in the years 1594-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowse|first=A. L|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|year=1964|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-36387-6|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to this, John Klause of [[Hofstra University]] accepts that Shakespeare intended "the fools of time" in the sonnet to represent executed Jesuits, but contends that the poet, by alluding to executed Jesuit [[Robert Southwell (jesuit)|Robert Southwell]]'s ''Epistle of Comfort'' and its glorification of martyrdom, sympathises with them. Klause maintains that Southwell's influence is also identifiable in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Klause (2008: 136)&lt;/ref&gt; A later assessment places Klause's interpretation as "against most recent trends".&lt;ref name="Schiffer1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiffer|first=James|title=Shakespeare's sonnets: critical essays|year=1999|publisher=Garland |location=New York|isbn=0-8153-2365-4|page=55|chapter=Reading new life into Shakespeare's sonnets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding Pearce's identification (above) of Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' as a reworking of ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John]]'', made to refute its anti-Catholic bias, strong examples of Protestant sympathies, such as the denouncement of the Pope as an "unworthy and ridiculous...Italian priest" with "usurped authority", remain in the text.&lt;ref&gt;''The life and death of King John:'' Act III, Scene 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yale]]'s David Kastan sees no inconsistency in a Protestant dramatist lampooning the martyr Oldcastle in the play ''Henry IV'' (above): a contemporary audience would have identified Shakespeare's unsympathetic portrayal as a proof of his Protestantism because the knight's [[Lollard]]ry was in the author's time identified with [[Puritanism]], by then abhorred for undermining the [[State religion|established church]].&lt;ref name="Kastan1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kastan|first=David Scott|title=Shakespeare after theory|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-90113-8|page=99|quote=the mark of a Protestant bias rather than a papist one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Greenblatt]] acknowledges the convention that the "equivocator" arriving at the gate of hell in the Porter's speech in ''[[Macbeth]]'' is a reference to the Jesuit [[Henry Garnet|Father Henry Garnet]], who had been executed in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt (2004: 388)&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that Shakespeare probably included the allusion for the sake of topicality, trusting that his audience would have heard of Garnet's pamphlet on [[Doctrine of mental reservation|equivocation]], and not from any hidden sympathy for the man or his cause – indeed the portrait is not a sympathetic one. Literary editor [[William Warburton|Bishop Warburton]] declared that in the mind of [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] playgoers the policy of equivocation, adopted as an official doctrine of the Jesuits, would have been a direct reminder of Catholic treason in the "[[Gunpowder plot]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntley|first=Frank|date=September 1964|title=''Macbeth'' and the background of Jesuitical equivocation|journal=Publications|publisher=[[Modern Language Association of America]]|location=New York|volume=79|issue=4|page=390|quote=...this kind of equivocation was in the public mind when Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'' was written in honor of the king who had escaped from the gunpowder.|doi=10.2307/460744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare may have also been aware of the "equivocation" concept which appeared as the subject of a 1583 tract by Queen Elizabeth's chief councillor [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], and the 1584 ''[[Doctrine of mental reservation#Mentalis restrictio in moral theology|Doctrine of Equivocation]]'' by the Spanish prelate [[Martin Azpilcueta]] that was disseminated across Europe and into England in the 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miola|first=Robert S|title=Early modern Catholicism: an anthology of primary sources|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-925985-4|page=82|quote=The practice of equivocation [drew] ridicule from all sides including even Shakespeare…[but] Continental theologians such as Martin Azpilcueta…justify the deception.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps Shakespeare's most direct reference in the plays to contemporary religious issues comes at the birth of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] in ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', during whose reign, as the character [[Thomas Cranmer|Archbishop Cranmer]], architect of the [[English Reformation|reformation]], predicts: "God shall be truly known".&lt;ref&gt;''Henry VIII'', Act V, Scene 5&lt;/ref&gt; The words in question, however, are generally attributed to Fletcher, and not directly attributable to Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;Cranmer's words here are now generally acknowledged to have been composed by Fletcher. See ''King Henry VIII'', ed. G. McMullan (London, 2000), footnote 5.4, page 427, "Critics invariably treat (or want to treat) this scene, with its climactic status, as Shakespeare's; attributional methods suggest, however, that it is a Fletcher scene."&lt;/ref&gt;

One perspective is that to deduce from the evidence a definite Anglican Shakespeare is to misapprehend the religious circumstances of the time, the word "Anglican" not existing until nearly two decades after the writer's death and contemporary historians not recognising Anglicanism as a firm organisation or religious identity during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Rist, Thomas, ''Shakespeare Now and Then: Communities, Religion, Reception'' in [https://books.google.com/books?id=aO142MTrZHIC&amp;dq Writing and religion in England, 1558–1689: studies in community-making and cultural memory], pp. 125–126, Roger D. Sell and Anthony W. Johnson eds., Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Maurice Hunt, Jean-Christophe Mayer and others have written of a Shakespeare with a [[syncretism|syncretic]] or hybrid faith, in some sense both Catholic and Protestant. [[Anthony Nuttall]] argues Shakespeare's work defies identification of precise religious influences because Shakespeare's ranging and restless mind played with many ideas, alternately promoting and challenging assumptions throughout the plays; in ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', Nuttall finds evidence of experimentation with heretical [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuttall|first=A. D.|authorlink=Anthony_Nuttall|title=Shakespeare the Thinker|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, London|year=2007|pages=12-24,262-76|isbn=978-0-300-11928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eamon Duffy points out that although the majority of Tudor people were muddled and uncertain, accepting of compromise and accommodation, "Religious diversity was not a notion to conjure with in Tudor England… Ritual and doctrinal diversity were evils, aspects of social and religious disunity."&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Eamon (1996).

=== Shakespeare's will ===
Beilby Watson (1843) as well as John Donnan Countermine (1906) argued that Shakespeare's religious beliefs could be studied taking into account his [[Will and testament|will]],&lt;ref&gt;John Donnan Countermine (1906), "[https://archive.org/details/religiousbelief00coungoog The Religious Belief of Shakespeare]", p. 30: ''Shakespeare believed thus in an overruling Providence... A short time before his death, Shakespeare made his will. After the introduction he says, " I commit my soul into the hands of God, my Creator..." Here as elsewhere Shakespeare speaks of himself as having a soul and a body.''&lt;/ref&gt; which states:

{{Quote|In the name of God, Amen. I, William Shakespeare..., in perfect health and memory, God be praised, do make and ordain this my last will and testament in manner and form following. That is to say, first, I commend my soul into the hands of God my Creator, hoping and assuredly believing, through the only merits of Jesus Christ my Saviour, to be made partaker of life everlasting, and my body to the earth whereof it is made.|[[s:Shakespeare's last will and testament|Shakespeare's last will and testament]], 25 March 1616&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in [[Standard English]], in Charles Knight, James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps Martin, Johnson, (1851). ''The Complete Works of Shakespeare, from the Original Text: Life of Shakespeare.'' p. LIII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Nye]] (2013), The Late Mr. Shakespeare. Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., Ch. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the opinion of David Kastan, "this is as close as we can get to an expression of [Shakespeare's] own belief, and might well be taken as conclusive evidence [by some people]". [[A. L. Rowse]] (2013), for instance, insisted that the statement in Shakespeare's Will shows a conformist position to Protestant religion.&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Rowse, as quoted in The Portsmouth Institute (2013). "Newman and the Intellectual Tradition: Portsmouth Review", Sheed &amp; Ward. p. 127: ''"He died, as he had lived, a conforming member of the Church of England. His will made that perfectly clear – in facts, puts it beyond dispute, for it uses the Protestant formula."''&lt;/ref&gt; Kastan discusses how some might see the phrase ''"through thonlie merittes of Jesus Christe"'' as a reference to the doctrine of ''[[solus Christus]]'', but at the same time he argues that the expression "might have become merely conventional by 1616, and have little or any theological import". Thus, he asserts that this can hardly be considered as an ultimate evidence to define Shakespeare's religious affiliation, since the preamble was formulaic in the epoch.&lt;ref&gt;David Scott Kastan (2014). "A Will to Believe: Shakespeare and Religion", Oxford University Press. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Park Honan]], in ''Shakespeare, A Life'' (1998), concurs with the view that Shakespeare's biblical references are essentially conformist, alluding to his use of the [[Bishop's Bible]] in his plays and religious activity in Protestant circles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Park Honan]]'s position in his ''Shakespeare: A Life'' (1998), as stated in The Portsmouth Institute (2013). "Newman and the Intellectual Tradition: Portsmouth Review", Sheed &amp; Ward. p. 128: ''""Honan is careful not to make surmises about what William himself believed. Outwardly, he conformed to the official state religion, as evidence in the use he made of the Bishop's Bible in his plays, in his attendance at Holy Trinity church and at various Protestant services for his family and friends: christenings, burials and marriages. Nothing in his later life suggests that he was other than a conformist in his religious practice."''&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics of the former point say that Church attendance cannot be taken as a conclusive proof because attendance at Protestant churches was mandatory in the epoch. Hence, Callaghan concludes that "we may not know decisively if Shakespeare was a Catholic, but crucially, neither do we know that he was a stalwart Protestant."&lt;ref&gt;Dympna Callaghan (2012), "Who Was William Shakespeare: An Introduction to the Life and Works", John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|9781118312278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atheism==

Shakespeare’s Christianity is not universally accepted. William Birch of Oxford University was, in 1848, probably the first to suggest that Shakespeare could be an [[atheism|atheist]], based on his interpretation of sentiments expressed in the works. His theory wasn't accepted by other scholars, however, and his contemporary [[Horace Howard Furness|H. H. Furness]] dismissed it as a "rare tissue of perverted ingenuity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Birch|first=William John|title=An Inquiry into the Philosophy and Religion of Shakspere|publisher=C Mitchell|location=London|year=1848|oclc=162952347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Howard Furness|Furness, H.H.]] (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-31BAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare: King Lear''].  Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co. (1880), p.135,  n. lines 156–169. [[OCLC]] 249150403&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence used to support this thesis was suggested by a notorious forger of historical documents, [[John Payne Collier]], who examined the records of [[Southwark Cathedral|St Saviour's, Southwark]], and found that Shakespeare, alone among his fellow [[Globe theatre|Globe]] actors, was not shown as a churchgoer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collier|first1=J Payne|title=Memoirs of the Principal Actors in Shakespeare's Plays|date=1846|publisher=The Shakespeare Society|location=London|page=xiii|quote=Either [Shakespeare] did not go to church and receive the sacrament, or…the absence of his name…may have some connexion with the question as to his religious tenets.|oclc=215517868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Pearce again offers the explanation of [[recusancy]], rather than evidence of atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce (2008: 126) "Such a conclusion misses the obvious and logical point... that Shakespeare remained... a believing Catholic". Pearce slightly mis-attributes Collier's findings to an earlier work: his ''The history of English dramatic poetry to the time of Shakespeare,'' of 1831, [[OCLC]] 558809.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Thurston]], writing in the 1912 edition of the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' questioned not only Shakespeare's Catholicism, but pondered "whether Shakespeare was not infected with the atheism, which, as we know from the testimony of writers as opposite in spirit as [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Robert Persons|[Robert] Persons]], was rampant in the more cultured society of the Elizabethan age."&lt;ref name="CErelshakes"/&gt;

In a 1947 essay, [[George Orwell]] wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;"The morality of Shakespeare's later tragedies is not religious in the ordinary sense, and certainly is not Christian. Only two of them, ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'', are supposedly occurring inside the Christian era, and even in those, apart from the antics of the ghost in ''Hamlet'', there is no indication of a ‘next world’ where everything is to be put right....  We do not know a great deal about Shakespeare's religious beliefs, and from the evidence of his writings it would be difficult to prove that he had any."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orwell|first=George|title=Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool|url=http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/lear/english/e_ltf|date=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Russian Shakespeare scholar [[Vadim Nikolayev]] has stated "that Shakespeare put forward anti-church ideas and did not consider suicide to be a sin", that he "skillfully avoided conflicts with censorship".&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.rus-shake.ru/file.php/id/f6173/name/Shakespeare_Readings_2008_Abstracts.pdf Shakespeare Readings 2008 : Paper Abstracts. Moscow, Publishing House of Moscow University for the Humanities, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolayev presented these theories in 2008, at an International Conference; it caused intense discussion, though the majority of participants disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Gaydin B.

==Paganism==
"''As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods. They kill us for their sport.''" - The Earl of Gloucester in ''[[King Lear]]'', Act 4 Scene 1

Shakespeare's very frequent references to [[Pagan]]istic gods and concepts, such as [[Hymen (god)|Hymen]] bringing about the resolution of ''[[As You Like It]]'', are not a reflection of his own belief but a necessary device to present deity on stage, where Christian figures were, in contrast to the presentation of the [[mystery play]]s of earlier times, prohibited. Some commonplace Christian allusions, involving no physical manifestation of religion, in [[Early texts of Shakespeare's works#Quarto|Quarto]] editions of the [[Shakespearean history|history cycle]] were replaced with harmless references to pagan gods when the [[First Folio]] appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richmond|first1=Hugh Macrae|title=Shakespeare's Theatre: A Dictionary of His Stage Context|publisher=Continuum|location=Oxford, England|isbn=9780826456403|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on Islam==
Shakespeare's views on [[Islam]] have been described by ''[[The Economist]]'' as "complex" and "multifaceted", and he "was ahead of his time in his sensitivity to the [[Islamic world]] and its inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=S.M.|title=Shakespeare and religion: Shakespeare’s complex views of the Islamic world|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/04/shakespeare-and-religion|accessdate=24 April 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the conclusion of Prof Matthew Dimmock, Shakespeare's depiction of Islam and Muslims "denied either scriptural congruence or religious coherence, embodied in the martially aggressive male."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Loewenstein|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Witmore|editor2-first=Michael|title=Shakespeare and Early Modern Religion|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107026612|pages=292–300|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's works included several Muslim characters, including Aaron the [[Moors|Moor]] in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', the Prince of Morocco in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and [[Othello (character)|Othello]] in the eponymous play. These works are said to have been inspired by several Moorish delegations from [[Morocco]] to [[Elizabethan England]] around 1600, such as that of [[Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud]].&lt;ref&gt;Professor Nabil Matar (April 2004), ''Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Stage Moor'', [[Sam Wanamaker]] Fellowship Lecture, Shakespeare's [[Globe Theatre]] ([[cf.]] [[Mayor of London]] (2006), [http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/publications/equalities/muslims-in-london.pdf Muslims in London], pp. 14-15, Greater London Authority)&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare also makes one explicit reference to [[Muhammad]], in ''Henry VI''.&lt;ref&gt;Henry VI Part One, Act 1 Scene 2. This demonstrates a knowledge of a contemporary fable (that Muhammad had trained a dove to nibble grain from his ear) rather than any insight into Islam: see {{cite book|last1=Brewer|first1=Ebenezer|title=Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|publisher=Wordsworth editions|edition=2001|isbn=1-84022-310-3|page=701|chapter=Mahomet's Dove|authorlink=Ebenezer Brewer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Rowena Bradley was born in 1922 to Nancy George Bradley (1881–1963) and Henry Bradley, and was the youngest of eight children.{{sfn|Fariello|2009|p=106}} She grew up on the Painttown Community's Swimmer Branch on the [[Qualla Boundary]].&lt;ref name="Fariello"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fariello|first1=Anna|title=Cherokee Basketry: From the Hands of our Elders|date=2009|publisher=The History Press|url=http://www.wcu.edu/library/DigitalCollections/CherokeeTraditions/People/Baskets_RowenaBradley.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowena created her first basket at the age of six.&lt;ref name="Fariello" /&gt; She learned weaving by observing her mother and her grandmother Mary Dobson (''Tahtahyeh'', b. ca. 1857), who were both accomplished basketmakers. While neither her mother or her grandmother spoke English, they sold their baskets outside the Qualla Boundary area, including Washington, D.C. and New York.

Bradley was also a student of basketweaver [[Lottie Queen Stamper]], who taught basketmaking at the Cherokee [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding school]].

== Method ==
Bradley crafted baskets from [[rivercane]] and was one of few weavers with knowledge of a double-weave technique, which she learned from her mother Nancy Bradley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wcudigitalcollection.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16232coll9/id/597|title=Rowena Bradley :: Cherokee Traditions|website=wcudigitalcollection.contentdm.oclc.org|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She quartered, peeled, and scraped the rivercane with a pocketknife. The dye materials she used were derived from local bark and roots such as butternut, black walnut and bloodroot.&lt;ref name="Fariello"/&gt; She wove patterns that she learned from her mother and also made her own designs.{{sfn|Fariello|2009|p=97}} Her favored designs are now known as Peace Pipe, Double Peace Pipe, and Chief's Daughter.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Power|first1=Susan C.|title=Art of the Cherokee: Prehistory to the Present|date=2007|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=978-0-8203-2766-2|pages=137, 202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPVEos7PKIgC&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=%22rowena%20bradley%22&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist John Parris described the process Bradley used in weaving, "working from memory, she forms the strips into patterns and then into baskets of all shapes and sizes. Early in the process of a double-weave pattern, literally scores of [[Withy|withes]] seem to fly out in all directions."{{sfn|Fariello|2009|p=80}} Bradley devised new types of baskets, including a Purse Basket for sales to tourists.&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt;

== Recognition ==
Bradley's basketry was featured in a 1974 exhibition at the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual in Cherokee, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wcu.edu/library/DigitalCollections/CherokeeTraditions/People/Baskets_RowenaBradley.html|title=Cherokee Traditions {{!}} People {{!}} Rowena Bradley|website=www.wcu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was partially funded by the [[North Carolina Arts Council]] and the [[Indian Arts and Crafts Board]]. She was recognized as "one of the foremost masters of rivercane basketry and one the most talented, creative basketmakers in the United States."&lt;ref name="Power" /&gt; Stephen Richmond wrote that Bradley's work was a "new dimension of technical and aesthetic achievement."{{sfn|Fariello|2009|p=82}}

'''Stanislaus Francis Perry''' (May 7, 1823 &amp;ndash; February 24, 1898) was a farmer and politician in [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada.

He represented [[1st Prince]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island]] from 1854 to 1875 and from 1879 to 1887 and, in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], represented [[Prince County (electoral district)|Prince County]] from 1874 to 1878 and from 1887 to 1896 and [[West Prince]] from 1897 to 1898 as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] member. Perry (Poirier) was the first [[Acadian]] to serve in both the provincial assembly and the House of Commons.

He was born '''Stanislas-François Poirier''' in [[Tignish, Prince Edward Island]], the son of Pierre Poirier and Marie-Blanche Gaudet. Poirier was educated in Tignish and then was educated in [[English language|English]] at [[St. Andrew's College (Charlottetown)|St. Andrew's College]] in [[Charlottetown]]. On his return to Tignish in 1843, he taught school. Poirier [[anglicisation|anglicize]]d his name around this time. In 1847, he married Margaret Carroll. He was named a [[justice of the peace]] in 1851.

In 1854, Perry left teaching, began farming to support his family and entered politics. As an Acadian, he supported the redistribution of land on the island from the landowners to the tenant farmers. In 1870, he supported a coalition conservative government because it supported grants to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] schools. Perry was speaker in the provincial assembly from 1873 to 1874. Perry was initially opposed to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] but ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the House of Commons in 1873 before being elected in 1874. He was also an unsuccessful federal candidate in 1878 and 1882. He was defeated in 1896 but won the subsequent by-election after the first election was declared invalid. Perry was a proponent of a tunnel to link the island to the mainland.

Perry helped organize the first and second Acadian national conventions in [[Memramcook, New Brunswick]] (1881) and [[Miscouche, Prince Edward Island]] (1884) although he boycotted the second event because he wanted the event to be held in Tignish.

He died in office in Ottawa in 1898 and was buried in Tignish. He's a direct ancestor of current PEI MLA [[Hal Perry (politician)|Hal Perry]].

[[Image:Thomas Conway portrait.jpg|thumb|Thomas Conway (1735–1800)]]
'''Thomas Conway''' (February 27, 1735 – c. 1800) served as a [[major general]] in the American [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He became involved with the alleged [[Conway Cabal]] with [[Horatio Gates]]. He later served with [[Émigré]] forces during the [[French Revolutionary War]].

==Early life==
Conway was born in Ireland to James Conway and his wife Julieanne Conway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/photos/artifacts/24217789 |title=James Conway (Count Conway) Biography |last= |first= |date=27 March 2016 |website= |publisher= |access-date=8 August 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he immigrated to France with his parents. At 14, he enrolled in the [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]] of the French Army and rose rapidly to [[colonel]] by 1772.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fredriksen |first=John C. |date=2006 |title=Revolutionary War Almanac |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=769 |isbn=9780816074686 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival in America==
Following the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] he volunteered to the [[Continental Congress|Congress]] for service with the American rebels in 1777. Based on an introduction from [[Silas Deane]], the Congress appointed him a [[brigadier general]] on May 13, and sent him on to [[George Washington]].

Conway commanded the leading [[brigade]] on the American right flank at the [[Battle of Germantown]], and was justly praised for his actions. However, Washington opposed his promotion to major general, believing that many American-born officers with longer and valuable service deserved the rank; this caused a falling out between Washington and Conway. [[United States Congress|Congress]] appointed Conway a major general despite Washington's objections in December 1777, and made him [[inspector general]] of the army.

==Conway Cabal==
{{Main|Conway Cabal}}
When his name was used politically, it was used to describe the infighting known as the [[Conway Cabal]]. During the affair, he had written  a letter to General [[Horatio Gates]] in which he referred to Washington as a "weak general".&lt;ref&gt;Buescher, John and Ron Martin. "[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24484 Dissent in the Ranks]." [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed 30 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was intercepted by Washington and his backers after its delivery was botched by Brigadier General [[James Wilkinson]], and brought before the Congress for inquiry. When the contents of the letter were made public, Conway lost his command as a result. He tried a ploy that had worked before his promotion, and submitted his resignation to Congress in March 1778. This time it was accepted, so he was forced to leave the continental army.  [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]] shot him in a duel on July 4, 1778.&lt;ref&gt;https://founders.archives.gov/?q=conway%20duel%20Dates-From%3A1778-06-27&amp;s=1111311111&amp;sa=&amp;r=2&amp;sr=&lt;/ref&gt; When he recovered, he wrote an apology to Washington and returned to France.

There is also a slightly different version of these happenings:

{{quote|He was challenged to a duel by Washington's friend, Gen. Cadwallader, who proceeded to shoot him through the mouth.

Conway, believing himself dying, wrote one more letter. This time to Washington, asking forgiveness for his villainies and declaring the chief to be a "great and good man." Then he "conditionally" resigned his commission as an officer in the American service. Congress accepted the resignation, unconditionally, and Conway went back to France.&lt;ref name="TGT"&gt;The Gettysburg Times (Gettsyburg, Pennsylvania) Jun 27, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Later life==
Conway later returned to the French Army, in 1787 he received promotion to Maréchal-de-camp (Major General) and an appointment as Governor of [[French India|French colonies in India]].

In 1793 he fought with royalist forces in opposition to [[French Revolution]] in southern France.

During the French Revolution he was condemned to death. He was saved only by an appeal to Great Britain (against which he had fought in the American Revolution), but was compelled to flee from France for his life.&lt;ref name="TGT" /&gt;

After that Conway disappeared from history. He is supposed to have died about 1800 in Ireland in poverty and exile.&lt;ref name="TGT" /&gt;

'''William Gilbert''' (20 May 1804 – 3 January 1890) was an English writer and [[Royal Navy]] [[surgeon]].  He wrote a considerable number of novels, biographies, histories, essays (especially about the dangers of alcohol and the plight of the poor) and popular fantasy stories, mostly in the 1860s and 1870s. Some of these have been reprinted in recent decades and are still available today.  He is best remembered, however, as the father of dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].

==Life and career==
Gilbert was born at [[Bishopstoke]], Hampshire, the eldest son of William (1780–1812), a grocer in Commercial Row, [[Blackfriars, London]], and his wife Sarah ''née'' Mathers (1782–1810).&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, family tree and pp. 5 and 13. Gilbert's ODNB entry says her name was Catherine, but Ainger's extensive, and later, research on family history is clear.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both his parents died of tuberculosis by the time William was seven years old, and thereafter, he and his younger siblings, Joseph and Jane, were raised in London by their mother's sister and her husband, Mary ''nee'' Mathers (b. 1778) and John Samuel Schwenck (d. 1865), a childless and financially comfortable couple.  Gilbert's father had also left the children legacies that would be invested by their uncle until the youngest had reached age 21, so Gilbert's would not be due to him until age 26.  With the three young Gilbert children, the Schwencks soon moved from [[Lambeth]] to a larger house in [[Clapham]], where they raised the children with affection.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert served the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]] as a [[midshipman]] from 1818 (age 14) to 1821 but was unhappy with the conditions, and so he quit the service. He then spent several years in Italy, returning to England about 1825. There he studied at [[Guy's Hospital]] and served as an assistant surgeon in the navy, and then he entered the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1830.  At this time, he received his an annuity from his father's estate, giving him financial independence, and also published a volume of his poetry.  He first married Mary Ann Skelton in 1832, who died two years later at around age 20.  By this time, he had privately published another book, but after the death of his wife, he published no more for many years.  He married Anne Mary Bye Morris (1811–1888), age 24, on 14 February 1836.  She was the daughter of Thomas Morris (1760–1849), an apothecary, and Christiana ''nee'' Sutherland (1777–1845).  The couple's famous son, [[W. S. Gilbert]], was born on 18 November 1836 at the Morris's house in Southampton Street. The Gilberts then moved to [[Hammersmith]], near Anne's sister Harriet and her family.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, family tree and pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, Gilbert took his wife and toddler on a long trip to Italy, where he had lived as a young man.  There, their daughter Jane Morris Gilbert (1838–1906) was born.  In 1841, Gilbert's brother and sister, Joseph and Jane, both died of tuberculosis.  Gilbert received some property owned by his sister and became a potential co-guardian to Joseph's two young sons, together with the Schwencks.  In 1843, his daughter Mary Florence (1843–1911) was born.  In early 1845, Gilbert decided to take custody of his two young nephews from their mother, Catherine, who had begun a relationship with an officer of the East India Company.  She brought a custody lawsuit and her children were returned to her.  Amidst considerable publicity critical of Gilbert and the Schwencks, Gilbert fled with his young family to [[Boulogne]], France, where his daughter, Anne Maude (1845–1932), was born. The family lived there for two years and returned to London in 1847, moving to [[Brompton, London|Brompton]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert and Anne "led an increasingly quarrelsome life" in London.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Stedman, Jane. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10707/10707?back=,33400 "Gilbert, William (1804–1890)"], ''Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 21 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early writing career===
Gilbert began his writing career around 1857. He was concerned, throughout his life, with the welfare of the poor and served as honorary secretary of the Society of the Relief of Distress. His interest in the poor is evident in his writing, and one of his recurring themes was that poverty and alcohol, not genealogy, was the major cause of crime and the main factor in one's later fortunes. This theme would also be seen in his son's writing.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the elder Gilbert's first pieces was a pamphlet entitled, "On the Present System of Rating for the Relief of the Poor in the Metropolis" (1857). In 1858, anonymously, Gilbert published ''Dives and Lazarus, or the adventures of an obscure medical man in a low neighbourhood.''  The book was a fictional account focusing on what Gilbert saw as the increasing disparity in the lives of the rich and the poor. A similar theme pervades another early Gilbert novel, ''The Weaver's Family'' (1860). This theme continued to concern Gilbert throughout his career including in ''Contrasts; dedicated to the ratepayers of London'' (1873) and in one of his fiercest attacks on social abuses, ''The City; An Inquiry into the Corporation, its livery companies, and the administration of their charities and endowments'' (1877),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wJkHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22william+gilbert%22+%22the+city+an+inquiry%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sw9WUwYZGX&amp;sig=FCDBe9_AfGizfqHEEtVz79G0qw8 Online googlebooks version of ''The City'']&lt;/ref&gt; describing how 50,000 working-class people were evicted from their dwellings to make room for the [[Metropolitan Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;  In an age of [[male chauvinism]], Gilbert also wrote several articles about discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian. "The Beginnings of Bab: a perspective", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 3, issue 21, Summer 2007, pp. 662–63&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, Gilbert published a novel, ''Margaret Meadows, A Tale for the Pharisees''. This was made into a play called ''Mary Warner'' by [[Tom Taylor]] in 1869, who was forced to pay Gilbert a settlement for plagiarising his novel. Gilbert's most successful early novel was ''Shirley Hall Asylum: Or the Memoirs of a Monomaniac'' (1863), which told the stories of inmates of a lunatic asylum from the point of view of an escapee driven mad by trying to solve the problem of [[perpetual motion]]. Gilbert's first novel published under his own name was ''Christmas Tale: The Rosary, a Legend of Wilton Abbey'' (1863). The story purports to be the written confession of one Alicia Longspée, who had been Lady Abbess of the [[Wilton Abbey|Benedictine Convent at Wilton]] in the 15th century. Gilbert's next novel, ''De Profundis, a tale of the social deposits'' (1864) is the story of a foundling rescued by a Scottish Fusilier Guardsman stationed in London. The foundling grows up to marry the guardsman's daughter. Another 1864 book was ''The Goldsworthy Family, or the country attorney'', about an unethical lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's 1865 book, ''The Magic Mirror'' (about a mirror that grants wishes), containing stories with a moral was illustrated by his multi-talented son. Gilbert also wrote histories and articles and stories for numerous periodicals (often anonymously), including ''Cornhill, Temple Bar, St. Paul's, the Quiver, The Contemporary Review, The Sunday Magazine, Good Things, Good Words, Strahan's Boy's and Girl's (sic) Annual'' and ''The Fortnightly Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Gilbert's best-known, and most popular, works were his ''Innominato'' tales of the supernatural, published in various magazines, including ''[[Argosy Magazine|Argosy]]'', and finally collected in [http://www.haddon-hall.com/Libretti/WizardOfTheMountainFirst.pdf ''The Wizard of the Mountain'' (1867)]. One of the best-known is "The Last Lords of Gardonal" (1867).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/lastlord.htm Online copy of "The Last Lords of Gardonal"]&lt;/ref&gt;  These stories concerned the adventures of an enigmatic wizard and astrologer called the Innominato (in English, "Nameless"), in 14th century Italy, who tried to use his powers to help people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jessnevins/vici.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+17:04:22 Article about the Innominato character]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1868, Gilbert wrote ''The Doctor of Beauweir, an autobiography'', told from the point of view of a South Wales medic.  ''King George's Middy'' (1869), also illustrated by W. S. Gilbert, relates the adventures of a [[Leicestershire]] squire's son who becomes a midshipman and is marooned of the coast of Africa. Another 1869 novel was Sir Thomas Branston. Later that year, Gilbert produced his most famous biography, ''Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara: a biography: Illustrated by rare and unpublished documents''. In this work, Gilbert concluded, after extensive research, that there was no evidence of the acts of gross immorality of which Borgia was accused, including murder. This was followed in 1870 by ''The Inquisitor, or the Struggle in Ferrara'', about the life of [[Renée of France]], Duchess of Ferrara, set in 1554.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, pp. 297–98&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the novel ''Martha'' was followed by ''The Landlord of the "Sun"'', again describing a descent into degradation, this time involving a villainous seducer, an illegitimate child and drunkenness, and, in 1873, by ''Clara Levesque.''  Another theme that was seen in Gilbert's writings was his dislike of established religion and the Roman Catholic Church in particular. Two works on this theme included ''Facta non Verba: a comparison between the good works performed by the ladies in Roman Catholic communities in England and the unfettered efforts of their Protestant sisters'' (1874) and ''Disestablishment from a Church point of view'' (1875).&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, pp. 298–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert had a mercurial temper and was difficult to live with, imposing arbitrary restrictions on his wife and daughters. After many years of strained relations with his wife, Gilbert left home and separated from her in 1876 after forty years of marriage. He left his wife and daughters substantial incomes and the family home, assuming that he would be able to earn a good living from his writing.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he soon became seriously ill and appeared to be dying, and his doctors advised him not to write. His wife did not assist in his care and did not, ultimately, allow him to return home. Her son appealed to her on his father's behalf, but she would not change her mind. W. S. Gilbert apparently never contacted his mother again.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Gilbert went to live with Jane, his only married daughter, and her husband in The Close at [[Salisbury]], where he resided for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, Gilbert published ''Them Boots'', another description of characters from the lowest class of society, as well as ''The City''. Pursuing another favourite theme, the dangers of drink, Gilbert also published in 1877 ''Nothing but the Truth, an unvarnished picture of the effects of intemperance'', and example of his many writings about the dangers of alcohol. 1879 saw the publication of ''Mrs. Dubosq's Bible'', about a French [[Huguenot]] group in [[Spitalfields]] in the 18th century, and the possession of a 1650 Geneva Bible by a poor person. In 1880, ''Memoirs of a Cynic'' was a protest against cruelty and hypocrisy. This was followed in 1881 by ''Modern Wonders of the World, or the new Sinbad'', a series of 10 stories told to London children by Hassan, the son of an Egyptian slave dealer. His last book, published in 1882, ''Legion, or the modern demoniac'', returns to Gilbert's campaign against drink, which, he illustrated, leads to "crime, profligacy, suicide, homicide, brutality, cruelty, pauperism, idiocy and insanity."&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, pp. 300–01&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert died at the age of 86 and was buried in The Close at Salisbury.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Direct descendants of the Gilbert family still live in [[Cornwall]], England.

'''Xian Hui''' ({{zh |s = {{linktext|咸|辉}} }}; [[Xiao'erjing]]: {{lang|zh-Arab|ﺷِﯿًﺎ  ﺧُﻮِ}}; born March 1958) is a Chinese female politician of [[Hui people|Hui ethnic heritage]]. She is serving as [[Politics of Ningxia|Chairwoman]] (Governor) of [[Ningxia|Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region]] from July 2016. Along with [[Bu Xiaolin]] of Inner Mongolia and [[Chen Yiqin]] of Guizhou, Xian Hui is one of only three women to hold a provincial government leadership position in China, as of 2016.&lt;ref name="ifeng"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.ifeng.com/a/20160703/49285594_0.shtml |title = 咸辉任宁夏自治区人民政府代理主席 |website = ifeng.com |accessdate = 2016-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Xian Hui was born in [[Dingxi|Dingxi prefecture]], [[Gansu]] on March 1958. During [[Down to the Countryside Movement]], she became a [[Sent-down youth]] in Dingxi, performing manual labour. Between 1978 and 1981, she joined one of the first batches of students to be admitted to post-secondary education following the Cultural Revolution and took up studies in Chinese literature at the [[Minzu University of China]]. After university, she returned to her home province, and began working in the provincial United Front Work Department, where she would rise steadily through its career ladder and serve until 2005, eventually rising to head the old cadres bureau and the deputy head of the Gansu United Front Department.&lt;ref name=ganxu&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2012-04-21|url=http://news.qq.com/a/20070331/000261.htm|title=泽巴足咸辉出任甘肃省副省长|publisher=qq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Xian was appointed as deputy head of the party's Organization Department of Gansu. In March 2007, Xian was named vice-governor. She was named to the [[provincial party standing committee]] in April 2012. In May 2015, she became executive vice-governor; she served until July 2016.&lt;ref name=ganxu/&gt;

On July 3, 2016, Xian was named Chairwoman of Ningxia, a region bordering Gansu. Xian's ascension to the Chairwoman's office marked the only known instance in the history of the People's Republic during which one woman succeeded another woman in a leading provincial party or government position. She was confirmed as government by the regional People's Congress on September 19, 2016.&lt;ref name="ifeng"/&gt;
