In [[aviation]], '''ACARS''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ei|k|ɑr|z}}; an [[acronym]] for '''aircraft communications addressing and reporting system''') is a digital [[datalink]] system for transmission of short messages between [[aircraft]] and ground stations via [[airband]] radio or [[satellite]]. The protocol was designed by [[ARINC]] and deployed in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Carlsson |first=Barbara |author-link= |publication-date=October 2002 |date= |year= |archivedate=11 February 2006 |title=GLOBALink/VHF: The Future Is Now |periodical=The Global Link |series= |publication-place= |place= |publisher= |volume= |issue= |page=4 |url=http://www.arinc.com/news/newsletters/gl_10_02.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211160041/http://www.arinc.com/news/newsletters/gl_10_02.pdf |issn= |doi= |oclc= |accessdate=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Telex]] format. More ACARS radio stations were added subsequently by [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]].

==History of ACARS==
Prior to the introduction of datalink in aviation, all communication between the aircraft and ground personnel was performed by the flight crew using voice communication, using either [[VHF]] or [[High frequency|HF]] voice radios. In many cases, the voice-relayed information involved dedicated radio operators and digital messages sent to an [[airline teletype system]] or successor systems.

Further, the hourly rates for flight and cabin crew salaries depended on whether the aircraft was airborne or not, and if on the ground whether it was at the gate or not. The flight crews reported these times by voice to geographically dispersed radio operators. Airlines wanted to eliminate self-reported times to preclude inaccuracies, whether accidental or deliberate. Doing so also reduced the need for human radio operators to receive the reports.

In an effort to reduce crew workload and improve data integrity, the engineering department at [[ARINC]] introduced the ACARS system in July 1978, as essentially an automated time clock system. [[Teledyne Controls]] produced the avionics and the launch customer was [[Piedmont Airlines (1948–1989)|Piedmont Airlines]]. The original expansion of the abbreviation was "Arinc Communications Addressing and Reporting System".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arinc.com/downloads/product_collateral/acars_first_datasheet.pdf |title= ARINC Communications Addressing and Reporting System |accessdate=22 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706055818/http://www.arinc.com/downloads/product_collateral/acars_first_datasheet.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was changed to "Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System". The original avionics standard was ARINC 597, which defined an ACARS Management Unit consisting of discrete inputs for the doors, parking brake and weight on wheels sensors to automatically determine the flight phase and generate and send as telex messages. It also contained a [[Minimum shift keying|MSK modem]], which was used to transmit the reports over existing VHF voice radios. Global standards for ACARS were prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC). The first day of ACARS operations saw about 4,000 transactions, but it did not experience widespread use by the major airlines until the 1980s.

Early ACARS systems were extended over the years to support aircraft with digital [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] interfaces, [[flight management system]]s, and printers.

== System description and functions ==
ACARS as a term refers to the complete air and ground system, consisting of equipment on board, equipment on the ground, and a service provider.

On-board ACARS equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arinc.com/cf/store/catalog_detail.cfm?item_id=555 |title=ARINC Characteristic 758-2 Communications Management Unit (CMU) Mark 2 |publisher=ARINC |date=July 2005 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of end systems with a [[Router (computing)|router]], which routes messages through the air-ground subnetwork.

Ground equipment is made up of a [[Telecommunications network|network]] of radio [[transceiver]]s managed by a central site computer called AFEPS (Arinc Front End Processor System), which handles and routes messages. Generally, ground ACARS units are either government agencies such as the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], an airline operations headquarters, or, for small airlines or general aviation, a third-party subscription service. Usually government agencies are responsible for clearances, while airline operations handle gate assignments, maintenance, and passenger needs.

===The ground processing system===

Ground system provision is the responsibility of either a participating ANSP or an aircraft operator. Aircraft operators often contract out the function to either DSP or to a separate service provider. Messages from aircraft, especially automatically generated ones, can be pre-configured according to message type so that they are automatically delivered to the appropriate recipient just as ground-originated messages can be configured to reach the correct aircraft.{{citation needed|reason=Sounds correct, don't doubt it, but need citation|date=June 2016}}

The ACARS equipment on the aircraft is linked to that on the ground by the datalink service provider. Because the ACARS network is modeled after the point-to-point telex network, all messages come to a central processing location to be routed. [[ARINC]] and [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]] are the two primary service providers, with smaller operations from others in some areas. Some areas have multiple service providers.

== ACARS message types ==
ACARS messages may be of three broad types:
* [[Air traffic control]] messages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arinc.com/cf/store/catalog_detail.cfm?item_id=561 |title=ARINC Specification 623-3Character-Oriented Air Traffic Service (ATS) Applications |publisher=ARINC |date=April 2005 |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used to request or provide clearances.
* [[Aeronautical Operational Control|Aeronautical operational control]]
* Airline administrative control

Control messages are used to communicate between the aircraft and its base, with messages either standardized according to ARINC Standard 633, or user-defined in accordance with ARINC Standard 618.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arinc.com/cf/store/catalog_detail.cfm?item_id=2072 |title=ARINC Specification 618-7 Air/Ground Character-Oriented Protocol Specification |publisher=ARINC |date=June 2013 |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of such messages can be OOOI events, flight plans, weather information, equipment health, status of connecting flights, etc.

=== OOOI events===
A major function of ACARS is to automatically detect and report the start of each major flight phase, called OOOI events in the industry (&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;ut of the gate, &lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;ff the ground, &lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;n the ground, and &lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;nto the gate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aspmhelp.faa.gov/index.php/OOOI_Data|title=OOOI Data|publisher=[[FAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These OOOI events are detected using input from aircraft [[sensors]] mounted on doors, parking brakes, and struts. At the start of each flight phase, an ACARS message is transmitted to the ground describing the flight phase, the time at which it occurred, and other related information such as the amount of fuel on board or the flight origin and destination. These messages are used to track the status of aircraft and crews.

=== Flight management system interface ===
ACARS interfaces with [[flight management system]]s (FMS), acting as the communication system for [[flight plan]]s and weather information to be sent from the ground to the FMS. This enables the airline to update the FMS while in flight, and allows the flight crew to evaluate new weather conditions or alternative flight plans.

=== Equipment health and maintenance data ===
ACARS is used to send information from the aircraft to ground stations about the conditions of various aircraft systems and sensors in real-time. Maintenance faults and abnormal events are also transmitted to ground stations along with detailed messages, which are used by the airline for monitoring equipment health, and to better plan [[repair and maintenance]] activities.

=== Ping messages ===
Automated [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] messages are used to test an aircraft's connection with the communication station.&lt;ref name=Hoppenbrouwers14&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoppenbrouwers |first=Jeroen |title=ACARS documentation |url=http://www.hoppie.nl/acars/system/tech.html |work=ACARS |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that the aircraft ACARS unit has been silent for longer than a preset time interval, the ground station can ping the aircraft (directly or via satellite). A ping response indicates a healthy ACARS communication.

=== Manually sent messages ===
ACARS interfaces with interactive display units in the cockpit, which flight crews can use to send and receive technical messages and reports to or from ground stations, such as a request for weather information or clearances or the status of connecting flights. The response from the ground station is received on the aircraft via ACARS as well. Each airline customizes ACARS to this role to suit its needs.

== Communication details ==
ACARS messages may be sent using a choice of communication methods, such as VHF or HF, either direct to ground or via satellite, using [[Minimum-shift keying| minimum-shift keying (MSK)]] modulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tooley |first1=Michael H. |last2=Wyatt |first2=David |year=2007 |title=Aircraft communications and navigation systems: Principles, operation and maintenance |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/127107537 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier/Butterworth-Heineman |isbn=978-0750681377 |accessdate=23 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACARS can send messages over VHF if a VHF ground station network exists in the current area of the aircraft. VHF communication is [[line-of-sight propagation]] and the typical range is up to 200 nautical miles at high altitudes. Where VHF is absent, an HF network or satellite communication may be used if available. Satellite coverage may be limited at high latitudes (trans-polar flights).

== Role of ACARS in air accidents and incidents ==
In the wake of the crash of [[Air France Flight 447]] in 2009, there was discussion about making ACARS an "online-[[Flight recorder|black-box]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,628924,00.html |title=Online-Black-Box soll Crashs schneller aufklären |trans-title=Online Black Box to solve crashes faster |language=German |work=Spiegel-Online |date=6 June 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the effects of the loss of a flight recorder. However no changes were made to the ACARS system.

In March 2014, ACARS messages and [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] analysis of ACARS satellite communication data played a very significant role in efforts to trace [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]] to an approximate location. While the primary ACARS system on board MH370 had been switched off, a second ACARS system called Classic Aero was active as long as the plane was powered up, and kept trying to establish a connection to an [[Inmarsat]] satellite every hour.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=MH370: Britain finds itself at centre of blame game over crucial delays |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/10720009/MH370-Britain-finds-itself-at-centre-of-blame-game-over-crucial-delays.html |first1=Gordon |last1=Rayner |first2=Nick |last2=Collins |journal=The Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACARS on the Airbus A320 of [[EgyptAir Flight 804]] reported "irregularities" to ground staff on three separate occasions, which led to three emergency landings, in the 24 hours prior to the aircraft's crash into the Mediterranean Sea on May 19, 2016, which killed all 66 persons on board. The specific nature of the irregularities was not explained, but at each instance the aircraft was given clearance to continue its flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/egyptair-ms804-doomed-plane-made-3-emergency-landings-day-before-crash-reports-france-3-tv-1563285 |title=EgyptAir MS804: Doomed plane made 3 emergency landings in day before crash reports France 3 TV |first=Harriet |last=Sinclair |work=International Business Times |location=UK |date=2 June 2016 |access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of ACARS outside aviation ==
In 2002, ACARS was added to the [[NOAA Observing System Architecture]]. Thus commercial aircraft can act as weather data providers for weather agencies to use in their forecast models, sending meteorological observations like winds and temperatures over the ACARS network. NOAA provides real-time weather maps.

'''Akai''' (アカイ) is a [[consumer electronics]] [[brand]] name. The original company was founded in 1946 in [[Tokyo]], Japan as '''Akai Electric Co., Ltd.''', developing electronics such as LED TVs and Air Conditioning systems.

==Corporate history==
Akai was founded by Masukichi Akai and his son, Saburo Akai (who died in 1973&lt;ref name=museum-msr/&gt;) as {{nihongo|''Akai Electric Company Ltd.''|赤井電機株式会社|Akai Denki [[Kabushiki kaisha|Kabushiki-gaisha]]}}, a [[Japan]]ese manufacturer in 1929&lt;ref name=museum-msr&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1946.&lt;ref group=note&gt;
Although reliable sources are not yet found, according to the several sources ([http://kotobank.jp/word/%E8%B5%A4%E4%BA%95%E9%9B%BB%E6%A9%9F%5B%E6%A0%AA%5D kotobank.jp], [[:ja:Akai Professional]]), Masukichi Akai established ''Akai Press Industry'' in 1923, then his son, Saburo Akai established ''Akai Electric Company Ltd.'' in 1946, and Masukichi served as the president of both.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's business eventually became troubling and it left the audio industry in 1991. At its peak in the late 1990s, Akai Holdings employed 100,000 workers and had annual sales of HK$40 billion (US$5.2 billion). The company filed for insolvency in November 2000, owing creditors US$1.1B.&lt;ref name=DuceTan&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aWP18uiUC6dQ | publisher=Bloomberg | title=Akai Liquidator to Receive Payment in Settlement With Grande | first1=John | last1=Duce | first2=Andrea | last2=Tan | date=5 October 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154521/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aWP18uiUC6dQ | archivedate=22 February 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged that ownership of Akai Holdings had somehow passed in 1999 to [[Grande Holdings]], a company founded by Akai's chairman [[James Ting]]. The liquidators claimed that Ting had stolen over US$800m from the company with the assistance of accountants [[Ernst &amp; Young]] who had tampered with audit documents going back to 1994.&lt;ref name=SCMP20090930&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.scmp.com/article/694025/raids-arrest-fraud-police-probe-akai-files | title=Raids, arrest as fraud police probe Akai files | first1=Naomi | last1=Rovnick | first2=Clifford | last2=Lo| date=30 September 2009 | newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ting was imprisoned for false accounting in 2005,&lt;ref name=SCMP20090930 /&gt; and E&amp;Y paid $200m to settle the negligence case out of court in September 2009.&lt;ref name=SCMP20100127&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.scmp.com/article/704741/ernst-young-pays-settle-negligence-claim | title=Ernst &amp; Young pays up to settle negligence claim | first=Naomi | last=Rovnick | date=27 January 2010 | newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate lawsuit, a former E&amp;Y partner, Christopher Ho, made a "substantial payment" to Akai creditors in his role as chairman of Grande Holdings.&lt;ref name=DuceTan /&gt;

==History==

===Historical products===
[[File:AKAI stack.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Stack of historical AKAI machines]]
Akai's products included [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] audiotape recorders (such as the GX series), [[Tuner (radio)|tuners]] (top level AT, mid level TR and TT series), [[Compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] decks (top level GX and TFL, mid level TC, HX and CS series), [[amplifier]]s (AM and TA series), [[microphone|microphones]], [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]], [[Phonograph|turntable]]s, [[Videocassette recorder|video recorders]] and [[loudspeaker]]s.

[[File:Tape recorder GX-6300.jpg|thumb|Tape recorder GX-630D]]
Many Akai products were sold under the name '''Roberts''' in the US{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, as well as '''A&amp;D''' in Japan (from 1987 after a partnership with [[Mitsubishi Electric]]), '''Tensai''' and ''Transonic Strato'' in Western Europe{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. During the late 1960s, Akai adopted [[Tandberg]]'s [[cross-field head|cross-field recording]] technologies (using an extra tape head) to enhance high frequency recording and switched to the increasingly reliable Glass and crystal (X'tal) (GX) ferrite heads a few years later{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. The company's most popular products{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} were the GX-630D, GX-635D, GX-747/GX-747DBX and GX-77 open-reel recorders (latter featuring an auto-loading function), the three-head, closed-loop GX-F95, GX-90, GX-F91, GX-R99 cassette decks, and the AM-U61, AM-U7 and AM-93 stereo amplifiers.

Akai manufactured and badged most of its imported hi-fi products with the [[Tensai International|Tensai]] brand (named after the Swiss audio and electronics distributor '''Tensai International'''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Tensai International was Akai's exclusive distributor for the Swiss and Western European markets until 1988.

Akai limited its consumer [[hi-fi]] product line in the United States and Europe towards the end of the 20th century{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

====Introduction of the on-screen display====
Akai produced consumer [[video cassette recorder]]s (VCR) during the 1980s. The Akai VS-2 was the first VCR with an on-screen display,&lt;ref name=""&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally named the Interactive Monitor System. By displaying the information directly on the television screen, this innovation eliminated the need for the user to be physically near the VCR to program recording, read the tape counter, or perform other common features. Within a few years, all competing manufacturers had adopted on-screen display technology in their own products.

===Akai Professional===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
In 1984,&lt;ref name=akaipromi/&gt; a new division of the company&lt;ref name=kanagawa/&gt; was formed to focus on the manufacture and sale of [[electronic instruments]], and was called &lt;!-- Akai Electronic Musical Instruments Corporation, or --&gt;Akai Professional.

[[File:Akaimg1214.png|thumb|250px|right|Akai's portable studio, Akai MG-1214 unit]]&lt;/div&gt;
The first product released by the new subsidiary was MG1212, a 12 channel, 12 track recorder in 1984.&lt;ref name=akaipromi-prod&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovative device used a special VHS-like cartridge (a MK-20), and was good for 10 minutes of continuous 12 track recording (19&amp;nbsp;cm per second) or 20 minutes at half speed (9.5&amp;nbsp;cm per second). One track (14) was  permanently dedicated to recording absolute time, and another one for synchronization such as [[SMPTE]] or [[MIDI timecode|MTC]]. Each channel strip included [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] type-1 noise reduction and semi-parametric equalizers (with fixed bandwidths). The unit also had innovations like an electronic 2 bus system, a 12 stereo channel patch bay and auto [[Punch in / out|punch in and out]], among others. The unique transport design and noise reduction gave these units a recording quality rivaling that of more expensive 16 track machines using 1" tape. The MG-1212 was later replaced by the MG-1214, which improved the transport mechanism and overall performance.

Other early products included the Akai [[AX80]] 8-voice analog synthesizer in 1984,&lt;ref name=akaipromi-prod/&gt; followed by [[Akai AX60|AX60]] and AX73 6-voice analog synthesizers ca.1986.&lt;ref name=vse-ax60&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AX-60 borrowed many ideas from the [[Roland Juno-106|Roland Juno series]], but used voltage controlled analog oscillators (VCO) as a sound source as opposed to Roland's more common digitally controlled analog oscillators (DCO), and also allowed the performer to "split" the keyboard (using different timbres for different ranges of keys). The AX-60 also had the ability to interface with Akai's early samplers through a serial cable, using 12-bit samples as an additional oscillator.&lt;ref name=akaipromiax73&gt;

  “''The AX73 was a simple analogue synthesiser based around the Curtis CEM 3394 chips ... Internally, the AX60 had the same voice architecture as the AX73 and VX90 ... Common to all models in the range, however, was a proprietary 13-pin DIN socket that allowed you to connect an S900 for processing through the synths' analogue filters. ...''”

====S series digital samplers====

[[Image:AKAI S612.jpg|thumb|220px|S612]]&lt;/div&gt;
{{See also|Sampler (musical instrument)#Akai}}

The S612 12-bit digital [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] in 1985, was the first in a series of (relatively) affordable samplers already in 19-inch studio-rack format but in black color.&lt;ref name=akaipromi-prod/&gt; It held only a single sample at a time, which was loaded into memory via a separate disk drive utilizing Quick Disk 2.8-inch [[floppy disk]]s. The maximum sample time at the highest quality sampling rate (32&amp;nbsp;kHz) was one second.

&lt;div style="clear:right; float:right; margin:-1.65ex 0;"&gt;

[[Image:AKAI Z4.jpg|thumb|102px|Z4]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The introduction of a "professional" range of digital samplers began with the 12-bit S900 in 1986,&lt;ref name=akaipromi-prod/&gt; followed by the X7000 keyboard sampler in 1986,&lt;ref name=vse-x7000&gt;
{{cite web
 | title	= Akai X7000
 | url  	= http://www.vintagesynth.com/akai/x7000.php
 | publisher	= vintage synth explorer
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the S700 rack-mount version in 1987.&lt;ref name=akaipromi-prod/&gt; Unlike the single-sample S612, however, they allowed the use of six active samples at once, had a built-in disk drive and could be extended with six individual outputs via cable and a flash memory extension which added another six samples to the memory for multisample playback. The S700/X7000 sampler series were light-grey colored, which didn't change throughout the whole "professional" range of Akai samplers.

The 16-bit [[Akai S1000]] followed in 1988. The latter was replaced by the S3000 series in 1992–1995,&lt;ref name=akaipromi-prod/&gt; which notably featured a writeable [[CD-ROM]] (on S3000CD) and [[hard disk]] recording (on S3000i), and was followed by the S5000 and S6000.  Additional releases of note were the Z4 and Z8 24-bit 96&amp;nbsp;kHz samplers.&lt;ref name=akaipromi-prod/&gt;

Akai also produced several Digital MIDI [[music sequencer|sequencers]] and [[digital synthesizer]]s such as the [[Akai MPC|MPC]] range, a line of integrated drum machines, MIDI sequencers, samplers and direct-to-disk recorders.

====New ownership of Akai Professional====
In December 1999, one year before the application of [[:ja:民事再生法|Civil Rehabilitation Act]] to Akai Electric Company Ltd., the brand of their musical instrument division, Akai Professional was acquired by a company of the United States. The new company “Akai Professional Musical Instrument Corporation”&lt;ref name=akaipromi&gt;

[Abstract: according to the private credit research company, [[:ja:帝国データバンク|Teikoku Databank]] Yokohama branch, by the 7th (December 2005), Akai Professional M.I. received a bankruptcy proceedings decision by the Tokyo District Court. ... Akai Professional M.I. was established in December 1999 to focus on the manufacture and sale of electronic musical instruments, by a company of the United State who acquired the brand(s) of musical instrument division of Akai Electric Company Ltd.]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, following a US distribution deal, the Akai Professional Musical Instrument division was acquired by Jack O'Donnell, owner of [[Numark Industries]] and [[Alesis]]. Numark, including Akai Professional, was acquired in 2012 by [[inMusic Brands]].

An Akai Professional product that is somewhat sought after in current times is the model DM13 microphone. This small, unidirectional unit was originally made for tape recorders, as well as [[citizen band radio|CB radio]] equipment. Today, they can be found in the arsenal of many [[blues harmonica]] players due to its high gain and high impedance properties.

==Current products==
In early 2003, the consumer electronics company began undergoing a re-exposure by marketing various rebranded video products manufactured by Samsung. In the same year, Akai began to distribute home appliances such as [[HVAC]] units, [[vacuum cleaner]]s, [[water filtration]] devices, and refrigerated store showcases.

In [[Canada]], Akai portable DVD players were sold at 'The Source by Circuit City', and at [[Zellers]], a division of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].

'''Arid Lands Information Network''' ('''ALIN''') is a [[Kenya]]-based non-governmental organisation that seeks to exchange ideas and experiences among "grassroots change agents". It sees its goal as enabling such grassroot change agents to learn from one another, through capacity-building and what it terms the "innovative use of [[information and communication technologies]] (ICTs)."

==ALIN==
Known as the Arid Lands Information Network (ALIN), this organisation describes itself as "a non-profit, non-political NGO". Its focus of work is on the arid and semi-arid lands (also referred to as the ASALs) within the [[African Great Lakes]] region.

==Membership==
ALIN is a network of over 2,000 grassroots Community Development Workers (CDWs) drawn from non-governmental organisations and community- based organisations as well as government departments.  The members of the network offer a form of extension service in their fields of expertise.

To promote local level networking, ALIN has clustered members in the same geographical regions into grassroots networking nodes known as focal groups. These groups form the entry points of ALIN into the community. The network works through 15 focal groups spread out across the African Great Lakes region, in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

==Maarifa Centres==
In collaboration with other partners, ALIN has established and equipped Maarifa Centres (MCs) with ICT equipment. The centres act as access and dissemination points for information, content creation and skills development among the rural communities. There are MCs in all three Great Lakes countries. Partners of the MCs include [[Oxfam Novib]], [[Ford Foundation]], Communication Commission of Kenya (CCK), the Royal Danish Embassy and the Embassy of Finland among others. The centres are manned by Communication Information Volunteers (CIVs) who are hired on a one-year basis as young and fresh graduates from reputable institutions of higher learning  and are then posted to the various Maarifa centres.

==History==
It was earlier known as the Reseau d'Information des Terres Arides - Arid Lands Information Network (RITA-ALIN).

==Publications==
ALIN is involved in the production of several publications. The ''Baobab Journal'' is ALIN's flagship journal. It has been in circulation since 1998. Baobab acts a platform for CDWs to share information and experiences on sustainable livelihoods.

ALIN also produces the LEISA (Low External Input in Sustainable Agriculture) magazine for Eastern Africa which is named ''Kilimo Endelevu Afrika'' (Sustainable Agriculture in Africa). This magazine aims to identify promising technologies for small-scale farmers.

''Joto Afrika'' (loosely translated as "Africa is feeling the heat") is the third major publication and is produced in collaboration with the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS). It is a new series of printed briefings and online resources. The publication focuses on climate change adaptation and developments in sub-Saharan Africa and is published in both English and French.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15577">An '''arms embargo''' is an [[embargo]] that applies solely to weaponry, and may also apply to "[[dual-use technology]]". An arms embargo may serve one or more purposes:
* to signal disapproval of behavior by a certain actor,

==Historical examples==

===Argentina===
[[United States]] President [[Jimmy Carter]] imposed an arms embargo on the 1976 Argentinian ''[[Proceso de Reorganizacion Nacional]]'' (National Reorganization Process) [[military junta]] due to the [[Dirty War]] that took place from 1974 to 1983. The embargo was joined by the [[United Kingdom]] following the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. The ban was lifted in the 1990s after Argentina was named as a [[major non-NATO ally]]. During those years, Argentine armed forces shifted to [[Western European]] countries and [[Israel]] for supplies.

===Indonesia===
The United States government imposed an arms embargo against Indonesia in 1999 due to human rights violations in [[East Timor]]. The embargo was lifted in 2005.

===Iran===
The United States imposed economic sanctions against Iran following the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. However, to secure the release of American hostages, several senior [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran in the 1980s, in a scandal called the [[Iran–Contra affair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/ ''The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On'']. The National Security Archive (George Washington University), 2006-11-24&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the US [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|expanded sanctions]] to include firms dealing with the Iranian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ariel Zirulnick |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2011/0224/Sanction-Qaddafi-How-5-nations-have-reacted-to-sanctions./Iran |title=Sanction Qaddafi? How 5 nations have reacted to sanctions: Iran |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1747|UN Security Council Resolution 1747]] tightened the [[sanctions against Iran|sanctions imposed on Iran]] in connection with the [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian nuclear program]]. The UN sanctions were lifted on 16 January 2016.

===People's Republic of China===
The United States and the European Union stopped exporting arms to China after 1989, due to the [[Government of China|Chinese government]]'s violent suppression of [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|protests in Tiananmen Square]]. In 2004-05, there was some debate in the EU over whether to lift the embargo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sldinfo.com/the-eu-arms-embargo-repeal-debate/ The EU Arms Embargo Repeal Debate&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 418|arms embargo of South Africa]] from 1977 extended to dual-use items. The embargo was lifted by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 919|Resolution 919]] in 1994.

==List of current arms embargoes==
The countries included in the list are under arms embargo of the [[United Nations]] or another international organization ([[European Union|EU]], [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe|OSCE]] and others) or country. In some cases the arms embargo is supplemented by a general [[trade embargo]], other [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] (financial) or [[Persona non grata|travel ban]] for specific persons. In some cases the arms embargo applies to any entity residing or established in the country, but in others it is partial – the recognized government forces and international [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] are exempted from the embargo.{{Expand list|date=March 2010}}

{{Dablink|This article is about an item of medical equipment. For the Bedford to London St Pancras railway line known colloquially as the "Bedpan service", see [[Thameslink]].}}
A '''bedpan''' or '''bed pan''' is a receptacle used for the [[toileting]] of a bedridden [[patient]] in a [[health care]] facility, and is usually made of metal, glass, ceramic, or plastic. A bedpan can be used for both urinary and fecal discharge. Many diseases can confine a patient to bed, necessitating the use of bedpans, including [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[stroke]], and [[dementia]]. Additionally, many patients may be confined to a bed temporarily as a result of a temporary illness, injury, or surgery, thereby necessitating the use of a bedpan.

Bedpans are usually constructed of [[stainless steel]], which is easy to clean and durable, but may be cold, hard, and uncomfortable to use.  Also, the supporting area of some products is very small, and prolonged use can cause [[pressure ulcer]]s. To solve these problems, new ergonomic bedpans have been developed, which support the patient with a larger area of warm plastic. Some designs completely cover the [[Sex organ|genitalia]] during use, offering protection and an extra measure of privacy. On the other hand, the material is more difficult to sterilize, and may become a reservoir for microorganisms.

'''Fracture bedpans''' are smaller than standard size bedpans, and have one flat end. These bedpans are designed specifically for patients who have had a [[Pelvic fracture|hip fracture]] or are recovering from hip replacement. This type of bedpan may be used for those patients who cannot raise their hips high enough or roll over onto a regular size bedpan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Textbook of basic nursing|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0781765218|pages=648|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tB1YiYj_kdkC&amp;pg=PA648&amp;lpg=PA648&amp;dq=bedpan+fracture+how+to+use&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xCKKxA4NMv&amp;sig=mPBQCyPc29zcZJnFM_TZa8ias-E&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=bedpan%20fracture%20how%20to%20use&amp;f=false|first=Caroline|last=Bunker Rosdahl|edition=9th|author2=Kowalski, Mary T.|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a bedpan liner made of recycled wood pulp ([[molded pulp]]) is more popular in UK hospitals; it is for single use, decreasing the risk of cross-contamination diseases.  An alternative to the recycled pulp liner is the plastic bedpan liner, which also creates a barrier between the waste and the bedpan. Some liners are made of [[biodegradable plastic]] and contain absorbent powder to eliminate splashing and spills.  Liners are used in hospitals to decrease infection, and can also be purchased and used for [[home health care]].

The [[DFRL]]/[[DRDO]] has developed a [[biosynthesis reactor]] which facilitates to control, measure and process different micro formulations of [[Biopolymers]], bio preservative coatings and packing films for MAP to enhance the [[shelf life]] of the fresh produces.

==Main Features==
*It is a simple, portable and low cost system which can also make production of most frequently used fat replacers, along with [[Emulsion]], [[stabilizers|Stabilisers]], thickeners, suspending agents, gelling agents, fibre sources, and mouth feel improvers utilizing [[Hydrocolloids]] blending (with or without heat) and high speed shear processing.
*The rise in temperature can be adjusted up to 1500 C.
*The parameters such as temperature, pressure, torque, agitation speed, feed rate and rotation with inert atmosphere can be optimized depending on the biopolymers to be synthesized.
*The system is suitable and provides opportunities for adding value to agricultural biopolymers abundantly available in nature (proteins of plant/animal) or as by-products of the food processing industry. This significantly reducing the environmental impact of synthetic film and health hazards.
Food scientists and technologists, packaging scientists and technologists, protein chemists, and polymer chemists in research and developments can be benefited by this reactor.

'''Bridging loss''' is the loss, at a given [[frequency]], that results when an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is connected across a [[transmission line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communications Standard Dictionary|last=Weik|first=Martin|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|year=1989|isbn=9781461566748|location=New York|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expressed as the ratio, in [[decibel]]s, of the [[signal (information theory)|signal]] [[power (physics)|power]] delivered to a given point in a [[system]] downstream from the bridging point prior to bridging, to the signal power delivered to the given point after bridging.

[[Image:Cattle race.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A curved "V" (tapered) race leading to a covered crush]]
A '''cattle chute''' (North America) or '''cattle race''' ([[Australia]], [[British Isles]] and [[New Zealand]])  also called a '''run''' or '''alley''',&lt;ref&gt;   [http://www.bowmanenterprisesnet.com/ "Cattle handling equipment"],  [ bowmanenterprisesnet.com]  [http://www.filsonlivestockequip.com/sweeps_&amp;_alleys.htm "SWEEPS &amp; ALLEYS"],   filsonlivestockequip.com.
&lt;/ref&gt; is a narrow corridor built for [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[pig]]s and other animals to travel through when being herded from one location to another that is nearby. A conventional race consists of parallel panels or fences with a space between them just wide enough for one animal to pass through comfortably without being able to turn around, thus forming the animals into a [[queue area|queue]] that only allows them to go forward.&lt;ref&gt;
   Doyle, Philip W., Beef Cattle Yards, NSW Dept. of Agriculture, 1979.
&lt;/ref&gt;   It is used for routine husbandry activities such as drafting (sorting) or loading animals via ramp or ''loading chute'' into a vehicle; placing them one at a time in a ''[[cattle crush]]''
(variations also called a ''squeeze chute'' or ''standing stock'')
for examination, marking or veterinary treatment.  They are also used at [[packing plant]]s to move animals into a crush designed for [[slaughter house|slaughter]].

== Overview ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CurvedRaceCattleCorral.jpg|thumb|right|Experimental humane cattle race]] --&gt;
An experimental humane design of cattle run, by [[Temple Grandin]], gradually narrows so that cattle have ample time to form the queue, and curves to encourage cattle to move forward in a controlled manner (see photo).

Calves (and other smaller animals such as sheep) can turn around in an adult cattle race, so a narrower race is required for proper handling.  Thus the width of some races are adjustable to accommodate different sized animals.

[[Image:Portable yards.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Portable cattle yards including a head bail, Gunnedah, NSW]]
Cattle races may be portable, or may be a permanent fixture with a concrete walkway. Portable races may be made of steel, iron or aluminium; but modern permanent ones are usually of steel or iron (sometimes timber or even concrete) which is usually set in concrete, with solid or railed sides and a non-slip floor. Anti-bruise races do not have sharp edges, and instead use pipe with rounded edges such as oval rails; alternatively sides with sheet iron or steel can be found or built onto the races, which improves livestock movement and also prevents injuries from animals getting their legs or heads caught between the rails. Races that have concrete floors have the flooring made wider than the race itself to prevent hooves catching between the bottom rail and the edge of the concrete.  The concrete is also not smooth like that on city sidewalks but roughed out to give the animals more traction to prevent slipping and injury.  Lower parts of the race have side panels that may be removable in the event of an animal becoming cast (fallen) or caught up in which the animal is needed to be freed to prevent further injury.

The length of the race is usually determined by the size of the herd &amp;ndash; a longer one requires less penning-up of a larger herd. Longer races may be curved, to improve the movement of the animals. However races longer than {{convert|24|ft|m|1}} tend to cause trouble with the flow of the animals into the loading chute or cattle crush. A walkway may be provided on the outside of the race, on one or both sides, to allow handlers easier handling, examination or treatment of animals from above.  

There are gates at the start and end of the race to regulate the movement of animals.  The entrance is from a small funnel-shaped or semi-circular ''forcing pen'' (or ''forcing yard'' or ''crowding tub''), where a gate is used to move cattle into the race.  The gates are usually arranged so the operator cannot become trapped or injured by the cattle.  This is achieved in several ways:
:* using a sliding gate operated from outside the race, commonly found between the exit of the crowding tub and the entrance to the race, in the middle of the race itself, or at the end of the race in entrance to the crush or loading chute;
:* unlatching exit gates by a remotely operated cord;
:* or for a forcing pen gate which uses a self-locking brake-latch that will lock if animals move back on it but be pushed forward by the handler.  A latch is pulled back to unlock the gate so that it can open to another batch of livestock waiting to be forced in behind the previous batch.  This forcing pen gate can swing at an angle of 180° to 300°.

| colspan=2 |
[[Image:Calf cradle.JPG|right|thumb|center|A calf race leading to a calf cradle]]
|}
The exit from the race may be through a ''drafting gate'' (or ''shedding gate''), which swings to open one or another of several exits for separating animals into various groups.

== Calf race/cradle ==
{{main|Livestock crush}}
A calf race and cradle makes [[livestock branding|calf branding]] and [[castration]] much quicker and cleaner. The calf is forced into a crush, like that of a normal crush, except it is pushed to one side and held by steel bars as shown in the photo on the right. Note that the bars are nowhere near the belly region of the calf, only located on the neck and in front of the stifle. Then one side of the crush is tipped 90°, exposing the side of the calf to be branded or examined. Calf cradles are available in temporary or permanent styles like that described above.  The steel transportable race and table cradle, as shown in the photo, are very popular in Australia and New Zealand, but are also found in North America.

[[File:Electric steam iron.jpg|thumb|An electric steam iron]]
[[File:Szénvasaló.JPG|thumb|Charcoal iron (Hungary)]]

A '''clothes iron''' is a device that, when heated, is used to press clothes to remove [[Wrinkle|creases]]. It is named for the metal of which the device was historically commonly made, and the use of it is generally called [[ironing]]. Ironing works by loosening the ties between the long chains of molecules that exist in [[polymer]] fiber materials. With the heat and the weight of the ironing plate, the fibers are stretched and the fabric maintains its new shape when cool. Some materials, such as cotton, require the use of water to loosen the intermolecular bonds. 

Before the introduction of electricity, irons were heated by combustion, either in a fire or with some internal arrangement. An "electric flatiron" was invented by American [[Henry W. Seeley]] and patented on June 6, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|259,054}}&lt;/ref&gt; It weighed almost 15 pounds and took a long time to heat. The UK [[Electricity Association]] is reported to have said that an electric iron with a carbon arc appeared in France in 1880, but this is considered doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museelr.chez.com/origines.htm |title=DU FER A REPASSER|trans-title=The smoothing iron|website=Musée du Lavage et du Repassage (Museum of Washing and Ironing)|language=French|date=  |author= |accessdate= 27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal pans filled with hot coals were used for smoothing fabrics in [[China]] in the 1st century [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="OldAndInteresting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldandinteresting.com/antique-irons-smoothers-mangles.aspx |title=History of ironing and irons - flat-irons, sad-irons, mangles |publisher=Oldandinteresting.com |date=2002-02-07 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 17th century, ''sadirons'' or ''sad irons'' (from Middle English "sad" meaning of "solid", used in modern English through the 1800s&lt;ref&gt;OED&lt;/ref&gt;) began to be used. They were thick slabs of [[cast iron]], delta-shaped and with a handle, heated in a fire or on a stove. These were also called flat irons. A later design consisted of an iron box which could be filled with hot [[coal]]s, which had to be periodically aerated by attaching a bellows. In [[Kerala]] in India, burning [[coconut]] shells were used instead of charcoal, as they have a similar heating capacity. This method is still in use as a backup device, since power outages are frequent. Other box irons had heated metal inserts instead of hot coals.

Another solution was to employ a cluster of solid irons that were heated from a single source: As the iron currently in use cooled down, it could be quickly replaced by a hot one. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there were many irons in use that were heated by fuels such as [[kerosene]], [[ethanol]], [[whale oil]], [[natural gas]], carbide gas ([[acetylene]], as with [[carbide lamp]]s), or even [[gasoline]]. Some houses were equipped with a system of pipes for distributing natural gas or carbide gas to different rooms in order to operate appliances such as irons, in addition to lights. Despite the risk of fire, liquid-fuel irons were sold in U.S. rural areas up through World War II.

In the industrialized world, these designs have been superseded by the electric iron, which uses [[electrical resistance|resistive]] heating from an [[electric current]]. The hot plate, called the ''sole plate'', is made of [[aluminium]] or [[stainless steel]] polished to be as smooth as possible; it is sometimes coated with a low-friction heat-resistant plastic to reduce friction below that of the metal plate. The heating element is controlled by a [[thermostat]] that switches the current on and off to maintain the selected temperature. The invention of the resistively heated electric iron is credited to Henry W. Seeley of [[New York City]] in 1882. In the same year an iron heated by a carbon arc was introduced in France, but was too dangerous to be successful. The early electric irons had no easy way to control their temperature, and the first thermostatically controlled electric iron appeared in the 1920s. Later, steam was used to iron clothing. Credit for the invention of the steam iron goes to [[Thomas Sears]]. The first commercially available electric steam iron was introduced in 1926 by a New York drying and cleaning company, Eldec, but was not a commercial success. The patent for an electric steam iron and dampener was issued to Max Skolnik of Chicago in 1934. In 1938 Skolnik granted the Steam-O-Matic Corporation of New York the exclusive right to manufacture steam-electric irons. This was the first steam iron to achieve any degree of popularity, and led the way to more widespread use of the electric steam iron during the 1940s and 1950s.

===Types and names of iron===
Historically, irons have had several variations and have thus been called by many names:

* '''Flatiron ([[American English]]), flat iron ([[British English]]) or smoothing iron'''
: The general name for a hand-held iron consisting simply of a handle and a solid, flat, metal base, and named for the flat ironing face used to smooth clothes.
* '''Sad iron or sadiron'''&lt;ref name="OldAndInteresting"/&gt;
: Mentioned above, meaning "solid" or heavy iron, where the base is a solid block of metal, sometimes used to refer to irons with heavier bases than a typical "flatiron".
* '''Box iron, ironing box, charcoal iron, ox-tongue iron or slug iron'''&lt;ref name="OldAndInteresting" /&gt;
: Mentioned above; the base is a container, into which hot coals or a metal brick or slug can be inserted to keep the iron heated. The ox-tongue iron is named for the particular shape of the insert, referred to as an ox-tongue slug.
* '''Goose, tailor's goose or, in Scottish, gusing iron'''&lt;ref name="OldAndInteresting" /&gt;
: A type of flat iron or sad iron named for the goose-like curve in its neck, and (in the case of "tailor's goose") its usage by tailors.
* '''Goffering iron'''
: This type of iron, now obsolete, consists of a [[:File:Tally iron set.jpg|metal cylinder oriented horizontally on a stand]]. It was used to iron [[Ruff (clothing)|ruffs]] and collars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.objectlessons.org/houses-and-homes-victorians/goffering-irons-victorian-original/s59/a911/ |title=Goffering Irons, Victorian, Original &amp;#124; Object Lessons - Houses &amp; Homes: Victorians |publisher=Object Lessons |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldandinteresting.com/fluting-goffering-irons.aspx |title=Crimping, fluting, goffering, Italian irons: smoothing frills, ruffles, puffed sleeves |publisher=Oldandinteresting.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Modern irons for home use can have the following features:
* A design that allows the iron to be set down, usually standing on its end, without the hot soleplate touching anything that could be damaged;
* A [[thermostat]] ensuring maintenance of a constant temperature;
* A temperature control dial allowing the user to select the operating temperatures (usually marked with types of cloth rather than temperatures: "[[silk]]", "[[wool]]", "[[cotton]]", "[[linen]]", etc.);
* An electrical cord with heat-resistant [[silicone rubber]] insulation;
* Injection of [[steam]] through the fabric during the ironing process;
** A water reservoir inside the iron used for steam generation;
** An indicator showing the amount of water left in the reservoir,
** Constant steam: constantly sends steam through the hot part of the iron into the clothes;
** Steam burst: sends a burst of steam through the clothes when the user presses a button;
** (advanced feature) Dial controlling the amount of steam to emit as a constant stream;
** (advanced feature) Anti-drip system;
* Cord control: the point at which the cord attaches to the iron has a spring to hold the cord out of the way while ironing and likewise when setting down the iron (prevents fires, is more convenient, etc.);
* A retractable cord for easy storage;
* (advanced feature) non-stick coating along the sole plate to help the iron glide across the fabric
* (advanced feature) Anti-burn control: if the iron is left flat (possibly touching clothes) for too long, the iron shuts off to prevent scorching and fires;
* (advanced feature) Energy saving control: if the iron is left undisturbed for several (10 or 15) minutes, the iron shuts off.
* Cordless irons: the iron is placed on a stand for a short period to warm up, using [[thermal mass]] to stay hot for a short period. These are useful for light loads only.  [[Battery (electricity)|Battery]] power is not viable for irons as they require more power than practical batteries can provide.
* (advanced feature) 3-way automatic shut-off
* (advanced feature) self-cleaning
* (advanced feature) vertical steam to help to remove creases and wrinkles by holding an iron vertically and steaming material close to it.

==Collections==
One of the world's larger collection of irons, comprising 1300 historical examples of irons from Germany and the rest of the world, is housed in [[Gochsheim Castle]], near [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]].

Many ethnographical museums around the world have collections of irons. In [[Ukraine]], for example, about 150 irons are the part of the exhibition of the [[Radomysl Castle]] in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Богомолець. О. "Замок-музей Радомисль на Шляху Королів Via Regia". — Київ, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ironing center==
[[Image: Stoomstrijkijzer.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ironing center, where one can see the separate tank.]]
An ironing center or [[steam ironing]] station is a device consisting of a clothes iron and a separate steam generator-tank. By having a separate tank, the ironing unit can generate more steam than a conventional iron, making steam ironing faster. Such ironing facilities take longer to warm up than conventional irons, and cost more.

'''Constant-current diode''' is an electronic device that limits current to a maximal specified value for the device.  It is known as '''current-limiting diode''' ('''CLD'''), '''current-regulating diode''' ('''CRD''').

[[File:Current limiting diode - internal structure.svg|thumb|150px|Internal structure]]
These diodes consist of an n-channel [[JFET]] with the gate shorted to the source, which functions like a two-terminal current limiter or [[current source]] (analogous to a voltage-limiting [[Zener diode]]).  They allow a current through them to rise to a certain value, and then level off at a specific value.  Unlike Zener diodes, these diodes keep the current constant instead of the voltage constant.  These devices keep the current flowing through them unchanged when the voltage changes. An example is the 1N5312. Note the negative ''V''&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; is required, as an example on the n-type junction-gate field-effect transistor 2N5457.

[[File:Mamiya RB67 - dos 120.jpg|thumb|A dark slide on the back of a [[Mamiya]] RB67]]
In [[photography]], a '''dark slide''' is a wooden or metal plate that covers the sensitized [[emulsion]] side of a photographic plate. In use, a pair of plates joined back to back were used with both plates covered with a dark slide. When used, the dark slide is removed for the period of the exposure and then replaced. Modern dark slides are used in conjunction with a film holder, that either holds in place pieces of cut sheet film or, if modified, some piece of light sensitive material such as glass.

[[File:MAHOGANY DOUBLE DARK SLIDES, TO FIT LANCASTER Camera Supply , 1895-1902 PLATE CAMERA (17036203928).jpg|thumb|Mahogany double dark slides]]
In place, the dark slide is in a film holder or magazine. Film holders usually refer to cut sheet film and magazines refer to roll film. Vintage film holders were made of wood and held in place either photo-sensitized plates or photo sensitive film. In either case, the construction must be such to reduce light leaks, or any unwanted light from striking the film until the holder is held in place by a camera and considered "light tight". Some holders held only one piece of light sensitive material, some are double sided and hold two pieces of film.

Once in the camera with a light tight back and light tight bellows, the dark slide may be pulled out for the exposure to be made from a lens. After the exposure, the dark slide is put back in place and the array is put away, usually in a light tight cloth bag or box until it can be taken into a darkroom for development. The term "dark slide" refers to the fact the slide is pulled or slid out of the frame either plastic or wooden. On sliding it back in, the same channels for holding the dark slide are used to cover the film. Ordinarily, in modern film holders, the opening to permit the dark slide to be removed is protected by a strip of black velour or other black baffling that permits the dark slide to move in and out of the holder while restraining the amount of light used by the dark slide while either in place or removed.

A dark slide is used for magazine backs on [[medium format]] cameras such as [[Hasselblad]] and [[Mamiya]], and plate or sheet film holders on [[view camera]]s, like the earlier [[Reisekamera]].

'''Diathermy''' is electrically induced heat or the use of high-frequency electromagnetic currents as a form of physical therapy and in surgical procedures.       
The field was pioneered in 1907 by German physician Karl Franz Nagelschmidt, who coined the term ''diathermy'' from the Greek words ''dia'' and θέρμη ''therma'', literally meaning "heating through" (adj., diather´mal, diather´mic).

Diathermy is commonly used for [[muscle]] relaxation, and to induce deep heating in tissue for therapeutic purposes in medicine.  It is used in physical therapy to deliver moderate heat directly to pathologic lesions in the deeper tissues of the body.

Diathermy is produced by three techniques: [[ultrasound]] (''ultrasonic diathermy''), short-wave radio frequencies in the range 1–100&amp;nbsp;MHz (''shortwave diathermy'') or [[microwave]]s typically in the 915&amp;nbsp;MHz or 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz bands (''microwave diathermy''), the methods differing mainly in their penetration capability.&lt;ref name="Dutton2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Dutton|title=Physical Therapist Assistant Exam Review Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fISkTGGX2XUC&amp;pg=PA468&amp;dq=thermo+penetratin+diathermy#v=onepage&amp;q=thermo%20penetratin%20diathermy&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=11 May 2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-0-7637-9757-7|pages=468–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exerts physical effects and elicits a spectrum of physiological responses.

The same techniques are also used to create higher tissue temperatures to destroy [[neoplasm]]s (cancer and tumors), warts, and infected tissues; this is called [[hyperthermia treatment]].  In surgery diathermy is used to [[cauterize]] blood vessels to prevent excessive bleeding. The technique is particularly valuable in neurosurgery and surgery of the eye.

==History==
The idea that high-frequency electromagnetic currents could have therapeutic effects was explored independently around the same time (1890-91) by French physician and biophysicist [[Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval]] and Serbian American engineer [[Nikola Tesla]].&lt;ref name="Rhees"&gt;{{cite journal

By 1900 application of high-frequency current to the body was used experimentally to treat a wide variety of medical conditions in the new medical field of ''[[electrotherapy]]''. In 1899 Austrian chemist von Zaynek determined the rate of heat production in tissue as a function of frequency and current density, and first proposed using high-frequency currents for deep heating therapy.&lt;ref name="Ho" /&gt;  In 1908 German physician Karl Franz Nagelschmidt coined the term ''diathermy'', and performed the first extensive experiments on patients.&lt;ref name="Hand" /&gt;   Nagelschmidt is considered the founder of the field.  He wrote the first textbook on diathermy in 1913, which revolutionized the field.&lt;ref name="Ho" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hand" /&gt;

Until the 1920s noisy spark-discharge [[Tesla coil]] and [[Oudin coil]] machines were used.  These were limited to frequencies of 0.1 - 2&amp;nbsp;MHz, called "longwave" diathermy. The current was applied directly to the body with contact electrodes, which could cause skin burns.  In the 1920s the development of [[vacuum tube]] machines allowed frequencies to be increased to 10 - 300&amp;nbsp;MHz, called "shortwave" diathermy.  The energy was applied to the body with inductive coils of wire or capacitive plates insulated from the body, which reduced the risk of burns.   By the 1940s [[microwave]]s were being used experimentally.

==Uses==
[[Image:Diathermy machine 1933.jpg|thumb|Shortwave diathermy machine, 1933]]

===Physical therapy===
The three forms of diathermy employed by physical therapists are [[ultrasound]], [[short wave]] and [[microwave]]. The application of moderate heat by diathermy increases blood flow and speeds up metabolism and the rate of ion diffusion across cellular membranes. The fibrous tissues in tendons, joint capsules, and scars are more easily stretched when subjected to heat, thus facilitating the relief of stiffness of joints and promoting relaxation of the muscles and decrease of muscle spasms.

====Ultrasound====
{{main article|Therapeutic ultrasound}}
Ultrasound diathermy employs high-frequency acoustic vibrations which, when propelled through the tissues, are converted into heat. This type of diathermy is especially useful in the delivery of heat to selected musculatures and structures because there is a difference in the sensitivity of various fibers to the acoustic vibrations; some are more absorptive and some are more reflective. For example, in subcutaneous fat, relatively little energy is converted into heat, but in muscle tissues there is a much higher rate of conversion to heat.

The therapeutic ultrasound apparatus generates a high-frequency alternating current, which is then converted into acoustic vibrations. The apparatus is moved slowly across the surface of the part being treated. Ultrasound is a very effective agent for the application of heat, but it should be used only by a therapist who is fully aware of its potential hazards and the contraindications for its use.

====Short wave====
Short wave diathermy machines use two condenser plates that are placed on either side of the body part to be treated. Another mode of application is by induction coils that are pliable and can be molded to fit the part of the body under treatment. As the high-frequency waves travel through the body tissues between the condensers or the coils, they are converted into heat. The degree of heat and depth of penetration depend in part on the absorptive and resistance properties of the tissues that the waves encounter.

Short wave diathermy operations use the [[ISM band]] frequencies of 13.56, 27.12, and 40.68 megahertz. Most commercial machines operate at a frequency of 27.12&amp;nbsp;MHz, a wavelength of approximately 11 meters.

Short wave diathermy usually is prescribed for treatment of deep muscles and joints that are covered with a heavy soft-tissue mass, for example, the hip. In some instances short wave diathermy may be applied to localize deep inflammatory processes, as in [[pelvic inflammatory disease]]. Short wave diathermy can also be used for hyperthermia therapy, as an adjuvant to radiation in cancer treatment. Typically, hyperthermia would be added twice a week before radiation, as shown in the photograph from a 2010  clinical trial at [[Mahavir Cancer Sansthan]] in Patna, India. [[File:Diathermy unit for hyperthermia treatment.jpg|thumb|Clinical trial of hyperthermia and radiation at the Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, Patna, India]]

====Microwave====
Microwave diathermy uses [[microwave]]s, radio waves which are higher in [[frequency]] and shorter in [[wavelength]] than the [[short wave]]s above.  Microwaves, which are also used in [[radar]], have a frequency above 300&amp;nbsp;MHz and a wavelength less than one meter.  Most, if not all, of the therapeutic effects of microwave therapy are related to the conversion of energy into heat and its distribution throughout the body tissues. This mode of diathermy is considered to be the easiest to use, but the microwaves have a relatively poor depth of penetration.

Microwaves cannot be used in high dosage on [[edematous| edematous tissue]], over wet dressings, or near metallic implants in the body because of the danger of local burns. Microwaves and short waves cannot be used on or near persons with implanted electronic cardiac pacemakers.

[[Hyperthermia]] induced by microwave diathermy raises the temperature of deep tissues from 41&amp;nbsp;°C to 45&amp;nbsp;°C using electromagnetic power.  The biological mechanism that regulates the relationship between the thermal dose and the healing process of soft tissues with low or high water content or with low or high blood perfusion is still under study. Microwave diathermy treatment at 434 and 915&amp;nbsp;MHz can be effective in the short-term management of musculo-skeletal injuries.

Hyperthermia is safe if the temperature is kept under 45&amp;nbsp;°C or 113&amp;nbsp;°F.  The absolute temperature is, however, not sufficient to predict the damage that it may produce.

Microwave diathermy-induced hyperthermia produced short-term pain relief in established supraspinatus tendinopathy.

The physical characteristics of most of the devices used clinically to heat tissues have been proved to be inefficient to reach the necessary therapeutic heating patterns in the range of depth of the damage tissue. The preliminary studies performed with new microwave devices working at 434&amp;nbsp;MHz have demonstrated encouraging results. Nevertheless, adequately designed prospective-controlled clinical studies need to be completed to confirm the therapeutic effectiveness of hyperthermia with large number of patients, longer-term follow-up and mixed populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bmb/ldm020 |title=Hyperthermia induced by microwave diathermy in the management of muscle and tendon injuries |year=2007 |last1=Giombini |first1=A. |last2=Giovannini |first2=V. |last3=Cesare |first3=A. D. |last4=Pacetti |first4=P. |last5=Ichinoseki-Sekine |first5=N. |last6=Shiraishi |first6=M. |last7=Naito |first7=H. |last8=Maffulli |first8=N. |journal=British Medical Bulletin |volume=83 |pages=379–96 |pmid=17942453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microwave diathermy is used in the management of superficial tumours with conventional [[radiotherapy]] and [[chemotherapy]].  Hyperthermia has been used in oncology for more than 35 years, in addition to radiotherapy, in the management of different tumours.  In 1994, hyperthermia was introduced in several countries of the European Union as a modality for use in physical medicine and sports traumatology. Its use has been successfully extended to physical medicine and sports traumatology in Central and Southern Europe.

===Surgery===
{{Main article | Electrosurgery}}
''Surgical diathermy'' is usually better known as "[[electrosurgery]]". (It is also referred to occasionally as "[[Cauterization#Electrocautery|electrocautery]]", but see disambiguation below.) Electrosurgery and surgical diathermy involve the use of high-frequency A.C. electric current in [[surgery]] as either a cutting modality, or else to cauterize small blood vessels to stop bleeding. This technique induces localized tissue burning and damage, the zone of which is controlled by the frequency and power of the device.

Some sources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valleylab.com/education/poes/poes_02.html ''Valleylab article'']'' on Principles of Electrosurgery/Electrocautery''&lt;/ref&gt; insist that [[electrosurgery]] be applied to surgery accomplished by high-frequency alternating current (AC) cutting, and that "[[Cauterization#Electrocautery|electrocautery]]" be used only for the practice of cauterization with heated [[nichrome]] wires powered by direct current (DC), as in the handheld battery-operated portable cautery tools.

====Types====
Diathermy used in surgery is of typically two types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bipolar Surgical Diathermy|url=http://home.btconnect.com/MalcolmBrown/entries/BIPOLAR_SURGICAL_DIATHERMY.html|work=Medical Equipment Dictionary|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Monopolar, where electric current passes from one electrode near the tissue to be treated to other fixed electrode (indifferent electrode) elsewhere in the body. Usually this type of electrode is placed in contact with buttocks or around the leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indifferent Electrode|url=http://home.btconnect.com/MalcolmBrown/entries/INDIFFERENT_ELECTRODE.html|work=Medical Equipment Dictionary|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Bipolar, where both electrodes are mounted on same pen-like device and electric current passes only through the tissue being treated. Advantage of bipolar electrosurgery is that it prevents the flow of current through other tissues of the body and focuses only on the tissue in contact. This is useful in [[microsurgery]] and in patients with [[cardiac pacemaker]].

==Diathermy risks==

Burns from electrocautery generally arise from a faulty grounding pad or from an outbreak of a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kressin KA|author2=Posner KL|author3=Lee LA|author4=Cheney FW|author5= Domino KB|year=2004|title=Burn injury in the OR: a closed claims analysis|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=101|page=A1282|url=http://www.asaabstracts.com/strands/asaabstracts/abstract.htm;jsessionid=88AFA2FC766242E24C0D122F1170663B?year=2004&amp;index=15&amp;absnum=1067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monopolar electrocautery works because radio frequency energy is concentrated by the surgical instrument's small surface area. The electrical circuit is completed by passing current through the patient's body to a conductive pad that is connected to the radio frequency generator. Because the pad's surface area is large relative to the instrument's tip, energy density across the pad is reliably low enough that no tissue injury occurs at the pad site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asit.org/assets/documents/Prinicpals_in_electrosurgery.pdf |title=Principles of Electrosurgery |date=2008 |website=asit.org |publisher=Covidien AG |access-date=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical shocks and burns are possible, however, if the circuit is interrupted or energy is concentrated in some way. This can happen if the pad surface in contact is small, e.g. if the pad's electrolytic gel is dry, if the pad becomes disconnected from the radio frequency generator, or via a metal implant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Case Report Full-Thickness Forehead Burn Over Indwelling Titanium Hardware Resulting From an Aberrant Intraoperative Electrocautery Circuit |year=208 |last1=Mundlinger |first1=Gerhard |last2=Rosen |first2=Shai |last3=Carson |first3=Benjamin |journal=Eplasty |volume=8 |pages=e1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern electrocautery systems are equipped with sensors to detect high resistance in the circuit that can prevent some injuries.

As with all forms of heat applications, care must be taken to avoid burns during diathermy treatments, especially in patients with decreased sensitivity to heat and cold. With electrocautery there have been reported cases of [[Flash fire#Surgical flash fire|flash fires]] in the operating theatre related to heat generation meeting chemical flash points, especially in the presence of increased oxygen concentrations associated with anaesthetic.

Concerns have also been raised regarding the toxicity of [[surgical smoke]] produced by electrocautery. This has been shown to contain chemicals which may cause harm to patients, surgeons and/or operating theatre staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00464-011-1872-1 |title=A single-blind controlled study of electrocautery and ultrasonic scalpel smoke plumes in laparoscopic surgery |year=2011 |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=J. Edward F. |last2=Malik |first2=Momin |last3=Ahmed |first3=Irfan |journal=Surgical Endoscopy |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=337–42 |pmid=21898022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For patients that have a surgically implanted [[Spinal Cord Stimulator]] (SCS) system, diathermy can cause tissue damage through energy that is transferred into the implanted SCS components resulting in severe injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spinal Cord Stimulator|author1=Anthony H |author2=Wheeler, MD |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1980819-periprocedure#aw2aab6b3b2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical diathermy devices were used to cause interference to German radio beams used for targeting nighttime bombing raids in World War II during the [[Battle of the Beams]].

'''Electronic filters''' are circuits which perform [[signal processing]] functions, specifically to remove unwanted frequency components from the signal, to enhance wanted ones, or both. Electronic [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] can be:

*[[Passive filter|passive]] or [[active filter|active]]
*[[analogue filter|analog]] or [[digital filter|digital]]
*[[high-pass filter|high-pass]], [[low-pass filter|low-pass]], [[band-pass filter|band-pass]], [[band-stop filter|band-stop]] (band-rejection; notch), or [[all-pass filter|all-pass]].
*[[discrete-time]] (sampled) or [[Continuous signal|continuous-time]]
*[[linear filter|linear]] or [[non-linear filter|non-linear]]
*[[infinite impulse response]] (IIR type) or [[finite impulse response]] (FIR type)

The most common types of electronic filters are [[linear filters]], regardless of other aspects of their design. See the article on linear filters for details on their design and analysis.

== History ==
{{main|Analogue filter}}
The oldest forms of electronic filters are passive analog linear filters, constructed using only [[resistors]] and [[capacitor]]s or resistors and [[inductor]]s. These are known as RC and RL single-[[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] filters respectively.  However, these simple filters have very limited uses.  Multipole LC filters provide greater control of response form, bandwidth and [[transition band]]s.  The first of these filters was the [[constant k filter]], invented by [[George Ashley Campbell|George Campbell]] in 1910.  Campbell's filter was a ladder network based on [[transmission line]] theory.  Together with improved filters by [[Otto Zobel]] and others, these filters are known as [[image parameter filter]]s. A major step forward was taken by [[Wilhelm Cauer]] who founded the field of [[network synthesis filter|network synthesis]] around the time of [[World War II]].  Cauer's theory allowed filters to be constructed that precisely followed some prescribed frequency function.

== Classification by technology ==

===Passive filters===
Passive implementations of linear filters are based on combinations of [[resistor]]s (R), [[inductor]]s (L) and [[capacitor]]s (C). These types are collectively known as ''passive filters'', because they do not depend upon an external power supply and/or they do not contain active components such as transistors.

Inductors block high-frequency signals and conduct low-frequency signals, while [[capacitor]]s do the reverse.  A filter in which the signal passes through an [[inductor]], or in which a capacitor provides a path to ground, presents less [[attenuation]] to low-frequency signals than high-frequency signals and is therefore a ''[[low-pass filter]]''. If the signal passes through a capacitor, or has a path to ground through an inductor, then the filter presents less attenuation to high-frequency signals than low-frequency signals and therefore is a ''[[high-pass filter]]''. [[Resistor]]s on their own have no frequency-selective properties, but are added to inductors and capacitors to determine the ''time-constants'' of the circuit, and therefore the frequencies to which it responds.

The inductors and capacitors are the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] elements of the filter.  The number of elements determines the order of the filter.  In this context, an [[LC circuit|LC tuned circuit]] being used in a band-pass or band-stop filter is considered a single element even though it consists of two components.

At high frequencies (above about 100 [[hertz|megahertz]]), sometimes the inductors consist of single loops or strips of sheet metal, and the capacitors consist of adjacent strips of metal. These inductive or capacitive pieces of metal are called [[stub (electronics)|stubs]].

====Single element types====
[[File:1st Order Lowpass Filter RC.svg|framed|A low-pass electronic filter realised by an [[RC circuit]]]]

The simplest passive filters, [[RC circuit|RC]] and [[RL circuit|RL]] filters, include only one reactive element, except [[Hybrid LC Filter|hybrid LC filter]] which is characterized by inductance and capacitance integrated in one element.&lt;ref&gt;Dzhankhotov V., ''Hybrid LC filter for power electronic drives: Theory and Implementation'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==== L filter ====
An L filter consists of two reactive elements, one in series and one in parallel.

==== T and π filters ====
[[File:Lowpass Pi Filter.svg|thumb|250px|left|Low-pass π filter]]
[[File:Highpass T Filter.svg|thumb|250px|right|High-pass T filter]]

Three-element filters can have a 'T' or 'π' topology and in either geometries, a [[low-pass]], [[high-pass]], [[band-pass]], or [[band-stop]] characteristic is possible. The components can be chosen symmetric or not, depending on the required frequency characteristics. The high-pass T filter in the illustration, has a very low impedance at high frequencies, and a very high impedance at low frequencies. That means that it can be inserted in a transmission line, resulting in the high frequencies being passed and low frequencies being reflected. Likewise, for the illustrated low-pass π filter, the circuit can be connected to a transmission line, transmitting low frequencies and reflecting high frequencies. Using [[m-derived filter]] sections with correct termination impedances, the input impedance can be reasonably constant in the pass band.&lt;ref&gt;The American Radio Relay League, Inc.: "The ARRL Handbook, 1968" page 50&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

====Multiple element types====

Multiple element filters are usually constructed as a [[ladder network]].  These can be seen as a continuation of the L,T and π designs of filters.  More elements are needed when it is desired to improve some parameter of the filter such as stop-band rejection or slope of transition from pass-band to stop-band.

===Active filters===
[[Active filter]]s are implemented using a combination of passive and active (amplifying) components, and require an outside power source. [[Operational amplifier]]s are frequently used in active filter designs. These can have high [[Q factor]], and can achieve [[Electrical resonance|resonance]] without the use of inductors. However, their upper frequency limit is limited by the bandwidth of the amplifiers.

===Other filter technologies===
{{main|Filter (signal processing)}}
There are many filter technologies other than lumped component electronics.  These include [[digital filter]]s, [[crystal filter]]s, [[mechanical filter]]s, [[surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) filters, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters, [[YIG sphere|garnet filters]], and atomic filters (used in [[atomic clock]]s).

== The transfer function ==
:''see also [[Filter (signal processing)]] for further analysis''
The [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;\ H(s)&lt;/math&gt; of a filter is the ratio of the output signal &lt;math&gt;\ Y(s)&lt;/math&gt; to that of the input signal &lt;math&gt;\ X(s)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the complex frequency &lt;math&gt;\ s&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ H(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\ s = \sigma + j \omega&lt;/math&gt;.

The transfer function of all linear time-invariant filters, when constructed of discrete components, will be the ratio of two polynomials in &lt;math&gt;\ s&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. a [[rational function]] of &lt;math&gt;\ s&lt;/math&gt;. The order of the transfer function will be the highest power of &lt;math&gt;\ s&lt;/math&gt; encountered in either the numerator or the denominator.

== Classification by topology ==

Electronic filters can be classified by the technology used to implement them.
Filters using [[passive filter]] and [[active filter]] technology can be further classified by the particular [[electronic filter topology]] used to implement them.

Any given filter transfer function may be implemented in any [[electronic filter topology]].

Some common circuit topologies are:

* [[Cauer topology]] – passive
* [[Sallen–Key topology]] – active
* [[Multiple feedback topology]] – active
* [[State variable filter|State variable topology]] – active
* [[biquad filter|Biquadratic topology]] – active

==Classification by design methodology==
{{Linear analog electronic filter}}
Historically, linear analog filter design has evolved through three major approaches.  The oldest designs are simple circuits where the main design criterion was the [[Q factor]] of the circuit.  This reflected the radio receiver application of filtering as Q was a measure of the frequency selectivity of a tuning circuit.  From the 1920s filters began to be designed from the [[image impedance|image]] point of view, mostly being driven by the requirements of telecommunications.  After [[World War II]] the dominant methodology was [[network synthesis filters|network synthesis]].  The higher mathematics used originally required extensive tables of polynomial coefficient values to be published but modern computer resources have made that unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, J, ''Innovation and the Communications Revolution'', Institute of Electrical Engineers''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct circuit analysis===
Low order filters can be designed by directly applying basic circuit laws such as [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]] to obtain the transfer function.  This kind of analysis is usually only carried out for simple filters of 1st or 2nd order.
[[File:RL filter response.png|thumb|left|250px|RL filter frequency response]]
{{clear|left}}

===Image impedance analysis===
:{{main|Composite image filters}}
This approach analyses the filter sections from the point of view of the filter being in an infinite chain of identical sections.  It has the advantages of simplicity of approach and the ability to easily extend to higher orders.  It has the disadvantage that accuracy of predicted responses relies on filter terminations in the image impedance, which is usually not the case.&lt;ref name="MYJ"&gt;Matthaei, Young, Jones ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'' McGraw-Hill 1964&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Constant k order 5.png|thumb|left|250px|Constant k filter response with 5 elements]]
[[File:Zobel 5 sections.png|thumb|none|250px|Zobel network (constant R) filter, 5 sections]]
[[File:m-derived order 1.png|thumb|left|250px|m-derived filter response, m=0.5, 2 elements]]
[[File:m-derived order 5.png|thumb|none|250px|m-derived filter response, m=0.5, 5 elements]]
{{clear|left}}

===Network synthesis===
:{{main|Network synthesis filters}}
The network synthesis approach starts with a required transfer function and then expresses that as a polynomial equation of the input impedance of the filter.  The actual element values of the filter are obtained by continued-fraction or partial-fraction expansions of this polynomial.  Unlike the image method, there is no need for impedance matching networks at the terminations as the effects of the terminating resistors are included in the analysis from the start.&lt;ref name="MYJ"/&gt;

Here is an image comparing Butterworth, Chebyshev, and elliptic filters. The filters in this illustration are all fifth-order low-pass filters. The particular implementation&amp;nbsp;– analog or digital, passive or active&amp;nbsp;– makes no difference; their output would be the same.

[[File:Electronic linear filters.svg|500px|center]]

As is clear from the image, elliptic filters are sharper than all the others, but they show ripples on the whole bandwidth.

'''Existing visitor optimisation''' (EVO) is a discipline of optimising [[website]]s to maximise return from existing visitors rather than through [[search engine optimisation]] ([[SEO]]). While [[SEO]] is useful to gain more visitors, EVO looks at types of [[neuromarketing]] and [[psychology]] to optimise the language and layout elements of websites to maximise the benefits of the increased visitors.

Strategies that may be employed include asking "how many would you like" rather than offering an "add to cart" button on [[e-commerce]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;Bandler, Richard &amp; LaValle, John. ''Persuasion Engineering''. Meta Publications, Chapter. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; EVO is a concept that works closely with existing [[marketing]] concepts such as the utilisation of [[social media]]. Initially investigated by a PhD student from [[Exeter University]] and The [[University College Plymouth St Mark &amp; St John]] to provide a solid foundation to making the most of existing websites and building on the work of [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]], EVO was first presented at [[York St. John University]] as part of a post-graduate conference in 2008.

In 2010, during the [http://www.anlp.org/index.asp?CatName=NLP%20Research%20and%20Conference&amp;CatID=53 Second International NLP Research Conference] (hosted by [[Cardiff University]] and co-organised by [http://www.surrey.ac.uk/management/people/paul_tosey/ Paul Tosey] of The [[University of Surrey]] in association with The association of [[Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP]], [[Association for Neuro Linguistic Programming|ANLP]]), EVO was expanded to include email optimisation using the same psychological models.

'''Far-Play''' (stylized '''fAR-Play''', from [[augmented reality game|augmented reality]]) is a [[software platform]] developed at the [[University of Alberta]], for creating [[location-based game|location-based]], scavenger-hunt style games which use the [[global positioning system|GPS]] and web-connectivity features of a player's [[smartphone]]. According to the development team, "our long-term objective is to develop a general framework that supports the implementation of AARGs that are fun to play and also educational".&lt;ref&gt;Guiterrez et al., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It utilizes [[Layar]], an [[augmented reality]] smartphone application, [[QR code]]s located at particular real-world sites, or a phone's web browser, to facilitate games which require players to be in close physical proximity to predefined "nodes". A node, referred to by the developers as a Virtual Point of Interest (vPOI), is a point in space defined by a set of map coordinates; fAR-Play uses the [[GPS]] function of a player's smartphone—or, for indoor games, which are not easily tracked by GPS satellites, specially-created [[QR codes]]—to confirm that they are adequately near a given node. Once a player is within a node's proximity, Layar's various augmented reality features can be utilized to display a range of extra content overlaid upon the physical play-space or launch another application for extra functionality.

==Development and features==
[[File:FAR-Play operational structure chart.jpg|left|thumb|270px| fAR-Play's In-world Mapping Tools]]fAR-Play began development in 2008, emerging from a collaborative project undertaken by a group of University of Alberta students from the [[Computer Science]] and [[Humanities Computing]] departments. fAR-Play is still under development, but a beta version is available for testing by request. fAR-Play's development is managed by a team of interdisciplinary professors and students at the University of Alberta.  Currently, the developing team's roster includes Supervising Professors Geoffrey Rockwell and Eleni Stroulia, Developers Lucio Gutierrez and Matthew Delaney, and Website Developers Calen Henry and Garry Wong.&lt;ref&gt;fAR-Play.ualberta.ca: People&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
fAR-Play relies on a number of [[Open Source Software|open-]]  and [[closed source software|closed-source]] web technologies as tools to create, and enhance the users' experience. [[Layar]] is the recommended client-side frontend for delivering game content to the player; it is available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]], which covers over 91% of smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;Llamas et al., 2013&lt;/ref&gt; While Layar is not a requirement to play fAR-Play games, the application does supply additional augmented reality functionality; Layar also includes a built-in QR scanner. Depending on the design of the particular game, the player may instead use a dedicated QR code scanner; the developers recommend BeeTagg, but any such application will do. Layar or a QR code scanner are the maximum software requirements to play a fAR-Play game, making implementation of games on a wide variety of platforms relatively straightforward. fAR-Play games can also be designed for play strictly within a mobile phone's web browser. On the server side, fAR-Play's engine is composed of an [[Apache HTTP server|Apache server]] which manages the system's web interface, including the mobile and desktop versions of the fAR-Play website, and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based [[representational state transfer|REST]] framework for managing the database of nodes.

===Features===
As a platform for designing [[Augmented reality game#Gaming|AR games]], as opposed to an AR game itself, fAR-Play offers little in the way of explicit shapes or patterns for games to take; instead, these elements are left to the game designer or players to develop. However, the nonspecific nature of nodes, the many options they offer for content delivery, and the [[open design]] of the platform are such that these elements can be developed extensively. Functionally, fAR-Play is a tool for tracking arbitrary points in space and a given player's proximity to them; what it does beyond that is up to the developers' and players' discretion. However, the fAR-Play website contains a [[Ranking chart|leaderboard]] which tracks registered user's total scores.&lt;ref&gt;fAR-Play.ualberta.ca: Leaderboard&lt;/ref&gt;  Players are assigned [[rank up|levels]] based on their total score, ranging from Novice - Super Player.  Player profiles will display nodes that the player has recently caught, and any [[achievement (video gaming)|achievements]] the player has gained.  Additionally, players can share their adventure progress, achievements, and the capture of vPOIs on [[Facebook]].

==How to play==
In order to participate in the [[Location-based game|locative]] aspects of fAR-Play games, users must have an Android or iOS [[mobile device]] and access to wireless internet.  Players can participate in fAR-Play [[anonymity|anonymously]], or create and sign into a fAR-Play account.  Those who choose to play anonymously will lose the ability to track their progress across multiple games.&lt;ref&gt;http://farplay.ualberta.ca/far-play/index.php?page=login.php&lt;/ref&gt; When signed in, the player is presented with a list of games that are currently available for play. Each game includes a brief description and the various "adventures" available to the player.  Once the game has been started, the player has three different methods for capturing nodes: they may scan a QR in the physical space, discover a node through the Layar camera virtual view, or receive a link in their device's [[web browser]].&lt;ref&gt;A Player's Guide to fAR-Play&lt;/ref&gt;

===QR codes and Layar===
[[File:FAR-Play Example QR Tag.png|right|thumb|100px|A QR code used in a fAR-Play game.]]QR codes can only be used as a method for capturing nodes and initiating games when there is a physical code present.  In order to scan a QR code, players are required to have an application which can capture and recognize QR codes. If the player is utilizing a QR scanning application that has a built in browser, they will be required to log into fAR-Play through the app. [[Layar]] is a free to download augmented reality app, containing a built in QR code scanner, which enables its users to participate in fAR-Play games.

===Capturing nodes===
Layar permits the player to see nodes on their mobile device, guiding the player to their goal.  Using this application, the player is able to navigate to their objective with map provided by [[Google Maps| Google Maps']] [[application programming interface|API]] or by using their camera—Layar overlays a virtual image onto the real-world scene presented by the camera. The representations on screen expand in size as the player approaches the node destination, simulating relative distance. If the player taps any of the nodes that are presented on the screen, they will be provided additional information about that node, including the node's name and a brief description.  Nodes can be captured by tapping the "capture" button.

===Playing on browsers===
The player can also play fAR-Play games within their mobile device's [[web browser|browser]]. By visiting http://farplay.ualberta.ca/far-play/ on a mobile device, players will be presented with a fully realized user interface, permitting full interaction with the games.  The player can capture the in game vPOIs through their browser by tapping the "nodes" button.  This will bring up a list of all the accessible nodes, complete with a brief description for each location.  By clicking on one of the nodes, the player is shown to a screen with a mapped location of the vPOI, an in-depth description of it, and hints.  At the top of the page, the player can tap "CAPTURE THIS NODE" and advance in the game.
When attempting to capture a node, the developer may or may not associate a challenge with the node.  For example, in the game "Zombies ate my Campus", when players are attempting to capture a node, they're presented with a multiple choice question associated with the current node.

===Game types===
Players complete an adventure when they have captured all of the nodes within it. fAR-Play provides two game modes: in a Virtual [[Scavenger Hunt]], nodes must be captured in a specific order; in a Virtual [[Treasure hunting|Treasure Hunt]], the order is unimportant.

==Existing fAR-Play games==
Games currently available through fAR-Play include:&lt;ref&gt;fAR-Play.ualberta.ca: Games&lt;/ref&gt;
*Giselle Ever After
*Thought Hub
*Comics Arts Capture Challenge
*Pioneering Edmonton
*The Intelliphone Challenge
*A Tour of Atwater
*Zombies ate my Campus

==For developers==
fAR-Play's ultimate goal is to provide a simple, effective platform for the creation of locative augmented reality games, but the developer tools are still under active development and not openly available to the public. Access can be granted on a case-by-case basis, however, and a developer's manual is available.&lt;ref&gt;fAR-Play Developers' Manual&lt;/ref&gt;  Users with development privileges can create new games or edit their existing games, in addition to playing their own or others' games.

===Adventures===
Games that are developed with fAR-Play are segmented into components called "Adventures".  To progress through each game adventure, the player must reach and capture virtual points of interest, referred to in the game as vPOIs.  In order to capture a vPOI, the player must travel to a physical location that is set by the developer.  It is the developer's choice to include a challenge question to capture the vPOI, though it is not mandatory.  A deduction of points can be implemented if the player submits an incorrect answer to a challenge question.

===Points and achievements===
Each of the nodes will reward the player with a predetermined number of points once they have been captured by the player.  These points are added to the player's total points.  Each of the adventures that are created require a predetermined number of vPOIs to be completed before the player can advance.  fAR-Play has the ability to implement [[achievement (video gaming)|achievements]], which can reward players with extra points for completing certain tasks.  The two general classifications of achievements in the game are: "Percentage of Adventure Completed" and "Percentage of Game Completed".&lt;ref&gt;fAR-Play Developers' Manual&lt;/ref&gt;

===Win conditions===
The developer must decide if the vPOIs must be completed in a certain order, or if the order is inconsequential.  Additionally, the developer can choose if the win condition of an adventure requires all vPOIs to be captured, or only a certain percentage of them.  Game creators can set a "Catch Limit" for each vPOI, which restricts the number of times each node may be captured.  This can be used to encourage races and [[competition|competitive play]].

===Name, description and customization===
When developing a game for fAR-Play, the site requires that users submit a game name, game description, and game story.  Each of the adventures within the game will also require a name, and type; Scavenger Hunt is currently the only available adventure type.  For additional aesthetic customization, fAR-Play allows developers to utilize [[Cascading Style Sheet|CSS]] to customize the appearance and layout of the player's interface.

===Hints===
The developer may implement a hint system within the game to guide players through the experience.  These hints can take the form of an image, audio, or video file.  To encourage the player to discover answers for themselves, the game can penalize players for the use of hints, reducing their points by a predetermined number.

'''Flexible electronics''', also known as ''flex circuits'', is a [[technology]] for assembling [[electronic circuit]]s by mounting electronic devices on [[Flexibility|flexible]] [[plastic]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]]s, such as [[polyimide]], [[PEEK]] or transparent conductive polyester&lt;ref&gt;D. Shavit: The developments of LEDs and SMD Electronics on transparent conductive Polyester film, Vacuum International, 1/2007, S. 35 ff&lt;/ref&gt; film. Additionally, flex circuits can be [[screen printing|screen printed]] silver circuits on [[polyester]]. Flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid [[printed circuit board]]s, allowing the board to conform to a desired shape, or to flex during its use. An alternative approach to flexible electronics suggests various etching techniques to thin down the traditional silicon substrate to few tens of micrometers to gain reasonable flexibility, referred to as [[flexible silicon]] (~ 5&amp;nbsp;mm bending radius).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=Mohamed T.|last2=Alfaraj|first2=Nasir|last3=Torres-Sevilla|first3=Galo A.|last4=Fahad|first4=Hossain M.|last5=Hussain|first5=Muhammad M.|title=Out-of-Plane Strain Effects on Physically Flexible FinFET CMOS|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|date=July 2016|volume=63|issue=7|pages=2657–2664|doi=10.1109/TED.2016.2561239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alfaraj|first1=Nasir|last2=Hussain|first2=Aftab M.|last3=Torres Sevilla|first3=Galo A.|last4=Ghoneim|first4=Mohamed T.|last5=Rojas|first5=Jhonathan P.|last6=Aljedaani|first6=Abdulrahman B.|last7=Hussain|first7=Muhammad M.|title=Functional integrity of flexible n-channel metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors on a reversibly bistable platform|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=26 October 2015|volume=107|issue=17|pages=174101|doi=10.1063/1.4934355|url=http://repository.kaust.edu.sa/kaust/bitstream/10754/582486/1/1.4934355.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=Mohamed T.|last2=Zidan|first2=Mohammed A.|last3=Salama|first3=Khaled N.|last4=Hussain|first4=Muhammad M.|title=Towards neuromorphic electronics: Memristors on foldable silicon fabric|journal=Microelectronics Journal|date=November 2014|volume=45|issue=11|pages=1392–1395|doi=10.1016/j.mejo.2014.07.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rojas|first1=Jhonathan Prieto|last2=Ghoneim|first2=Mohamed Tarek|last3=Young|first3=Chadwin D.|last4=Hussain|first4=Muhammad Mustafa|title=Flexible High-&lt;formula formulatype="inline"&gt;&lt;tex Notation="TeX"&gt;$\kappa$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;/Metal Gate Metal/Insulator/Metal Capacitors on Silicon (100) Fabric|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|date=October 2013|volume=60|issue=10|pages=3305–3309|doi=10.1109/TED.2013.2278186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kutbee|first1=Arwa T.|last2=Ghoneim|first2=Mohamed T.|last3=Ahmad|first3=Sally M.|last4=Hussain|first4=Muhammad M.|title=Free-Form Flexible Lithium-Ion Microbattery|journal=IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology|date=May 2016|volume=15|issue=3|pages=402–408|doi=10.1109/TNANO.2016.2537338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=Mohamed|last2=Hussain|first2=Muhammad|title=Review on Physically Flexible Nonvolatile Memory for Internet of Everything Electronics|journal=Electronics|date=23 July 2015|volume=4|issue=3|pages=424–479|doi=10.3390/electronics4030424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=M.

==Manufacturing==
Flexible printed circuits (FPC) are made with a photolithographic technology. An alternative way of making flexible foil circuits or [[flexible flat cable]]s (FFCs) is laminating very thin (0.07&amp;nbsp;mm) copper strips in between two layers of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]. These PET layers, typically 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm thick, are coated with an adhesive which is [[thermoset]]ting, and will be activated during the lamination process. FPCs and FFCs have several advantages in many applications:
* Tightly assembled electronic packages, where electrical connections are required in 3 axes, such as [[cameras]] (static application).
* Electrical connections where the assembly is required to flex during its normal use, such as folding [[cell phones]] (dynamic application).
* Electrical connections between sub-assemblies to replace wire harnesses, which are heavier and bulkier, such as in cars, [[rocket]]s and [[satellites]].
* Electrical connections where board thickness or space constraints are driving factors.

===Advantage of FPCs===
* Potential to replace multiple rigid boards or connectors
* Single-sided circuits are ideal for dynamic or high-flex applications
* Stacked FPCs in various configurations

===Disadvantages of FPCs===
* Cost increase over rigid PCBs
* Increased risk of damage during handling or use
* More difficult assembly process
* Repair and rework is difficult or impossible
* Generally worse panel utilization resulting in increased cost

==Applications==
Flex circuits are often used as connectors in various applications where flexibility, space savings, or production constraints limit the serviceability of rigid circuit boards or hand wiring. A common application of flex circuits is in computer keyboards; most keyboards use flex circuits for the [[Keyboard technology#Keyboard switch matrix|switch matrix]].

In [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] fabrication, glass is used as a substrate.  If thin flexible plastic or metal foil is used as the substrate instead, the entire system can be flexible, as the film deposited on top of the substrate is usually very thin, on the order of a few micrometres.

[[Organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLEDs) are normally used instead of a back-light for flexible displays, making a [[flexible organic light-emitting diode]] display.

Most flexible circuits are passive wiring structures that are used to interconnect electronic components such as integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors and the like, however some are used only for making interconnections between other electronic assemblies either directly or by means of connectors.

In the automotive field, flexible circuits are used in instrument panels, under-hood controls, circuits to be concealed within the headliner of the cabin, and in ABS systems. In computer peripherals flexible circuits are used on the moving print head of printers, and to connect signals to the moving arm carrying the read/write heads of disk drives. Consumer electronics devices make use of flexible circuits in cameras, personal entertainment devices, calculators, or exercise monitors.

Flexible circuits are found in industrial and medical devices where many interconnections are required in a compact package. Cellular telephones are another widespread example of flexible circuits.

Flexible [[solar cell]]s have been developed for powering [[satellite]]s.  These cells are lightweight, can be rolled up for launch, and are easily deployable, making them a good match for the application.  They can also be sewn into backpacks or outerwear.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the [[Scottevest]] solar jacket and the Voltaic [http://www.voltaicsystems.com/offgrid.shtml] and similar solar backpacks.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Patent]]s issued at the turn of the 20th century show that early researchers were envisioning ways of making flat conductors sandwiched between layers of [[Insulator (electrical)|insulating material]] to layout [[electrical circuit]]s to serve in early [[telephony]] switching applications. One of the earliest descriptions of what could be called a flex circuit was unearthed by Dr Ken Gilleo&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.et-trends.com/files/Circuits_100Years.pdf|title=et-trends.com - This website is for sale! - et-trends Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.et-trends.com |deadurl=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; and disclosed in an English patent by Albert Hansen in 1903 where Hansen described a construction consisting of flat metal conductors on [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] [[coated paper]]. [[Thomas Edison]]’s lab books from the same period also indicate that he was thinking to coat patterns [[cellulose gum]] applied to linen paper with [[graphite]] powder to create what would have clearly been flexible circuits, though there is no evidence that it was reduced to practice.

In the 1947 publication "Printed Circuit Techniques" by Cledo Brunetti and Roger W. Curtis&lt;ref&gt;"Printed Circuit Techniques" by Cledo Brunetti and Roger w. Curtis (National Bureau of Standards Circular 468 first issued 15 November 1947)&lt;/ref&gt; a brief discussion of creating circuits on what would have been flexible insulating materials (e.g. [[paper]]) indicated that the idea was in place and in the 1950s [[Sanders Associates]]' inventors ([[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua, NH]]) Victor Dahlgren and company founder Royden Sanders made significant strides developing and patenting processes for printing and etching flat conductors on flexible base materials to replace [[wire harness]]es. An advertisement from the 1950 placed by Photocircuits Corporation in New York demonstrated their active interest in flexible circuits also.

Today, flexible circuits which are also variously known around the world variously as ''flexible printed wiring, flex print, flexi circuits,'' are used many products. Large credit is due to the efforts of [[Japan]]ese [[electronics]] packaging engineers who have found countless new ways to employ flexible circuit technology. For the last decade, flexible circuits have remained one of the fastest growing of all interconnection product market segments.  A more recent variation on flexible circuit technology is one called "flexible electronics" which commonly involves the integration of both active and passive functions in the processing.

==Flexible circuit structures==
There are a few basic constructions of flexible circuits but there is significant variation between the different types in terms of their construction. Following is a review of the most common types of flexible circuit constructions

===Single-sided flex circuits===
Single-sided flexible circuits have a single conductor layer made of either a metal or conductive (metal filled) polymer on a flexible [[dielectric]] film. Component termination features are accessible only from one side. Holes may be formed in the base film to allow component leads to pass through for interconnection, normally by [[soldering]]. Single sided flex circuits can be fabricated with or without such protective coatings as cover layers or cover coats, however the use of a [[protective coating]] over circuits is the most common practice. The development of [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounted devices]] on sputtered conductive films has enabled the production of transparent LED Films, which is used in [[Transparent LED embedded glass|LED Glass]] but also in flexible [[LED Headliner|automotive lighting composites]].

===Double access or back bared flex circuits===
Double access flex, also known as back bared flex, are flexible circuits having a single conductor layer but which is processed so as to allow access to selected features of the conductor pattern from both sides. While this type of circuit has certain benefits, the specialized processing requirements for accessing the features limits its use.

===Sculptured flex circuits===
Sculptured flex circuits are a novel subset of normal flexible circuit structures. The [[manufacturing]] process involves a special flex circuit multi-step etching method which yields a flexible circuit having finished [[copper]] conductors wherein the thickness of the conductor differs at various places along their length. (i.e., the conductors are thin in flexible areas and thick at interconnection points.).

===Double-sided flex circuits===
Double-sided flex circuits are flex circuits having two conductor layers. These flex circuits can be fabricated with or without plated [[Through-hole technology|through holes]], though the plated through hole variation is much more common. When constructed without plated through holes and connection features are accessed from one side only, the circuit is defined as a "Type V (5)" according to military specifications. It is not a common practice but it is an option. Because of the plated through hole, terminations for electronic components are provided for on both sides of the circuit, thus allowing components to be placed on either side. Depending on design requirements, double-sided flex circuits can be fabricated with protective coverlayers on one, both or neither side of the completed circuit but are most commonly produced with the protective layer on both sides. One major advantage of this type of substrate is that it allows crossover connections to be made very easy. Many single sided circuits are built on a double sided substrate just because they have one of two crossover connections. An example of this use is the circuit connecting a [[mousepad]] to the motherboard of a laptop. All connections on that circuit are located on only one side of the substrate, except a very small crossover connection which uses the second side of the substrate.

===Multilayer flex circuits===
Flex circuits having three or more layers of conductors are known as multilayer flex circuits. Commonly the layers are interconnected by means of plated through holes, though this is not a requirement of the definition for it is possible to provide openings to access lower circuit level features. The layers of the multilayer flex circuit may or may not be continuously laminated together throughout the construction with the obvious exception of the areas occupied by plated through-holes. The practice of discontinuous lamination is common in cases where maximum flexibility is required. This is accomplished by leaving unbonded the areas where flexing or bending is to occur.

===Rigid-flex circuits===
Rigid-flex circuits are a hybrid construction flex circuit consisting of rigid and flexible substrates which are laminated together into a single structure. Rigid-flex circuits should not be confused with rigidized flex constructions, which are simply flex circuits to which a stiffener is attached to support the weight of the electronic components locally. A rigidized or stiffened flex circuit can have one or more conductor layers. Thus while the two terms may sound similar, they represent products that are quite different.

The layers of a rigid flex are also normally electrically interconnected by means of plated through holes. Over the years, rigid-flex circuits have enjoyed tremendous popularity among military product designer, however the technology has found increased use in commercial products. While often considered a specialty product for low volume applications because of the challenges, an impressive effort to use the technology was made by Compaq computer in the production of boards for a laptop computer in the 1990s. While the computer's main rigid-flex PCBA did not flex during use, subsequent designs by Compaq utilized rigid-flex circuits for the hinged display cable, passing 10s of 1000s of flexures during testing. By 2013, the use of rigid-flex circuits in consumer laptop computers is now common.

Rigid-flex boards are normally multilayer structures; however, two metal layer constructions are sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gcaflex.com/flexible-circuits/rigid-flex-circuits/|title=Rigid Flex Circuits, Flexible Circuits, Flex Circuit Boards, PCB Flex {{!}} GC Aero Flexible Circuitry, Inc.|website=gcaflex.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymer thick film flex circuits===
Polymer thick film (PTF) flex circuits are true printed circuits in that the conductors are actually printed onto a polymer base film. They are typically single conductor layer structures, however two or more metal layers can be printed sequentially with insulating layers printed between printed conductor layers, or on both sides. While lower in conductor conductivity and thus not suitable for all applications, PTF circuits have successfully served in a wide range of low-power applications at slightly higher voltages. Keyboards are a common application, however, there are a wide range of potential applications for this cost-effective approach to flex circuit manufacture.

==Flexible circuit materials==
Each element of the flex circuit construction must be able to consistently meet the demands placed upon it for the life of the product. In addition, the material must work reliably in concert with the other elements of the flexible circuit construction to assure ease of manufacture and reliability. Following are brief descriptions of the basic elements of flex circuit construction and their functions.

===Base material===
The base material is the flexible polymer film which provides the foundation for the laminate. Under normal circumstances, the flex circuit base material provides most primary physical and electrical properties of the flexible circuit. In the case of adhesiveless circuit constructions, the base material provides all of the characteristic properties.
While a wide range of thickness is possible, most flexible films are provided in a narrow range of relatively thin dimension from 12&amp;nbsp;µm to 125&amp;nbsp;µm (1/2 mil to 5 mils) but thinner and thicker material are possible. Thinner materials are of course more flexible and for most material, stiffness increase is proportional to the cube of thickness. Thus for example, means that if the thickness is doubled, the material becomes eight times stiffer and will only deflect 1/8 as much under the same load.
There are a number of different materials used as base films including: polyester (PET), polyimide (PI), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyetherimide (PEI), along with various fluropolymers (FEP) and copolymers. Polyimide films are most prevalent owing to their blend of advantageous electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties.

===Bonding adhesive===
Adhesives are used as the bonding medium for creating a laminate. When it comes to temperature resistance, the adhesive is typically the performance limiting element of a laminate especially when polyimide is the base material. Because of the earlier difficulties associated with polyimide adhesives, many polyimide flex circuits presently employ adhesive systems of different polymer families. However some newer thermoplastic polyimide adhesives are making important in-roads.
As with the base films, adhesives come in different thickness. Thickness selection is typically a function of the application. For example, different adhesive thickness is commonly used in the creation of cover layers in order to meet the fill demands of different copper foil thickness which may be encountered.

===Metal foil===
A metal foil is most commonly used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available from which to choose and create a flex circuit, however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper’s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper foil for printed circuits divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, there are a number of different types of copper foil available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.

In certain non standard cases, the circuit manufacturer may be called upon to create a specialty laminate by using a specified alternative metal foil, such as a special copper alloy or other metal foil in the construction. This is accomplished by laminating the foil to a base film with or without an adhesive depending on the nature and properties of the base film.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Flexible circuit industry standards and specifications==
Specifications are developed to provide a common ground of understanding of what a product should look like and how it should perform. Standards are developed directly by manufacturer's associations such as the [[IPC (electronics)|Association Connecting Electronics Industries]] (IPC) and by users of flexible circuits.

'''Leverate''' is a [[software as a service]] provider for [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange brokers]]. It provides both [[electronic trading platform]]s and [[Back office|back-office]] software to manage a company's operations through its various subsidiaries.&gt; It has offices in Cyprus, Hong Kong, Israel, Ukraine, China and Germany.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==History==

Leverate was founded in 2008 by Ran Strauss, Doron Cohen, Itai Damti, and Doron Somech who had worked together on the project since 2006.&lt;ref name=ForexcyInterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jandova|first1=Zuzana|title=Interview with Ran Strauss, the CEO at Leverate|url=http://forexcy.com/interview-ran-strauss-ceo-leverate/|website=ForexCY|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea was to create a [[algorithmic trading|trading algorithm]] for the purpose of buying and selling that was completely automated. It took two years to build the platform and the company was launched officially in 2008. Leverate received its first angel investment in 2008 from Jacques Beer, owner and chief executive officer of [[Tempo Beer Industries|Tempo Beverages Ltd]]. The company saw a limit to the use of the algorithm and instead turned it into a price feed for brokers that helped reduce losses incurred by latency.&lt;ref name=TwoSidesHebrew&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilad|first1=Assaf|title=החברה שמחזיקה בשני צדי המטבע (The company owns two sides of the coin)|url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/markets/articles/0,7340,L-3403669,00.html|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=Calcalist|date=5 May 2010|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leverate discontinued the use of its algorithm in 2008 and began to market products to brokers.&lt;ref name=TwoSidesHebrew/&gt; One of the features of the algorithm was a product feed that was described as "fast" and "accurate." The company began using the feed to help brokers who had a lack of knowledge of market conditions. The feed became Leverate's initial product offering, referred to as LXFeed. Leverate moved from algorithm trading into the [[Software as a service|SaaS]] market with the product launch, leading to the development of additional products that include risk management tools and mobile trading platforms.

Leverate expanded its operations in 2011 by adding 20 employees to its staff of 50.&lt;ref name=GlobesSoftware50&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shelah|first1=Shmulik|title=Leverate has 50 employees and wants to hire 20 more, mostly software engineers|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000668594|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=Globes|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was able to do so after selling a 25% stake to [[Saxo Bank]] for $12.5 million (USD).&lt;ref name=GlobesSoftware50/&gt;&lt;ref name=YnetSaxo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilad|first1=Assaf|title=Saxo Investment Bank buys 25% of Leverate|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4101584,00.html|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=Ynet News|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also expanded its presence by opening a financial services branch in Hong Kong in 2012&lt;ref name=InvestKHHong&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli Fintech Company Sets Up Asian Headquarters in Hong Kong|url=http://www1.investhk.gov.hk/success-stories/israeli-fintech-company-sets-up-asian-headquarters-in-hong-kong/|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=InvestHK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an office in Ukraine in 2013.&lt;ref name=GlobesOffices&gt;{{cite news|title=חברת לברייט שכרה משרדים במגדל צ'מפיון ב-80 שקל למ"ר|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000888267|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=Globes|date=23 October 2013|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leverate entered into an agreement with Saxo Bank in 2014 to buy back that company's 25% stake in the company.&lt;ref name=FMbuyback&gt;{{cite news|last1=Golovtchenko|first1=Victor|title=Leverate Founders Buy Back 25% of Shares from Saxo Bank|url=http://forexmagnates.com/leverate-founders-buy-back-25-shares-saxo-bank/|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=Forex Magnates|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017,Leverate launched cyprus-based regulatory consulting and services operation Regyoul8, The finacial Certification services the Edu8, and The new generation traeding platforms.

==Products==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Leverate Sirix Station Screenshot.png|thumb|Screenshot of Leverate Sirix Station.]] --&gt;
Leverate's first product was its LXFeed which launched in 2008. It released a risk management system in 2009. The same year it began to bundle its products and release them under the name LXSuite while also allowing companies to purchase stand alone products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Michael|title=Leverate Launches LXRisk: a Cutting-Edge Risk Management Software Platform|url=http://forexmagnates.com/leverate-launches-lxrisk-a-cutting-edge-risk-management-software-platform/|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=Forex Magnates|date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 it launched a platform called LXAPI which allowed users the ability to customize platforms. It also released LXCRM as a customer management tool for brokers. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin were added to its LXFeed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finberg|first1=Ron|title=Breaking: Leverate Adding Bitcoin and Litecoin Feeds, STP Coming Soon|url=http://dcmagnates.com/breaking-leverate-adding-bitcoin-and-litecoin-feeds-stp-coming-soon/|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=DC Magnates|date=16 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150310185317/http://dcmagnates.com/breaking-leverate-adding-bitcoin-and-litecoin-feeds-stp-coming-soon/|archivedate=10 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leverate ventured into the [[social trading]] marketing by launching Sirix Social Community and The new generation Activ8. The community allows members to view and copy other trader's portfolios, creating transparency in currency pairs, as well as integrating with [[MetaTrader 4]].&lt;ref name=DailySirixRock&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patterson|first1=Sarah|title=Will Leverate's Sirix Trader Rock Social Forex Trading World|url=http://www.dailyforex.com/forex-figures/forex-brokers-2/leverates-sirix-trader-rock-social-forex-trading-world/713|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=Daily Forex|date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liver support systems''' are therapeutic devices to assist in performing the functions of the liver in persons with liver damage.

The primary functions of the liver include removing toxic substances from the blood, manufacturing [[blood proteins]], storing energy in the form of [[glycogen]], and secreting [[bile]]. The [[hepatocytes]] that perform these tasks can be killed or impaired by disease, resulting in [[hepatic insufficiency]]. A sudden onset of life-threatening hepatic insufficiency is known as [[acute liver failure]] (ALF).

[[File:Classification for hepatic insufficiency.jpg|center|Classification for hepatic insufficiency]]

In hyperacute and acute liver failure the clinical picture develops rapidly with progressive [[Hepatic encephalopathy|encephalopathy]] and [[Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome|multiorgan dysfunction]] such as [[hyperdynamic circulation]], [[coagulopathy]], [[acute renal failure|acute renal]] and [[respiratory insufficiency]], severe metabolic alterations and [[cerebral edema]] that can lead to brain death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shakil|first=OA|author2=Kramer D |author3=Mazariegos GV |author4=Fung JJ |author5=Rakela J |title=Acute liver failure: clinical features, outcome analysis, and applicability of prognostic criteria|journal=Liver Transpl.|year=2000|volume=6|pages=163–169|pmid=10719014|doi=10.1002/lt.500060218|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jalan|first=R|author2=Williams R |title=Acute on chronic liver failure. Pathophysiological basis of therapeutic options|journal=Blood Purif.|year=2002|volume=20|pages=252–261|pmid=11867872|issue=3|doi=10.1159/000047017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases the mortality without [[liver transplantation]] (LTx) ranges between 40-80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stravitz|first=RT|title=Critical management decisions in patients with acute liver failure|journal=Chest|year=2008|volume=134|pages=1092–1102|pmid=18988787|doi=10.1378/chest.08-1071|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auzinger|first=G|author2=Wendon, J |title=Intensive care management of acute liver failure.|journal=Current Opinion in Critical Care|date=April 2008|volume=14|issue=2|pages=179–88|doi=10.1097/MCC.0b013e3282f6a450|pmid=18388681}}&lt;/ref&gt; LTx is the only effective treatment for these patients although it requires a precise indication and timing to achieve good results. Nevertheless, due to the scarcity of organs to carry out liver transplantations, it is estimated that one third of patients with ALF die while waiting to be transplanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sen|first=S|author2=Williams R |author3=Jalan R |title=Emerging indications for albumin dialysis|journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol.|year=2005|volume=100|issue=2|pages=468–475|pmid=15667509|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.40864.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, a patient with a chronic hepatic disease can suffer an acute decompensation of liver function following a precipitating event such as variceal bleeding, [[sepsis]] and excessive alcohol intake among others that can lead to a condition referred to as acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF).
Both types of hepatic insufficiency, ALF and ACLF, can potentially be reversible and liver functionality can return to a level similar to that prior to the insult or precipitating event.
LTx is the only treatment that has shown an improvement in the prognosis and survival with most severe cases of ALF. Nevertheless, cost and donor scarcity have prompted researchers to look for new supportive treatments that can act as “bridge” to the transplant procedure. By stabilizing the patient’s clinical state, or by creating the right conditions that could allow the recovery of native liver functions, both detoxification and synthesis can improve, after an episode of ALF or ACLF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=JW|author2=Hassanein, T |author3=Bhatia, SN |title=Advances in bioartificial liver devices.|journal=Hepatology |date=September 2001|volume=34|issue=3|pages=447–55|pmid=11526528|doi=10.1053/jhep.2001.26753}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Basically, three different types of supportive therapies have been developed: bio-artificial, artificial and hybrid liver support systems (Table 2).

[[Bio artificial liver device|Bio-artificial liver support systems]] are experimental extracorporeal devices that use living cell lines to provide detoxification and synthesis support to the failing liver. Bio-artificial liver (BAL) Hepatassist 2000 uses porcine hepatocytes&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; whereas ELAD system employs hepatocytes derived from human hepatoblastoma C3A cell lines.&lt;sup&gt;9,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sussman|first=NL|author2=Gislason, GT |author3=Conlin, CA |author4= Kelly, JH |title=The Hepatix extracorporeal liver assist device: initial clinical experience.|journal=Artificial Organs|date=May 1994|volume=18|issue=5|pages=390–6|pmid=8037614|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1594.1994.tb02221.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=AJ|author2=Hughes, RD |author3=Wendon, JA |author4=Dunne, J |author5=Langley, PG |author6=Kelly, JH |author7=Gislason, GT |author8=Sussman, NL |author9= Williams, R  |title=Pilot-controlled trial of the extracorporeal liver assist device in acute liver failure.|journal=Hepatology |date=December 1996|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1446–51|pmid=8938179|doi=10.1002/hep.510240625}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Both techniques can produce, in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), an improvement of hepatic encephalopathy grade and biochemical parameters. Nevertheless, they are therapies with high complexity that require a complex logistic approach for implementation; a very high cost and possible inducement of important side effects such as immunological issues (porcine endogenous retrovirus transmission), infectious complications and tumor transmigration have been documented. Other biological hepatic systems are Bioartificial Liver Support (BLSS)&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and Radial Flow Bioreactor (RFB).&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Detoxification capacity of these systems is poor and therefore they must be used combined with other systems to mitigate this deficiency. Today its use is limited to centers with high experience in their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phua|first=J|author2=Lee, KH |title=Liver support devices.|journal=Current Opinion in Critical Care|date=April 2008|volume=14|issue=2|pages=208–15|pmid=18388685|doi=10.1097/MCC.0b013e3282f70057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial liver support systems are aimed to temporally replace native liver detoxification functions and they use [[albumin]] as scavenger molecule to clear the toxins involved in the physiopathology of the failing liver. Most of the toxins that accumulate in the plasma of patients with liver insufficiency are protein bound, and therefore conventional [[renal dialysis]] techniques, such as [[hemofiltration]], [[hemodialysis]] or [[hemodiafiltration]] are not able to adequately eliminate them.
Between the different albumin dialysis modalities, single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) has shown some positive results at a very high cost;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peszynski|first=P|author2=Klammt, S |author3=Peters, E |author4=Mitzner, S |author5=Stange, J |author6= Schmidt, R |title=Albumin dialysis: single pass vs. recirculation (MARS).|journal=Liver|year=2002|volume=22 Suppl 2|pages=40–2|pmid=12220302|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0676.2002.00007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been proposed that lowering the concentration of albumin in the dialysate does not seem to affect the detoxification capability of the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chawla|first=LS|author2=Georgescu, F |author3=Abell, B |author4=Seneff, MG |author5= Kimmel, PL |title=Modification of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration with single-pass albumin dialysate allows for removal of serum bilirubin.|journal=American Journal of Kidney Diseases|date=March 2005|volume=45|issue=3|pages=e51-6|pmid=15754264|doi=10.1053/j.ajkd.2004.11.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the most widely used systems today are based on hemodialysis and adsorption. These systems use conventional dialysis methods with an albumin containing dialysate that is latter regenerate by means of adsorption columns, filled with activated charcoal and ion exchange resins. 
At present, there are two artificial extracorporeal liver support systems: the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; from [http://www.gambro.com/en/global/ Gambro] and Fractionated Plasma Separation and Adsorption (FPSA), commercialised as Prometheus (PROM) from [http://www.fmc-ag.com/ Fresenius Medical Care].&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Of the two therapies, MARS is the most frequently studied, and clinically used system to date.

==The MARS System==
MARS was developed by a group of researchers at the University of Rostock (Germany), in 1993&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; and later commercialized for its clinical use in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stange J, Mitzner SR, Risler T, Erley CM, Lauchart W, Goehl H, Klammt S, Peszynski P, Freytag J, Hickstein H, Löhr M, Liebe S, Schareck W, Hopt UT, Schmidt R |title=Molecular adsorbent recycling system (MARS): clinical results of a new membrane-based blood purification system for bioartificial liver support.|journal=Artificial Organs|date=April 1999|volume=23|issue=4|pages=319–30|pmid=10226696|doi=10.1046/j.1525-1594.1999.06122.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is able to replace the detoxification function of the liver while minimizing the inconvenience and drawbacks of previously used devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapoor|first=D|title=Molecular adsorbent recirculating system: albumin dialysis-based extracorporeal liver assist device.|journal=Journal of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology|date=December 2002|volume=17 Suppl 3|pages=S280-6|pmid=12472950|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1746.17.s3.14.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davenport|first=A|title=Extracorporeal support for patients with hepatic failure.|journal=Hemodialysis International |date=Jun 1, 2003|volume=7|issue=3|pages=256–63|pmid=19379373|doi=10.1046/j.1492-7535.2003.00046.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sechser|first=A|author2=Osorio, J |author3=Freise, C |author4= Osorio, RW |title=Artificial liver support devices for fulminant liver failure.|journal=Clinics in Liver Disease|date=May 2001|volume=5|issue=2|pages=415–30|pmid=11385970|doi=10.1016/s1089-3261(05)70172-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In vivo'' preliminary investigations indicated the ability of the system to effectively remove bilirubin, biliary salts, free fatty acids and tryptophan while important physiological proteins such as albumin, alpha-1-glicoproteine, alpha 1 antitrypsin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, transferrin, globulin tyrosine, and hormonal systems are unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stange|first=J|author2=Mitzner, S |title=A carrier-mediated transport of toxins in a hybrid membrane.

==MARS System Components==
[[File:XMARS.JPG|thumb|Combined MARS and PrismaFlex monitors]]
MARS is an extracorporeal hemodialysis system composed of three different circuits: blood, albumin and low-flux dialysis. The blood circuit uses a double lumen catheter and a conventional hemodialysis device to pump the patient’s blood into the MARS FLUX, a biocompatible polysulfone high-flux dialyser. With a membrane surface area of 2.1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 100&amp;nbsp;nm of thickness and a cut-off of 50 KDa, the MARSFLUX is essential to retaining the albumin in the dialysate. Blood is dialysed against a human serum albumin (HSA) dialysate solution that allows blood detoxification of both water-soluble and protein-bound toxins, by means of the presence of albumin in the dialysate (albumin dialysis). The albumin dialysate is then regenerated in a close loop in the MARS circuit by passing through the fibres of the low-flux diaFLUX filter, to clear water-soluble toxins and provide electrolyte/acid-base balance, by a standard dialysis fluid. Next, the albumin dialysate passes through two different adsorption columns; protein-bound substances are removed by the diaMARS AC250, containing activated charcoal and anionic substances are removed by the diaMARS IE250, filled with cholestyramine, an anion-exchange resin. The albumin solution is then ready to initiate another detoxifying cycle of the patient's blood that can be sustained until both adsorption columns are saturated, eliminating the need to continuously infuse albumin into the system during treatment (Fig. 1).

==Results published in the literature with the MARS system==
A systematic review of the literature from 1999 to June 2011 was performed in the following databases:

# Specialized in systematic reviews: Cochrane Library Plus and NHS Centre database for Reviews and Dissemination (HTA, DARE and NHSEED).
# General databases: Medline, Pubmed and Embase.
# On-going clinical trials and research project databases: Clinical Trials Registry (National Institutes of Health, EE.UU.) and Health Services Research Projects in Progress.
# General web searching engines: Scholar Google.

==LiverNet==
The [http://www.livernet.net/ LiverNet] is a database dedicated to the liver diseases treated with the support of extracorporeal therapies. To date, the most currently used system is the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS), which is based on the selective removal of albumin bound molecules and toxins from the blood in patients with acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure. The purpose is to register prospectively all patients treated worldwide with the MARS system in order to:
# Improve our understanding of the clinical course, pathopysiology and treatment of these diseases
# Evaluate the clinical impact of MARS therapy on the course of the disease in different specific indication
# Increase the knowledge in this extremely innovative area, a basis for an improvement of liver support devices and the treatment of these patients in the next future
The liverNet is an eCRF database (www.livernet.net) using a SAS platform that allows major advantages for the centres including the automatic calculations of most liver rand ICU scoring systems, instant queries online, instant export of all patients included in the database of each centre to an Excel file for direct statistical analysis and finally instant online statistical analysis of selective data decided by the scientific committee. Therefore, the LiverNet is an important tool to progress in the knowledge of liver support therapies.

==Effects of MARS treatment on Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)==
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) represents one of the more serious extrahepatic complications associated with liver dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitzner|first=S|author2=Loock, J |author3=Peszynski, P |author4=Klammt, S |author5=Majcher-Peszynska, J |author6=Gramowski, A |author7=Stange, J |author8= Schmidt, R |title=Improvement in central nervous system functions during treatment of liver failure with albumin dialysis MARS--a review of clinical, biochemical, and electrophysiological data.|journal=Metabolic Brain Disease|date=December 2002|volume=17|issue=4|pages=463–75|pmid=12602522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butterworth|first=RF|title=Role of circulating neurotoxins in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy: potential for improvement following their removal by liver assist devices.|journal=Liver International |year=2003|volume=23 Suppl 3|pages=5–9|pmid=12950954|doi=10.1034/j.1478-3231.23.s.3.1.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuro-psychiatric manifestations of HE affect consciousness and behaviour.

Evidence suggests that HE develops as some neurotoxins and neuro active substances, produced after hepatocellular breakdown, accumulates in the brain as a consequence of a portosystemic shunt and the limited detoxification capability of the liver. Substances involved are ammonia, manganese, aromatic aminoacids, mercaptans, phenols, medium chain fatty acids, bilirubin, endogenous benzodiazepines, etc.&lt;br/&gt;
The relationship between ammonia neurotoxicity and HE was first described in animal studies by Pavlov et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matthews|first=SA|title=Ammonia, a causative factor in meat poisoning in Eck fistula dos|journal=Am J Physiol|year=1922|volume=59|pages=459–460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Subsequently, several studies in either animals or humans have confirmed that, a ratio in ammonia concentration higher than 2 mM between the brain and blood stream, causes HE, and even a comatose state when the value is greater than 5 mM. Some investigators have also reported a decrease in serum ammonia following a MARS treatment (Table 3).

==Effects of MARS Treatment on Unstable Hemodynamics==
Hemodynamic instability is often associated with acute liver insufficiency, as a consequence of endogenous accumulation of vasoactive agents in the blood. This is characterized by a systemic vasodilatation, a decrease of systemic vascular resistance, arterial hypotension, and an increase of cardiac output that gives rise to a hyperdynamic circulation.&lt;br /&gt;
During MARS therapy, systemic vascular resistance index and mean arterial pressure have been shown to increase and show improvement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitzner|first=SR|author2=Stange, J |author3=Klammt, S |author4=Peszynski, P |author5=Schmidt, R |author6= Nöldge-Schomburg, G |title=Extracorporeal detoxification using the molecular adsorbent recirculating system for critically ill patients with liver failure.|journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology |date=February 2001|volume=12 Suppl 17|pages=S75-82|pmid=11251037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laleman|first=W|author2=Wilmer, A |author3=Evenepoel, P |author4=Elst, IV |author5=Zeegers, M |author6=Zaman, Z |author7=Verslype, C |author8=Fevery, J |author9= Nevens, F  |title=Effect of the molecular adsorbent recirculating system and Prometheus devices on systemic haemodynamics and vasoactive agents in patients with acute-on-chronic alcoholic liver failure.|journal=Critical Care |year=2006|volume=10|issue=4|pages=R108|pmid=16859530|doi=10.1186/cc4985 |pmc=1751025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

They analyzed hemodynamic parameters in both groups hourly. In the MARS group, a statistically significant increase of 46% on systemic vascular resistance was observed (1215 ± 437 to 1778 ± 710 dinas x s x cm&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; x m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with a 6% increase in the controls. Mean arterial pressure also increased (69 ± 5 to 83 ± 11 mmHg, p&lt; 0.0001) in the MARS group, whereas no difference was observed in the controls. Cardiac output and heart rate also decreased in the MARS group as a consequence of an improvement in the hyperdynamic circulation. Therefore, it was shown that a statistically significant improvement was obtained with MARS when compared with the SMT.

==Effects of MARS Treatment on Renal Function==
Hepatorenal syndrome is one of the more serious complications in patients with an acute decompensation of cirrhosis and increased portal hypertension. It is characterized by hemodynamic changes in splanchnic, systemic and renal circulation. Splanchnic vasodilatation triggers the production of endogenous vasoactive substances that produce renal vasoconstriction and low glomerular filtration rate, leading to oliguria with a concomitant reduction in creatinine clearance. Renal insufficiency is always progressive with a very poor prognosis,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arroyo|first=V|title=New treatments for hepatorenal syndrome.|journal=Liver Transplantation |date=May 2000|volume=6|issue=3|pages=287–9|pmid=10827227|doi=10.1053/lv.2000.7569}}&lt;/ref&gt; with survival at 1 and 2 months of 20 and 10% respectively.

Pierre Versin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Versin P, Hirsch-Marie H, Catan R |title=Línsufissance rénale circulatoire spntané du cirrhotique. Son évolution.|journal=Sem Hôp Paris|year=1962|volume=38|pages=3598–3602}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is one of the pioneers in the study of hepatorenal syndrome in patients with liver impairment. 
Great efforts have been made trying to improve the prognosis of this type of patient; however, few have solved the problem. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the only treatment that has shown to improve acute and chronic complications derived from severe liver insufficiency. Today it is possible to combine albumin dialysis with continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration, which provides a greater expectation for these patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McIntyre|first=CW|author2=Fluck, RJ |author3=Freeman, JG |author4= Lambie, SH |title=Characterization of treatment dose delivered by albumin dialysis in the treatment of acute renal failure associated with severe hepatic dysfunction.|journal=Clinical Nephrology|date=November 2002|volume=58|issue=5|pages=376–83|pmid=12425489}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by optimization of their clinical status.

MARS treatment lowers serum urea and creatinine levels improving their clearance,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and even favors resolution of hepatorenal syndrome.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saich|first=R|author2=Collins, P |author3=Ala, A |author4=Standish, R |author5= Hodgson, H |title=Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis with secondary renal impairment treated with extracorporeal albumin dialysis.|journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology|date=May 2005|volume=17|issue=5|pages=585–8|pmid=15827452|doi=10.1097/00042737-200505000-00018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results are confirmed in a randomized controlled trial published by Mitzner ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; in which 13 patients diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome type I were treated with MARS therapy. Mean survival was 25,2±34,6 days in the MARS group compared to 4,6±1,8 days observed in the controls in whom hemodiafiltration and standard care (SMT) was applied. This resulted in a statistically significance difference in survival at 7 and 30 days (p&lt;0.05). Authors concluded that MARS therapy, applied to liver failure patients (Child-Pugh C and UNOS 2A scores) who develop hepatorenal syndrome type I, prolonged survival compared to patients treated with SMT.

Although mechanisms explaining previous findings are not yet fully understood, it has been reported that there was a decrease in plasma rennin concentrations in patients diagnosed with acute on chronic liver failure with renal impairment that were treated with MARS.
Likewise, other studies have suggested some efficacy for MARS in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cárdenas|first=A|author2=Ginès, P|title=Therapy insight: Management of hepatorenal syndrome.|journal=Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology|date=June 2006|volume=3|issue=6|pages=338–48|pmid=16741553|doi=10.1038/ncpgasthep0517}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreau|first=R|author2=Lebrec, D |title=Diagnosis and treatment of acute renal failure in patients with cirrhosis.|journal=Best Practice &amp; Research.

Many hypothesis have been formulated to explain physio pathogenesis of such manifestation, including incremental plasma concentration of biliary acids, abnormalities in the bile ducts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lebovics|first=E|author2=Seif, F |author3=Kim, D |author4=Elhosseiny, A |author5=Dworkin, BM |author6=Casellas, A |author7=Clark, S |author8= Rosenthal, WS |title=Pruritus in chronic hepatitis C: association with high serum bile acids, advanced pathology, and bile duct abnormalities.|journal=Digestive Diseases and Sciences|date=May 1997|volume=42|issue=5|pages=1094–9|pmid=9149069|doi=10.1023/A:1018865809556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  increased central neurotransmitters coupling opioid receptors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=EA|author2=Bergasa, NV |title=The pruritus of cholestasis and the opioid system.|journal=JAMA |date=Dec 16, 1992|volume=268|issue=23|pages=3359–62|pmid=1333541|doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490230089034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergasa|first=NV|author2=Thomas, DA |author3=Vergalla, J |author4=Turner, ML |author5= Jones, EA |title=Plasma from patients with the pruritus of cholestasis induces opioid receptor-mediated scratching in monkeys.|journal=Life Sciences|year=1993|volume=53|issue=16|pages=1253–7|pmid=8412484|doi=10.1016/0024-3205(93)90569-o}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.…. Despite the number of historical drugs used, individually or combined (exchange resins, hidrophilic biliary acids, antihistamines, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, opioid antagonists), there are reported cases of intractable or refractory pruritus with a dramatic reduction in patients’ quality of life (i.e. sleep disorders, depression, suicide attempts…).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchesini G, Bianchi G, Amodio P, Salerno F, Merli M, Panella C, Loguercio C, Apolone G, Niero M, Abbiati R, ((Italian Study Group for quality of life in cirrhosis))|title=Factors associated with poor health-related quality of life of patients with cirrhosis.|journal=Gastroenterology|date=January 2001|volume=120|issue=1|pages=170–8|pmid=11208726|doi=10.1053/gast.2001.21193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Younossi|first=ZM|author2=Kiwi, ML |author3=Boparai, N |author4=Price, LL |author5= Guyatt, G |title=Cholestatic liver diseases and health-related quality of life.|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|date=February 2000|volume=95|issue=2|pages=497–502|pmid=10685757|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2000.01774.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intractable pruritus can be an indication for liver transplantation.

==Effects of MARS Treatment on Drugs and Poisons clearance==
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for a majority of drugs can be significantly be modified with liver failure, affecting the therapeutic approach and potential toxicity of the drugs. In these type of patients, Child-Pugh score represents a poor prognostic factor to assess the metabolic capacity of the failing liver.
* Metabolic performance of the liver depends on several factors:
* Hepatic flow rate
* Cytochrome P-450 enzimatic activity
* Albumin affinity for the drug
* Extrahepatic clearance for the drug

In patients with hepatic failure, drugs that are only metabolized in the liver, accumulate in the plasma right after they are administered, and therefore it is needed to modify drug dosing in both, concentration and time intervals, to lower the risk of toxicity. It is also necessary to adjust the dosing for those drugs that are exclusively metabolized by the liver, and have low affinity for proteins and high distribution volume, such as fluoroquinolones ([[Levofloxacin]] and [[Ciprofloxacin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Majcher-Peszynska|first=J|author2=P.

Extracorporeal detoxification with albumin dialysis increases the clearance of drugs that are bound to plasmatic proteins (Table 7).

== Effects of MARS on Survival==

In the meta-analysis published by Khuroo ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; which included 4 randomized trials&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; an improvement in survival for the patients with liver failure treated with MARS, compared with SMT, was not observed.

However, neither in the extracorporeal liver support systems review by the Cochrane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = JP | last2 = Gluud | first2 = LL | last3 = Als-Nielsen | first3 = B | last4 = Gluud | first4 = C | year = 2004 | title = Artificial and bioartificial support systems for liver failure | url = | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 1 | issue = | page = CD003628 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003628.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (published in 2004), nor the meta-analysis by Kjaergard ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kjaergard | first1 = LL | last2 = Liu | first2 = J | last3 = Als-Nielsen | first3 = B | last4 = Gluud | first4 = C | year = 2003 | title = Artificial and bioartificial support systems for acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure: a systematic review | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 289 | issue = | pages = 217–222 | doi=10.1001/jama.289.2.217}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a significance difference in survival found for patients diagnosed with ALF treated with extracorporeal liver support systems. 
Nevertheless, these reviews included all kind of liver support systems and used a heterogeneous type of publication ( abstracts, clinical trials, cohort, etc.).

There is literature showing favorable results in survival for patients diagnosed with ALF, and treated with MARS., In a randomized controlled trial, Salibà ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saliba | first1 = F | last2 = Camus | first2 = C | last3 = Durand | first3 = F | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = Randomized controlled multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of albumin dialysis with MARS in patients with fulminant and subfulminant hepatic failure | url = | journal = Hepatology | volume = 48 | issue = 4 (Suppl 1) | page = 377A | doi = 10.1002/hep.22615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  studied the impact on survival of MARS therapy for patients with ALF, waiting on the liver transplant list. Forty-nine patients received SMT and 53 were treated with MARS. They observed that patients that received 3 or more MARS sessions showed a statistically significance increase in transplant-free survival compared with the others patients of the study. Notably, 75% of the patients underwent liver transplantation in the first 24 hours after inclusion in the waiting list, and besides the short exposure to MARS therapy, some patients showed a better survival trend compared to controls, when they were treated with MARS prior to the transplant.

In a case-controlled study by Montejo ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; it was reported that MARS treatment do not decrease mortality directly; however, the treatment contributed to significantly improve survival in patients that were transplanted. In studies by Mitzner ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and Heemann ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; they were able to show a significance statistical difference in 30-day survival for patients in the MARS group. However, El Banayosy ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  and Hassanein ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; noticed a non significant improvement in survival, probably because of the short number of patients included in the trials. In the majority of available MARS studies published with patients diagnosed with ALF, either transplanted or not, survival was greater in the MARS group with some variations according to the type of trial, ranging from 20-30%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lai | first1 = WK | last2 = Haydon | first2 = G | last3 = Mutimer | first3 = D | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = The effect of molecular adsorbent recirculating system on pathophysiological parameters in patients with acute liver failure | url = | journal = Intensive Care Med | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1544–1549 | doi=10.1007/s00134-005-2786-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = KH | last2 = Lee | first2 = MK | last3 = Sutedja | first3 = DS | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = Outcome from molecular adsorbent recycling system (MARS) liver dialysis following drug-induced liver failure | url = | journal = Liver Int | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 973–977 | doi=10.1111/j.1478-3231.2005.01091.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 60-80%.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhou | first1 = XM | last2 = Miao | first2 = JY | last3 = Yang | first3 = Y | display-authors = etal   | year = 2004 | title = Clinical experience with molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) in patients with drug-induced liver failure | url = | journal = Artif Organs | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 483–486 | doi=10.1046/j.1525-1594.2003.00953.x-i1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kantola | first1 = T | last2 = Koivusalo | first2 = A | last3 = Höckerstedt | first3 = K | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = The effect of molecular adsorbent recirculating system on survival, native liver recovery, and need for liver transplantation in acute liver failure patients | url = | journal = Transpl Int | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 857–866 | doi=10.1111/j.1432-2277.2008.00698.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Camus | first1 = C | last2 = Lavoue | first2 = S | last3 = Gacouin | first3 = A | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Liver transplantation avoided in patients with fulminant hepatic failure who received albumin dialysis with the molecular adsorbent recirculating system while on the waiting list: impact of the duration of therapy | url = | journal = Ther Apher Dial | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 549–555 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-9987.2009.00708.x | pmid=19954480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is summarized in Tables 8, 9 and 10.

For patients diagnosed with acute on chronic liver failure and treated with MARS therapy, clinical trial results showed a not statistically significant reduction in mortality (odds ratio [OR] =0,78; confident interval [CI] =95%: 0,58 – 1,03; p= 0,1059, Figure 3)

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 3: Meta-analysis showing the effect on survival of patients with ACLF treated with MARS therapy&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;A non-statistically significant reduction of mortality was shown in patients with ALF treated with MARS (OR = 0,75 [CI= 95%, 0,42 – 1,35]; p= 0,3427). (Figure 4)

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 4. Meta-analysis showing the effect on survival of patients with ALF treated with MARS therapy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Combined results yielded a non-significant reduction on mortality in patients treated with MARS therapy. However, the low number of patients included in each of the studies may be responsible for not being able to achieve enough statistical power to show differences between both treatment groups. Moreover, heterogeneity for the number of MARS sessions and severity of liver disease of the patients included, make it very difficult for the evaluation of MARS impact on survival.

Recently, a meta-analysis on survival in patients treated with an extra-hepatic therapy has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stutchfield|first=BM|author2=Simpson, K |author3=Wigmore, SJ |title=Systematic review and meta-analysis of survival following extracorporeal liver support.|journal=The British Journal of Surgery|date=May 2011|volume=98|issue=5|pages=623–31|pmid=21462172|doi=10.1002/bjs.7418}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searching strategies yielded 74 clinical trials: 17 randomized controlled trials, 5 case control and 52 cohort studies. Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis: three addressing acute liver failure, one with MARS therapy&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; and five addressing acute on chronic, being four MARS related.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Authors concluded that extra-hepatic detoxifying systems improve survival for acute liver insufficiency, whereas results for acute decompensation of chronic liver diseases suggested a non significant survival benefit. Also, due to an increased demand for liver transplantation together with an augmented risk of liver failure following large resections, development of detoxifying extrahepatic systems are necessary.

==Safety Aspects==
Safety, defined as presence of adverse events, is evaluated in few trials. Adverse events in patients receiving MARS therapy are similar to those in the controls with the exception of thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage that seems to occur more frequently with the MARS system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitzner|first=SR|author2=Stange, J |author3=Klammt, S |author4=Koball, S |author5=Hickstein, H |author6= Reisinger, EC |title=Albumin dialysis MARS: knowledge from 10 years of clinical investigation.|journal=ASAIO Journal |date=Sep–Oct 2009|volume=55|issue=5|pages=498–502|pmid=19730006|doi=10.1097/mat.0b013e3181b37d86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heemann et al.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; reported two adverse events most probably MARS related: fever and sepsis, presumably originated at the catheter.

In the study by Hassanein ''et al.'',&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; two patients in the MARS group abandoned the study owing to''' '''hemodynamic instability, three patients required larger than average platelets transfusion and three more patients presented gastrointestinal bleeding.

Laleman ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; detected one patient with thrombocytopenia in both the MARS and Prometheus treatment groups, and an additional patient with clotting of the dialysis circuit and hypotension, only in the Prometheus group.

Kramer ''et al''. (Biologic-DT)&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; wrote about 3 cases with disseminated intravascular coagulation in the interventional group, two of them with fatal outcomes.

Mitzner ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; described, among patients treated with MARS, a thrombocytopenia case and a second patient with chronic hepatitis B, who underwent TIPS placement on day 44 after randomization and died on day 105 of multiorgan failure, as a consequence of complications related to the TIPS procedure.

Montejo ''et al''.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; showed that MARS is an easy technique, without serious adverse events related to the procedure, and also easy to implement in ICU settings that are used to renal extracorporeal therapies.

The MARS International Registry, with data from more than 500 patients (although sponsored by the manufacturer),  shows that the adverse effects observed are similar to the control group. However, in these severely ill patients it is difficult to distinguish between complications of the disease itself and side effects attributable to the technique.

==Health Economics==
Only three Studies addressing cost-effectivenenss of MARS therapy have been found.
Hassanein et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassanein|first=T|author2=Oliver, D |author3=Stange, J |author4= Steiner, C |title=Albumin dialysis in cirrhosis with superimposed acute liver injury: possible impact of albumin dialysis on hospitalization costs.|journal=Liver International |year=2003|volume=23 Suppl 3|pages=61–5|pmid=12950963|doi=10.1034/j.1478-3231.23.s.3.6.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  analysed costs of randomized patients with ACLF receiving MARS therapy or standard medical care. They used the study published in 2001 by Kim et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim WR, Gross JB Jr, Poterucha JJ, Locke GR 3rd, Dickson ER |title=Outcome of hospital care of liver disease associated with hepatitis C in the United States.|journal=Hepatology |date=Jan 2001|volume=33|issue=1|pages=201–6|pmid=11124837|doi=10.1053/jhep.2001.20798}}&lt;/ref&gt;   describing the impact of complications in hospitalization costs in patients diagnosed with alcoholic liver failure. Cost of 11 patients treated with standard medical care (SMT) were compared to those that received MARS, in addition to SMT (12 patients). In the MARS group, there was less in-hospital mortality and complications related to the disease, with a remarkable reduction in cost which compensated the MARS related expenditure (Table 11).

There were 5 survivors in the control group, with a cost per patient of $35.904, whereas in the MARS group, 11 patients out of 12 survived with a cost per patient of $32.036 which represents a $4000 savings per patient in favors of the MARS group.
Hessel et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hessel|first=FP|title=Economic evaluation of the artificial liver support system MARS in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure.|journal=Cost effectiveness and resource allocation : C/E|date=Oct 5, 2006|volume=4|pages=16|pmid=17022815|doi=10.1186/1478-7547-4-16|pmc=1601969}}&lt;/ref&gt;   published a 3-year follow-up of a cohort of 79 patients with ACLF, of whom 33 received MARS treatments and 46 received SMT. Survival was 67% for the MARS group and 63% for the controls, that was reduced to 58 and 35% respectively at one year follow-up, and then 52 and 17% at three years.

Hospitalization costs for the MARS treated group were greater than that for the controls (€31.539 vs. €7.543) and similarly direct cost at 3-year follow-up (€8.493 vs. €5.194). Nevertheless, after adjusting mortality rate, the annual cost per patient was €12.092 for controls and €5.827 for MARS group; also in the latter, they found an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 31.448 € per life-year gained (LYG) and an incremental costs per QALY gained of 47171 €.

Two years later, same authors published the results of 149 patients diagnosed with ACLF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hessel|first=FP|author2=Bramlage, P |author3=Wasem, J |author4= Mitzner, SR |title=Cost-effectiveness of the artificial liver support system MARS in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure.|journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology|date=Feb 2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=213–20|pmid=19773666|doi=10.1097/meg.0b013e3283314e48}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There were 67 patients (44,9%) treated with MARS and 82 patients (55,1%) were allocated to receive SMT. Mean survival time was 692 days in the MARS group (33% at 3 years) and 453 days in the controls (15% at 3 years); the results were significant (p=0,022). Differences in average cost was €19.853 (95% IC: 13.308-25.429): 35.639 € for MARS patients and 15.804 € for the control group. Incremental cost per LYG was 29.985 € (95% IC: 9.441-321.761) and €43.040 (95% IC: 13.551-461.856) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY).

Liver support systems, such as MARS, are very important to stabilize patients with acute or acute on chronic liver failure and avoid organ dysfunction, as well as a bridge-to-transplant. Although initial in-hospital costs are high, they are worth for the favorable outcome.

* Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
* Benign intrahepatic cholestasis (BIC)
* Biliary Atresia

'''Goals of MARS Therapy'''
* Attenuate pruritus symptoms and improve patients’ quality of life

'''MARS Therapy Indication'''
* Pruritus not responding to SMT

'''Treatment Schedule:'''
* 3 to 5 eight-hour treatment sessions in consecutives days
* Repeat treatment when symptoms reoccur

== MARS Therapy Contraindications ==

Same contraindications as with any other extracorporeal treatment may be applied to MARS therapy. 
* Unstable hemodynamics with mean arterial pressure (MAP)&lt; 55 mmHg despite vasoconstrictors administration
* Uncontrolled hemorrhage
* Severe coagulopathy
* Severe thrombocytopenia

== Treatment Parameters ==

'''Blood Flow'''

The trend is to use high flow rates, although it is determined by the technical specifications of the combined machine and catheters’ size

'''Intermittent treatments:'''
* Without renal dysfunction, it is recommended a blood and albumin flow rates ranging from 150 to 250 ml/min
'''Continuous treatments:'''
* With or without renal impairment it is recommended to use flow rates from 100 to 150 ml/min.

'''Dyalisate Flow Rate'''

'''Intermittent treatments:'''
* Without renal impairment: 1800 a 3000 ml/hour
* With renal impairment: 3000 a 6000 ml/hour
'''Continuous treatments:'''
* Recommended flow rate: 1000 to 2000 ml/hour.

'''Replacement Flow Rate'''
* According to medical criteria and same as in CVVHD

'''Heparin Anticoagulation'''

Similarly to CVVHD, it depends of previous patient’s coagulation status. In many cases it will not be needed, unless the patient presents a PTT inferior to 160 seconds. In patients with normal values, a bolus of 5000 to 10000 IU of heparin could be administered at the commencement of the treatment, followed by a continuous perfusion, to keep PTT in ratios from 1,5 to 2,5 or 160 to 180 seconds.

'''Monitoring'''

A biochemical analysis is recommended (liver and kidney profile, ionic, glucose) together with a hemogram at the end of first session and before starting the following one.

Coagulation analysis must be also performed before starting the session to adjusting heparin dose.

In case that medication susceptible to be eliminated by MARS is being administered, it is also recommended to monitor their levels in blood

'''End of the Session'''
* Once the treatment is finalized, blood should be returned following the unit procedure,
and both catheter’s lumens heparinized 
* For the next session a new kit must be used
* For continuous treatments, kit must be changed by a new one every 24 hours 
* Treatment must be stopped before schedule owing to the particular circumstances listed below: 
# MAP inferior to 40 mmHg at least for 10 minutes
# Air embolism of the extracorporeal circuit
# Transmembrane pressure (TMP) greater than 600 mmHg.
# Blood leak detection in the albumin circuit
# Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
# Severe active hemorrhage

== FDA Clearance (US only) ==

Federal Drug Administration (FDA) cleared, in a document dated on May 27, 2005, MARS  therapy for the treatment of drug overdose and poisoning. The only requirement is that the drug or poison must be susceptible to be dialysed and removed by activated charcoal or anionic exchange resins.

More recently, on December 17, 2012,  MARS therapy has been cleared by the FDA for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy due to a decompensation of a chronic liver disease Clinical trials conducted with MARS treatment in HE patients having a decompensation of chronic liver disease demonstrated a transient effect from MARS treatments to significantly decrease their hepatic encephalopathy scores by at least 2 grades compared to standard medical therapy (SMT).

The MARS is not indicated as a bridge to liver transplant. Safety and efficacy has not been demonstrated in controlled, randomized clinical trials.

The effectiveness of the MARS device in patients that are sedated could not be established in clinical studies and therefore cannot be predicted in sedated patients

'''Logic Trunked Radio''' ('''LTR''') is a system developed in the late 1970s by the [[E. F. Johnson Company]].

LTR is distinguished from some other common [[trunked radio system]]s in that it does not have a dedicated control channel. Each repeater has its own controller and all of these controllers are coordinated together. Even though each controller monitors its own channel, one of the channel controllers is assigned to be a master and all the other controllers report to it.

Typically on LTR systems, each of these controllers periodically sends out a data burst (approximately every 10 seconds on LTR Standard systems) so that the subscriber units know that the system is there. The idle data burst can be turned off if desired by the system operator. Some systems will broadcast idle data bursts only on channels used as home channels and not on those used for "overflow" conversations. To a listener, the idle data burst will sound like a short blip of static like someone keyed up and unkeyed a radio within about 1/2 second. This data burst is not sent at the same time by all the channels but happen randomly throughout all the system channels.

[[File:Fleurcups sizes.png|upright=1.3|thumb|A menstrual cup in two different sizes.]]

A '''menstrual cup''' is a [[feminine hygiene]] product that is inserted into the [[vagina]] during [[menstruation]]. Its purpose is to prevent menstrual fluid (blood from [[uterine lining]]) from leaking onto clothes. Menstrual cups are usually made of flexible [[medical grade silicone]] and shaped like a bell with a stem. The stem is used for insertion and removal. The bell-shaped cup seals against the vaginal wall just below the cervix. Every 4–12 hours (depending on the amount of flow), the cup is removed, emptied, rinsed, and reinserted. After each period, the cup should be boiled for at least 5 minutes and stored for use the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.en.louloucup.com/pages/quest-ce-quune-coupe-menstruelle|title=What is a menstrual cup, review and use|website=louloucup|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://divacup.com/how-it-works/care-and-cleaning/|title=Care and cleaning|last=|first=|date=27 May 2018|website=Divacup.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[tampons]] and [[sanitary napkin|pads]], cups collect menstrual fluid rather than absorbing it.&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;Elizabeth Gunther Stewart, Paula Spencer: ''The V Book: A Doctor's Guide to Complete Vulvovaginal Health'', Bantam Books, 2002, Seiten 96 und 97, {{ISBN|0-553-38114-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menstruationstasse-maedels.de/ |title=Menstruationstasse für deine Tage |accessdate=November 20, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6m8t572QF?url=http://www.menstruationstasse-maedels.de/ |archivedate=November 19, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Garrett, Peter Greenberg: ''The Virtuous Consumer: Your Essential Shopping Guide for a Better, Kinder and Healthier World'', New World Library, 2007, Seiten 17 bis 19, {{ISBN|1-930722-74-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One cup is reusable for up to five years or more. This makes their long-term cost lower than that of disposable tampons or pads, though the initial cost is higher. Menstrual cups are also promoted as more practical and eco-friendly than pads and tampons. Given that the menstrual cup is reusable, its use greatly decreases the amount of waste generated from menstrual cycles, as there is no daily waste and the amount of discarded packaging decreases as well.

Most menstrual cup brands sell a smaller and a larger size. Menstrual cups are sold colorless and translucent, but several brands also offer colored cups, such as pink or purple.

The use of menstrual cups is considered a safe option relative to other forms of menstrual hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/menstrual-cup#2|title=What’s a Menstrual Cup?|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mayo" /&gt; {{TOC limit|3}}

==Use==
[[File:Menstrual cup inserted.png|thumb|A menstrual cup (purple) seals against the vagina and catches all the fluid that comes out of the uterus (green).]]The menstrual cup is first folded or pinched and then inserted into the vagina. It will normally unfold automatically and create a light seal against the vaginal walls. In some cases, the user may need to twist the cup or flex the vaginal muscles to ensure the cup is fully open. The cup should sit around the cervix. If correctly inserted, the cup shouldn't leak or cause any discomfort.  In comparison with a tampon, the menstrual cup should be placed lower in the vaginal canal.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uk.lunette.com/pages/cervix|title=Vagina Anatomy - Learn Your Parts|website=Lunette UK|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stem should be completely inside the vagina.  There are various folding techniques for insertion; common folds include the c-fold, as well as the punch-down fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Use-a-Menstrual-Cup&amp;oldid=16766928|title=How to Use a Menstrual Cup|last=|first=|date=March 2, 2015|work=wikiHow|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If lubrication is necessary for insertion, it should be [[Personal lubricant#Water-based|water-based]], as [[Personal lubricant#Silicone-based|silicone lubricant]] can be damaging to the silicone.

After 4–12 hours of use (depending on the amount of flow), the cup is removed by reaching up to its stem to find the base. Simply pulling on the stem is not recommended to remove the cup, as that can create suction. The base of the cup is pinched to release the seal, and the cup is removed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After emptying, a menstrual cup should be rinsed or wiped and reinserted. It can be washed with a mild soap, and sterilized in boiling water for a few minutes at the end of the cycle. Alternatively, sterilizing solutions (usually developed for baby bottles and breast pump equipment) may be used to soak the cup. Specific cleaning instructions vary by brand.

=== Advantages ===

* When using a menstrual cup, the menstrual fluid is collected after it flows from the cervix and is held in liquid form. With tampons, liquid is absorbed and held in semi-coagulated form against the cervix.&lt;ref name=youngwobost/&gt; This reduces odors.
* Menstrual cups collect menstrual fluid inside the vagina and generally do not leak (if emptied often enough and inserted properly). Some women have experienced leakage due to improper use or cup size. For example, a menstrual cup may leak if it is not inserted correctly and does not pop open completely and seal against the walls of the vagina. 
* If a user needs to track the amount of menses she is producing (e.g., for medical reasons), a menstrual cup allows her to do so accurately. Some cups even have measuring marks on them.

=== Acceptability studies ===
[[File:Fleurcup and tampons.jpg|thumb|180px|A large Fleurcup menstrual cup (center) can hold about 3 times as much liquid as a large tampon]]
A 2011 randomized controlled trial in Canada investigated whether silicone menstrual cups are a viable alternative to tampons and found that approximately 91% of women in the menstrual cup group said they would continue to use the cup and recommend it to others.&lt;ref name="FLOW" /&gt; In a 1991 clinical study involving 51 women, 23 of the participants (45%) found rubber menstrual cups to be an acceptable way of managing menstrual flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheng M, Kung R, Hannah M, Wilansky D, Shime J |title=Menses cup evaluation study |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=661–3 |date=September 1995 |pmid=7641929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a randomized controlled feasibility study in rural western Kenya, adolescent primary school girls were provided with menstrual cups or sanitary pads instead of traditional menstrual care items of cloth or tissue.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips-Howard|first=Penelope A.|last2=Nyothach|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Ter Kuile|first3=Feiko O.|last4=Omoto|first4=Jackton|last5=Wang|first5=Duolao|last6=Zeh|first6=Clement|last7=Onyango|first7=Clayton|last8=Mason|first8=Linda|last9=Alexander|first9=Kelly T.|date=2016|title=Menstrual cups and sanitary pads to reduce school attrition, and sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections: a cluster randomised controlled feasibility study in rural Western Kenya|journal=BMJ Open|volume=6|issue=11|pages=e013229|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013229|issn=2044-6055|pmc=5168542|pmid=27881530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls provided with menstrual cups had a lower prevalence of [[sexually transmitted infections]] than control groups. Also, the prevalence of [[bacterial vaginosis]] was lower among cup users compared with sanitary pad users or those continuing other usual practice.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After six months, menstrual cup users were free from embarrassing leakage or odor, and could engage in class activities and sport without humiliation or being teased.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=Linda|last2=Laserson|first2=Kayla|last3=Oruko|first3=Kelvin|last4=Nyothach|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Alexander|first5=Kelly|last6=Odhiambo|first6=Frank|last7=Eleveld|first7=Alie|last8=Isiye|first8=Emily|last9=Ngere|first9=Isaac|last10=Omoto|first10=Jackton|last11=Mohammed|first11=Aisha|last12=Vulule|first12=John|last13=Phillips-Howard|first13=Penelope |date=|year=2015|title=Adolescent schoolgirls' experiences of menstrual cups and pads in rural western Kenya: a qualitative study|url=http://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/abs/10.3362/1756-3488.2015.003|journal=Waterlines|volume=34|issue=1|pages=15–30|doi=10.3362/1756-3488.2015.003|issn=0262-8104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Access to water and hygiene ===
[[File:Boiling a menstrual cup.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Boiling a menstrual cup]]
* Cleaning a menstrual cup in a [[public toilet]] can pose problems as the [[handwashing]] sinks are usually, though not always, in a public space rather than in the toilet cubicle. Some manufacturers suggest wiping out the cup with a clean tissue and cleaning the cup at the next private opportunity. The user could also carry a small bottle of water to rinse the cup privately over the toilet. Another option is to use [[wet wipe]]s. Since menstrual cups may only need to be emptied every 6–24 hours, many users do not have to empty them in public restrooms but rather in the comfort of their own home.
* A lack of clean water and soap for handwashing, needed before inserting the cup, presents a problem to women in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Insertion requires thorough washing of the cup and hands to avoid introducing new bacteria into the vagina, which may heighten the risk of UTIs and other infections.&lt;ref name="Crofts"&gt;{{ cite book | last1 = Crofts | first = T. | title = Menstruation hygiene management for schoolgirls in low-income countries | date = 2012 | url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1569 | publisher = [[Loughborough University|Water, Engineering and Development Center (WEDC), Loughborough University]] |location = Loughborough }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disposable and reusable pads do not demand the same hand hygiene, though reusable pads also require access to water for washing out pads.
* Due to the fact that menstrual cups require boiling once a month, this can be a problem in developing countries if there is a lack of water, fire wood and good hygiene practices.&lt;ref name="APHRC"&gt;APHRC (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/984 Attitudes towards, and acceptability of, menstrual cups as a method for managing menstruation: Experiences of women and schoolgirls in Nairobi, Kenya] - Policy Brief No. 21. The African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC), Nairobi, Kenya&lt;/ref&gt; However, other options currently in use, such as rags that are washed, may be less hygienic.
* Removing a menstrual cup can be messy. Sometimes menstrual blood can spill during removal, although many women remove the device while hovering over a toilet to catch such spillage.

When using a [[urine-diverting dry toilet]], menstrual blood can be emptied into the part that receives the feces. If any menstrual blood falls into the funnel for urine, it can be rinsed away with water.&lt;ref&gt;WECF (2006).

==Safety==

Menstrual cups are safe when used as directed and no health risks related to their use have been found.&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;{{cite web | last = Pruthi | first = Sandhya | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/menstrual-cup/AN01770 | title = Menstrual cup: What is it? | website = Mayoclinic.com | date = January 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stewart | first = Elizabeth B. | title = The V Book: A Doctor's Guide to Complete Vulvovaginal Health | publisher = Bantam | year = 2002 | page = 96 | isbn = 0-553-38114-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No medical research was conducted to ensure that menstrual cups were safe prior to introduction on the market.&lt;ref name="assocpharmtox.org"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Lione | first1 = Armand | last2 = Guidone | first2 =  Heather C. | title = The ERC online questionnaire of women who used menstrual cups: summary statement of results and a call for additional research | url = http://www.assocpharmtox.org/pages/CupSummaryStatement.html | website = assocpharmtox.org | publisher = Endometriosis Research Centre, Associated Pharmacologists &amp; Toxicologists (APT) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early research in 1962 evaluated 50 women using a bell-shaped cup. The researchers obtained vaginal smears, gram stains, and basic aerobic cultures of vaginal secretions. Vaginal speculum examination was performed, and pH was measured. No significant changes were noted. This report was the first containing extensive information on the safety and acceptability of a widely used menstrual cup that included both preclinical and clinical testing and over 10 years of post-marketing surveillance.&lt;ref name="JWH2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=North|first1=Barbara B.|last2=Oldham|first2=Michael J.|date=February 2011|title=Preclinical, clinical, and over-the-counter postmarketing experience with a new vaginal cup: menstrual collection|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2009.1929|journal=[[Journal of Women's Health]]|publisher=[[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.]]|volume=20|issue=2|pages=303–311|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1929|pmc=3036176|pmid=21194348|postscript=.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One case report noted the development of [[endometriosis]] and [[adenomyosis]] in one menstrual cup user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Spechler S, Nieman LK, Premkumar A, Stratton P |title=The Keeper, a menstrual collection device, as a potential cause of endometriosis and adenomyosis |journal=Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=35–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12867766 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000072329 |doi=10.1159/000072329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one survey with a small sample size indicated a possible link. Therefore, two organizations have issued a combined statement that urged further research.&lt;ref name="assocpharmtox.org" /&gt; However, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] declined to remove menstrual cups from the market, saying that there was insufficient evidence of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/03/Nov03/112803/03P-0166-ans0001.pdf|title=Citizen Petition on Menstrual Cups &amp; Endometriosis|last=Lione|first=Armand|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 [[randomized controlled trial]] measured urovaginal infection in a comparison of menstrual cup and tampon use, and found no difference.&lt;ref name="FLOW"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Howard C, Rose CL, Trouton K, Stamm H, Marentette D, Kirkpatrick N, Karalic S, Fernandez R, Paget J |title=FLOW (finding lasting options for women): Multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing tampons with menstrual cups |journal=Canadian Family Physician |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=e208-15 |date=June 2011 |PMC=3114692 |pmid=21673197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No differences in the growth of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', or health harms were identified among school girls provided with menstrual cups compared to those using sanitary pads, or continuing their usual practice in rural western [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Juma|first=Jane|last2=Nyothach|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Laserson|first3=Kayla F.|last4=Oduor|first4=Clifford|last5=Arita|first5=Lilian|last6=Ouma|first6=Caroline|last7=Oruko|first7=Kelvin|last8=Omoto|first8=Jackton|last9=Mason|first9=Linda|date=2017-05-04|title=Examining the safety of menstrual cups among rural primary school girls in western Kenya: observational studies nested in a randomised controlled feasibility study|journal=BMJ Open|volume=7|issue=4|pages=e015429|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015429|issn=2044-6055|pmc=5566618|pmid=28473520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxic shock syndrome===

[[Toxic shock syndrome]] (TSS) is a potentially fatal bacterial illness. Scientists have recognized an association between TSS and [[tampon]] use, although the exact connection remains unclear.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/PatientAlerts/ucm070003.htm|title = Tampons and Asbestos, Dioxin, &amp; Toxic Shock Syndrome|date = 13 May 2015|accessdate = 8 September 2015|website = |publisher = FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSS caused by menstrual cup use appears to be very rare to virtually nonexistent.&lt;ref name="FLOW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=MA Mitchell |author2=S Bisch |author3=S Arntfield |author4=SM Hosseini-Moghaddam |title=A confirmed case of toxic shock syndrome associated with the use of a menstrual cup|journal=Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases &amp; Medical Microbiology |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=218–220 |date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The probable reason for this is that menstrual cups are not absorbent, do not irritate the vaginal [[Mucous membrane|mucosal]] tissue, and so do not change the [[vaginal flora]] in any measurable amount.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | author = North B. B., Oldham M. J. | year = 2011 | title = Preclinical, Clinical, and Over-the-Counter Postmarketing Experience with a New Vaginal Cup: Menstrual Collection | journal = Journal of Women's Health | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 303–311 | pmc=3036176 | pmid=21194348 | doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[vaginal dryness]] and [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] may occur if the tampon used is more absorbent than needed for the menstrual flow, and normal liquid that should line the vaginal wall is also absorbed.&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt; Research has shown that the cup has no impact on the vaginal flora, which means there is no effect on the presence of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'', the [[Bacteria|bacterium]] that can cause TSS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The risk of TSS associated with [[cervical cap]]s used for [[Birth control|contraception]] in the female barrier method is also very low.&lt;ref&gt;Faculty of Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Care (2007).

==Types==
Menstrual cups are generally bell-shaped, with a few exceptions. Most brands use [[medical grade silicone]] as the material for the menstrual cup, although [[latex]] and [[thermoplastic elastomer]] are also options. Menstrual cups made from silicone are generally designed to last for 1–5 years.

The majority of menstrual cup brands on the market are selling reusable cups, rather than disposable cups, which is therefore the focus of this article.

Most menstrual cup brands sell a smaller and a larger size. The smaller size is recommended for women under 30 who have not given birth vaginally. The larger size is recommended for women who are over 30, have given birth vaginally, or have a heavy flow. Cups with an even smaller size are recommended for teenagers, as well as women and girls who are more physically fit, as those with stronger pelvic floor muscles may find a larger cup uncomfortable. Length also needs to be considered: if a female's cervix sits particularly low, she may want to use a shorter cup. Capacity is important to women who have a heavier flow. The average menstrual cup holds around 20 ml. Some cups are designed to be larger and hold 37–42 ml. However, all cups currently available have a larger capacity than a regular tampon, which is 10–12 ml.&lt;ref name="AssortedSizeCharts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/menstrual_cups/1285963.html |title=Assorted Size Charts |date=18 August 2008 |publisher=Menstrual Cup Support |accessdate=8 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717060326/http://community.livejournal.com/menstrual_cups/1285963.html |archivedate=17 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final consideration in selecting a menstrual cup is firmness or flexibility. Some companies offer a range of firmness levels in their cups. A firmer cup pops open more easily after insertion and may hold a more consistent seal against the vaginal wall (preventing leaks), but many women find softer cups more comfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Melissa L.|title=Menstrual Cup Info:  Measurement Chart|url=http://menstrualcupinfo.wordpress.com/cup-stiffness-comparison-chart/|publisher=Word Press Blog|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color===
The silicone of which most brands of cups are produced is naturally colorless and translucent. Several brands offer colored cups as well as, or instead of the colorless ones. Translucent cups lose their initial appearance faster than colored &amp;ndash; they tend to get yellowish stains with use. The shade of a colored cup may change over time, though stains are often not as obvious as on colored cups. Stains on any color of cup can often be removed or at least lightened by soaking the cup in diluted [[hydrogen peroxide]] and/or leaving it out in the sun for a few hours.

Most cups produced do not have any other additives to them, except for the colored cups. The coloring used is reported to be safe and approved by the [[FDA]] for medical use and food coloring.

=== Disposable ===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
[[file:Stap2.png|thumb|Inserting a disposable cup.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[wikihow:Use-an-Instead-Softcup#/Image:Undefined_14872.png|How to use an Instead Softcup]], Wikihow&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A disposable cup (also called menstrual disc) is usually disc-shaped, like a [[Diaphragm (birth control)|diaphragm]], with a flexible outer ring and a soft, collapsible center. It is designed to be disposed of after use. These tend to be made of a medical-grade&amp;nbsp;[[polymer blend]].  It is placed at the base of the cervix in the&amp;nbsp;[[vaginal fornix]], and covers the cervix, like a diaphragm. Because of its placement, it can be worn during sexual intercourse, but it is not a contraceptive nor does it protect against sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flexfits.com/pages/faq|title=FAQs {{!}} learn more about FLEX &amp; how to use it {{!}} The Flex Company|website=The Flex Company|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disposable cups are designed to fit most women, but may not be suitable for teenagers as the diameter of the rim may be uncomfortable. The disposable cup is pinched in half and inserted into the vaginal canal. Once inserted, a finger is used to push it back and down toward the cervix. The top rim of the disc rests behind the pubic bone. If correctly inserted, it should not be felt and should not leak.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After about 12 hours of use (depending on flow volume), a disposable cup should be removed and disposed of. This is done by inserting a finger into the vagina, feeling for the top of the rim, hooking the finger beneath the rim and pulling straight out. Sitting down is recommended, to keep the disc parallel to the floor while removing. Removing a disc cleanly takes practice, and may be done while seated on the toilet to avoid spillage. During peak flow, most women use two disposable cups per day[[Menstruation|.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Cost==
Reusable menstrual products (including menstrual cups, but not disposable menstrual cups) are more economical than disposable products. Money will be saved using a menstrual cup, compared with other options such as [[tampon]]s.&lt;ref name="FLOW" /&gt; A woman in a developed country spends an average of US$60 per year on pads and tampons. If a woman menstruates for 40 years, the lifetime expense for pads and tampons is US$2,400. If the average silicon menstrual cup lasts between one and five years, then between eight and 40 would be needed in 40 years. If a menstrual cup costs US$30 (costs vary by manufacturer), the lifetime cost for a menstrual cup would be between US$240 and US$1,200.&lt;ref&gt;Caitlyn Shaye Weir, BSc Combined Honours, Environmental Science and Gender and Women Studies, Dalhousie University (2015) April 3rd, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The up-front cost of a menstrual cup may be expensive for women from low-income households, especially in developing countries. Buying pads or using rags monthly may seem more affordable than purchasing a menstrual cup, though the lifetime spend is higher.&lt;ref name="Crofts" /&gt;

== History ==
An early version of a bullet-shaped menstrual cup was patented in 1932, by the midwifery group of McGlasson and Perkins.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, L.J. [http://www.google.com/patents?id=W75tAAAAEBAJ US Patent #1,891,761] (issued December 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leona Chalmers]] patented the first usable commercial cup in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=North|first1=Barbara B.|last2=Oldham|first2=Michael J.|title=Preclinical, Clinical, and Over-the-Counter Postmarketing Experience with a New Vaginal Cup: Menstrual Collection|pmc=3036176|pmid=21194348|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1929|volume=20|date=Feb 2011|journal=J Womens Health (Larchmt)|pages=303–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later menstrual cups were patented in 1935, 1937, and 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedora, Arthur F. [http://www.google.com/patents?id=GbV4AAAAEBAJ US Patent #1,996,242] (issued April 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, Leona. [http://www.google.com/patents?id=ioJMAAAAEBAJ US Patent #2,089,113] (issued August 1937).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, Ileona W. [http://www.google.com/patents?id=kuVYAAAAEBAJ US Patent #2,534,900] (issued December 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; The Tassaway brand of menstrual cups was introduced in the 1960s, but it was not a commercial success.&lt;ref name="options"&gt;Wysocki, Susan. [http://nurse-practitioners.advanceweb.com/Editorial/Content/Editorial.aspx?CC=182215 "New Options in Menstrual Protection"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524001435/http://nurse-practitioners.advanceweb.com/Editorial/Content/Editorial.aspx?CC=182215 |date=2009-05-24 }}. ''Advance for Nurse Practitioners'' (November 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Early menstrual cups were made of rubber.&lt;ref name="mayo" /&gt;

In 1987, another latex rubber menstrual cup, The Keeper, was manufactured in the United States. This proved to be the first commercially viable menstrual cup and it is still available today. The first silicone menstrual cup was the UK-manufactured Mooncup in 2001. Most menstrual cups are now manufactured from medical grade silicone because of its durability and hypoallergenic properties, though there are also brands made of TPE ([[thermoplastic elastomer]]). Menstrual cups are becoming more popular worldwide, with many different brands, shapes and sizes on the market.&lt;ref name="youngwobost" /&gt; Most are reusable, though there is at least one brand of disposable menstrual cups currently manufactured.&lt;ref name="youngwobost"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Menstrual Products|url=http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/alternative_menstrual.html|work=Center for Young Women's Health|publisher=Boston Children's Hospital|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and companies have begun to propose menstrual cups to females in developing countries since about 2010, for example in Kenya and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/985 Use of Menstrual Cup by Adolescent Girls and Women: Potential Benefits and Key Challenges]. In: Policy Brief No. 22. Nairobi: APHRC, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Menstrual cups are regarded as a low-cost and environmentally friendly alternative to sanitary cloth, expensive disposable pads or "nothing" &amp;ndash; the reality for many females in developing countries.&lt;ref name="APHRC" /&gt;

While numerous companies all over the world offer this product it was still not well known in around 2010. It may be difficult for companies to make profit from this product as one single menstrual cup can last a girl or woman five years or longer. Most women hear of menstrual cups through the internet or word of mouth, rather than through conventional [[advertizing]] on TV for example. As of 2018, menstrual cups are mentioned more and more often alongside tampons and pads in publications about menstrual hygiene management.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Society and culture==

=== Developing countries ===
{{Further|Menstrual hygiene day}}
[[File:Women in Meru, Kenya, examining Menstrual Cups (5926104507).jpg|thumb|Women in Meru, Kenya examining a menstrual cup.]]
Menstrual cups can be useful as a means of [[Menstrual hygiene day|menstrual hygiene management]] for women in developing countries, such as Kenya, Uganda and India, where access to affordable sanitary products may be limited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tellier M, Hyttel M, Gad M.

The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/26/kenyan-girls-sanitary-problem-banana-fibre-pad. 26 Sep 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Menstrual cups offer a long-term solution compared to some other feminine hygiene products because they do not need to be replaced monthly.

=== Cultural aspects ===
{{Further|Culture and menstruation}}

Feminine hygiene products that need to be inserted into the vagina can be unacceptable for cultural reasons. There are myths that they interfere with female reproductive organs and that females lose their [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="Crofts" /&gt; Use of a menstrual cup could stretch or break the [[hymen]]. Since some cultures value preservation of the hymen as evidence of virginity, this can discourage young women from using cups.

===Environmental impact===

Since they are reusable, menstrual cups help to reduce solid [[waste]].&lt;ref&gt;Bharadwaj S, Patkar A. [http://www.wsp.org/Hygiene-Sanitation-Water-Toolkit/Resources/Readings/Bharadwai-2004-Menstrual.doc Menstrual hygiene and management in developing countries: Taking stock]; Junction Social 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Some disposable sanitary napkins and plastic tampon applicators can take 25 years to break down in the ocean and can cause a significant environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Environmental Impact of Everyday Things|url=http://www.thechicecologist.com/2010/04/the-environmental-impact-of-everyday-things/|publisher=The Chic Ecologist|accessdate= 22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodegradable sanitary options are also available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Schagen |first=Sarah|title=A review of eco-minded feminine products|url=http://grist.org/article/the-red-vadge-of-courage/ | journal = [[Grist (magazine)|Grist]] | date = 8 November 2008 |accessdate= 22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these decompose in a short period of time, but they must be composted, and not disposed off in a landfill.

Each year, an estimated 20 billion pads and tampons are discarded in North America. They typically end up in landfills or are incinerated, which can have a great impact on the environment. Most of the pads and tampons are made of cotton and plastic. Plastic takes about 50 or more years and cotton starts degrading after 90 days if it's composted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Lili Li |author2=Margaret Frey |author3=Kristie J Browning |year=2010|title=Biodegradability Study on Cotton and Polyester Fabrics|url=http://www.jeffjournal.org/papers/Volume5/5-4-6Frey.pdf|journal=Journal of Engineered Fibers and Fabrics|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the menstrual cup is reusable, its use greatly decreases the amount of waste generated from menstrual cycles, as there is no daily waste and the amount of discarded packaging decreases as well. After their life span is over, the silicone cups are put in landfills or incinerated.

Menstrual cups may be emptied into a small hole in the [[soil]] or in [[Compost|compost pile]]s, since menstrual fluid is a valuable [[fertilizer]] for plants and any [[pathogen]]s of [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] will quickly be destroyed by soil microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/Publications/Documents/Organics%5C44200014.doc |title=Composting Reduces Growers’ Concerns About Pathogens|last=CalRecycle|first=|date=|website= |accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water used to rinse the cups can be disposed of in the same way. This reduces the amount of [[wastewater]] that needs to be [[Sewage treatment|treated]].

In developing countries, solid waste management is often lacking. Here, menstrual cups have an advantage over disposable pads or tampons as they do not contribute to the solid waste issues in the communities or generate embarrassing refuse that others may see.

Eswaran, A. Rowe and R. Rajkumar, "Nano-RK: An Energy-Aware Resource-Centric Operating System for Sensor Networks," IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium, December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS) from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] designed to run on [[Micro controller| micro-controllers]] for use in sensor networks. Nano-RK supports a fixed-priority fully [[Preemption (computing)| preemptive scheduler]] with fine-grained timing primitives to support real-time task sets. "Nano" implies that the RTOS is small, consuming 2&amp;nbsp;KB of [[RAM]] and using 18&amp;nbsp;KB of [[Flash memory|flash]], while "RK" is short for ''resource kernel''. A resource [[Kernel (computer science)| kernel]] provides reservations on how often system resources can be consumed.  For example, a [[Task (computers)|task]] might only be allowed to execute 10&amp;nbsp;ms every 150&amp;nbsp;ms (CPU reservation), or a [[Node (networking)| node]] might only be allowed to transmit 10 [[Packet (information technology)| network packets]] per minute (network reservation). These reservations form a virtual [[energy budget]] to ensure a node meets its designed battery lifetime as well as protecting a failed node from generating excessive network traffic.  Nano-RK is [[open source]], is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and runs on the [[Atmel]]-based FireFly sensor networking platform, the MicaZ motes as well as the [[MSP430]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;Anand Eswaran and Anthony Rowe and Raj Rajkumar, “FireFly: A Time Synchronized Real-Time Sensor Networking Platform”&lt;/ref&gt;

The following article &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embedded.com/design/networking/204800543?pgno=1 embedded.com]&lt;/ref&gt; discusses some of the tradeoffs associated with using an RTOS in sensor networks.

== advantage ==
NanoRK takes advantage of priority-based preemptive scheduling to help honor the real-time factor of being deterministic thus ensuring task timeliness and synchronization. Due to the characteristic of limited battery power on the wireless node, Nano-RK provides CPU, network, and sensor efficiency through the use of virtual energy reservations, labeling this system as a resource kernel. These energy reservations can enforce energy and communication budgets to minimize the negative impact on the node’s operational lifetime from unintentional errors or malicious behavior by other nodes within the network. It supports packet forwarding, routing and other network scheduling protocols with the help of a light-weight wireless networking stack. Compared with other current sensor operating systems, Nano-RK provides rich functionality and timeliness scheduling with a small-footprint for its embedded resource kernel (RK).&lt;ref&gt;[3] Anand Eswaran and Anthony Rowe and Raj Rajkumar, “Nano-RK: an
Energy-aware Resource-centric RTOS for Sensor Networks,”,2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features of Nano-RK ==
'''Static Configuration''' - Nano-RK uses a static design-time approach for energy usage control. Dynamic task creation is disallowed by Nano-RK requiring application developers to set both task and reservation quotas/priorities in a static testbed design. This design allows the developers to create an energy budget for each task in order to maintain application requirements as well as energy efficiency throughout the system’s lifetime. Using a static configuration approach, all of the runtime configurations as well as the power requirements are predefined and verified by the designer before the system is deployed and executed in the real world. This approach also helps to guarantee the stability and small-footprint characteristics when compared with traditional RTOSs.

'''Watchdog Timer support''' - Watchdog is a software timer that triggers a system reset action if the system hangs on crucial faults for an extended period of time. The watchdog mechanism can bring the system back from the nonresponsive state into normal operation by waiting until the timer goes off and subsequently rebooting the device. In Nano-RK, the watchdog timer is tied directly to the
processor’s reset signal REBOOT ON ERROR. By default, it is enabled when the system boots and reset each time the scheduler executes. If the system fails to respond within the predefined time period, the system will reboot and run the initialization instruction sequence to hopefully regain control.

'''Deep Sleep Mode''' - Another feature of Nano-RK is the deep sleep mode. For energy efficiency reasons, if there are no eligible tasks to run, the system can be powered down and given the option to enter deep sleep mode. When the system is in deep sleep mode, only the deep sleep timer can wake the system up with a predefined latency period. After waking up from the deep sleep mode, the next context swap time is set to guarantee the CPU wakes up in time. If a sensor node does not wish to perform deep sleep, it also is presented with the choice to go into a low energy consumption state while still managing its peripherals.

== The NANO-RK ready queue ==
Nano-RK has implemented a double-linked list of ready queue nodes within a fixed-size array, termed the ready queue, that orders All ready tasks in decreasing order by whichever of the task’s priorities is higher. As the number of tasks running within the Nano-RK implementation is statically-configured in a testbed before deployment, the ready queue size is also fixed to this number of tasks that can be ready to run. A fixed-length array named nrk readyQ is found within the nrk defs.h file along with two pointers to reference the two most important cells within this array. The free node pointer (free node) and the head node pointer (head node) point to the next cell in the array to be allocated and the current highest priority task ready to run, respectively.

== SCHEDULER ==
The core of Nano-RK is a static preemptive real-time scheduler which is priority-based and energy efficient. For priority-based preemptive scheduling, the scheduler always selects the highest priority task from the ready queue. To save energy, tasks do not poll for a resource but rather tasks will be blocked on certain events and can be unlocked when the events occur. When there is no task in the ready queue, the system can be powered down to save energy. When the system is working, one and only one task (current task), signified by the nrk cur task tcb, is running for a predefined period. So the most important job of the scheduler is to decide which task should be run next and for how long the next task should be run until the scheduler is triggered to run again.

Background, right: [[Windows 3.1]], [[DOS]] (not their "official" os-tan). Foreground: [[Windows CE]] (fairy), [[Windows ME]] (levitated by CE).]]

The '''OS-''tan''''' is an [[Internet meme]] that originated within the Japanese [[Futaba Channel]]. The OS-''tan'' are the [[Moe anthropomorphism|''moe'' anthropomorphism]]/[[personification]] of several [[operating system]]s by various amateur Japanese artists. The OS-''tan'' are typically depicted as women, with the OS-''tan'' representative of [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems usually depicted as sisters of varying ages. The ''-tan'' element in the term is a [[Hypocorism|hypocoristic]] suffix from [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

Though initially appearing only in fan work, the OS-''tan'' proved popular enough that [[Microsoft]] branches in [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]] used the OS-''tan'' concept as the basis for ad campaigns for [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Microsoft Silverlight]], respectively.

==History==
The concept of the OS-''tan'' is reported to have begun as a personification of the common perception of [[Windows Me]] as unstable and prone to frequent crashes. Discussions on Futaba Channel likened this to the [[stereotype]] of a fickle, troublesome [[girl]] and as this personification expanded Me-''tan'' was created and followed by the other characters.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} One of the early works to predominantly feature the OS-''tan'' was an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] [[animation]] showing a possible intro to an imaginary [[anime]] show known as ''Trouble Windows''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYlBuAvSzXk |title=Troubled Windows |publisher=YouTube |date=2005-11-11 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[fansub]] of this was eventually created and is partly responsible for the spread of the OS-''tan'' to English language [[imageboard]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The OS-''tan'' are not an original concept and are pre-dated by Toy's iMac Girl, who was featured on a series of desktops released between August 1998 and March 1999.

Japanese version of Windows 7 Ultimate DSP Edition includes the unofficial Nanami Madobe mascot. This inspired Microsoft Taiwan to launch an official mascot for Microsoft Silverlight, Hikaru. This was followed up by giving Hikaru "sisters", Lei, Aoi, and Yu.

A special package of the Japanese Windows 7 Ultimate DSP Edition, called the Touch Mouse Artist Edition or Touch Mouse Limited Edition Artist Series, came with an animated tutorial [[Windows theme]] (with custom sounds and three desktop backgrounds) featuring Madobe Nanami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/ThemeID.27509700/Microsoft-Touch-Mouse-Artist-Edition-Deanna-Cheuk/productID.234209300 |title=Microsoft Store Nederland Onlinewinkel - Welkom |publisher=Microsoftstore.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/touch-mouse-limited-edition-artist-series/3kj-00012 |title=Software Downloads: Touch Mouse Limited Edition Artist Series |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]-based comic titled ''Ubunchu!'' was serialized in ''Kantan Ubuntu!'', a spinoff from ''Weekly ASCII'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-09/ubunchu-manga-about-linux-variant-translated |title=Ubunchu!

==''Tan'' suffix==
The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] suffix {{nihongo|''tan''|たん|}} is a mispronunciation of {{nihongo|[[Japanese titles#Chan|''chan'']]|ちゃん|}}, an informal, intimate, and diminutive [[Japanese titles|honorific]] [[suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] for a person,  used for friends, family, and pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jref.com/language/japanese_suffixes.shtml|title=How to use Japanese suffixes|publisher=Japan Reference|date=2004-05-07|accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the mispronunciation is used intentionally to achieve the contrived cute or charming effect that is commonly associated with its use by young children and is also sometimes added to the names of non-mascot characters. The personifications as a whole are commonly simply called [[mascot]]s or mascot characters, and as such the ''-tan'' suffix itself means nothing outside its role as an [[honorific]] and its implications of cuteness. Normal suffixes, including ''-san'', ''-chan'', and ''-kun'' are also used in the name of some OS-''tan'', depending on the character and the speaker's preference; or the suffix may be omitted entirely.

==Examples==
===Windows 10===
The name of Windows 10 mascot is officially introduced as Tōko (or Touko) Madobe on 31 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haruhichan.com/wpblog/50564/windows-10s-mascot-name-officially-revealed/|title=Windows 10's Mascot Name Officially Revealed - Haruhichan|date=8 August 2015|website=Haruhichan.com|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As confirmed on the character's official Facebook page, her name is a homonym for one of the readings for the Japanese word for 'ten': {{nihongo|''too''|とお}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-08-06/windows-10-mascot-officially-introduced-as-toko/.91354|title=Windows 10 Mascot Officially Introduced as 'Tōko'|website=Animenewsnetwork.com|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name was chosen by fans through an online poll. According to her fictional profile, her origins are the Madobe family and she is set 100 years in the future. She likes online gaming and supporting others. Her personal traits are being an excellent student, and expanding her knowledge on technology. Her manager often worries since she’s a bit spontaneous. She also enjoys cheering on people who are working hard and doing their best. She has a part-time job at the Akibano Custom Computer Company where she is a rookie. This level of [[back story]] is rather unusual for OS-''tan''.

The Windows 8 Can Edition from Unitcom (available for the first 2,888 copies) included notepad, T-shirt, two-way mouse pad, pocket media case, smart phone stand cleaning, two-way PC cleaner, Yū and Ai badges, and a freeze blanket.{{clarify|date=June 2018|reason=What on earth is "freeze blanket" supposed to mean?}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faith-go.co.jp/ms/windows8/ |title=Windows 8 価格・情報 - BTOパソコンの通販SHOP フェイス |work=Faith-Go |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extended fictional Madobe family tree detailed that Yū is the older sister, and their parents are Eiichi ({{lang|ja|映一(えいいち)}}) from the Netsu (根津) family and Shii ({{lang|ja|椎(しい)}}) from the Madobe family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/hotline/20121013/etc_ms6.html |title=Windows 8の萌えOSキャラ「窓辺ゆう」「窓辺あい」情報まとめ / 人気で予約完売も、家系図も判明 |work=Akiba-PC.Watch.Impress.co.jp |date=2012-10-13 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yū and Ai were said to have a birthdate of 18 November 1996 ([[Windows CE]]'s release date) with age 15, with height of 152&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/hotline/20121027/etc_ms3.html |title=Windows 8の自作応援キャラ「窓辺ゆう」「窓辺あい」が正式デビュー、窓辺ななみもまだまだ活躍 |publisher=Akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp |date=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflicts with other back-story materials suggesting that Ai is the younger sister.

MasatakaP and Electrocutica produced a Windows 8 music video titled "Through the Window", featuring Madobe characters Nanami, Yū (in silhouette), and Claudia. The video was presented as the opening to Microsoft's keynote on the second day of Windows Developer Days in Japan.{{clarify|date=June 2018|What year?}}

In 2012 and 2013, Windows Navi+ (Techno-Alliance Corp.) also created separate Twitter accounts for Ai and Yū, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/wakiba/find/20130207_586583.html |title=「窓辺ゆう＆あい」がTwitterしてた、って知ってました？ （取材中に見つけた○○なもの） - AKIBA PC Hotline! |publisher=Akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/windows8_ai/status/261423998800384000 |title=Twitter / windows8_ai: はじめまして！Windows8かってに応援隊その２、窓辺あい |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/windows8_ai/status/291522828824625152 |title=Twitter / windows8_ai: .@windows8_yuu |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows 7===
Akiba PC reported that the first 7777 copies of Japanese [[Windows 7]] Ultimate DSP editions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305202459/http://www.windows7-mania.jp/ultimateorder_start.html|deadurl=no|

The character was designed by Wakaba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanator.com/the-os-war-is-won-windows-7-gets-officially-endorsed-os-tan-11521.phtml |title=The OS war is won! Windows 7 gets officially endorsed OS-tan |publisher=Japanator |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premium set includes a Windows 7 theme featuring 3 Nanami wallpapers, 19 event sound sets, CD with 5 extra Nanami sounds. Regular DSP edition includes a digest Windows 7 theme including a Nanami wallpaper, an event sound set; the preorder users can also download an extra Nanami wallpaper and 6 event sound sets. This makes it the first OS-''tan'' marketed by the company producing the operating system. In addition, the character also got its own [[Twitter]] account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/windows7_nanami/ |title=窓辺むつみ (windows7_nanami) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial sales event of the Windows 7 DSP edition, the official profile of the character has also been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ascii.jp/elem/000/000/470/470187/index-3.html |title=「Windows 7」DSP版が販売開始！ 深夜のアキバはお祭り騒ぎ (3/6) |publisher=Ascii.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Madobe Nanami was born in 1992-04-06 (release date of Windows 3.1) 17 years of age(at the time of release), who lives in [[Chiyoda, Tokyo]]. Nanami is among an extended family of 16 members, and she has elder brother named Goichi (吾一), elder sister named Mutsumi (むつみ), mother named Mikaho (美佳穗) from Madobe (窓辺) family, father named Kyuuachi (究八) from Shirato (白戸) family. Nanami and her cousin Claudia Madobe (クロード(蔵人)) later appeared in Microsoft's Cloud Girl comic strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/windowsazure/claudia00_01 |title=登場人物紹介 &amp;#124; クラウド ガール -窓と雲と碧い空 |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows Vista===
Windows Vista's most distinguishing characteristic is usually her horn-shaped pigtails (some variants have up to four pigtails) and [[heterochromia|heterochromatic eyes]]. Silver or white hair appears to be the most frequent, although light blue and black are also seen. A common costume design was a white and red [[sailor fuku]] and stockings. Since the release of more details about [[Windows Vista|Vista's]] interface, her look has changed slightly. A black maid's outfit is now emerging in popularity (which matches the new default Vista color scheme), as well as a circular Windows logo hair clip, identical to the new Start Menu button in Vista. There also seems to be a more finalized version who has a hair colour similar to that of Vista wallpapers, with a range from light blue, to yellow, to green. She also wears a type of long coat (which only covers her left and right sides) which are transparent to imitate that of the Aero glass effect.

===Windows XP===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[XP-tan]] --&gt;
XP-''tan'' is a dark-haired girl with ribbons in her hair and an "XP" hair ornament typically worn on the left side. As [[Windows XP]] is criticized for bloating a system and being very pretty without being as useful, XP-''tan'' is commonly depicted wearing tight clothing with big breasts. Additionally, as a reference to the memory usage of Windows XP, she is often seen eating or holding an empty [[donburi|rice bowl]] labeled "Memory". Some variants include a version for [[Windows XP|XP Home]] known as "Homeko" who has green hair which she wears in a short ponytail with two large XP-shaped hairclips that cover her ears, as well as a less common variation representing [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]]. The outfits worn by the two main variants are based on the loading lines at the Windows splash screen during startup.

===Windows 2000===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[2K-tan]] --&gt;
Although a few variants exist, the most common operating system represented is [[Windows 2000 Professional]]. She is typically drawn as an intelligent, professional, reserved looking woman with short [[blue hair]], [[meganekko|glasses]], and hair clips that resemble cat ears flanking a small white bonnet or ruffle, similar to a maid's bonnet, that shows the Windows logo. Her outfit resembles a swimsuit suggesting the Windows logo colors worn with long blue coat, alluding to the popular opinion that [[Windows 2000]] is the most stable and dependable of the Windows operating systems. Due to the greater stability of Win2K compared with WinME, which was released near 2000, 2K-''tan'' is often described as the guardian of ME-''tan''. The particular shade of blue used in most drawings is similar to the default Windows 2000 desktop color.

===Windows ME===
The design of ME-''tan'', the personification of [[Windows Me]], is very much in line with the Japanese concept of [[kawaii]] or cuteness.  Her design has changed little from the artist's original designs and is depicted with green hair in long pigtails wearing a maid outfit with a "[[Exclamation mark|!]]" badge on the front reminiscent of the Windows Me Active Desktop Recovery screen, often shown after rebooting from a system crash in Me. While she is considered to be a hard worker, webcomics often depict her failing at anything she tries to do, often literally crashing and irritating her sisters. When she is not frozen or out of control, she tends to do things showing a lack of common sense or knowledge, such as putting a soda can into a microwave oven or defending herself by swinging a [[Welsh onion]].
{{clear|left}}

===Windows 98 and 98SE===
While many variations exist the most common depiction of the [[Windows 98]] operating systems is a pair of young girls. The OS-''tan'' representative of the original release of Windows 98 is shown in a white and blue uniform that includes the Windows logo as part of a neck tie, navy blue hair, and a "98" hair clip. The [[Windows 98 Second Edition]] OS-''tan'' is similar in appearance, but wears a green sailor school uniform with the letters "SE" on the front. Two early representations that are also seen are a pair of stick-limbed [[Pocky]] boxes with a face and version number drawn in crayon. This is a reference to Vulcan 300, a character from the ''[[Zatch Bell!]]'' anime series. These early representations are still used as a [[mecha]] piloted by the girls, dolls carried by the girls, or sometimes even as hiding places for them.

===Windows 95===
As [[Windows 95]] is considered to be the oldest of the modern 32-bit Windows operating systems, it is usually represented as a traditional lady from the early modern era of Japan. She is typically depicted as a gentle-looking [[Brunette|brown]] haired woman in a [[kimono]], with a hair ribbon showing the four Windows colors. Her outfit is a traditional kimono and a [[hakama]] of Japan and she wears thick sandals, or [[Geta (footwear)|geta]], on her feet. These were a woman college student's typical clothes as seen in the earliest period during the course of the modernization in Japan (from the [[Meiji period]] to the [[Taishō period]]) and is a reference to the modernization of Windows in comparison to the modernization of Japan. Additionally, the pattern of her kimono is based on the file "hana256.bmp", which was used as a desktop wallpaper pattern in the Japanese version of Windows. She is typically depicted as engaged in drinking [[tea]], [[cooking|serving meals]] or doing other [[housekeeping|housework]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} One recurring theme in stories is her unfamiliarity with newer, post Win-95 technologies, such as [[USB]] devices (even though the OSR 2.x supported it) and [[Broadband Internet access|broadband internet]] connections. She is also occasionally depicted wielding a [[katana]] in an aggressive manner, symbolizing that it was with her generation of operating systems that Microsoft finally achieved full dominance of the personal computer market.

===Windows 3.1===

[[Windows 3.1]] is a short girl with long silver hair, a long light purple dress, and a large purple bow on her head. She is often seen carrying a small, black cat on her head as well. She acts as a servant, or a [[maid]] of some sort, who serves and tends to DOS-''tan''. This is a reference to the fact that Windows 3.1 is not a full operating system, but rather just a GUI for [[MS-DOS]].

===Mac OS X===
[[File:OSX-tan.svg|thumb|Mac OS X Leopard-''tan'']]
The [[Mac OS X]] girl is often portrayed as a [[catgirl]], following with the Apple "wild cat" naming tradition (every Mac OS X release until [[OS X Mavericks]] had a codename like Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Snow Leopard, etc.). Otherwise, she is shown as an older variation of the [[Mac OS 9]] girl, wearing a white coat and wearing an [[AirPort]] wireless hub fashioned as a hat. She is occasionally shown holding a publication of some sort, as Macs are often used for [[desktop publishing]].

===Linux===
[[File:Linux-tan closeup.gif|thumb|left|Linux-''tan'']]
Originally seen as a bearded [[penguin]] (a reference to [[Tux (mascot)|Tux]], the penguin mascot of the [[Linux]] kernel), an image of a girl with a helmet and flippers was chosen as a human alternative.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Her helmet (most likely a metaphor for the Linux kernel's oft-claimed excellent security) usually has horns on it, likely a reference to the [[GNU]] software which comprises the common system programs present in nearly all Linux distributions. The gear teeth on the helmet are a reference to [[KDE]], a common [[desktop environment]] used with GNU/Linux. The [[:Image:Gnomelogo.svg|foot symbol]] on her shirt is a reference to [[GNOME]], another common [[desktop environment]]. She is often seen with a [[spear]] that has flags attached representing the [[GRand Unified Bootloader|GRUB]], [[LILO (boot loader)|LILO]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] tools for Linux.

The artist who drew [[Konqi]], [[Tyson Tan]], submitted a mascot for [[LibreOffice]] during a contest run by [[The Document Foundation]] in late 2017. The mascot was not officially accepted by the foundation but has developed a [[fandom]] on [[8chan]] and [[reddit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TysonTanX/status/913430461866704896|title=LibreOffice contest entry|last=|first=|date=2017-09-28|website=Twitter|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://design.blog.documentfoundation.org/2017/11/13/mascot-iteration/|title=LibreOffice Mascot: Iterating the submissions|last=|first=|date=2017-11-13|website=The Document Foundation Blog|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MSX-DOS===
The [[MSX-DOS]] girl is often portrayed as a young but grey-haired girl carrying a large cartridge-shaped bag with an MSX-DOS logo on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coffeekan.xii.jp/konshu/img/msxdos.jpg |title=MSX-DOS image |publisher=Coffeekan.xii.jp |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is even a short game featuring this OS-''tan'' as player character. The bag this OS-''tan'' is often shown holding is cartridge-shaped, likely because MSXDOS2 required an cartridge with an extra 64 kB of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] in order to work.

===American -''tan''===
Some Americanized versions of Windows related OS-''tan'', named XP-USA, Me-USA, and 2K-USA, were published in the Ohzora's FanBook in a comic strip named "Trouble Windows in USA", by Saint Muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ostan-collections.net/imeeji/displayimage.php?album=35&amp;pos=138 |title=Comics - 1113152962903 |work=OS-tan Collections Gallery |date=2012 |access-date=2013-12-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120401205504/http://ostan-collections.net/imeeji/displayimage.php?album=35&amp;pos=138 |archive-date=2012-04-01 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Optical Storage Technology Association''' (OSTA) is an international [[trade association]] which promotes the use of recordable optical technologies and products, and most notably it is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] specification. Representing more than 85 percent of worldwide writable optical product shipment's manufacturers and resellers, it was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1992.

In the autumn of 2007, OSTA spearheaded a campaign to encourage families and photographers to back up their digital photographs on compact discs. Since it is estimated that one out of seven computer hard drives "crash" within the first year,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} OSTA believes it is dangerous to merely rely on storing irreplaceable pictures on a hard drive alone.

[[File:Pierre de Caters 1910.jpg|thumb]]
'''Baron Pierre de Caters''' ([[Berchem]], 25 December 1875 &amp;ndash; [[Paris]], 21 March 1944) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[adventurer]], [[aviator]] and [[auto racing|car]] and [[motorboat racing|motorboat racer]]. In 1908, he was the [[Aviation history|first Belgian to fly an aircraft]].&lt;!-- Jeez, learn to write. As written, it meant he was the first in 1908 to do it...--&gt;

[[Image:De Caters Antwerp Flying Week.jpg|thumb|De Caters' Voisin at Antwerp Aviation Week 1909.]]

He was also the first Belgian to receive a pilot's license from the Belgian air club on 2 December 1909 and received a gold medal for the first kilometer in the same year. He was the first aircraft manufacturer in Belgium and the first instructor of military aviation. He also took part in car and motorboat races in Belgium and France. 

In 1904, he briefly held the [[land speed record]], driving a [[Mercedes Simplex|DMG Mercedes Simplex]] at {{convert|97.25|mph|abbr=on}} on a {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} beach course in [[Ostend]], Belgium. 

In [[World War I]] he joined Belgian military aviation, commanding the flying school of [[Étampes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stelling.nl/followup/blikscaters.htm FollowUp - Kleintje Actueel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923075503/http://www.stelling.nl/followup/blikscaters.htm |date=23 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journey to India==
On 16 November 1910, de Caters embarked to India with two Aviator airplanes. He was accompanied by [[Jules Tyck]], another Belgian pilot.
[[Image:RMM Brussel de Caters IV 3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Replica in the Royal Military Museum (Brussels) of the Voisin de Caters IV]]

The city of [[Bombay]] refused the organization of an aviation meeting. Then the two airmen traveled to [[Calcutta]] with their aircraft crated. In Calcutta, de Caters flew several times from the Club of [[Tollygunge]]. On 21 December, he flew for 27 minutes with Mrs. Sen Beil, sister of the [[Maharaja]] of [[Cooch Behar]] as passenger. One of the Aviators was damaged by fire. On 2 February 1911, de Caters and Tyck flew in [[Bangalore]]. They were received by the Maharaja of [[Mysore]]. From 16–18 February, Pierre flew from [[Secunderabad]] in the [[Hyderabad state]]. The Indian tour was completed and Pierre de Caters returned to Europe. A little later Aviator was dissolved and the baron would not take part in competitions any more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">'''Project CHATTER''' was a [[United States Navy]] program beginning in the fall of 1947 focusing on the identification and testing of drugs in interrogations and the recruitment of agents. Their search included laboratory experiments on both animal and human subjects. The program operated under the direction of Charles Savage of the [[Naval Medical Research Institute]], [[Bethesda, Maryland]], from 1947 to 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblackvault.com/documents/biologicalweapons/chatter/navychatter.pdf FOIA Documents from the Department of the Navy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeeShlain1985"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin A.

The project was centered on, but not restricted to, the use of [[anabasine]] (an [[alkaloid]]), [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] and [[mescaline]]. The program ended shortly after the [[Korean War]] in 1953, presumably due to limited progress and the success of other projects.

[[Image:Solid_oxide_fuel_cell_protonic.svg|thumb|Scheme of a proton conducting fuel cell]]

A '''protonic ceramic fuel cell''' or '''PCFC''' is a [[fuel cell]] based on a ceramic electrolyte material that exhibits high protonic conductivity at elevated temperatures.

PCFCs share the thermal and kinetic advantages of high temperature operation at 700 degrees Celsius with [[Molten carbonate fuel cell|molten carbonate]] and [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s, while exhibiting all of the intrinsic benefits of proton conduction in [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s (PEMFC) and [[phosphoric acid fuel cell]]s (PAFC). The high [[operating temperature]] is necessary to achieve very high electrical fuel efficiency with hydrocarbon fuels. PCFCs can operate at high temperatures and electrochemically oxidize fossil fuels directly to the anode. This eliminates the intermediate step of producing hydrogen through the costly reforming process. Gaseous molecules of the hydrocarbon fuel are absorbed on the surface of the anode in the presence of water vapor, and hydrogen atoms are efficiently stripped off to be absorbed into the electrolyte, with [[carbon dioxide]] as the primary reaction product. PCFCs have a solid electrolyte, so that the membrane cannot dry out as with PEM fuel cells, and liquid cannot leak out as with PAFCs.

[[Colorado School of Mines]] is primarily researching this type of fuel cell.

[[Image:Potato-ricer.jpg|thumb|right|A hand-held potato ricer.]]
'''Ricing''' is a [[cooking]] term meaning to pass food through a [[food mill]] or "ricer", which comes in several forms. In the most basic, food is pushed or pressured through a metal or plastic plate with many small holes, producing a smoother result than mashing, but coarser than [[purée|pureeing]] or passing through a [[sieve]] or [[tamis]].  The size of the product produced by ricing is about the same as grains of [[rice]]. 

[[Potato]]es are the most commonly "riced" foods, as in the dish riced potatoes, essentially a smoother version of [[mashed potatoes]].  However, other vegetables can be 'riced' in order to provide low glycemic, nutrient-rich vegetable dishes, either cooked or raw, with or without sauces and herbs, or in salads.  Cooking artfully 'riced' cauliflower, then mashing it before serving, provides a more health-supporting vegetable dish that looks like mashed potatoes but isn't.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/healthy-cauliflower-rice-3363582 Healthy Cauliflower Rice. Food Network Kitchen.

Demonstrates with photos the process of ricing cauliflower. Accessed June 30, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[potato ricer]] tool forces vegetables, such as potatoes, through a sheet of small holes.  It differs in function somewhat from a [[food mill]], which is larger and not held in one hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kitchenboy.net/blog/food-mill-versus-potato-ricer/ Food Mill Versus Potato Ricer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23465">'''RoboCup''' is an annual international [[robotics competition]] proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|citeseerx = 10.1.1.49.7511|title=RoboCup: The Robot World Cup Initiative|publisher=RoboCup|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and founded in 1996 (Pre-RoboCup) by a group of university professors (among which [[Hiroaki Kitano]], [[Manuela M. Veloso]], and Minoru Asada). The aim of such a competition consists of promoting robotics and AI research, by offering a publicly appealing, but formidable challenge.

“Competition pushes advances in technologies. What we learn from robots playing soccer or navigating a maze can be applied to industry and help us solve difficult real-world problems,” according to Professor Maurice Pagnucco, Head of the School of Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://businesseventssydney.com.au/media/latest-news/australia-faces-robot-invasion-in-2019/|title=RoboCup 2019|last=Pagnucco|first=Professor Maurice|date=|website=Business Events Sydney|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''RoboCup'' is a contraction of the competition's full name, "Robot Soccer [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]", but there are many other stages of the competition such as "RoboCupRescue", "RoboCup@Home" and "RoboCupJunior". In 2016, the world's competition was held in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/news/news/robocup-wm-2016-kommt-nach-leipzig/|title=RoboCup WM 2016 kommt nach Leipzig - Stadt Leipzig|website=www.leipzig.de|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; RoboCup 2017 was held in [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robocup.org/events/events-2017/|title=Events-2017 «  RoboCup|website=www.robocup.org|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Itsuki Noda&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://staff.aist.go.jp/i.noda/index.en.html|title=NODA, Itsuki's homepage|website=staff.aist.go.jp|language=ja-JP|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the current president of RoboCup since 2014.

The official goal of the project:
:"By the middle of the 21st century, a team of fully [[wikt:Autonomy|autonomous]] [[humanoid]] [[robot soccer]] players shall win a [[soccer]] game, complying with the official rules of [[FIFA]], against the winner of the most recent [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robocup.org/objective/|title=RoboCup: Objective|publisher=RoboCup|year=1998|accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The formal RoboCup was preceded by the (often unacknowledged) first [[International Micro Robot World Cup Soccer Tournament]] (MIROSOT) held by [[KAIST]] in [[Taejon]], [[Korea]], in November 1996.  This was won by an American team from [[Newton Labs]], and the competition was shown on [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtonlabs.com/soccer/&lt;/ref&gt;

It states that dualization and [[discretization]] are, in general, non-commutative operations. The operations can be made commutative by an application of the [[covector mapping principle]].&lt;ref name="RK"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = I. M. | last2 = Karpenko | first2 = M. | year = 2012 | title = A Review of Pseudospectral Optimal Control: From Theory to Flight | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367578812000375 | journal = Annual Reviews in Control | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 182–197 | doi=10.1016/j.arcontrol.2012.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the theory==
A continuous-time optimal control problem is information rich.  A number of interesting properties of a given problem can be derived by applying the [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]] or the [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]]s.  These theories implicitly use the continuity of time in their derivation.&lt;ref name ="mord" &gt;B. S. Mordukhovich, Variational Analysis and Generalized Differentiation: Basic Theory, Vol.330 of Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences] Series, Springer, Berlin, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 
When an optimal control problem is discretized, the Ross–Fahroo lemma asserts that there is a fundamental loss of information.  This loss of information can be in the primal variables as in the value of the control at one or both of the boundary points&lt;ref name="FR1"&gt;
F. Fahroo and I. M. Ross, Pseudospectral Methods for Infinite Horizon Nonlinear Optimal Control Problems, AIAA Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference, August 15–18, 2005, San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="FR2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahroo | first1 = F. | last2 = Ross | first2 = I. M. | year = 2008 | title = Pseudospectral Methods for Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control Problems | url = | journal = Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 927–936 | doi=10.2514/1.33117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
or in the dual variables as in the value of the Hamiltonian over the time horizon. To address the information loss, Ross and Fahroo introduced the concept of closure conditions which allow the known information loss to be put back in. This is done by an application of the [[covector mapping principle]].&lt;ref name="RK" /&gt;

==Applications to pseudospectral optimal control==
When pseudospectral methods are applied to discretize optimal control problems, the implications of the Ross–Fahroo lemma 
appear in the form of the discrete covectors seemingly being discretized by the transpose of the differentiation matrix.&lt;ref name = "RF01" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "RF1" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "RF3" /&gt;
When the [[covector mapping principle]] is applied, it reveals the proper transformation for the adjoints.  Application of the transformation generates the [[Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral method]]s.&lt;ref name="hawkins-mit"&gt;A. M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3138">'''SAE J300''' is a standard that defines the [[viscometric]] properties of mono- and multigrade [[engine oil]]s, maintained by [[SAE International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = SAE International | title = J300 Engine Oil Viscosity Classification | url = https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j300_201501/ | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key parameters for engine oil viscometrics are the oil's [[kinematic viscosity]], its high temperature-high shear viscosity measured by the [[tapered bearing simulator]], and low temperature properties measured by the [[cold-cranking simulator]] and [[mini-rotary viscometer]]. This standard is commonly used throughout the world, and standards organizations that do so include [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] and [[ILSAC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = American Petroleum Institute | url = http://www.api.org/~/media/files/certification/engine-oil-diesel/publications/mom_guide_english_2013.pdf | title = Motor oil matters - Which oil is right for you? | year = 2013 | accessdate = 2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Association des Constructeurs Européens d'Automobiles|ACEA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = ACEA | title = ACEA European Oil Sequences | year = 2016 | url = http://www.acea.be/uploads/news_documents/ACEA_European_oil_sequences_2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viscosity grades==
SAE viscosity grades include 0W through 25W in increments of 5W, and 4 through 16 in increments of 4, and 20 through 60 in increments of 10. The former grades denote a multigrade engine oil's low-temperature properties (W denoting "winter"), whereas the latter grades denote an engine oil's properties at the operating temperature of an engine. To illustrate, a lawnmower may require SAE 30 monograde engine oil that must meet the SAE 30 requirements. In comparison, a contemporary passenger car engine may require SAE 0W-20 multigrade engine oil that must meet both the SAE 0W and SAE 20 requirements. 

The addition of the SAE 8 through SAE 16 viscosity grades permit improved fuel economy through reduced [[hydrodynamic friction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | author = Patrick Ponticel | url = http://articles.sae.org/11945/ | publisher = SAE International| title = SAE codifies new oil viscosity grade (SAE 16) | date = 2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Lubes 'n' Greases | url = https://pubs.lubesngreases.com/lubereport-asia/4_16/specs/JAMA-Proposes-SAE-0W-8-Spec-11917-1.html | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | date = 2017-04-18 | title = JAMA Proposes SAE 0W-8 Spec | author = Steve Swedberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scandinavian design''' is a [[design]] movement characterized by simplicity, [[minimalism]] and functionality that emerged in the early 20th century, and which flourished in the 1950s, in the five [[Nordic countries]] of [[Danish design|Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's The Deal With Scandinavian Furniture?|url=https://emfurn.com/blogs/elite-modern-furniture-blog/whats-the-deal-with-scandinavian-furniture|website=EMFURN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the Danish ''Selskabet for Dekorativ Kunst'' (Company for Decorative Arts) launched its ''{{ill |Skønvirke |da}}'' (literally "Graceful Work") magazine. Its title became the name of a new Danish style of arts and crafts, to rival [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Jugendstil]].&lt;ref name=Rekkali&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rekkali |first1=Zeynep |title=Danish Design: The birth, rise, fall and resurrection |url=https://danish.tm/article/danish-design-birth-rise-fall-resurrection/ |publisher=Danish |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s, designers such as [[Alvar Aalto]] (furniture, textiles),&lt;ref name=SD&gt;{{cite web |title=Scandinavian design |url=https://www.scandinavia-design.fr/design-scandinave_en.html |publisher=Scandinavia design |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arne Jacobsen]] (chairs),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Borge Mogensen]] (furniture),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Hans J. Wegner]] (chairs),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Verner Panton]] (plastic chairs),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Poul Henningsen]] (lamps),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; and [[Maija Isola]] (printed textiles)&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; helped to create a "golden age of Scandinavian design".&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;&lt;!--please do not add anything here without citing a reliable source, it will be removed: and this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of every early designer, either, but a brief overview, so the list is long enough already--&gt;

The [[Lunning Prize]], awarded to outstanding Scandinavian designers between 1951 and 1970, was instrumental in making Scandinavian design a recognized commodity, and in defining its profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krondahl |first1=Hans |title=Tema Lunning Prize winners |url=http://runeberg.org/tema/lunning.html |publisher=Runeberg |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the [[Brooklyn Museum]] held its "Design in Scandinavia" exhibition, and a fashion for "Scandinavian Modern" furniture began in America.&lt;ref name=Rekkali/&gt;{{sfn|Englund|Schmidt|Wood|2007}}{{sfn|Halén|Wickman|2003}} Scandinavian design is by no means limited to furniture and household goods. It has been applied to industrial design, such as of consumer electronics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ingdal |first1=Cecilie |title=Let there be light |url=https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/stories/cecilie-ingdal |publisher=[[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobile phones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The new old principles of HMD's #Nokia design |url=http://nokiamob.net/2017/08/15/the-new-old-principles-of-hmds-nokia-design/ |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=3 January 2018 |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Gavin |title=Designed to Delight |url=https://www.volvocars.com/intl/cars/new-models/xc60/stories/scandinavian-design |publisher=[[Volvo]] |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Scandinavian design has been the subject of scholarly debate, exhibitions and marketing agendas since the 1950s. Many emphasize the democratic design ideals that were a central theme of the movement and are reflected in the rhetoric surrounding contemporary Scandinavian and international design. Others, however, have analyzed the reception of Scandinavian design abroad, seeing in it a form of myth-making and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leary, Erin |title='The Total Absence of Foreign Subjects': The Racial Politics of US Interwar Exhibitions of Scandinavian Design |journal=Design and Culture |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=283–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Denmark===
{{main|Danish design}}

Danish Design is a style of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century. Influenced by the German [[Bauhaus]] school, many [[Danish people|Danish]] designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have become iconic and are still in use and production, such as [[Arne Jacobsen]]'s 1958 [[Egg (chair)|Egg chair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Chair|url=http://www.aram.co.uk/egg-chair.html|publisher=Aram|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poul Henningsen]]'s 1926 [[PH-lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  title=The PH lamp |  publisher=Visit Denmark |  deadurl=yes |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215054112/http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  archivedate=2012-02-15 |  df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]], conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design. The emphasis was on furniture but [[architecture]], silver, ceramics, [[glass]] and textiles also benefitted from the trend. Denmark's [[late industrialisation]] combined with a tradition of high-quality [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] formed the basis of gradual progress towards industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.netpublikationer.dk/UM/8584/pdf/Furniture20and20Indust43D234.pdf | title=Furniture and Industrial Design | publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Denmark| accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===In Iceland===

Design in Iceland is a relatively young tradition, starting in the 1950s but now growing rapidly. The country's limited options for manufacturing and its constrained choice of materials have both forced designers to be innovative, though wool remains a staple material, whether felted or knitted. Iceland's Museum of Design and Applied Art, aiming to record Icelandic design from 1900 onwards, opened in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design and Architecture {{!}} General information |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDICDESIGN/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iceland Academy of the Arts was also founded in 1998, soon followed by  its Faculty of Architecture and Design, which has promoted a distinctively Icelandic character in the nation's design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iceland Design Centre |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDDESIGNCENTRE/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

Swedish design is considered minimalist, with an emphasis on functionality and simple clean lines. This has applied especially to furniture. Sweden is known for traditional crafts including glass and [[Sami people|Sami]] handicrafts. Swedish design was pioneered by [[Anders Beckman]] (graphics), [[Bruno Mathsson]] (furniture), [[Märta Måås-Fjetterström]] and [[Astrid Sampe]] (textile), and [[Sixten Sason]] (industrial). Organisations that promote design in Sweden are [[Svensk Form]], the Swedish society of crafts and design, founded in 1845; the [[Swedish Industrial Design Foundation]], known as SVID; the [[Swedish Arts Council]]; and the [[Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design]] (known as ArkDes) on the island of [[Skeppsholmen]] in Stockholm, beside the [[Moderna Museet|modern art museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stylish functionality |url=https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/swedish-design/|publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 4 November 1869]]
In [[academic publishing]], a '''scientific journal''' is a [[periodical publication]] intended to further the progress of [[science]], usually by reporting new [[research]].

==Content==
Articles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as students, researchers and professors instead of professional journalists. There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see [[list of scientific journals]]). Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' publish articles and [[scientific paper]]s across a wide range of scientific fields. Scientific journals contain articles that have been [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]]ed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Although scientific journals are superficially similar to [[professional]] [[magazine]]s, they are actually quite different. Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine. The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the [[scientific method]]. If they are describing experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results. Each such journal article becomes part of the permanent scientific record.

==Scope==
Articles in scientific journals can be used in research and higher education. Scientific articles allow researchers to keep up to date with the developments of their field and direct their own research. An essential part of a scientific article is citation of earlier work. The impact of articles and journals is often assessed by counting citations ([[citation impact]]). Some classes are partially devoted to the explication of classic articles, and [[seminar]] classes can consist of the presentation by each student of a classic or current paper. Schoolbooks and textbooks have been written usually only on established topics, while the latest research and more obscure topics are only accessible through scientific articles. In a scientific research group or [[academic department]] it is usual for the content of current scientific journals to be discussed in [[journal club]]s. Public funding bodies often require the results to be published in scientific journals. Academic credentials for promotion into academic ranks are established in large part by the number and impact of scientific articles published. Many doctoral programs allow for [[thesis by publication]], where the candidate is required to publish a certain number of scientific articles.

==Wording==
Articles tend to be highly technical, representing the latest theoretical research and experimental results in the field of science covered by the journal. They are often incomprehensible to anyone except for researchers in the field and advanced students. In some subjects this is inevitable given the nature of the content. Usually, rigorous rules of [[scientific writing]] are enforced by the editors; however, these rules may vary from journal to journal, especially between journals from different publishers. Articles are usually either original articles reporting completely new results or reviews of current literature. There are also scientific publications that bridge the gap between articles and books by publishing thematic volumes of chapters from different authors. Many journals have a regional focus, specializing in publishing papers from a particular geographic region, like ''[[African Invertebrates]]''.

== History ==
The history of scientific journals dates from 1665, when the French ''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' and the English ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' first began systematically publishing research results. Over a thousand, mostly [[ephemeral]], were founded in the 18th century, and the number has increased rapidly after that.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Kronick, ''History of Scientific and Technical Periodicals'', 2nd ed. Scarecrow, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to mid-20th century, [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]] was not always necessary, but gradually it became essentially compulsory.

== Publishing process ==
The authors of scientific articles are active researchers instead of journalists; typically, a graduate student or a researcher writes a paper with a professor. As such, the authors are unpaid and receive no compensation from the journal. However, their funding bodies may require them to publish in scientific journals. The paper is submitted to the journal office, where the '''editor''' considers the paper for appropriateness, potential scientific impact and novelty. If the journal's editor considers the paper appropriate, the paper is submitted to [[scholarly peer review]]. Depending on the field, journal and paper, the paper is sent to 1–3 '''reviewers''' for evaluation before they can be granted permission to publish. Reviewers are expected to check the paper for soundness of its scientific argument, i.e. if the data collected or considered in the paper support the conclusion offered. Novelty is also key: existing work must be appropriately considered and referenced, and new results improving on the state of the art presented. Reviewers are usually unpaid and not a part of the journal staff—instead, they should be "peers", i.e. researchers in the same field as the paper in question.

== Standards and impact ==
The standards that a journal uses to determine publication can vary widely. Some journals, such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[PNAS]]'', and ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', have a reputation of publishing articles that mark a fundamental breakthrough in their respective fields.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} In many fields, a formal or informal hierarchy of scientific journals exists; the most prestigious journal in a field tends to be the most selective in terms of the articles it will select for publication, and usually will also have the highest [[impact factor]]. In some countries, journal rankings can be utilized for funding decisions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/publication-forum/background|title=Background - julkaisufoorumi.fi|author=|date=|website=julkaisufoorumi.fi|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930090021/http://www.julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/publication-forum/background|archivedate=30 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even evaluation of individual researchers, although they are poorly suited for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/evaluations/faq|title=FAQ - julkaisufoorumi.fi|author=|date=|website=julkaisufoorumi.fi|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127065227/http://www.julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/evaluations/faq|archivedate=27 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproducibility and Replicability ==
For scientific journal [[Reproducibility]] and [[Replicability]] are core concepts that allow other scientist to check and reproduce the results under the same conditions mentioned in the paper or at least similar conditions and produce similar results with similar [[measurements]] of the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] or carried out under changed conditions of measurement.

==Types of articles==
{{further information|Scientific paper}}
{{see also|Academic publishing#Categories of papers{{!}}Categories of academic articles}}

[[File:1665 phil trans vol i title.png|thumb|Cover of the first volume of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', the first journal in the world exclusively devoted to science]]

There are several types of journal articles; the exact terminology and definitions vary by field and specific journal, but often include:
*'''Letters''' (also called ''communications'', and not to be confused with ''letters to the editor'') are short descriptions of important current research findings that are usually fast-tracked for immediate publication because they are considered urgent.
*'''Research notes''' are short descriptions of current research findings that are considered less urgent or important than ''Letters''.
*'''Articles''' are usually between five and twenty pages and are complete descriptions of current original research findings, but there are considerable variations between scientific fields and journals—80-page articles are not rare in [[mathematics]] or [[theoretical computer science]].
*'''Supplemental articles''' contain a large volume of tabular [[data]] that is the result of current research and may be dozens or hundreds of pages with mostly numerical data. Some journals now only publish this data electronically on the Internet. Supplemental information also contains other voluminous material not appropriate for the main body of the article, like descriptions of routine procedures, derivations of equations, source code, non-essential data, spectra or other such miscellaneous information.
*'''[[Review article]]s''' do not cover original research but rather accumulate the results of many different ''articles'' on a particular topic into a coherent narrative about the state of the art in that field. Review articles provide information about the topic and also provide journal references to the original research. Reviews may be entirely narrative, or may provide quantitative summary estimates resulting from the application of [[meta-analysis|meta-analytical methods]].
*'''[[Data paper]]s''' are articles dedicated to describe datasets. This type of article is becoming popular and journals exclusively dedicated to them have been established, e.g. ''[[Scientific_Data_(journal)|Scientific Data]]'' and ''[[Earth_Observation|Earth System Science Data]]''.
*'''[[Video paper]]s''' are a recent addition to practice of scientific publications. They most often combine an online video demonstration of a new technique or protocol combined with a rigorous textual description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jove.com/|title=JoVE - Peer Reviewed Scientific Video Journal - Methods and Protocols|author=|date=|website=www.jove.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322165712/https://www.jove.com/|archivedate=22 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videonauka.ru/|title=Научный журнал "Видеонаука"|date=|website=Scientific journal "Videonauka"|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184031/http://videonauka.ru/|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formats of journal articles vary, but many follow the general [[IMRAD]] scheme recommended by the [[International Committee of Medical Journal Editors]]. Such articles begin with an ''[[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]'', which is a one-to-four-paragraph summary of the paper. The ''introduction'' describes the background for the research including a discussion of similar research. The ''materials and methods'' or ''experimental'' section provides specific details of how the research was conducted. The ''results and discussion'' section describes the outcome and implications of the research, and the ''conclusion'' section places the research in context and describes avenues for further exploration.

In addition to the above, some scientific journals such as ''Science'' will include a news section where scientific developments (often involving political issues) are described. These articles are often written by science journalists and not by scientists. In addition, some journals will include an editorial section and a section for letters to the editor. While these are articles published within a journal, in general they are not regarded as scientific journal articles because they have not been peer-reviewed.

==Electronic publishing==
{{Main article|Eprint|Electronic article|Electronic journal}}
Electronic publishing is a new area of information [[dissemination]]. One definition of electronic publishing is in the context of the scientific journal. It is the presentation of scholarly scientific results in only an electronic (non-paper) form. This is from its first write-up, or creation, to its publication or dissemination. The electronic scientific journal is specifically designed to be presented on the internet. It is defined as not being previously printed material adapted, or retooled, and then delivered electronically.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;&lt;ref name= Boyce-Dalterio/&gt;

Electronic publishing will exist alongside paper publishing, because printed paper publishing is not expected to disappear in the future. Output to a screen is important for browsing and searching but is not well adapted for extensive reading. Paper copies of selected information will definitely be required{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Therefore, the article has to be transmitted electronically to the reader's local printer. Formats suitable both for reading on paper, and for manipulation by the reader's computer will need to be integrated.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;&lt;ref name= Boyce-Dalterio/&gt; Many journals are electronically available in formats readable on screen via [[web browsers]], as well as in portable document format [[PDF]], suitable for printing and storing on a local desktop or laptop computer. New tools such as [[JATS]] and [[Utopia Documents]] provide a 'bridge' to the 'web-versions' in that they connect the content in PDF versions directly to the [[WorldWideWeb]] via hyperlinks that are created 'on-the-fly'. The PDF version of an article is usually seen as the version of record, but the matter is subject to some debate.&lt;ref name="Pettifer 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Pettifer, S. |author2=McDermott, P. |author3=Marsh, J. |author4=Thorne, D. |author5=Villeger, A. |author6=Attwood, T.K. |title=Ceci n'est pas un hamburger: modelling and representing the scholarly article |journal=Learned Publishing |year=2011 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=207–220 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/alpsp/lp/2011/00000024/00000003/art00009 |doi=10.1087/20110309 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021094618/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/alpsp/lp/2011/00000024/00000003/art00009 |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic counterparts of established print journals already promote and deliver rapid dissemination of peer reviewed and edited, "published" articles. Other journals, whether spin-offs of established print journals, or created as electronic only, have come into existence promoting the rapid dissemination capability, and availability, on the Internet. In tandem with this is the speeding up of peer review, copyediting, page makeup, and other steps in the process to support rapid dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/148/WP02-12B.html;jsessionid=8E99F087A1E6FFEC3DBC59015C33BAF1|title=The Internet and the Velocity of Scholarly Journal Publishing|last=Swygart-Hobaugh|first=Rob Kling, Amanda J.|website=scholarworks.iu.edu|access-date=2016-10-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027060130/https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/148/WP02-12B.html;jsessionid=8E99F087A1E6FFEC3DBC59015C33BAF1|archivedate=2016-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other improvements, benefits and unique values of electronically publishing the scientific journal are easy availability of supplementary materials (data, graphics and video), lower cost, and availability to more people, especially scientists from non-developed countries. Hence, research results from more developed nations are becoming more accessible to scientists from non-developed countries.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;

Moreover, electronic publishing of scientific journals has been accomplished without compromising the standards of the refereed, [[peer review]] process.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;

One form is the online equivalent of the conventional paper journal. By 2006, almost all scientific journals have, while retaining their peer-review process, established electronic versions; a number have moved entirely to electronic publication. In similar manner, most academic libraries buy the electronic version, and purchase a paper copy only for the most important or most-used titles.

There is usually a delay of several months after an article is written before it is published in a journal, making paper journals not an ideal format for announcing the latest research. Many journals now publish the final papers in their electronic version as soon as they are ready, without waiting for the assembly of a complete issue, as is necessary with paper. In many fields in which even greater speed is wanted, such as [[physics]], the role of the journal at disseminating the latest research has largely been replaced by [[preprint]] databases such as [[arXiv.org]]. Almost all such articles are eventually published in traditional journals, which still provide an important role in [[quality control]], archiving papers, and establishing scientific credit.

==Cost==
{{main article|Academic publishing#Publishers and business aspects}}
{{see also|Academic journal#Costs}}

Many scientists and librarians have long protested the cost of journals, especially as they see these payments going to large for-profit publishing houses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmm-online.com/channel/elsevier-begins-outreach-as-push-back-on-publisher-threatens-to-widen/article/225855/|title=Elsevier begins outreach as push-back on publisher threatens to widen|last=Weinstein|first=Deborah|date=1 Feb 2012|website=MM&amp;M|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215023645/https://www.mmm-online.com/channel/elsevier-begins-outreach-as-push-back-on-publisher-threatens-to-widen/article/225855/|archivedate=2018-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. To allow their researchers online access to journals, many universities purchase ''site licenses'', permitting access from anywhere in the university, and, with appropriate authorization, by university-affiliated users at home or elsewhere. These may be quite expensive, sometimes much more than the cost for a print subscription, although this may reflect the number of people who will be using the license—while a print subscription is the cost for one person to receive the journal; a site-license can allow thousands of people to gain access.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Publications by [[scholarly societies]], also known as not-for-profit-publishers, usually cost less than commercial publishers, but the prices of their scientific journals are still usually several thousand dollars a year. In general, this money is used to fund the activities of the scientific societies that run such journals, or is invested in providing further scholarly resources for scientists; thus, the money remains in and benefits the scientific sphere.

Despite the transition to electronic publishing, the [[serials crisis]] persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Harvard University says it can't afford journal publishers' prices |first=Ian |last=Sample |journal=The Guardian |date=24 April 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207164109/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices |archivedate=7 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about cost and open access have led to the creation of free-access journals such as the [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS) family and partly open or reduced-cost journals such as the ''[[Journal of High Energy Physics]]''. However, professional editors still have to be paid, and PLoS still relies heavily on donations from foundations to cover the majority of its operating costs; smaller journals do not often have access to such resources.

Based on statistical arguments, it has been shown that electronic [[publishing]] online, and to some extent [[open access]], both provide wider dissemination and increase the average number of citations an article receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ |title=Online Or Invisible? |authorlink=Steve Lawrence (computer scientist) |first=Steve |last=Lawrence |publisher=[[NEC Research Institute]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316145522/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ |archivedate=2007-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
Traditionally, the author of an article was required to transfer the [[copyright]] to the journal publisher. Publishers claimed this was necessary in order to protect authors' rights, and to coordinate permissions for reprints or other use. However, many authors, especially those active in the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement, found this unsatisfactory,&lt;ref name=Di_Cosmo&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have used their influence to effect a gradual move towards a license to publish instead. Under such a system, the publisher has permission to edit, print, and distribute the article commercially, but the authors retain the other rights themselves.

Even if they retain the copyright to an article, most journals allow certain rights to their authors. These rights usually include the ability to reuse parts of the paper in the author's future work, and allow the author to distribute a limited number of copies. In the print format, such copies are called reprints; in the electronic format, they are called [[postprints]]. Some publishers, for example the [[American Physical Society]], also grant the author the right to post and update the article on the author's or employer's website and on free e-print servers, to grant permission to others to use or reuse figures, and even to reprint the article as long as no fee is charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forms.aps.org/author/copyfaq.html |title=APS Copyright Policies and Frequently Asked Questions |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009083902/http://forms.aps.org/author/copyfaq.html |archivedate=2006-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of open access journals, in which the author retains the copyright but must pay a publication charge, such as the [[Public Library of Science]] family of journals, is another recent response to copyright concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://io9.gizmodo.com/5796054/is-it-time-to-end-copyright-for-scientific-journals Is it time to end copyright for scientific journals?] Gizmodo, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spar and Membrane Structure''' (SMS) is a type of wall construction in which lightly reinforced 2" - 3" [5&amp;nbsp;cm - 8&amp;nbsp;cm] of [[shotcrete]] or [[gunite]] skins (membranes) are interconnected with extended “X” shaped light [[rebar]] (spars) through the interior of the wall. Typically, SMS construction uses straw bales as leave in [[formwork]] for the concrete skins with the spars placed at the head of each bale, however, many other types of formwork could be used in place of straw bales. The SMS system was invented and patented by R. Gary Black, an [[engineer]] and professor of [[architecture]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Gary, and Mannik, Henri, “Spar and Membrane Structure” The Last Straw journal, #17, Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''steel building''' is a metal [[structure]] fabricated with [[steel]] for the internal support and for exterior cladding, as opposed to [[steel frame]]d buildings which generally use other materials for floors, walls, and external envelope.  Steel buildings are used for a variety of purposes including storage, work spaces and living accommodation.  They are classified into specific types depending on how they are used.

==History==
[[File:Basílica de San Sebastián, (Agustinos Recoletos) Manila, Filipinas..jpg|thumb|The [[Basilica of San Sebastian, Manila|Minor Basilica of San Sebastián]] (1891) in Manila]]
Steel buildings first gained popularity in the early 20th century.  Their use became more widespread during [[World War II]] and significantly expanded after the war when steel became more available. Steel buildings have been widely accepted, in part due to cost efficiency. The range of application has expanded with improved materials, products and design capabilities with the availability of computer aided design software.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Advantages==
Steel provides several advantages over other building materials, such as [[wood]]:
*Steel is structurally sound and manufactured to strict specifications and tolerances. 
*Any excess material is 100% recyclable.
*Steel does not easily warp, buckle, twist or bend, and is therefore easy to modify and offers design flexibility. Steel is also easy to install.
*Steel is [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effective]] and rarely [[Market trend|fluctuates in price]].
*Steel allows for improved quality of construction and less maintenance, while offering improved safety and resistance.{{clarify|date=January 2017}}
*With the propagation of mold and mildew in residential buildings, using steel minimizes these infestations. Mold needs moist, porous material to grow. Steel studs do not have those problems.

==Disadvantages==
*Heat conductivity: Calculations show that the web of an 18-gauge steel stud is about 31 times thinner than a "two-by" wood stud; however, steel conducts heat 310 times more efficiently than wood. As a net result, a "two-by" steel stud will conduct 10 times more heat than a "two-by" wood stud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/efficiency/deter_steel_framing.html  |title=Steel Framing: Meeting California's Residential Energy Efficiency Standards |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210235655/http://www.energy.ca.gov/efficiency/deter_steel_framing.html |archivedate = 2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Corrosion: Faulty design leads to the [[corrosion]] of [[iron]] and steel in buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/cbd/cbd020_e.html |title=NRC Institute for Research in Construction - IRC - NRC-CNRC |publisher=Irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2009-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217010441/http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/cbd/cbd020_e.html |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Can bend in fires.

==Types==
Some common types of steel buildings are "straight-walled" and "arch," or [[Nissen hut|Nissen]] or [[Quonset hut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steelbuildings.org/Building_Descriptions.html|title=The Three Types of Steel Buildings|publisher=SteelBuildings.org|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the structural type may be classed as clear span or multiple span. A clear span building does not have structural supports (e.g. columns) in the interior occupied space.

Straight-walled and arch type refer to the outside shape of the building. More generally, these are both structural arch forms if they rely on a rigid frame structure. However, curved roof structures are typically associated with the arch term.

Steel arch buildings may be cost efficient for specific applications.  They are commonly used in the agricultural industry.  Straight-walled buildings provide more usable space when compared to arch buildings.  They are also easier to blend into existing architecture.  Straight-walled buildings are commonly used for commercial, industrial, and many other occupancy types. 

Clear span refers to the internal construction.  Clear span steel buildings utilize large overhead support beams, thus reducing the need for internal supporting columns.  Clear span steel buildings tend to be less cost efficient than structures with interior columns. However, other practical considerations may influence the selection of framing style such as an occupancy where interior structural obstructions are undesirable (e.g. aircraft hangars or sport arenas).{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Long Bay buildings are designed for use in bay spans of over 35'.  They use prefabricated metal frames combined with conventional joists to provide larger openings and clearances in buildings.

==Components==
Building portions that are shop assembled prior to shipment to site are commonly referenced as [[prefabricated]]. The smaller steel buildings tend to be prefabricated or simple enough to be constructed by anyone. Prefabrication offers the benefits of being less costly than traditional methods and is more environmentally friendly (since no waste is produced on-site).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prefabricated Building Construction Systems Adopted in Hong Kong|url=http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/~bswmwong/pp/PrefabricatedConstruction.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger steel buildings require skilled construction workers, such as [[ironworkers]], to ensure proper and safe assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.absoluterv.com/help-and-resources/installation/frame_installation/steel-building-kits-erecting-the-frame/ | title=Steel Building Kits : Erecting the Frame | publisher=Absolute Steel | date=5 December 2011 | accessdate=11 October 2014 | author=Armstrong, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five main types of structural components that make up a steel frame - tension members, compression members, bending members, combined force members and their connections. Tension members are usually found as web and chord members in trusses and open web steel joists. Ideally tension members carry tensile forces, or pulling forces, only and its end connections are assumed to be pinned. Pin connections prevent any moment(rotation) or shear forces from being applied to the member. 
Compression members are also considered as columns, struts, or posts. They are vertical members or web and chord members in trusses and joists that are in compression or being squished. 
Bending members are also known as beams, girders, joists, spandrels, purlins, lintels, and girts. Each of these members have their own structural application, but typically bending members will carry bending moments and shear forces as primary loads and axial forces and torsion as secondary loads. 
Combined force members are commonly known as beam-columns and are subjected to bending and axial compression.
Connections are what bring the entire building together. They join these members together and must ensure that  they function together as one unit.&lt;ref&gt;Geschwindner,L.F.:''Unified Design of Steel Structures'' pages 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12225">'''Surface activated bonding''' ('''SAB''') is a low temperature [[wafer bonding]] technology with atomically clean and activated surfaces. Surface activation prior to bonding by using [[fast atom bombardment]] is typically employed to clean the surfaces. High strength bonding of [[semiconductor]], [[metal]], and [[dielectric]] can be obtained even at room temperature.

== Overview ==
In the standard SAB method, wafer surfaces are activated by argon [[fast atom bombardment]] in [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV) of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa. The  bombardment removes adsorbed contaminants and native oxides on the surfaces. The activated surfaces are atomically clean and reactive for formation of direct bonds between wafers when they are brought into contact even at room temperature.

==Researches on SAB==
The SAB method has been studied for bonding of various materials, as shown in Table I.

The standard SAB, however, failed to bond some materials such as SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and polymer films. The modified SAB was developed to solve this problem, by using a sputtering deposited Si intermediate layer to improve the bond strength.

The '''T-failure criterion''' is a set of [[material failure theory|material failure criteria]] that can be used to predict both [[brittle]] and [[ductile]] failure.  &lt;ref name=Adrian/&gt;
&lt;ref name=Adrian2/&gt;

These criteria were designed as a replacement for the [[von Mises yield criterion]] which predicts the unphysical result that pure [[hydrostatic]] tensile loading of metals never leads to failure.  The T-criteria use the volumetric stress in addition to the [[deviatoric stress]] used by the von Mises criterion and are similar to the [[Drucker Prager yield criterion]].  T-criteria have been designed on the basis of energy considerations and the observation that the reversible [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[energy density]] storage process has a limit which can be used to determine when a material has failed. 

==Description==
The strain energy density stored in the material and calculated by the area under the &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;\bar{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; curve represents the total amount of energy stored in the material only in the case of pure shear. In all other cases, there is a divergence between the actual and calculated stored energy in the material, which is maximum in the case of pure hydrostatic loading, where, according to the von Mises criterion, no energy is stored. This paradox is resolved if a second constitutive equation is introduced, that relates hydrostatic pressure p with the volume change &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;. These two curves, namely &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}-\bar{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; and (p-&lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;) are essential for a complete description of material behaviour up to failure.  Thus, two criteria must be accounted for when considering failure and two constitutive equations that describe material response. According to this criterion, an upper limit to allowable strains is set either by a critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;V,0&lt;/sub&gt; of the elastic energy density due to volume change ('''dilatational energy''') or by a critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;D,0&lt;/sub&gt; of the elastic energy density due to change in shape ('''distortional energy'''). The volume of material is considered to have failed by extensive plastic flow when the distortional energy Τ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; reaches the critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;D,0&lt;/sub&gt; or by extensive dilatation when the dilatational energy Τ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reaches a critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;V,0&lt;/sub&gt;. The two critical values Τ&lt;sub&gt;D,0&lt;/sub&gt; and Τ&lt;sub&gt;V,0&lt;/sub&gt; are considered material constants independent of the shape of the volume of material considered and the induced loading, but dependent on the strain rate and temperature.

==Deployment for Isotropic Metals==
For the development of the criterion, a [[continuum mechanics]] approach is adopted. The material volume is considered to be a continuous medium with no particular form or manufacturing defect. It is also considered to behave as a linear elastic isotropically hardening material, where stresses and strains are related by the generalised Hook’s law and by the incremental theory of plasticity with the von Mises flow rule. For such materials, the following assumptions are considered to hold:&lt;br /&gt;
(a) The total increment of a strain component &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is decomposed into the elastic and the plastic &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^e&lt;/math&gt; increment and &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^p&lt;/math&gt; respectively:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}=d\epsilon_{i,j}^e+d\epsilon_{i,j}^p&lt;/math&gt; (1)&lt;br /&gt;
(b) The elastic strain increment &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^e&lt;/math&gt; is given by Hooke’s law:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^e=\cfrac{1}{2G}(d{\sigma}_{i,j}-\cfrac{3\nu}{1+{\nu}}{\delta}_{i,j}dp)&lt;/math&gt;(2)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G=\cfrac{E}{2(1+\nu)}&lt;/math&gt;the [[shear modulus]], &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the [[Poisson ratio|Poisson’s ratio]] and &lt;math&gt;{\delta}_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Kronecker delta|Krönecker delta]].&lt;br /&gt;
(c) The plastic strain increment &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^p&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the respective deviatoric stress:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^p=s_{i,j}d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;(3)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;s_{i,j}={\sigma}_{i,j}-{\delta}_{i,j}p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; an infinitesimal scalar. (3) implies that the plastic strain increment:
* depends on the value of stresses, not on their variation 
* is independent of the hydrostatic component of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]
* is collinear with the deviatoric stresses (isotropic material)
(d) The increment in plastic work per unit volume using (4.16) is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dw_{p}={\sigma}_{i,j}d{\epsilon}_{i,j}^p={\sigma}_{i,j}s_{i,j}d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; (4)&lt;br /&gt;
and the increment in strain energy, &lt;math&gt;dT&lt;/math&gt;, equals to the total differential of the potential &lt;math&gt;{\Pi}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dT=d{\Pi}=pd{\Theta}+{\sigma}d{\epsilon}=dT_{V}+dT_{D}^*&lt;/math&gt;(5)&lt;br /&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;{\Theta}={\epsilon}_{11}+{\epsilon}_{22}+{\epsilon}_{33}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p=\cfrac{1}{3}({\sigma}_{11}+{\sigma}_{22}+{\sigma}_{33})&lt;/math&gt; and for metals following the von Mises yield law, by definition&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}=\cfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}[({\sigma}_{11}-{\sigma}_{22})^2+({\sigma}_{22}-{\sigma}_{33})^2+({\sigma}_{33}-{\sigma}_{11})^2]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;(6)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\bar{\epsilon}=\cfrac{1'''}{2}\sqrt{2}[({\epsilon}_{11}-{\epsilon}_{22})^2+({\epsilon}_{22}-{\epsilon}_{33})^2+({\epsilon}_{33}-{\epsilon}_{11})^2]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;(7)&lt;br /&gt;
are the equivalent stress and strain respectively.
In (5) the first term of the right hand side, &lt;math&gt;dT_{V}=pd\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the increment in elastic energy for unit volume change due to hydrostatic pressure. Its integral over a load path is the total amount of dilatational strain energy density stored in the material. The second term &lt;math&gt;dT_{D}^*=\bar{\sigma}d\bar{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the energy required for an infinitesimal distortion of the material. The integral of this quantity is the distortional strain energy density. The theory of plastic flow permits the evaluation of stresses, strains and strain energy densities along a path provided that &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; in (3) is known. In elasticity, linear or nonlinear, &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of strain hardening materials, &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; can be evaluated by recording the &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}=\bar{\sigma}(\bar{\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt; curve in a pure shear experiment. The hardening function after point “y” in Figure 1 is then:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H(\bar{\sigma},\bar{\epsilon})=\cfrac{d\bar{\sigma}}{d\bar{\epsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;(8)&lt;br /&gt;
and the infinitesimal scalar &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is:
&lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}=\cfrac{3}{2\bar\sigma^2}dw_p(H)&lt;/math&gt; (9)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;dw_p(H)&lt;/math&gt;is the infinitesimal increase in plastic work (see Figure 1). The elastic part of the total distortional strain energy density is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dT_D=\bar{\sigma}d\bar{\epsilon}^e&lt;/math&gt; (10)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\epsilon}^e&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic part of the equivalent strain. When there is no nonlinear elastic behaviour, by integrating (4.22) the elastic distortional strain energy density is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T_D=\int\bar{\sigma}d\bar{\epsilon}^e=\cfrac{1}{6G}\bar{\sigma}^2&lt;/math&gt; (11)&lt;br /&gt;
Similarly, by integrating the increment in elastic energy for unit volume change due to hydrostatic pressure, &lt;math&gt;dT_V=pd\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, the dilatational strain energy density is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T_V=\int{pd\Theta}=\cfrac{1}{2K}p^2=\cfrac{1}{2}K{\Theta}^2&lt;/math&gt; (12)&lt;br /&gt;
assuming that the unit volume change'' &lt;math&gt;{\Theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic straining, proportional to the hydrostatic pressure, p (Figure 2):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\Theta}=\cfrac{1}{2K}p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;d{\Theta}=\cfrac{1}{K}dp&lt;/math&gt; (13)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{\Theta}={\epsilon}_{11}+{\epsilon}_{22}+{\epsilon}_{33}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p=\cfrac{1}{3}({\sigma}_{11}+{\sigma}_{22}+{\sigma}_{33})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K=\cfrac{E}{3(1-2\nu)}&lt;/math&gt; the bulk modulus of the material. &lt;br /&gt;
In summary, in order to use (12) and (13) to determine the failure of a material volume, the following assumptions hold:
* The material is isotropic and follows the von Mises yield condition
* The elastic part of the stress-strain curve is linear
* The relationship between hydrostatic pressure and unit volume change is linear
* The derivative (hardening slope) must be positive or zero'''

== Limitations ==
The criterion will not predict any failure due to distortion for elastic-perfectly plastic, rigid-plastic, or strain softening materials. For the case of nonlinear elasticity, appropriate calculations for the integrals in and (12) and (13) accounting for the nonlinear elastic material properties must be performed. The two threshold values for the elastic strain energy &lt;math&gt;T_{V,0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{D,0}&lt;/math&gt; are derived from experimental data. A drawback of the criterion is that elastic strain energy densities are small and comparatively hard to derive. Nevertheless, example values are presented in the literature as well as applications where the T-criterion appears to perform quite well.

The [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|melting point]] of the primer sets the upper limit on annealing temperature. At temperatures just above this point, only very specific base pairing between the primer and the template will occur. At lower temperatures, the primers bind less specifically. Nonspecific primer binding obscures polymerase chain reaction results, as the nonspecific sequences to which primers anneal in early steps of amplification will "swamp out" any specific sequences because of the [[exponential growth|exponential]] nature of [[polymerase]] amplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hecker K, Roux K |title=High and low annealing temperatures increase both specificity and yield in touchdown and stepdown PCR |journal=Biotechniques |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=478–85 |year=1996 |pmid=8679209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The earliest steps of a touchdown polymerase chain reaction cycle have high annealing temperatures. The annealing temperature is decreased in increments for every subsequent set of cycles (the number of individual cycles and increments of temperature decrease is chosen by the experimenter).  The primer will anneal at the highest temperature which is least-permissive of nonspecific binding that it is able to tolerate.  Thus, the first sequence amplified is the one between the regions of greatest primer specificity; it is most likely that this is the sequence of interest.  These fragments will be further amplified during subsequent rounds at lower temperatures, and will outcompete the nonspecific sequences to which the primers may bind at those lower temperatures.  If the primer initially (during the higher-temperature phases) binds to the sequence of interest, subsequent rounds of polymerase chain reaction can be performed upon the product to further amplify those fragments. Touchdown increases specificity of the reaction at higher temperatures and increases the efficiency towards the end by lowering the annealing temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roux K |title=Using mismatched primer-template pairs in touchdown PCR |journal=Biotechniques |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=812–4 |year=1994 |pmid=8068332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''transistor radio''' is a small portable [[radio receiver]] that uses [[transistor]]-based circuitry.  Following their [[Regency TR-1|development in 1954]], made possible by the [[History of the transistor#Invention of the transistor|invention of the transistor in 1947]], they became the most popular electronic communication device in history, with billions&lt;ref name="Skrabec"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; manufactured during the 1960s and 1970s. Their pocket size sparked a change in popular music listening habits, allowing people to listen to music anywhere they went. Beginning in the 1980s, however, cheap AM transistor radios were superseded by devices with higher audio quality such as [[portable CD player]]s, [[personal audio player]]s, [[boombox]]es, and (eventually) [[smartphone]]s,&lt;ref name="From the Transistor Radio to the Smartphone"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/dave-petraglia/2014/03/why-you-owe-your-smartphone-to-the-transistor-radio/ |title=Why You Owe Your Smartphone To The Transistor Radio  |last=Petraglia |first=Dave |date=2014-03-05 |publisher=Thought Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which contain radios themselves.&lt;ref name="FM Radio in Smartphone Availability"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/11/06/your-smartphone-ready-for-radio/T7Yz67q9qXyctxxiviQK9J/story.html |title=Is Your Smartphone Ready for Radio? |last=Bray |first=Hiawatha |date=2014-11-06 |publisher=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Pocket radio open english.jpg|thumb|A five-transistor radio with back open, showing parts.]]
Before the transistor was invented, radios used [[vacuum tube]]s.  Although portable vacuum tube radios were produced, they were typically bulky and heavy.  The need for a low voltage high current source to power the filaments of the tubes and high voltage for the anode potential typically required two batteries.  Vacuum tubes were also inefficient and fragile compared to transistors, and had a limited lifetime.

[[Bell Laboratories]] demonstrated the first [[transistor]] on December 23, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/transistorexperiments.html The Invention of the Transistor]&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific team at Bell Laboratories responsible for the [[solid-state physics|solid-state]] amplifier included [[William Shockley]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[John Bardeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Made In Japan : Transistor Radios of the 1950s and 1960s | author = Handy, Erbe, Blackham, Antonier | publisher = Chronicle Books | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-8118-0271-X}} page 13&lt;/ref&gt; After obtaining patent protection, the company held a news conference on June 30, 1948, at which a prototype transistor radio was demonstrated.&lt;ref name="The Revolution in Your Pocket"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/2/2004_2_12.shtml|title=The Revolution in Your Pocket|accessdate=2010-04-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820121345/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/2/2004_2_12.shtml|archivedate=2006-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many claimants to the title of the first company to produce practical transistor radios, often incorrectly attributed to [[Sony]] (originally Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation). [[Texas Instruments]] had demonstrated all-transistor AM (amplitude modulation) radios as early as May 25, 1954,&lt;ref&gt;Invention and Technology Magazine, Fall 2004, Volume 20 Issue 2, "The Revolution in your Pocket", Author: Robert J. Simcoe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book Title: TI, the Transistor, and Me, Author: Ed Millis, page 34&lt;/ref&gt; but their performance was well below that of equivalent vacuum tube models. A workable all-transistor radio was demonstrated in August 1953 at the [[Düsseldorf]] Radio Fair by the German firm Intermetall.&lt;ref&gt;Article: "The French Transistor", Author: Armand Van Dormael, page 15, Source: IEEE Global History Network&lt;/ref&gt; It was built with four of [[Intermetall]]'s hand-made transistors, based upon the 1948 invention of the "Transistron"-germanium point-contact transistor by [[Herbert Mataré]] and [[Heinrich Welker]]. However, as with the early Texas Instruments units (and others) only prototypes were ever built; it was never put into commercial production. RCA had demonstrated a prototype transistor radio as early as 1952, and it is likely that they and the other radio makers were planning transistor radios of their own, but Texas Instruments and Regency Division of I.D.E.A., were the first to offer a production model starting in October 1954.&lt;ref&gt;website: www.regencytr1.com, Regency TR-1 Transistor Radio History&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sanyo Transistor.jpg|thumb|left|200|[[Sanyo]] 8S-P3 transistor radio, which received AM and shortwave bands.]]
The use of transistors instead of [[vacuum tube]]s as the amplifier elements meant that the device was much smaller, required far less power to operate than a tube radio, and was more shock-resistant. Since the transistor base draws current, its input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is low in contrast to the high input impedance of the vacuum tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Transistor Radio Handbook: Theory, Circuitry, and Equipment |author1=Donald L. Stoner  |author2=L.A. Earnshaw  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = Editors and Engineers, Ltd. | year = 1963}} page 32&lt;/ref&gt; It also allowed "instant-on" operation, since there were no filaments to heat up. The typical portable tube radio of the fifties was about the size and weight of a [[Lunch box|lunchbox]], and contained several heavy, non-rechargeable batteries— one or more so-called "A" batteries to heat the tube filaments and a large 45- to 90-volt "B" battery to power the signal circuits. By comparison, the transistor radio could fit in a pocket and weighed half a pound or less, and was powered by standard flashlight batteries or a single compact 9-volt battery. The now-familiar [[PP3 battery|9-volt battery]] was introduced for powering transistor radios.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}

Listeners sometimes held an entire transistor radio directly against the side of the head, with the speaker against the ear, to minimize the "tinny" sound caused by the high resonant frequency of its small speaker. Most radios included earphone jacks and came with single earphones that provided only mediocre-quality sound reproduction. To consumers familiar with the earphone-listening experience of the transistor radio, the first [[Sony Walkman]] cassette player, with a pair of high-fidelity stereo earphones, would provide a greatly contrasting display of audio fidelity.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}

== Regency TR-1&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the first transistor radio ==
[[Image:Regency transistor radio.jpg|right|thumb|Regency TR-1.]]
Two companies working together, Texas Instruments of Dallas, Texas and Industrial Development Engineering Associates (I.D.E.A.) of Indianapolis, Indiana, were behind the unveiling of the [[Regency TR-1]], the world's first commercially produced transistor radio. Previously, Texas Instruments was producing instrumentation for the oil industry and locating devices for the U.S. Navy and I.D.E.A. built home television antenna boosters. The two companies worked together on the TR-1, looking to grow revenues for their respective companies by breaking into this new product area.&lt;ref name="The Revolution in Your Pocket"/&gt; In May 1954, Texas Instruments had designed and built a prototype and was looking for an established radio manufacturer to develop and market a radio using their transistors. (The Chief Project Engineer for the radio design at Texas Instruments' headquarters in Dallas, Texas was Paul D. Davis, Jr., who had a degree in Electrical Engineering from Southern Methodist University. He was assigned the project due to his experience with radio engineering in World War II.) None of the major radio makers including RCA, Philco, and Emerson were interested. The President of I.D.E.A. at the time, Ed Tudor, jumped at the opportunity to manufacture the TR-1, predicting sales of the transistor radios at "20 million radios in three years".&lt;ref name=lane94&gt;{{cite book | title = Transistor Radios: A Collector's Encyclopedia and Price Guide |author1=David Lane  |author2=Robert Lane  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = Wallace-Homestead Book Company | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-87069-712-9}} pages 2-7&lt;/ref&gt;  The Regency TR-1 was announced on October 18, 1954 by the Regency Division of I.D.E.A., was put on sale in November 1954, and was the first practical transistor radio made in any significant numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4398895/TI-announces-1st-transistor-radio--October-18--1954 |title=TI announces 1st transistor radio, October 18, 1954 |last=Deffree |first=Suzanne |date=2017-10-17 |website=[[EDN (magazine)|EDN]] |language=en |access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported in 1954 that "the radio has only four transistors. One acts as a combination mixer-oscillator, one as an audio amplifier, and two as intermediate-frequency amplifiers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Regency markets pocket transistor radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year after the release of the TR-1 sales approached the 100,000 mark. The look and size of the TR-1 was well received, but the reviews of the TR-1's performance were typically adverse.&lt;ref name=lane94/&gt; The Regency TR-1 is patented by Richard C. Koch, {{cite patent|US|2892931}}, former Project Engineer of I.D.E.A.

==Raytheon 8-TP-1&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the second transistor radio==
In February 1955 the second transistor radio, the 8-TP-1, was introduced by [[Raytheon]]. It was a larger portable transistor radio, including an expansive four-inch speaker and four additional transistors (the TR-1 used only four). As a result, the sound quality was much better than the TR-1. An additional benefit of the 8-TP-1 was its efficient battery consumption. In July 1955, the first positive review of a transistor radio appeared in the [[Consumer Reports]] that said, "The transistors in this set have not been used in an effort to build the smallest radio on the market, and good performance has not been sacrificed." Following the success of the 8-TP-1, Zenith, RCA, DeWald, and Crosley began flooding the market with additional transistor radio models.&lt;ref name=lane94/&gt;

[[File:Transistor car radio Mopar model 914HR.JPG|thumb|All-Transistor car radio - Chrysler Mopar model 914HR]]

[[Chrysler]] and [[Philco]] announced that they had developed and produced the world's first all-transistor car radio in the April 28th 1955 edition of the Wall Street Journal.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, "Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56", April 28th 1955, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler made the all-transistor car radio, Mopar model 914HR, available as an "option" in fall 1955 for its new line of 1956 Chrysler and Imperial cars, which hit the showroom floor on October 21, 1955. The all-transistor car radio was a $150 option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsh |first=Rick |url=http://www.allpar.com/stereo/Philco/index.html |title=Philco's All-Transistor Mopar Car Radio |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/philco_mopar_914_hr_ch_c_5690hr.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcanorthamerica.com/company/Heritage/Pages/Chrysler-Heritage-1950.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Imperial Owners Manual, 1956, Page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pricing ==
Prior to the Regency TR-1, transistors were difficult to produce. Only one in five transistors that were produced worked as expected (only a 20% yield) and as a result the price remained extremely high.&lt;ref name=lane94/&gt; When it was released in 1954, the Regency TR-1 cost $49.95 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1954}}}} today) and sold about 150,000 units. Raytheon and Zenith Electronics transistor radios soon followed and were priced even higher. In 1955, Raytheon's 8-TR-1 was priced at $80 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|80|1955}}}} today).&lt;ref name=lane94/&gt; By November 1956 a transistor radio small enough to wear on the wrist and a claimed battery life of 100 hours cost $29.95.&lt;ref name="galaxy195611"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1956-11/Galaxy_1956_11#page/n1/mode/2up | title=Broadcast Band - All Transistor Wrist Radio | work=Galaxy | date=November 1956 | accessdate=18 December 2013 | pages=1 | type=advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony's TR-63, released in December 1957 cost $39.95 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40|1957}}}} today).&lt;ref name=lane94/&gt; Following the success of the TR-63 Sony continued to make their transistor radios smaller. Because of the extremely low labor costs in Japan, Japanese transistor radios began selling for as low as $25. In 1962 American manufacturers dropped prices of transistor radios to as low as $15 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15|1962}}}} today).&lt;ref name=lane94/&gt;

==Japanese history in the market==
[[Image:Superheterod radio.JPG|thumb|The circuit of a Japanese 5 transistor radio.]]

While on a trip to the United States in 1952, [[Masaru Ibuka]], founder of Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation (now [[Sony]]), discovered that AT&amp;T was about to make licensing available for the transistor. Ibuka and his partner, physicist Akio Morita, convinced the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to finance the $25,000 licensing fee (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1952}}}} today).&lt;ref name="Sony.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony History. Chapter4: Ibuka's First Visit to the United States|url=https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/SonyHistory/1-04.html|website=Sony.net|publisher=[[Sony]]|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several months Ibuka traveled around the United States borrowing ideas from the American transistor manufacturers. Improving upon the ideas, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation made its first functional transistor radio in 1954.&lt;ref name=lane94/&gt; Within five years, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation grew from seven employees to approximately five hundred.

Other Japanese companies soon followed their entry into the American market and the grand total of electronic products exported from Japan in 1958 increased 2.5 times in comparison to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Made In Japan : Transistor Radios of the 1950s and 1960s | author = Handy, Erbe, Blackham, Antonier | publisher = Chronicle Books | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-8118-0271-X}} pages 23-29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sony TR-55===
In August 1955, while still a small company, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation introduced their [[TR-55]] five-transistor radio under the new brand name [[Sony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = SONY : the private life | author = John Nathan | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-395-89327-5}} page 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/background1/events/tradio.html |title=Transistor Radios |year=1999 |publisher=ScienCentral |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this radio, Sony became the first company to manufacture the transistors and other components they used to construct the radio. The TR-55 was also the first transistor radio to utilize all miniature components. It is estimated that only 5,000 to 10,000 units were produced.

===Sony TR-63===
The TR-63 was introduced by Sony to the United States in December 1957. The TR-63 was 1/4" narrower and 1/2" shorter than the original Regency TR-1. Like the TR-1 it was offered in four colors: lemon, green, red, and black. In addition to its smaller size, the TR-63 had a small tuning capacitor and required a new battery design to produce the proper voltage. It used the [[nine-volt battery]], which would become the standard for transistor radios. Approximately 100,000 units of the TR-63 were imported in 1957.&lt;ref name=lane94/&gt; This "pocketable" (the term "pocketable" was a matter of some interpretation, as Sony allegedly had special shirts made with oversized pockets for their salesmen) model proved highly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-6/h2.html |title=Sony Global - Sony History |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820025319/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-6/h2.html |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the visible success of the TR-63 Japanese competitors such as Toshiba and Sharp joined the market. By 1959, in the United States market, there were more than six million transistor radio sets produced by Japanese companies that represented $62 million in revenue.&lt;ref name=lane94/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Transistor radios were extremely successful because of three social forces — a large number of young people due to the [[post–World War II baby boom]], a public with disposable income amidst a period of prosperity, and the growing popularity of rock 'n' roll music. The influence of the transistor radio during this period is shown by its appearance in popular films, songs, and books of the time, such as the movie ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]''. 
In the late 1950s, transistor radios took on more elaborate designs as a result of heated competition.  Eventually, transistor radios doubled as novelty items. The small components of transistor radios that became smaller over time were used to make anything from "Jimmy Carter Peanut-shaped" radios to "Gun-shaped" radios to "Mork from Ork Eggship-shaped" radios. Corporations used transistor radios to advertise their business. "[[Charlie the Tuna]]-shaped" radios could be purchased from Star-Kist for an insignificant amount of money giving their company visibility amongst the public. These novelty radios are now bought and sold as collectors' items amongst modern day collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Made In Japan : Transistor Radios of the 1950s and 1960s | author = Handy, Erbe, Blackham, Antonier | publisher = Chronicle Books | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-8118-0271-X}} pages 46-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Antique Radio Classified|publisher=John V. Terrey|pages=June 2002 p.10 and March 2008 p.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rise of portable audio players ==
[[Image:Sony-walkman-srfs84s 0001.JPG|thumb|right|A modern transistor radio (Sony Walkman SRF-S84 transistor radio, released 2001, shown without earphones)]]

Since 1980, the popularity of portable radios has declined with the rise of [[portable audio player]]s and [[smartphone]]s, which allow users to carry and listen to the music of their choosing and may also include a [[radio tuner]].  This began in the late 1970s with [[boom box]]es and portable cassette players such as the [[Sony Walkman]], followed by [[portable CD player]]s.  A common type now is the portable [[digital audio player]]. This type of device is a popular choice with listeners who are dissatisfied with terrestrial music radio because of a limited selection of music and reception problems.  However, transistor radios are still popular for news, [[talk radio]], weather, live sporting events and emergency alert applications.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
