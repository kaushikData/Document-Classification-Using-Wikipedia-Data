{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}
An '''acceleration clause''' —or '''acceleration covenant'''— in the [[law]] of [[contracts]], is a term that fully matures the performance due from a party upon a breach of the contract. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/acceleration_clause&lt;/ref&gt; Such clauses are most prevalent in [[mortgages]] and similar contracts to purchase [[real estate]] in installments.

Suppose, for example, the contract was for A to purchase [[Blackacre]] from B for $100,000, to be paid in 5 monthly installments of $20,000. If A makes the first two payments, but fails to make the third payment, an acceleration clause would require that A must immediately pay B the entire balance of $60,000, or lose his right to purchase Blackacre (without getting a refund of his $40,000).

An example of an acceleration clause is examined in the 1971 Rhode Island Supreme Court case of ''Scullian v. Petrucci'':&lt;ref&gt;''Scullian v. Petrucci'', 276 A.2d 277, 108 R.I. 406 (R.I., 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; There, the clause stated: "In the event Purchaser defaults on any payment or fails to comply with any condition of this contract [...] the full amount shall be immediately due and payable[...]". The court in that case found that the language of the clause required that default on the payment triggered the [[statute of limitations]] for the clause to be enforced.

'''''Adelantado''''' ({{IPA-es|aðelanˈtaðo}}) (meaning "advanced") was a title held by Spanish nobles in service of their respective kings during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was later used as a military title held by some [[Spain|Spanish]] ''[[conquistador]]es'' of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.

''Adelantados'' were [[charter|granted]] directly by the monarch the right to become [[governor]]s and [[judge|justices]] of a specific region, which they were charged with conquering, in exchange for funding and organizing the initial explorations, settlements and pacification of the target area on behalf of the [[Crown of Castile]]. These areas were usually outside the jurisdiction of an existing ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]'' or [[viceroy]], and ''adelantados'' were authorized to communicate directly with the [[Council of the Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Lillian Estelle. ''Viceregal Administration in the Spanish American Colonies''. Berkeley, University of California Press, 1926, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''reconquista''==
The term has its origins in the ''[[reconquista]]''. The term comes from the phrase ''por adelantado'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "in advance", although translations stating "one who goes before" and "the forward man" are also found). According to the [[Siete Partidas]] the office of adelantado was the equivalent of the Roman ''[[Praefectus urbi]]'' (Latin).

The earliest definitely known ''adelantado'' was appointed by [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]] in 1253 in the recently conquered territory of "''La Frontera''" ([[Andalusia]]). However the office had precedents in the duties and rights held by some officers of the Navarrese dynasty of Castile and León, and [[Álvar Fáñez]] or [[Fortún Sánchez]] in the Ebro valley performed similar services in detached territories beyond the frontier. It was during this time that the [[Siete Partidas]], commissioned by Alfonso X, more precisely identified the powers of the office. That law code created the position of an ''adelantado mayor'', who was at the same time an intermediary appellate judge, located in the judicial hierarchy between local justices and the king's court, and an executive officer, who as a direct representative of the king, was charged with implementing royal orders in his assigned area. Most appointees were from the upper nobility or the royal family. After its success in Andalusia, the institution was introduced in the northern areas of the peninsula, merging with, and becoming indistinguishable from an older judicial office, the Royal ''Merinos''.

==Overseas==
Beyond the peninsula the term ''adelantado'' was granted to [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] in the [[conquest of the Canary Islands]] and was confirmed to members of his family. The term became modified over time. During the colonization of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Americas]] and [[Spanish East Indies]] (Asia), each charter specified different powers to each ''adelantado'', sometimes in a vague manner, which often lead to confusion, as in the case between [[Juan de Oñate]] and the Viceroy of New Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher. ''Viceregal Administration'', 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The title was also granted both as an inheritable title and one that lasted for one life only. With the publication of the [[Ordinances Concerning Discoveries]] (''Ordenanzas de descubrimientos, nueva población y pacificación de las Indias'') in 1573, the attributes of ''adelantados'' became regularized, although the title was granted with much less frequency after this date, especially since the institutions of ''audiencias'', governors and viceroys had been developed.&lt;ref&gt;The laws relating to ''adelantados'' are compiled in Titles 3, 4 and 7 of Book IV of the [http://www.congreso.gob.pe/ntley/LeyIndiaP.htm ''Recompilación de las leyes de Indias'']. In [[Spanish Language|Spanish]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Ordinances are useful because they illustrate the faculties ''adelantados'' often had. The Ordinances established that ''adelantados'', in their capacity as governors and justices of the new territories, had the right to hear civil and criminal cases in appeal, to name the ''regidores'' and employees of the ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildos]]'' of any towns founded, to name interim treasury officials, to issue ordinances on the use of land and mines, to establish districts, and to organize [[militia]]s and name their captains. [[Image:Mapa de América del Sur (Gobernaciones 1534-1539).svg|thumb|200px|right|The ''adelantado'' grants of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] prior to the establishment of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].]]

The first use of the title ''adelantado'' in the Americas was by [[Bartolomeo Columbus]], brother of [[Christopher Columbus]], who governed [[Hispaniola]] under this title during his brother's absence from 1494 to 1498. It was later inherited by [[Diego Colón]] after much litigation. Other conquistadors who were granted the title include:
*1512: [[Juan Ponce de León]] for [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] and Biminí, renewed in 1524 for his son, Luis.
*15?? [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]] for [[Isthmus of Panama]] and [[Santa Marta]] 
*1514: [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] for the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]].
*1518: [[Ferdinand Magellan]] for the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], and [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] for [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and [[Cozumel]].
*1527: [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] for [[Spanish Florida|Florida]].
*1527: [[Pedro de Alvarado]] for [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;García Añoveros 1987, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1529: [[Francisco Pizarro]] for [[Peru]], and [[Pedro de Mendoza]] for [[Argentina]].
*1535: [[Pedro Fernández de Lugo]]  for [[Santa Marta]] (as son of [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]], ''Adelantado'' of [[Tenerife]] and [[La Palma]], he was a second-generation ''adelantado'').
*1537: [[Hernando de Soto]] for [[Spanish Florida|Florida]].
*1540: [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] for [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]].
*1549: [[Pedro de Valdivia]] for [[Chile]].
*1565: [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]] for [[Spanish Florida|Florida]].
*1571: [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] for the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]].
*1595: [[Alvaro de Mendaña]], and after his death his wife [[Isabel Barreto]], for the [[Solomon Islands]].

== History ==
Eric Liedtke, the executive of [[Adidas]] in 2015, chose to use recycled plastics in the production of the Adidas Parley, as he felt that there were many potential applications for its use and that it would also serve as part of a solution to the [[Marine debris|Ocean Plastic Problem]]. This formed the start of a long term initiative project by Adidas to eliminate [[Plastic|new plastic]] from its supply chain and to expand its plastic cultivation to more athletic product lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/adidas-shoes-made-from-ocean-plastic-are-finally-h/|title=Adidas Shoes Made From Ocean Plastic Are Finally Here|work=Global Citizen|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adidas has used recycled polyester and [[Organic cotton|sustainable cotton]] in previous athletic products, but these production runs are small in comparison to their ocean plastic shoe initiative.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/04/21/adidas-new-shoes-ocean-plastic/|title=Adidas Is Turning Plastic From the Ocean Into $200 Shoes|work=Fortune|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adidas - Parley Collaboration ===
Parley For The Oceans is Adidas' partner in the Parley A.I.R Strategy, which turns ocean plastic waste into thread that is woven into running shoes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Adidas-Parley shoe silhouettes were re-designed with knitted uppers and decorative stitching, all made from recycled plastic that was collected by Parley for the Oceans from polluted coastal regions. The [[outsole]] is crafted from recycled and [[Tire recycling|re-ground rubber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/2017/10/16/adidas-parley-interview/|title=adidas &amp; Parley for the Oceans Explain Their Eco-Friendly Shoes|date=2017-11-28|work=Highsnobiety|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;

'''Advance SA''' is a [[political party]] in [[South Australia]]. It was founded in 2017 by [[John Darley (politician)|John Darley]]. Darley had been elected to the [[Legislative Council of South Australia]] as a member of the Nick Xenophon Group, named as [[Nick Xenophon Team]] from 2015. Darley quit that party early in 2017 and founded the Advance SA party later in 2017. It was registered as a party with the [[Electoral Commission of South Australia]] on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecsa.sa.gov.au/parties-and-candidates/how-to-register-a-political-party/political-party-register |title=Register of political parties |publisher=[[Electoral Commission of South Australia]] |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darley was elected to an eight-year term at the [[South Australian state election, 2014|2014 state election]], so was not due for reelection in the [[South Australian state election, 2018|2018 state election]]. The upper house candidates in 2018 were Peter Humphries and Jenny Low&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/sa-election-2018-former-nick-xenophon-team-senator-john-darley-launches-the-advance-sa-party/news-story/4ed92b14a521ff23c081fc6457e32f1b |title=SA Election 2018: Advance SA candidate Jenny Low claims former partner Nick Xenophon was ‘manipulative and controlling’ |first=Paul |last=Purcell |first2=Adam |last2=Langenberg|newspaper=The Advertiser |publisher=News Limited  |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the party won 0.4% (4,190) of the state primary vote, which was not enough to gain an additional seat in the Legislative Council.

'''Anti-Zionism''' is opposition to [[Zionism]]. The term is broadly defined in the modern era as the opposition to the [[ethnonationalist]] and political movement of [[Jews]] and [[Jewish culture]] that supports the establishment of a [[Jewish state]] as a [[Jewish homeland]] in the territory defined as the historic [[Land of Israel]] (also referred to as [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Canaan]], or the [[Holy Land]]). Anti-Zionism is also defined as opposition to the [[State of Israel]].

The term is used to describe various religious, moral and political points of view, but their diversity of motivation and expression is sufficiently different that "anti-Zionism" cannot be seen as having a single ideology or source.  There is also a difference between how it is discussed philosophically and how it is enacted within a political or social campaign.&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;Halpern, Gilad, host.  [https://tlv1.fm/the-tel-aviv-review/2017/11/17/left-handed-compliments-anti-semitic-discourse-among-progressives/ "Left Handed Compliments ...."] ''The Tel Aviv Review'', TLV1 Podcasts.  17 November 2017.  See discussion beginning at 22:33.&lt;/ref&gt; Many notable Jewish and non-Jewish sources take the view that anti-Zionism has become a cover for modern-day [[antisemitism]], a position that critics have challenged as a tactic to silence [[criticism of the Israeli government|criticism of Israeli policies]]. Others, such as [[Steven M. Cohen]], [[Brian Klug]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug]], [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/03/comment No, Zionism is not anti-semitism] [[The Guardian]] 3 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Todd Gitlin]], see no correlation between the two.&lt;ref name="Zeveloff" /&gt;

==History==

{{main article|Timeline of anti-Zionism}}
{{see also|History of Zionism|History of antisemitism}}

==Jewish anti-Zionism==
Jewish anti-Zionism is as old as Zionism itself, and enjoyed widespread support in the Jewish  community until World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Marqusee]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=2llC2XJgwdwC&amp;pg=PR7 ''If I Am Not For Myself: Journey of an Anti-Zionist Jew,'']   [[Verso Books]] (2008) 2010 p.vii:’As long as there has been Zionism, there have been anti-Zionist Jews. Indeed, decades before it even came to the notice of non-Jews, anti-Zionism was a well-established Jewish ideology and until World War 11 commanded wide support in the diaspora.’&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jewish community is not a single united group and responses vary both among and within Jewish groups. One of the principal divisions is that between [[secular Jews]] and [[religious Jews]]. The reasons for secular opposition to the Zionist movement are very different from those of religious Jews.  Opposition to a Jewish state has changed over time and has taken on a diverse spectrum of religious, ethical and political positions.

The legitimacy of anti-Zionist views has been disputed to the present day, including the more recent and disputed relationship between anti-Zionism and [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="Wist1"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Before 1948===

There is a long tradition of Jewish anti-Zionism that has opposed the Zionist project from its origins. The [[Bundism|Bundists]], [[Jewish Autonomism|the Autonomists]], [[Reform Judaism]] and the [[World Agudath Israel|Agude]] regarded both the rationale and territorial ambitions of Zionism as flawed. [[Orthodox Judaism]], which grounds civic responsibilities and patriotic feelings in religion, was strongly opposed to Zionism because, though the two shared the same values, Zionism espoused nationalism in secular fashion, and used "Zion", "Jerusalem", "Land of Israel", "redemption" and "ingathering of exiles" as literal rather than sacred terms, endeavouring to achieve them in this world.&lt;ref name="Zionism and Religion"&gt;S. Almog, [[Jehuda Reinharz]], [[Anita Shapira]] (eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mS6oW4TTuwkC&amp;pg=PA111 Zionism and Religion]'', UPNE, 1998 citing [[Isaac Breuer]],''Judenproblem'', Halle 1918 p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Jews also opposed the creation of a [[Jewish state]] prior to the appearance of the [[Messiah in Judaism|messiah]], as contradicting divine will.&lt;ref name="shapira"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Shapira | first = Anita |authorlink=Anita Shapira | title = Israel a history | publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson| location = London | page = 15 | date = 2014 | isbn =9780297871583}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, reform Jews rejected Judaism as a national or ethnic identity, and renounced any messianic expectations of the advent of a Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Ross [https://books.google.com/books?id=4zGOUAnfr5MC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious====
Hope for return to the land of Israel is embodied in the content of the Jewish religion (see [[Kibbutz Galuyot]]). ''[[Aliyah]]'', the Hebrew word meaning "ascending" or "going up", is the word used to describe religious Jewish return to Israel, and has been used since ancient times. From the [[Middle Ages]] and onwards, many famous rabbis and often their followers returned to the land of Israel. These have included [[Nahmanides]], [[Yechiel of Paris]], [[Isaac Luria]], [[Yosef Karo]], [[Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk]] among others. For [[Jewish diaspora|Jews in the Diaspora]] ''[[Eretz Israel]]'' was revered in a religious sense. They prayed, and thought of the return, as being fulfilled in a messianic age.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. R. Taylor|Taylor, A. R.]], 1971, ''Vision and intent in Zionist Thought'', pp. 10, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Return remained a recurring theme for generations, particularly in [[Passover]] and [[Yom Kippur]] prayers, which traditionally concluded with, "[[Next year in Jerusalem]]", as well as the thrice-daily ''[[Amidah]]'' (Standing prayer).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Following [[Jewish Enlightenment]] however, [[Reform Judaism]] dropped many traditional beliefs, including ''aliyah'', as incompatible with modern life within the Diaspora. Later, Zionism re-kindled the concept of ''aliyah'' in an ideological and political sense, parallel with traditional religious belief; it was used to increase Jewish population in the Holy Land by immigration and it remains a basic tenet of Zionist ideology. Support for aliyah does not always equal immigration however, as a majority of the world Jewish population remains within the Diaspora. Support for the modern Zionist movement is not universal and, as a result, some religious Jews as well as some secular Jews do not support Zionism. [[Non-Zionism|Non-Zionist]] Jews are not necessarily anti-Zionists, although some are. Generally however, Zionism does have the support of the majority of the Jewish religious organizations, with support from segments of the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] movement, and most of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and more recently, the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rachael Gelfman, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/LandIsrael/modern_landisrael/ReligiousZionism.htm "Religious Zionists believe that the Jewish return to Israel hastens the Messiah"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehud Bandel – President, the Masorti Movement, [http://www.uscj.org/Zionism7161.html "Zionism"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccarnet.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=42&amp;pge_prg_id=4687&amp;pge_id=1656 |title=Reform Judaism &amp; Zionism: A Centenary Platform |date=27 October 2004 |publisher=[[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] |location=[[Miami]], [[Florida]] |access-date=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125135118/http://ccarnet.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=42&amp;pge_prg_id=4687&amp;pge_id=1656 |archive-date=25 November 2011 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Hasidic]] rabbis oppose the creation of a Jewish state. The leader of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidic group, Rabbi [[Joel Teitelbaum]]'s book, ''[[Vayoel Moshe|VaYoel Moshe]]'', published in 1958, expounds one &lt;!-- opposing? --&gt; Orthodox position on Zionism, based on a literal form of ''[[midrash]]'' (biblical interpretation). Citing to Tractate Kesubos 111a of the [[Talmud]] Teitelbaum states that God and the Jewish people exchanged [[the Three Oaths|three oaths]] at the time of the Jews' exile from ancient Israel, forbidding the Jewish people from massively immigrating to the Land of Israel, and from rebelling against the nations of the world.

====Secular====

Prior to the Second World War many Jews regarded Zionism as a fanciful and unrealistic movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMjh319vnwAC A History of Zionism]'', (Schocken Books, New York 1978, {{ISBN|0-8052-0523-3}}), pp385-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Many liberals during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had argued that Jews should enjoy full equality only on the condition that they pledge their singular loyalty to their nation-state and entirely assimilate to the local national culture; they called for the "regeneration" of the Jewish people in exchange for rights. Those liberal Jews who accepted integration and/or assimilation principles saw Zionism as a threat to efforts to facilitate Jewish citizenship and equality within the European nation-state context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMjh319vnwAC A History of Zionism]'', p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish Anti-Zionist League]], in Egypt, was a Communist-influenced anti-Zionist league in the years 1946–1947. In [[Israel]], there are several Jewish anti-Zionist organisations and politicians, many of these are related to [[Matzpen]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===After World War II and the creation of Israel===
Attitudes changed during and following the war. In May 1942, before the full revelation of the [[Holocaust]], the [[Biltmore Program]] proclaimed a fundamental departure from traditional Zionist policy of a "homeland"&lt;ref name="AJYB 1943 pp 206-214"&gt;''American Jewish Year Book'' Vol. 45 (1943–1944) [http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1943_1944_5_USCivicPolitical.pdf "Pro-Palestine and Zionist Activities"], pp. 206–214&lt;/ref&gt; with its demand "that [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] be established as a Jewish Commonwealth". Opposition to official Zionism's firm, unequivocal stand caused some prominent Zionists to establish their own party, [[Ichud]] (Unification), which advocated an Arab – Jewish Federation in Palestine. Opposition to the Biltmore Program also led to the founding of the anti-Zionist [[American Council for Judaism]].&lt;ref name="AJYB 1943 pp 206-214" /&gt;

The full knowledge of the [[Holocaust]] altered the views of many who critiqued Zionism before 1948, including the British journalist [[Isaac Deutscher]], a socialist and lifelong [[atheist]] who nevertheless emphasised the importance of his Jewish heritage. Before [[World War II]], Deutscher opposed Zionism as economically retrograde and harmful to the cause of [[international socialism]], but in the aftermath of the Holocaust he regretted his pre-war views, arguing for Israel's establishment as a "historic necessity" to provide a refuge for the surviving [[Jews of Europe]]. In the 1960s, Deutscher renewed his criticism of Zionism, scrutinizing Israel for its failure to recognise the dispossession of the [[Palestinians]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Other objections relate to the [[Demographics of Israel|maintenance of a Jewish majority]] within the present state of Israel.

[[Post-Zionism]], a related term, has been criticized as being equivalent to anti-Zionism.&lt;ref name="meforum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meforum.org/185/post-zionism-and-israeli-politics | title=Post-Zionism and Israeli Politics: A briefing by Limor Livnat | publisher=Middle East Forum | date=August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Orthodox religious groups have accepted and actively support the State of Israel, even if they have not adopted "Zionist" ideology. The [[World Agudath Israel]] party (founded in Poland) has at times participated in Israeli government coalitions. Most religious Zionists hold pro-Israel views from a right-wing viewpoint. The main exceptions are Hasidic groups such as [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidim, which have about 100,000 adherents worldwide, as well as numerous different, smaller Hasidic groups, unified in America in the [[Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada]] and in Israel in the [[Edah HaChareidis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com Jews Against Zionism website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226024643/http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/ |date=26 February 2009 }} Retrieved 4 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truetorahjews.org/ Jews Against Zionism website] Retrieved 22 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Novak]] writes that many Jewish anti-Zionists resent the way Zionism 'mak(es) ''Jewishly'' unwarranted claims on them and other Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Novak]], 2015 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6WUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jonathan Judaken]], 'numerous Jewish traditions have insisted that preservation of what is most precious about Judaism and Jewishness "demands" a principled anti-Zionism or post-Zionism.' This tradition dwindled in the aftermath of the Holocaust, and the establishment of Israel but is still alive in religious groups such as [[Neturei Karta]] and among many intellectuals of Jewish background in both Israel and the diaspora, such as [[George Steiner]], [[Tony Judt]] and [[Baruch Kimmerling]] .&lt;ref name="Judaken"&gt;[[Jonathan Judaken]], "Rethinking the New Antisemitism", in Jonathan Judaken (ed.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=haraAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 Naming Race, Naming Racisms]'', Routledge, 2013 pp. 195-223 pp. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secular====
[[Noam Chomsky]] has reported a change in the boundaries of what are considered Zionist and anti-Zionist views.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Peck (pacifist)|Peck, James]] (ed.) (1987). ''Chomsky Reader''. {{ISBN|0-394-75173-6}}. p. 7. "what was then called 'Zionist' ... are now called 'anti-Zionist' (concerns and views)".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, in his youth, Chomsky's support for a socialist [[binational state]], in conjunction with his opposition to any semblance of a theocratic system of governance in Israel, was at the time considered well within the mainstream of secular Zionism; today, it lands him solidly in the anti-Zionist camp.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Peck (pacifist)|Peck, James]] (ed.) (1987). ''Chomsky Reader''. {{ISBN|0-394-75173-6}}. p. 7 &lt;blockquote&gt;"I was interested in socialist, binationalist options for Palestine, and in the kibbutzim and the whole cooperative labor system that had developed in the Jewish settlement there (the Yishuv).... The vague ideas I had at the time [1947] were to go to Palestine, perhaps to a kibbutz, to try to become involved in efforts at Arab-Jewish cooperation within a socialist framework, opposed to the deeply antidemocratic concept of a Jewish state."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Alvin H. Rosenfeld]] in his much discussed essay, [[Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism]],&lt;ref name=RosenfeldEssay&gt;[[Alvin H. Rosenfeld]]. [http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/PROGRESSIVE_JEWISH_THOUGHT.PDF 'Progressive' Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism]. [[American Jewish Committee]]. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; claims that a "number of Jews, through their speaking and writing, are feeding a rise in virulent [[antisemitism]] by questioning whether [[Israel]] should even exist".&lt;ref name=CohenNYTimes&gt;Patricia Cohen. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/arts/31jews.html?ex=1327899600&amp;en=66861232e53ab847&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "Essay Linking Liberal Jews and Anti-Semitism Sparks a Furor"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 31 January 2007. Retrieved 19 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenfeld's general claims are:
#"At a time when the de-legitimization and, ultimately, the eradication of Israel is a goal being voiced with mounting fervor by the enemies of the Jewish state, it is more than disheartening to see Jews themselves adding to the vilification. That some do so in the name of Judaism itself makes the nature of their assault all the more grotesque."
#"Their contributions to what's becoming normative discourse are toxic. They're helping to make [anti-Semitic] views about the Jewish state respectable – for example, that it's a Nazi-like state, comparable to South African apartheid; that it engages in ethnic cleansing and genocide.

Many oppose it as a form of nationalism, which they argue to be a product of capitalist societies. One secular anti-Zionist group today is the [[International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network]], a socialist, anti-war, and anti-imperialist organization that calls for "the dismantling of Israeli apartheid, the return of Palestinian refugees, and the ending of the Israeli colonization of historic Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the International Jewish anti-Zionist Network |url=http://www.ijsn.net/about_us/charter/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804180125/http://www.ijsn.net/about_us/charter/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2012 |publisher=International Jewish anti-Zionist Network |accessdate=29 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne de Jong asserts that direct resistance from inhabitants of [[historic Palestine]] "focused less on religious arguments and was instead centred on countering the experience of colonial dispossession and opposing the Zionist enforcement of ethnic division of the indigenous population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jong|first1=Anne de|title=Zionist hegemony, the settler colonial conquest of Palestine and the problem with conflict: a critical genealogy of the notion of binary conflict|journal=Settler Colonial Studies|date=3 May 2017|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/2201473X.2017.1321171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian Christian owned [[Falastin (newspaper)|Falastin]] was founded in 1911 in the then Arab-majority city of [[Jaffa]]. The newspaper is often described as one of the most influential newspapers in historic Palestine, and probably the nation's fiercest and most consistent critic of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement. It helped shape Palestinian identity and [[Palestinian Nationalism|nationalism]] and was shut down several times by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|British]] authorities, most of the time due to complaints made by Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYADAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=rashid+khalidi+the+iron+cage&amp;hl=ar&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood|author=[[Rashid Khalidi]]|accessdate=25 January 2016|publisher=Beacon Press|date=9 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Anderson writes that Hope Simpson was also "wary of the gulf between Zionist rhetoric and practice, observing that 'The most lofty sentiments are ventilated in public meetings and in Zionist propaganda' but that the [[Jewish National Fund]] and other organs of the movement did not uphold or embody a vision of cooperation or mutual benefit with the Arabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Charles|title=The British Mandate and the crisis of Palestinian landlessness, 1929–1936|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=6 November 2017|pages=1–45|doi=10.1080/00263206.2017.1372427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Zionism in the Arab world emerged at the end of the 19th century, very soon after the First Zionist Congress was held in Basel in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beška |first=Emanuel |title=Responses Of Prominent Arabs Towards Zionist Aspirations And Colonization Prior To 1908 |journal=Asian and African Studies |volume=16 |issue= |year=2007 |url=https://www.academia.edu/5466913/RESPONSES_OF_PROMINENT_ARABS_TOWARDS_ZIONIST_ASPIRATIONS_AND_COLONIZATION_PRIOR_TO_1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only after the Young Turk revolution in 1908 did opposition to Zionism in Palestine and Greater Syria became widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beška |first=Emanuel |title=Political Opposition to Zionism in Palestine and Greater Syria: 1910–1911 as a Turning Point |journal=Jerusalem Quarterly |volume=59 |year=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/8377489/Political_Opposition_to_Zionism_in_Palestine_and_Greater_Syria_1910_1911_as_a_Turning_Point}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philosopher [[Michael Neumann]], Zionism as an "expansionist threat" has caused Arab hostility toward Israel and even antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Neumann, [http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann0604.html "What is antisemitism?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133837/http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann0604.html |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''[[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]]'', 4 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabist]] narratives in the 1960s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] era emphasized the idea of Palestine as a part of the [[Arab world]] taken by others.  In this narrative, the natural means of combating Zionism is Arab nations uniting and attacking Israel militarily.

Most [[Arab citizens of Israel]] do not have strong anti-Zionist views.  A poll of 507 [[Arab-Israeli]]s conducted by the [[Israeli Democracy Institute]] in 2007 found that 75 percent profess support for Israel's status as a [[Jewish and democratic state]] that guarantees equal rights for minorities.  Israeli Arab support for a constitution in general was 88 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853564.html |title=Poll of Arab-Israeli |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=23 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501032449/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853564.html |archivedate=1 May 2007 |df= }}&lt;!--not at archive.org --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Zionist Muslims consider the State of Israel as an intrusion into what many Muslims consider to be [[Dar al-islam|Dar al-Islam]], a domain they believe to be rightfully, and permanently, ruled only by Muslims due the fact it was historically conquered in the name of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Neusner |first=Jacob |authorlink=Jacob Neusner |title=Comparing Religions Through Law: Judaism and Islam |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-19487-3 }} p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Merkley |first=Paul Charles |title=Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel |year=2001 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |isbn=0-7735-2188-7 }} p.122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Akbarzadeh |first=Shahram |authorlink=Shahram Akbarzadeh |title=Islam And the West: Reflections from Australia |year=2005 |publisher=UNSW Press |isbn=0-86840-679-1 }} p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian and other Muslim groups, as well as the [[government of Iran]] (since the [[1979 Islamic Revolution]]), insist that the State of Israel is illegitimate and refuse to refer to it as "Israel", instead using the locution "the [[Zionist entity]]" (see [[Iran–Israel relations]]). Islamic maps of the Middle East frequently do not show the State of Israel. In an interview with ''[[Time Magazine]]'' in December 2006, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] said "Everyone knows that the Zionist regime is a tool in the hands of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom|British governments]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570714,00.html | work=Time | title=People Who Mattered: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad | date=16 December 2006 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Mohammed Amin al Husseini]] opposed the Jewish immigration to Palestine before the creation of the [[State of Israel]], and in several documented cases expressed his hostility toward Jews in general and Zionists in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/news/local_news/nazis-planned-holocaust-in-palestine-historians-29259.html |title=Nazis planned Holocaust in Palestine: historians |publisher=Expatica Germany |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Soviet anti-Zionism|Soviet Union and the Arab-Israeli conflict|History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union}}

During the last years of Stalin's rule, official support for the creation of Israel in 1948 was replaced by strong anti-zionism. The level of confrontation with those deemed as anti-Soviet "Jewish nationalists" was toned down after Stalin's death in 1953, but the official position of opposition to Zionism remained in force: the [[Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public]], as well as numerous other initiatives, were state-sponsored.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

As outlined in the third edition of the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (1969–1978), the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]'s position during the [[Cold War]] became: "the main posits of modern Zionism are militant [[chauvinism]], racism, [[anti-Communism]] and [[anti-Sovietism]], [...] overt and covert fight against freedom movements and the USSR."&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://encycl.yandex.ru/art.xml?art=bse/00071/37300.htm&amp;encpage=bse&amp;mrkp=http%3A//hghltd.yandex.com/yandbtm%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//encycl.yandex.ru/texts/bse/00071/37300.htm%26text%3D%25F1%25E8%25EE%25ED%25E8%25E7%25EC%26reqtext%3D%25F1%25E8%25EE%25ED%25E8%25E7%25EC%253A%253A781659%26%26isu%3D2 Сионизм], Большая советская энциклопедия (Zionism. [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition. 1969–1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
Anti-Zionist sentiments were also manifested in organisations such as the [[Organization for African Unity]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which passed resolutions condemning Zionism and equating it with racism and [[apartheid]] during the early 1970s. This culminated in the passing by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] of [[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]] in November 1975, which declared "Zionism is a form of racism."&lt;ref name="'70s 320"&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 320|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was revoked on 16 December 1991, when the General Assembly passed [[UN General Assembly Resolution 4686|Resolution 4686]], repealing resolution 3379, by a vote of 111 to 25, with 13 abstentions and 17 delegations absent. Thirteen out of the 19 Arab countries, including those engaged in negotiations with Israel, voted against the repeal, another six were absent. No Arab country voted for repeal. The [[Palestine Liberation Organisation]] denounced the vote. All of the ex-communist countries and most of the African countries who had supported Resolution 3379 voted to repeal it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/86 voting record|url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1393W3771T827.32837&amp;profile=voting&amp;uri=full=3100023~!480953~!65&amp;ri=3&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===African-American===
After [[Israel]] occupied [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] territory following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], some African-Americans supported the Palestinians and criticized Israel's actions, for example by publicly supporting Palestinian leader [[Yassir Arafat]] and calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Mark, "African American-Jewish Relations" in ''Antisemitism: a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution, Vol 1'', 2005. pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the war, the [[black power]] organization [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] published a newsletter criticizing Israel, and asserting that the war was an effort to regain Palestinian land and that during the 1948 war, "[[Zionists]] conquered the Arab homes and land through terror, force, and massacres."&lt;ref&gt;[[Clayborne Carson|Carson, Clayborne]], (1984) "Blacks and Jews in the Civil Rights movement: the Case of SNCC", in ''Strangers &amp; neighbors: relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States'', (Adams, Maurianne, Ed.), 2000., p. 583&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, philosopher [[Cornel West]] wrote: "Jews will not comprehend what the symbolic predicament and literal plight of Palestinians in Israel means to blacks.... Blacks often perceive the Jewish defense of the state of Israel as a second instance of naked group interest, and, again, an abandonment of substantive moral deliberation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornel West|West, Cornel]], ''Race Matters'', 1993, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; African-American support of Palestinians is frequently due to the consideration of Palestinians as people of color – political scientist [[Andrew Hacker]] writes: "The presence of Israel in the Middle East is perceived as thwarting the rightful status of people of color. Some blacks view Israel as essentially a white and European power, supported from the outside, and occupying space that rightfully belongs to the original inhabitants of Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hacker, Andrew]] (1999) "Jewish Racism, Black anti-Semitism", in ''Strangers &amp; neighbors: relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States'', Maurianne Adams (Ed.).

 |quote="Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish and non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." In addition, such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. [...] However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.

Professor [[Robert S. Wistrich]], head of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], is the originator of Marcus's second view of anti-Zionism (that anti-Zionism and antisemitism merged post-1948) argues that much contemporary anti-Zionism, particularly forms that compare Zionism and Jews with [[Hitler]] and the [[Third Reich]], has become a form of antisemitism: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Anti-Zionism has become the most dangerous and effective form of anti-Semitism in our time, through its systematic [[Delegitimization of Israel|delegitimization]], defamation, and demonization of Israel. Although not ''[[wiktionary:a priori|a priori]]'' anti-Semitic, the calls to dismantle the Jewish state, whether they come from Muslims, [[Left-wing|the Left]], or the radical [[Right-wing|Right]], increasingly rely on an anti-Semitic stereotypization of classic themes, such as the manipulative 'Jewish lobby,' the Jewish/Zionist 'world conspiracy,' and Jewish/Israeli "warmongers".&lt;ref name = "Wist3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Wistrich | first=Robert S. | authorlink = Robert S.

Nevertheless, I believe that the more radical forms of anti-Zionism that have emerged with renewed force in recent years do display unmistakable analogies to European anti-Semitism immediately preceding the [[Holocaust]].... For example, 'anti-Zionists' who insist on comparing Zionism and the Jews with Hitler and the Third Reich appear unmistakably to be de facto anti-Semites, even if they vehemently deny the fact! ... For if Zionists are 'Nazis' and if [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] really is Hitler, then it becomes a moral obligation to wage war against Israel.  ... Anti-Zionism is ... also the lowest common denominator and the bridge between the Left, the Right, and the militant Muslims; between the elites (including the media) and the masses; between the churches and the mosques; between an increasingly anti-American Europe and an endemically [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] Arab-Muslim Middle East; a point of convergence between conservatives and radicals and a connecting link between fathers and sons."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dina Porat]] (head of the [[Stephen Roth Institute|Institute for Study of Antisemitism and Racism]] at [[Tel-Aviv University]]) contends that anti-Zionism is antisemitic because it is discriminatory: &lt;blockquote&gt;... antisemitism is involved when the belief is articulated that of all the peoples on the globe (including the [[Palestinians]]), only the Jews should not have the right to self-determination in a land of their own. Or, to quote noted human rights lawyer [[David Matas]]: One form of antisemitism denies access of Jews to goods and services because they are Jewish. Another form of antisemitism denies the right of the Jewish people to exist as a people because they are Jewish. Antizionists distinguish between the two, claiming the first is antisemitism, but the second is not. To the antizionist, the Jew can exist as an individual as long as Jews do not exist as a people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dina Porat]], [http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/porat.htm#_edn23 ''Defining Anti-Semitism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403165405/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/porat.htm |date=3 April 2008 }}, Retrieved 15 November 2008.

[[United Kingdom|British]] sociologist [[David Hirsh]] wrote a book called ''Contemporary Left Antisemitism'' in which he studied anti-Zionism [[Empiricism|empirically]].  Philosophically, one might privately find under a set of theoretical circumstances that it is possible to be an anti-Zionist without being an antisemite, but according to Hirsh's book, "When anti-Zionism gets a foothold [in an organization] and becomes popular and normal and legitimate, it brings antisemitism with it."&lt;ref name="Halpern" /&gt;

In July 2001, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] reported that during a visit there, German Foreign Minister [[Joschka Fischer]] stated, "anti-Zionism inevitably leads to antisemitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/s/content.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4442915&amp;ct=5850509 |title=accessed Nov 2008 |publisher=Wiesenthal Center |date=17 July 2001 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Center observed in a newsletter introducing its report on North American campus life, that 'virulent anti-Zionism is often a thinly-veiled disguise for virulent anti-Semitism'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wiesenthal.com/anti-semitism-on-campus |title= Anti-Semitism on Campus: A Clear and Present Danger |publisher=Wiesenthal Center |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of conspiracies involving the Holocaust have been advanced.

In 1968, the East German communist paper [[Neues Deutschland]] justified the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] with the headline "In Prague Zionism is in power".&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Wiesenthal]], Justice not Vengeance, Mandarin 1989 page 207&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, William Korey released a work titled ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism''. Korey's central argument is that the [[Soviet Union]] promoted an "official [[Judeophobic]] propaganda campaign" under the guise of anti-Zionism from 1967 to 1986; after this program was shut down by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], a populist and chauvinist group called [[Pamyat]] emerged in the more open climate of [[Glasnost]] to promote an openly antisemitic message.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Korey]], ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism'', Routledge, 1995, pp. ix–x.&lt;/ref&gt; Korey also argues that much official late-period Soviet antisemitism may be traced back to the influence of ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion''. He notes, for instance, that a 1977 Soviet work titled ''International Zionism: History and Politics'' contains the allegation that most major Wall Street financial institutions are "large financial-industrial Jewish monopolies" exercising control over many countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Korey]], ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism'', Routledge, 1995, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Russian antisemitism'' was reviewed by Robert O. Freedman in the ''Slavic Review''; while he concurs with the book's central thesis, Freedman nevertheless writes that the actual extent of Soviet antisemitism may have been less than Korey suggests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Freedman (political scientist)|Robert O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21038">A '''bail bondsman''', '''bail bondsperson''',  '''bail bond agent''' or '''bond dealer''' is any person, agency or corporation that will act as a [[surety]] and pledge money or property as [[bail]] for the appearance of a [[defendant]] in court. Although [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies and other similar institutions are usually the sureties on other types of contracts (for example, to bond a contractor who is under a contractual obligation to pay for the completion of a construction project), such entities are reluctant to put their depositors' or policyholders' funds at the kind of risk involved in posting a bail bond. Bail bond agents, on the other hand, are usually in the business to cater to defendants, often securing their customers' release in just a few hours.

Bail bond agents are almost exclusively found in the [[United States]] and its former commonwealth, the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; In most other countries the practice of [[bounty hunter|bounty hunting]] is illegal.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Liptak |authorlink=Adam Liptak |title=Illegal Globally, Bail for Profit Remains in U.S. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/us/29bail.html |work=U.S. |publisher=The New York Times |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2008-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry is represented by various [[trade association]]s, with the (PBUS) Professional Bail Agents of the United States and the American Bail Coalition forming an umbrella group for bail agents and surety companies, and the National Association of Fugitive Recovery Agents representing the Bounty Hunting industry in the United States. Most legal entities, including the [[American Bar Association]] and the National District Attorneys Association, do not approve of bail bondsmen. They think that it discriminates against poor and middle-class defendants while doing nothing for public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/us/29bail.html|title=Illegal Globally, Bail for Profit Remains in U.S.|last=Liptak|first=Adam|work=The New York Times|date=2008-01-29|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first modern bail bonds business in the U.S. was established by [[Peter P. McDonough]] in [[San Francisco]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes|first1=Meritt|title=Corruption Central: Peter P. McDonough|website=FoundSF|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, clay tablets from ca. 2750 BC describe surety bail bond agreements made in the Akkadian city of [[Eshnunna]]  what is today modern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Willis D. [http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1251&amp;context=clr "The History and Economics of Suretyship."] Cornell Law Review, 12.2, February 1927, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens were released from jail by having an indemnitor pay a sum in currency and to pledge the defendant will show up to court backed by the indemnitor's property such as his sheep. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Modern practice==
Based on 1996 figures, one quarter of all released felony defendants [[failure to appear|fail to appear]] at trial, but those released via bail bond appear more frequently than other defendants.&lt;ref name=helland&gt;Eric Helland and Alexander Tabarrok. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071009220335/http://www.americanbailcoalition.com/pdf_files/PublicvsPrivate.pdf/  "The Fugitive: Evidence on Public versus Private Law Enforcement from Bail Jumping."] The Journal of Law and Economics 2004; 47(1), 93-122. DOI: 10.1086/378694&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bond agents, also referred to as "bond dealers"&lt;ref name=helland/&gt; have a standing security agreement with local court officials, in which they agree to post an irrevocable "blanket" bond, which will pay the court if any defendant for whom the bond agent is responsible does not appear. The bond agent usually has an arrangement with an insurance company, bank or another credit provider to draw on such security, even during hours when the bank is not operating. This eliminates the need for the bondsman to deposit cash or property with the court every time a new defendant is bailed out. The laws on bail bonds are generally inconsistent throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=Watson&amp;Labe&gt;Watson J, Labe LJ. (2001). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ngb1lNMGqVEC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127 Ch. 8 Bail Bonds]". In: ''The Law of Miscellaneous and Commercial Surety Bonds''. Eds. Todd C. Kazlow, Bruce C. King.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal laws affecting it include the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (which contains the [[Excessive Bail Clause]]) and the Bail Reform Act of 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Keller D. (2008). [http://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&amp;context=flr Resolving a "Substantial Question": Just Who is Entitled to Bail Pending Appeal under the Bail Reform Act of 1984?]. ''Florida Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was included in the [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984]]. The Uniform Criminal Extradition Act sponsored by the [[Uniform Law Commission]] is widely adopted.&lt;ref name=Watson&amp;Labe/&gt;

All bail bond agents have lengthy bail bond agreements. All agreements in California are to be verified and certified by the California Department of Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0200-industry/0050-renew-license/0200-requirements/bail-agent.cfm |title=Bail Agent |publisher=Insurance.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most bail bond agreements are given to the bail bond agents by their insurers, and the insurers have already verified and certified all bail bond agreements for their agents.{{citation needed||date=March 2016}}

Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon and Wisconsin have outlawed commercial bail bonds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/us/29bail.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1 ''Illegal Globally, Bail for Profit Remains in U.S.''], Adam Liptak, 29Jan2008, The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training and requirements===
"There are 18 states where theoretically anyone can become a bail recovery agent..."&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; In most jurisdictions, bond agents have to be licensed to carry on business within the state. Some insurance companies may offer insurance coverage that includes local bail bonds for traffic related arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hidden Benefits of Car Insurance|url=https://www.namic.org/Home/PrintContentById/866e25f3-0a47-4dbb-b227-729c25eaa488|website=National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies|accessdate=10 July 2017|date=28 February 2001}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides an extra service to their members, and frees the member from needing immediate cash.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Long time bail agents have said that they have never posted a bail bond through AAA, because AAA does not cover any arrest involving drugs or alcohol. AAA drivers who are stopped for traffic infractions are given tickets and those who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol are arrested without AAA covering their release from jail.{{citation needed||date=March 2016}}

=== Pricing ===
Bond agents generally charge a fee of 10% for a state charge and 15% for a federal bail bond, with a minimum of $100 in some states like Florida, required in order to post a bond for the full amount of the bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Does Bail Cost|url=https://www.aboutbail.com/pages/bail-cost|website=AboutBail|publisher=Lawgical|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fee is not refundable and represents the bond agents' compensation for their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moving Beyond Money: A Primer on Bail Reform|url=http://cjpp.law.harvard.edu/assets/FINAL-Primer-on-Bail-Reform.pdf|website=Criminal Justice Policy Program|publisher=Harvard Law School|accessdate=10 July 2017|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states, such as North Carolina, charge a flat 15% where other states that charge 10% can also bill the defendant for phone calls, gas, mileage, anything that has to do with the apprehension of the subject, etc.{{citation needed||date=March 2016}}

In Connecticut, bail bond costs are set by the Connecticut Insurance Department. A bondsman can arrange a payment plan with a minimum 35% down payment. Any unpaid balance must be paid within 15 months from the time of bail.{{citation needed||date=March 2016}}

Nevada bail bondsmen collect 15% and fall under some of the more strict guidelines in the nation. For example, Nevada law does not allow agents to collect renewal premiums for bonds held open for more than one year.

Nevada is one of the states which allow an arrestee to 'put up' a residence for a bail bond. To do this, the applicant needs to register a deed of trust and name the bonding agency as beneficiary. While this gives the bail company a lien on the property, they can only take ownership if the defendant fails to comply with all court instructions and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRS 697.320.  Collateral|url=https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-697.html#NRS697Sec320|website=Nevada Revised Statutes|publisher=Nevada State Legislature|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states such as Florida, this is not the case. Bondsmen are responsible for paying the forfeitures, and if they do not pay the full amount, they can no longer write bonds in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/Chapter648/All|title=Chapter 648 - 2011 Florida Statutes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative, some courts have recently instituted a practice of accepting 10% of the bond amount in cash, for example, by requiring a $10,000 bond or $1,000 in cash. In jurisdictions where the 10% cash alternative is available, a deposit with the court is usually returned if the case is concluded without violation of the conditions of bail.{{citation needed||date=March 2016}}

For large bail amounts, bond agents can generally obtain security against the assets of the defendant or persons willing to assist the defendant. For example, for a $100,000 bond for a person who owns a home, the bond agent would charge $10,000 and take a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] against the house for the full penal sum of the bond.{{citation needed||date=March 2016}}

=== Recovery and bounty hunting ===
If the defendant fails to appear in court, the bond agent is allowed by law or contractual arrangement to bring the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court in order to recover the money paid out under the bond, usually through the use of a [[bounty hunter]]. "Only the Philippines has a surety bail system similar in structure and function [as the US]."&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;Johnson, Brian R., and Ruth S. Stevens. [http://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/scjpeerpubs/3/ "The Regulation and Control of Bail Recovery Agents: An Exploratory Study."] Criminal Justice Review 38, no. 2 (2013): 190-206.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|193}} In the past, courts in Australia, India and South Africa had disciplined lawyers for professional misconduct for setting up commercial bail arrangements.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Some states, such as North Carolina, have outlawed the use or licensing of "bounty hunters" so each bail bondsman must re-apprehend their own fugitives. The bond agent is also allowed to sue the indemnitors, any persons who guaranteed the defendants appearance in court, and or defendant for any money forfeited to the court should the defendant fail to appear.{{Clarify|date=April 2009|reason=it is unclear if this refers strictly to NC or to all or many states}}

=== Alternatives and controversy ===
{{as of| 2007}} four states—[[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], [[Oregon]], and [[Wisconsin]]—had completely banned commercial bail bonding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/prfdsc.pdf|title=Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants in State Courts|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics|date=November 2007|accessdate=2012-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104030210/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/prfdsc.pdf|archive-date=2012-11-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually substituting the 10% cash deposit alternative described above. Some of these states specifically allow [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] and similar organizations to continue providing bail bond services pursuant to insurance contracts or membership agreements.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} While not outright illegal, the practice of bail bond services has effectively ended in Massachusetts as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Contrada|first1=Fred |title=Bail bondsmen are a thing of the past in Massachusetts|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/bail_bondsmen_are_a_thing_of_t.html|website=MassLive|accessdate=11 July 2017|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the US legal establishment, including the American Bar Association and the National District Attorneys Association, dislikes the bail bond business, saying it discriminates against poor and middle-class defendants, does nothing for public safety, and usurps decisions that ought to be made by the justice system.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Charitable bail funds have sprung up to combat the issue of discrimination, using donations to cover the bail amount for the arrested person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santo|first1=Alysia|title=Bail Reformers Aren’t Waiting for Bail Reform|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/08/23/bail-reformers-aren-t-waiting-for-bail-reform|website=The Marshall Project|accessdate=13 April 2018|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economically discriminatory effect of the bond system has been controversial and subject to attempts at reform since the 1910s. The market evidence indicates that judges in setting bail demanded lower probabilities of flight from minority defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/can-bail-bond-dealers-reduce-discrimination-a-guest-post/|work=The New York Times|title=Can Bail Bond Dealers Reduce Discrimination?

This is because a bail bondsman will not find it profitable to work on matters where the percentage of profit would yield $10 or $20. As such, bail bondsmen help release people with higher amounts of bail who are also charged with higher crimes, creating an imbalance in the numbers of people charged with minor crimes (low level misdemeanors) and increasing jail expenditures for this category of crimes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/01/21/122725771/Bail-Burden-Keeps-U-S-Jails-Stuffed-With-Inmates |publisher=National Public Radio |title=Bail Burden Keeps U.S. Jails Stuffed With Inmates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several high-profile cases involving bondsman misconduct have led to calls for increased regulation of the industry or outright abolition of the bail for profit industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/22400708/detail.html |title=Woman Suing Bail Bondsman Accused Of Raping Her |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511105642/http://www.wftv.com/news/22400708/detail.html |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-03-26/news/bal-tillman0327_1_milton-tillman-iii-defrauding-tax-returns|title=Bail bondsman accused of defrauding government appears in court |work=Baltimore Sun|date=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.myfoxla.com/dpp/news/local/bail-bondsman-accused-of-kidnapping-client-over-debt-20101020|title=Bail Bondsman Accused of Kidnapping Client|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404024919/http://www.myfoxla.com/dpp/news/local/bail-bondsman-accused-of-kidnapping-client-over-debt-20101020|archivedate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://da.lacounty.gov/mr/archive/2010/070110a.htm |title=Bail Bondsman Accused of Embezzling Funds From a Client |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104445/http://da.lacounty.gov/mr/archive/2010/070110a.htm |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most prominent cases, in Louisiana, involved bribery of judges by a bail bonding agency.

In addition to the use of bail bonds, a defendant may be released under other terms. These alternatives include [[pretrial services programs]], [[own recognizance]] or signature bond, [[Bail#Forms 2|cash bond]], [[Bail#Forms 2|surety bond]],&lt;!-- Is this redundant to bail bond? --&gt; [[Bail#Forms 2|property bond]], and [[Summons#Citation|citation release]]. The choice of these alternatives is determined by the court.{{citation needed||date=March 2016}}

In California a landmark case governing commercial free speech was decided on November 5, 2013, which upheld the conviction of Bail Bondsman Todd Russell Dolezal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PEOPLE v DOLEZAL |url = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1648801.html|accessdate = 2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; after his felony arrest by the California Department of Insurance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = California Department of Insurance|url = http://www.insurance.ca.gov/|website = www.insurance.ca.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation Division, Senior Investigator Gulcher&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Investigation Division Overview|url = https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0300-fraud/0200-invest-division-overview/|website = www.insurance.ca.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for bail solicitation. Under ''Dolezal v.

The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the practice of bail bonds as a form of injustice against low income communities  and fueling mass incarceration of innocent people with the ACLU recommending automated text messages or robocalls for court appearances&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/059_bail_report_2_1.pdf |title=$elling Off Our Freedom|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bankruptcy]] is a legally declared inability or impairment of ability of an individual or organization to pay their [[creditor]]s. In most cases [[personal bankruptcy]] is initiated by the bankrupt individual.  Bankruptcy is a legal process that discharges most debts, but has the disadvantage of making it more difficult for an individual to borrow in the future.  To avoid the negative impacts of personal bankruptcy, individuals in debt have a number of '''bankruptcy alternatives'''.

== Take no action ==

Bankruptcy prevents a person's creditors from obtaining a [[Legal judgment|judgment]] against them.  With a judgment a [[creditor]] can attempt to [[garnishment|garnish]] wages or seize certain types of property.  However, if a [[debtor]] has no wages (because they are [[Unemployment|unemployed]] or [[Retirement|retired]]) and has no property, they are "[[judgment proof]]", meaning a judgment would have no impact on their financial situation.  Creditors typically do not initiate legal action against a debtor with no assets, because it is unlikely they could collect the judgment.

If enough time passes, seven years in most jurisdictions, the debt is removed from the debtor's [[credit history]].

A [[debtor]] with no assets or income cannot be garnished by a [[creditor]], and therefore the "Take No Action" approach may be the correct option, particularly if the debtor does not expect to have a steady income or property a creditor could attempt to seize.

==Self money management==

[[Debt]] is a result of spending more than one's income in a given period.  To reduce debt, the most obvious solution is to reduce monthly spending to allow extra cash flow to service debt.  This can be done by creating a [[personal budget]] and analyzing expenses to find areas to reduce expenses.

Most people, when reviewing a written list of their monthly expenses, can find ways to reduce expenses.  Common areas for expense reduction would include reducing food expenses by eating out less often, taking public transportation instead of driving a car, and eliminating enhanced telephone and cable television services.

== Negotiate with creditors ==

Creditors understand that [[bankruptcy]] is an option for debtors with excessive debt, so most creditors are willing to negotiate a settlement so that they receive a portion of their money, instead of risking losing everything in a bankruptcy.

Negotiation is a viable alternative if the debtor has sufficient income, or has assets that can be liquidated so that the proceeds can be applied against the debt.  Negotiation may also buy the debtor some time to rebuild their finances.

For a business, a restructuring agreed with the creditors is a common approach but this requires the agreement of all creditors.&lt;ref name="EkvallSmiley2007"&gt;{{citation|author1=Lei Lei Ekvall|author2=Evan Smiley|title=Bankruptcy for Businesses: Benefits, Pitfalls and Alternatives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74KzPHVvcc8C|date=17 April 2007|publisher=Entrepreneur Press|isbn=978-1-59918-096-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debt restructuring ==
[[Debt restructuring]] is a process that allows a private or public company - or a sovereign entity - facing cash flow problems and [[financial distress]], to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent debts in order to improve or restore liquidity and rehabilitate so that it can continue its operations.

Out-of court restructurings, also known as workouts, are increasingly becoming a global reality. A debt restructuring is usually less expensive and a preferable alternative to bankruptcy. The main costs associated with a business debt restructuring are the time and effort to negotiate with bankers, creditors, vendors and tax authorities. Debt restructurings typically involve a reduction of debt and an extension of payment terms.

== Debt consolidation ==

Debt is a problem if the interest payments are greater than the debtor can afford. [[Debt consolidation]] typically involves borrowing from one lender (typically a bank), at a low rate of interest, sufficient funds to repay a number of higher interest rate debts (such as [[credit cards]]).  By consolidating debts, the debtor replaces many payments to many different creditors with one monthly payment to one creditor, thereby simplifying their monthly budget. In addition, the lower interest rate means that more of the debtor's monthly payment is applied against the principal of the loan, resulting in faster debt repayment.  It may be necessary to have a co-signor or other security, such as a car, if the borrower's credit is not sufficient on their own.

== Formal proposal to creditors ==

If the debtor cannot deal with their debt problems through personal budgeting, negotiation with creditors, or debt consolidation, the final bankruptcy alternative is a formal proposal or deal with the creditors.

Different countries have different legal procedures for compromising debts.  In the United States, a debtor can file a [[Chapter 13]] Wager Earner Plan.  The plan will typically last for up to five years, during which time the debtor makes payments that are distributed to their creditors.

In Canada, a Consumer Proposal can be filed with the assistance of a government-licensed proposal administrator.  Forty-five days after filing the proposal the creditors vote on the proposal, which is considered accepted if more than half of the creditors, by dollar value, vote to approve the proposal.

== Individual Voluntary Arrangement ==

In the UK the [[individual voluntary arrangement]] (IVA) represents the main formal alternative to a debtors bankruptcy petition. The IVA is part of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] and essentially allows a debtor to reach a formal repayment arrangement with their creditors usually over a 5-year period. In most cases the debtor does not repay their debts in full to their creditors however the IVA proposal essentially allows for any remaining debt to be written off by the creditors at the end of the 5 year repayment period. As with bankruptcy petitions the number of IVA proposals has been increasing rapidly in the UK in recent years.

The '''Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law''' is a national legal-advocacy organization representing people with mental disabilities in the US. Originally known as '''The Mental Health Law Project''', the Center was founded as a national public-interest organization in 1972 by a group of specialized attorneys and mental disability professionals &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bazelon.org/about/who-we-are/&lt;/ref&gt; who were working to help the court define a constitutional right to treatment in terms of specific standards for services and protections.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |title=Our History - An Overview |website=Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law |url=http://www.bazelon.org/Who-We-Are/History.aspx |access-date=November 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the organization changed its name to the Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law to honor the legacy of [[David L. Bazelon|Judge David L. Bazelon]], whose decisions as Chief Judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] had pioneered the field of mental health law.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==Litigation==
The Center's precedent-setting litigation has established important civil rights for people with mental illnesses or developmental disabilities. These include the right to treatment in ''[[Wyatt v. Stickney]]'' (decided in 1971 and successfully concluded in 1999),&lt;ref name="Wyatt"&gt;{{cite press release |first=John C. |last=Ziegler |date=December 8, 2003 |title=Historic Wyatt Case Ends |url=http://www.mh.state.al.us/admin/downloads/MediaCenterDocuments/PR_31208_HistoricWyattCaseEnds.asp |publisher=[[Alabama Department of Mental Health|Alabama Department of Mental Health &amp; Mental Retardation]] |access-date=December 13, 2006 |archive-date=December 10, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210020308/http://www.mh.state.al.us/admin/downloads/MediaCenterDocuments/PR_31208_HistoricWyattCaseEnds.asp |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Supreme Court's 1999 ''[[Olmstead v. L.C.]] ex rel. Zimring'' decision affirming the right of people with disabilities to receive public services in the most integrated setting consistent with their needs.&lt;ref name="Olmstead"&gt;[http://www.bazelon.org/Where-We-Stand/Community-Integration/Olmstead-.aspx ''Olmstead'' decision] information site at Bazelon Center, accessed online December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal policy==
The Center also engages in federal policy advocacy, working with Congress and the administrative agencies to ensure, for example, that people with mental disabilities are included under the protections of the [[Americans with disabilities act|Americans with Disabilities Act]] and amendments to the federal [[Fair Housing Act of 1968|Fair Housing Act]], and to generate resources such as [[Supplemental Security Income]] and [[Medicaid]] that can enable them to live and thrive in the community. In 2009, a major thrust was the integration of mental health in healthcare reform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bazelon.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1-25-2017-M-Murphy-Hire.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Bazelon Center's publications include reports; issue papers; law, regulation, and policy analyses; advocacy manuals; and consumer-friendly guides to legal rights. These are available for free download from the center's website, or print copies may be ordered by postal mail, telephone, or email.&lt;ref name=publications&gt;{{cite web |title=Publications |website=Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law |url=http://www.bazelon.org/News-Publications/Publications.aspx |access-date=November 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17350">'''CNCD Decision 323/2006''' is a decision of [[Romania|Romania's]] [[National Council for Combating Discrimination]] (CNCD) regarding the display of religious symbols in public schools. The decision was brought to the CNCD by Emil Moise, a teacher and parent from [[Buzău County]], who stated that the public display of [[Romanian Orthodox icons|Orthodox icons]] in classrooms constitutes an infringement of Romania's [[separation of church and state]] and discriminates against atheist, agnostic and non-religious people.

On November 21, 2006, the CNCD upheld Moise's complaint, ruling that the [[Ministry of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Ministry of Education]], who operates public schools, must "respect the secular character of the state and the autonomy of religion" and that "religious symbols must only be shown during religion lessons or in areas dedicated exclusively to religious education." On June 11, 2008, the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice (Romania)|High Court of Cassation and Justice]] ruled that the presence of icons in schools is legal, in effect overturning the CNCD's decision.

==History==

In 2005, Emil Moise (who affirms himself to be Christian-Orthodox)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-11-18&amp;id=211404 Emil Moise a dat în judecată Inspectoratul Judeţean] (''Emil Moise has sued the County Inspectorate''), ''[[Ziua]]'', 18 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; took the Buzău County School Inspectorate to court due to the presence of Romanian Orthodox icons in his daughter's school, the Margareta Sterian Art High School in [[Buzău]]. He claimed that the presence of such religious symbols in a state institution is an infringement of Romania's constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. The Buzău County Court ruled on March 27, 2005, in Decision 157/2005, that:

{{quote|The existence of religious symbols on the walls of school chancelleries, halls and classrooms does not infringe the fundamental rights of freedom of conscience, thought and the freedom of religious belief, and that of equality in student's rights, and does not represent a discriminatory situation for the plaintiff's daughter, a student at the Margareta Sterian Art High School in Buzău, who attends religion classes. It must be noted that in the case of this educational institution there exists a special situation in comparison to other schools run by the Buzău County School Inspectorate, in that the majority of icons exhibited in this institutions are elaborate works of the high school's students and are considered objects of art."}}

In this way, the County Court rejected Moise's complaint, upholding the maintenance of the religious symbols in the Margareta Sterian Art High School. Moise appealed to the Ploieşti Court of Appeals, which upheld the County Court's decision on July 20, 2006.

In July 2006, Moise filed a complaint at the National Council for Combating Discrimination, or CNCD, Romania's anti-discrimination and equality watchdog, claiming discrimination on the basis of religion under Romania's anti-discrimination law of 2000, and asking for the removal of religious symbols from all Romanian public education institutions.

On November 13, 2006, a number of Romanian non-governmental organisations sent a letter to the CNCD backing Moise's complaint. These included the Pro Democratia Association, the [[Noesis Cultural Society]], the Education 2000+ Centre, the Centre for International Studies, [[Accept (organization)|Accept]], the Agency for Press Monitoring, the Pro Europa League, the Centre for Juridical Resources, the Centre for Independent Journalism and the Solidarity for Freedom of Conscience. The political analyst [[Cristian Pârvulescu]], the human rights activist [[Renate Weber]] and the Romanian branch of [[Indymedia]] also supported the complaint.
&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Petrescu et al., [http://romania.indymedia.org/ro/2006/11/1713.shtml Scrisoare catre CNCD re: simboluri religioase] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102035609/http://www.romania.indymedia.org/ro/2006/11/1713.shtml |date=2007-01-02 }} ("Letter to the CNCD re: religious symbols"), Indymedia Româna, 13 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2006, Emil Moise was interviewed at the CNCD's headquarters in Bucharest. On the same date, the Secretary of State for Religious Affairs, Adrian Lemeni, also made a submission to the CNCD, asking that the religious symbols be maintained in schools. He argued that Orthodox icons were not an object of "religious veneration", but rather a symbol of freedom, "as well as having a powerful national symbols, being considered expressions of Romania's spiritual and cultural heritage." He concluded by saying that:

{{quote|We consider, in principle, that the display of religious symbols on the public walls of educational institutions does not constitute a breach of other people's rights and liberties so as to necessitate their removal, a solution which has not been adopted in any other European state with traditions similar to those of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvati-icoanele.info/2006/11/21/scrisoarea-secretarului-de-stat-pentru-culte-adrian-lemeni-catre-cncd/ Poziţia Secretarului de Stat pentru Culte Adrian Lemeni la audierea din comisia CNCD] (''The position of the Secretary of State for Religious Affairs, Adrian Lemeni'')&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Decision==

The CNCD's decision on Moise's complaint was made on November 21, 2006. On this date, the organisation disclosed a press release outlining that its decision and stating that a more complete explanation will be available in 15 days, according to law. The decision stipulated that:

{{quote|the Ministry of Education must elaborate and implement an internal regulation, in a reasonable amount of time, that regulates the presence of religious symbols in institutions of public education. This internal norm must be based on the following principles:

# It must assure the right to education and access to culture on the basis of equality;
# It must respect the right of parents to assure their children's education based on their religious and philosophical beliefs;
# It must respect the secular character of the state and the autonomy of religions;
# It must assure the freedom of religion, conscience and beliefs of all children on the basis of equality;
# '''Religious symbols may only be displayed during religious education classes and in areas intended exclusively for religious education'''.}}

The CNCD's president, [[Csaba Ferenc Asztalos]], stated that "[Through this decision], we recognised the relationship between the state and religions in Romania; we haven't touched on the historical recognition of the contributions of Christianity to the formation of the Romanian people. Now we call on the state, through the Ministry of Education, to assume its responsibilities on what happens in schools in this respect."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2006/11/061122_simboluri_religioase_romania.shtml Şcoala - cu sau fără simboluri religioase?] (''School - with or without religious symbols?''), [[BBC]] Romanian Service, November 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

The CNCD decision provoked widespread public debate on the issue of religious symbols of public schools, and also on the overall role of religion in Romanian society.

===Emil Moise===

Emil Moise lauded the CNCD's decision to uphold his complaint, claiming it was "an extraordinary result" in the separation between church and state, and that "this is what the legislation for combating discrimination states". He also declared that, "the Ministry of Education has a single thing to do now: to respect the CNCD's recommendation. Otherwise, I will return to court..."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

===Government===

After the CNCD's ruling, the [[Ministry of Education and Research of Romania|Ministry of Education and Research]] responded that "due to the special character of the decisions which must be taken", it would send the ruling to the Education Commission of the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] for debate. After the CNCD decision was fully published, the Ministry issued a comment stating it will not implement the CNCD's decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.ro/index.php/pressrel/7103/(''Prezenţa simbolurilor religioase în şcoli trebuie să fie decisă de comunitate, de părinţii elevilor şi, nu în ultimul rând, de şcoală'')]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 12 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious groups===

The Patriarchate of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] issued a press release on November 23, 2006 criticising the CNCD decision as an attack on "freedom of religion". The release stated that "the presence of religious symbols in schools is not the result of an imposition, but rather of the desire and consent of parents, teachers and students in conformity with the religious and cultural values which they share. Consequently, a decision to exclude [these symbols] would represent a brutal and unjustified measure of restraining religious liberty, contrary to European democratic principles. Such a decision would lead to the discrimination of Romanian [religious] believers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriarhia.ro/Stiri/2006/115.html Comunicat de presă - 23 noiembrie 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109021730/http://www.patriarhia.ro/Stiri/2006/115.html |date=2007-01-09 }} (''Press release - 23 November 2006''), Patriarchy of the Romanian Orthodox Church&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the spokesperson of the Orthodox Church, Constantin Stoica, declared that the issue of religious symbols in schools should be resolved by local communities and not be regulated by "neither the Church, nor the Ministry of Education, nor the CNCD". He also declared that "just as the majority must respect the rights of minorities, minorities must also respect the rights of the majority",&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; echoing the Church's line that the CNCD decision went against Romania's Orthodox majority, which forms approximately 87% of the population according to the 2002 census.

Other religious groups also criticised the CNCD's decision. The [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]] Archbishopric of Bucharest characterised the decision as "abusive and discriminatory" and going against the "sensibilities and religious freedoms of the Romanian people". The [[Armenian Orthodox Church]] in Romania compared the decision to a nihilistic stance, and stated that while "Emil Moise wishes to be a defender of the rights of atheist children... the atheist is indifferent, neutral, on the subject of symbols of the divinity; he denies rather than combats God."&lt;ref name="religious-response"&gt;[http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-11-29&amp;id=211988 Doar CNCD şi Moise din Buzău sunt ofensaţi de icoane] (''Just the CNCD and Emil Moise from Buzău are offended by icons''), ''[[Ziua]]'', 29 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murat Yusuf]], the mufti of [[Islam in Romania|Romania's small Islamic community]] opposed the decision, saying that Romania was an example of religious tolerance and co-existence, and that such a law was hence unnecessary. He stated that the Muslim community has lived for "more than eight centuries in these lands" and "the existence of other religious symbols in public institutions never bothered us and does not bother us now."&lt;ref name="religious-response" /&gt;

Speaking on behalf of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|even smaller Jewish community]], Aurel Vainer, who represents the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania in [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Parliament]], noted that "the Romanian people is in large part a Christian people" and characterised the debate as one that "serves no purpose in our country." He described the presence of icons as "a right won by Romania's Christians" and saw no hindrance to their continued display in schools.&lt;ref name="religious-response" /&gt;

===Civic Media petition===

On November 22, 2006, an online petition was started by Civic Media, a journalism [[NGO]], with the aim of overturning the CNCD decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvati-icoanele.info/2006/11/20/catre-guvernul-romaniei/ Petiţie-scrisoare deschisă pentru păstrarea simbolurilor religioase în şcoli]&lt;/ref&gt; The petition stated that the decision was "anti-European", "anti-religious" and "discriminatory" to Romania's Orthodox majority. It also cited court rulings in Italy and Greece which upheld the right of public schools to display Christian symbols such as crosses. The petition was signed by more than 3,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civicmedia.ro/acm/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=41 Semnaţi pentru icoanele din şcoli!] (''Sign for the icons in schools''), Civic Media petition&lt;/ref&gt; Civic Media, founded in 2000, has been involved in conservative religious campaigning before, starting a similar petition in 2006 to prevent the construction of a modern shopping centre near St Joseph's Cathedral ([[Roman Catholic]]) in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civicmedia.ro/acm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=37 Despre Civic Media] (''About Civic Media'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The petition was also supported by roughly 150 organisations like Altermedia, and the Romanian Association for Heritage or the ROST Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ionel Dâncu, [http://www.9am.ro/stiri-revista-presei/A/54327/Urmasii-lui-Zelea-Codreanu-iau-cu-asalt-Romania Urmasii lui Zelea Codreanu iau cu asalt Romania], ''Curentul'', 6 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ionut Dulamita, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=9888&amp;art=26229&amp;cHash=81635d41ae Ura da in clocot pe Internet], ''[[Cotidianul]], 27 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian Mîndruţă, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=124&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=1544 Ţara necunoscută.

Giurescu]], [[Constantin Bălăceanu-Stolnici]]), the president of the [[National Initiative Party]], [[Cozmin Guşă]], and the youth wing of the [[Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (Romania)|Christian-Democratic People's Party]]. Two major teachers unions (the National Education Federation and Spiru Haret Union, with almost 120,000 members) and three major media organisations endorsed the petition (MediaSind Media Union, the Romanian Journalists' Society and The Romanian Union of Professional Journalists).

Civic Media also stated that they will appeal the CNCD's decision in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicmedia.ro/?p=28 Civic Media contestă categoric decizia CNCD anti-religie, inclusiv în instanţă] (''Civic Media categorically contests the CNCD's anti-religious decision, including in court''), Civic Media, 22 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overturning of CNCD Decision===

On June 11, 2008, the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice (Romania)|High Court of Cassation and Justice]] ruled that the presence of icons in schools is legal, in effect overturning the CNCD's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/social/icoanele-raman-in-scoli-prezenta-lor-este-legala-2705772 "Icoanele rămân în şcoli, prezenţa lor este legală"], Mediafax, 12 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling has been confirmed later in a separate cause brought before the Court by another NGO, "Pro-vita".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.salvati-icoanele.info/2009/05/27/decizia-anti-simboluri-religioase-a-cncd-anulata-a-doua-oara/ "Decizia anti-simboluri religioase a CNCD, anulată a doua oară"], 27 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v Canada (AG)''''', [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, 2004 SCC 4 - known also as the '''spanking case''' - is a leading [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] where the Court upheld section 43 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] that allowed for a defence for assaulting children as not in violation of [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]], [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 12]] or [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15(1)]] of the Charter.

== Background ==

The Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law ("Foundation") applied for a declaration to strike-down section 43 of the Criminal Code which states, under the section entitled "Protection of Persons in Authority", 
{{quote|43. Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances.}}
 
The basis of which is because the provision violates: 
# section 7 of the Canadian Charter because it fails to give procedural protections to children, does not further the best interests of the child, and is both overbroad and vague; 
# section 12 of the Charter because it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment or treatment; 
# section 15(1) of the Charter because it denies children the legal protection against assaults that is accorded to adults.

== Ruling ==
The Supreme Court handed down its 6 to 3 decision on January 30, 2004.

The majority opinion was written by [[Beverley McLachlin|Chief Justice McLachlin]] with Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache and LeBel JJ. concurring.

=== Section 7 ===

Section 7 protects individuals from violation of their personal security. McLachlin found that there was no violation of the section. The Crown had conceded that the law adversely affected the child's [[security of person]], so the issue was whether the violation offended a principle of [[fundamental justice]]. The Foundation proposes three claims as mentioned above. McLachlin rejected the first claim that it failed to give procedural protection as children receive all the same protection as anyone else. On the second claim, she rejects that the "best interests of the child" is a principle of fundamental justice as there is no "consensus that it is vital or fundamental to our societal notion of justice."

On the third claim she rejects the claim that the law is vague and overbroad on grounds that the law "delineates a risk zone for criminal sanction". She examines the meaning of "reasonable under the circumstances" stating that it includes only "minor corrective force of a transitory and trifling nature", but it does not include "corporal punishment of children under two or teenagers", or "degrading, inhuman or harmful conduct" such as "discipline by the use of objects", "blows or slaps to the head" or acts of anger. The test is purely objective, McLachlin claims.

=== Section 12 ===

Section 12 prevents "cruel and unusual punishment". Citing the standard of showing cruel and unusual punishment from ''R. v. Smith'' [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045 as "so excessive as to outrage standards of decency", McLachlin rejects the claim as the section only permits "corrective force that is reasonable" thus cannot be excessive by definition.

=== Section 15(1) ===
Section 15(1) is the equality guarantee that protects individuals from discrimination. McLachlin examines the claim using the analytical framework from ''[[Law v. Canada]]''.

When identifying from whose perspective the analysis must be, McLachlin notes that rather than take the perspective of a young child, which would prove too difficult, it must be viewed from the perspective of a "reasonable person acting on behalf of a child" and apprised of the law.

McLachlin says that the claim hinges on demonstrating the lack of "correspondence between the distinction and the claimant's characteristics or circumstances" (the second contextual factor from the ''Law v. Canada'' test). On this point she acknowledges that children need to be protected, and in furtherance of this goal parents and teachers require protection as well. Section 43 decriminalizes "only minimal force of transient or trivial impact" and to remove such protection would be dangerous as it would criminalize acts such as "placing an unwilling child in a chair for a five-minute "time-out"" which would risk destroying the family.

{{Italic title}}
'''''{{lang|la|Casus belli}}''''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] expression meaning "an act or event that provokes or is used to justify war" (literally, "a case of war").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/casus+belli The Free Dictionary: ''casus belli'']&lt;/ref&gt; A ''casus belli'' involves direct offenses or threats against the nation declaring the war, whereas a ''{{lang|la|[[casus foederis]]}}'' involves offenses or threats against its ally—usually one bound by a mutual defense pact.&lt;ref name=Bynkershoek1&gt;{{Cite book | title = A Treatise on the Law of War | last = Bynkershoek | first = Cornelius van | authorlink =  Cornelius van Bynkershoek | publisher = Lawbook Exchange | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-58477-566-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bynkershoek2&gt;{{Cite book | title = On Questions of Public Law | last = Bynkershoek | first = Cornelius van | authorlink =  Cornelius van Bynkershoek | publisher = William S. Hein &amp; Company | year = 1995 | isbn = 1-57588-258-2 | url = http://www.constitution.org/bynk/bynk.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Either may be considered an {{nowrap|'''act of war'''.}}

The term came into wide use in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through the writings of [[Hugo Grotius]] (1653), [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek]] (1707), and [[Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui]] (1732), among others, and due to the rise of the political [[doctrine]] of ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' or "[[just war]] theory".&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Just War in the Middle Ages | author = Russell, Frederick H. | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-521-29276-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Childress&gt;{{Cite journal | authorlink = James Childress | last = Childress | first = James F. | title = Just-War Theories: The Bases, Interrelations, Priorities, and Functions of Their Criteria | journal = Theological Studies | volume = 39 | year = 1978 | pages = 427–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used informally to refer to any "just cause" a nation may claim for entering into a conflict. It is used retrospectively to describe situations that arose before the term came into wide use, as well as being used to describe present-day situations—even those in which war has not been formally declared.

In formally articulating a casus belli, a government typically lays out its reasons for going to war, its intended means of prosecuting the war, and the steps that others might take to dissuade it from going to war. It attempts to demonstrate that it is going to war only as a last resort ([[ultima Ratio|''ultima ratio'']]) and that it has "just cause" for doing so. Modern [[international law]] recognizes only three lawful justifications for waging war: self-defense, defense of an ally required by the terms of a treaty, and approval by the United Nations.

'''Proschema''' (plural ''proschemata'') is the equivalent Greek term, first popularized by [[Thucydides]] in his ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.  The proschemata are the stated reasons for waging war, which may or may not be the same as the real reasons, which Thucydides called [[prophasis]] ({{lang|el|πρóφασις}}). Thucydides argued that the three primary real reasons for waging war are reasonable fear, honor, and interest, while the stated reasons involve  appeals to nationalism or fearmongering (as opposed to descriptions of reasonable, empirical causes for fear).

== Reasons for use ==

Countries need a public justification for attacking another country, both to galvanize internal support for the war and to gain the support of potential allies.

In the post–World War II era, the [[UN Charter]] prohibits signatory countries from engaging in war except: 1) as a means of defending themselves—or an ally where treaty obligations require it—against aggression;  2) unless the UN as a body has given prior approval to the operation. The UN also reserves the right to ask member nations to intervene against non-signatory countries that embark on [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/|title=Chapter VII {{!}} United Nations|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples==
This section outlines a number of the more famous and/or controversial cases of ''casus belli'' which have occurred in modern times.

===American Civil War===
While long term conflict between the northern and southern states (mainly due to the economic disparities and moral questions caused by slavery) was the cause of the [[American Civil War]], the Confederate [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]] (April 12–14, 1861) served as ''casus belli''{{hsp}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watson |first=William |title=Life in the Confederate Army: Being the Observations and Experiences of an Alien in the South During the American Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJpBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA113 |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |year=1887 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=United States |isbn= |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; for igniting the deadliest war in American history.

===Spanish–American War===
In the eyes of the [[United States]], the sinking of {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} provided ''casus belli'' for the [[Spanish–American War]].
There have been several alternative explanations for the explosion, such as that proposed by Mr. Evans, a senior editor of Newsweek. In his book, he identifies a flaw in the design of USS ''Maine'' whereby the boiler room stood right next to the gunpowder storage room and that a boiler malfunction may have heated the adjacent metal wall and caused the powder to explode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Destruction of the Maine (1898) |url = https://www.loc.gov/law/help/usconlaw/pdf/Maine.1898.pdf|date=August 4, 2009|work=The Law Library of Congress |publisher = www.loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Second Opium War===
Europeans had access to Chinese ports as outlined in the Treaty of Nanking from the First Opium War. France used the execution of Auguste Chapdelaine as a casus belli for the Second Opium War. On February 29, 1856, Chapdelaine, a French missionary, was killed in the province of Guangxi, which was not open to foreigners. In response, British and French forces quickly took control of Guangzhou (Canton).

=== World War I ===
{{See also|Causes of World War I}}

The [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] provided the trigger that led to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. In June 1914, the refusal of two points of the [[July Ultimatum]] offered to Serbia was used by [[Austria-Hungary]] as a ''casus belli'' for declaring war on [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. The murder at [[Sarajevo]] in [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|Bosnia]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Bosnian Serbs|Bosnian Serb]] nationalist, Austrian subject and member of [[Young Bosnia]] (a [[secret society]]), was the reason why this ultimatum was made.

The [[Russian Empire]] started to mobilize its troops in defense of its ally Serbia, which resulted in the [[German Empire]] declaring war on Russia in support of its ally Austria-Hungary. Very quickly, after the involvement of [[France]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], five of the six great European powers became involved in the first European general war since the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

In 1917, the German Empire sent the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] to Mexico, in which they tried to persuade Mexico to join the war and fight against the United States, for which they would be rewarded Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, all former Mexican territories. This telegram was intercepted by the British, then relayed to the U.S., which led to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] then using it to convince Congress to join World War I alongside the Allies. The Mexican president at the time, Venustiano Carranza, had a military commission assess the feasibility, which concluded that this would not be feasible for multiple reasons.

===World War II===

In his autobiography ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', [[Adolf Hitler]] had in the 1920s advocated a policy of ''[[lebensraum]]'' ("living space") for the [[Germans|German people]], which in practical terms meant German territorial expansion into Eastern Europe.
[[Image:Alfred Naujocks.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Naujocks]], who organized and led the [[Gleiwitz incident]] on the orders of [[Heydrich]].]]
In August 1939, to implement the first phase of this policy, [[Germany]]'s [[Nazi]] government under Hitler's leadership staged the [[Gleiwitz incident]], which was used as a ''{{lang|la|casus belli}}'' for the [[invasion of Poland]] the following September. Nazi forces used [[concentration camp]] prisoners posing as Poles on 31 August 1939, to attack the German radio station Sender Gleiwitz in Gleiwitz, Upper [[Silesia]], Germany (since 1945: [[Gliwice]], Poland) on the eve of World War II in Europe. [[Poland]]'s allies, the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[France]], subsequently declared war on Germany in accordance with their alliance.

In 1941, acting once again in accordance with the policy of lebensraum, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]], using the ''casus belli'' of [[preemptive war]] to justify the act of aggression.

=== Vietnam War ===

Many historians have suggested that the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]] was a manufactured pretext for the [[Vietnam War]]. North Vietnamese Naval officials have publicly stated that {{USS|Maddox|DD-731|6}} was never fired on by North Vietnamese naval forces.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/world198_4.html McNamara asks Giap: What happened in Tonkin Gulf?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306124920/http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/world198_4.html |date=2015-03-06 }}". (November 9, 1995). ''[[Associated Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/11/interviews/mcnamara/ CNN Cold War – Interviews: Robert McNamara] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614000000/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/11/interviews/mcnamara/ |date=June 14, 2008 }}, retrieved January 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary film "''[[The Fog of War]]''", then-US Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] concedes the attack did not happen, though he says that he and President Johnson believed it did so at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2092916|title=The Evasions of Robert McNamara|first=Fred|last=Kaplan|date=19 December 2003|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Gulf of Tonkin Incident (the 2nd of August) should not be confused with the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident (4 August). The North Vietnamese claimed that on August 2, US destroyer USS ''Maddox'' was hit by one torpedo and that one of the American aircraft had been shot down in North Vietnamese territorial waters. The [http://www.clemson.edu/caah/history/FacultyPages/EdMoise/vtonk.html PAVN Museum in Hanoi displays] "Part of a torpedo boat... which successfully chased away the USS Maddox August 2nd, 1964".

The ''casus belli'' for the Vietnam War was the second incident. On August 4, USS ''Maddox'' was launched to the North Vietnamese coast to "show the flag" after the first incident. The US authorities claimed that two Vietnamese boats tried to attack USS ''Maddox'' and were sunk. The government of North Vietnam denied the second incident completely. Deniability played favorably into the propaganda efforts of North Vietnam throughout the war, and for some years to follow.

=== Six-Day War ===

A ''casus belli'' played a prominent role during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967. The Israeli government had a short list of ''{{lang|la|casūs belli}}'', acts that it would consider provocations justifying armed retaliation. The most important was a blockade of the [[Straits of Tiran]] leading into [[Eilat]], Israel's only port to the [[Red Sea]], through which Israel received much of its oil. After several border incidents between Israel and [[Egypt]]'s allies [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]], Egypt expelled [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] peacekeepers from the [[Sinai Peninsula]], established a military presence at [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], and announced a blockade of the straits, prompting Israel to cite its ''casus belli'' in opening hostilities against Egypt.

===1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon===
The ''{{lang|la|casus belli}}'' cited by Israel for its June 1982 [[1982 Lebanon war|invasion of Lebanon]] was the attempted assassination of the Israeli Ambassador in London, which the Israeli government blamed on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Sachar, Howard M.: ''A History of Israel from the Rise of Zionism to Our Time'', Alfred A. Knopf 1996, {{ISBN|0-679-76563-8}}, page 904.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible invasion plan had been prepared in advance by Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"As early as January 1982, therefore, with [[Menachem Begin|Begin]]'s approval, [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] paid a secret visit to Beirut.... By the following month... operational plans for the offensive were well advanced. Israeli liaison officers repeatedly visited Beirut to coordinate strategy with the [[Kataeb Party|Phalange]]. In the end, the Lebanon expedition would be the most thoroughly prepared campaign in Israel's history." – Sachar, ''A History of Israel'', p. 903.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War on Terror===

The ''{{lang|la|casus belli}}'' for the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s conceptual [[War on Terror]], which resulted in the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan war]], was the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], [[The Pentagon]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], and the intended attack on the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

===2003 Invasion of Iraq===

When the United States [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded Iraq in 2003]], it cited Iraq's non-compliance with the terms of cease-fire agreement for the 1990–1991 [[Gulf War]], as well as planning in the [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots#George H. W. Bush|1993 attempted assassination]] of former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and firing on coalition aircraft enforcing the [[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zones]] as its stated ''{{lang|la|casus belli}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021002-2.html | title=Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq | publisher=Office of the Press Secretary | date=October 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milnet.com/public-law-102-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017075722/http://www.milnet.com/public-law-102-1.html |archivedate=2008-10-17 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Cited by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] was [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) program. The administration claimed that Iraq had not conformed with its obligation to disarm under past UN Resolutions, and that Saddam Hussein was actively attempting to acquire a nuclear weapons capability as well as enhance an existing arsenal of chemical and biological weapons. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] addressed a plenary session of the [[United Nations Security Council]] on February 5, 2003 citing these reasons as justification for military action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2003/17300.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204130309/http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2003/17300.htm|archivedate=2005-02-04|title=Remarks to the United Nations Security Council|date=4 February 2005|publisher=|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now publicly known that the Bush administration’s claims of ongoing weapons programs were not justified by then-current intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/9/12123022/george-w-bush-lies-iraq-war | title=No, really, George W.

[[File:lbjsigningbill.jpg|thumb|250px|President Johnson signing the Civil Rights Act of 1968]]
The '''Civil Rights Act of 1968''', ({{USStatute|90|284|82|73|1968|04|11}}), also known as the '''Fair Housing Act''', is a landmark part of legislation in the [[United States]] that provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, religion, or national origin and made it a federal crime to "by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone … by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/176437/hate-crime-laws-dont-prevent-violence-against-lgbt-people#|title=Hate Crime Laws Don’t Prevent Violence Against LGBT People|author1=Michael Bronski |author2=Ann Pellegrini |author3=Michael Amico |publisher=The Nation|date=October 2, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act was signed into [[law]] during the [[King assassination riots]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who had previously signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]] into law.

Title&amp;nbsp;VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 is commonly known as the ''[[Fair Housing Act]]'' and was meant as a follow‑up to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. While the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] prohibited discrimination in housing, there were no federal enforcement provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Act of 1866 &amp; Civil Rights Act of 1871 – CRA – 42 U.S. Code 21 §§1981, 1981A, 1983, &amp; 1988|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil-rights-act-1866-civil-rights-act-1871-cra-42-us-code-21-1981-1981a-1983-1988|publisher=findUSlaw|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1968 act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], religion, [[national origin]], and since 1974, [[gender]]; since 1988, the act protects [[people with disabilities]] and families with children.

Victims of discrimination may use both the 1968 act and the 1866 act via [[Civil Rights Act of 1871#As later amended and codified as section 1983|section 1983]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=42 USC § 1983 – Civil action for deprivation of rights|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983|publisher=Cornell University Law School Legal Information Institute|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to seek redress.  The 1968 act provides for federal solutions while the 1866 act provides for private solutions (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;civil suits).

Titles II through VII comprised the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which applies to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the United States and makes many, but not all, of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights applicable within the tribes&lt;ref&gt;[https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/civil68.pdf "Civil Rights Act of 1968" full text, US House of Representatives website]&lt;/ref&gt; (that Act appears today in Title 25, sections 1301 to 1303 of the United States Code).

A [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] attached to the bill makes it a [[felony]] to "travel in interstate commerce...with the intent to incite, promote, encourage, participate in and carry on a riot". This provision has been criticized for "equating organized political protest with organized violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Committee to Defend the Conspiracy|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1969/jun/19/the-committee-to-defend-the-conspiracy/|accessdate=4 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=19 June 1969|author1=Peter Babcox |author2=Noam Chomsky |author3=Judy Collins |author4=Harvey Cox |author5=Edgar Z.

==Political context==
One impetus for the law's passage came from the 1966 [[Chicago Freedom Movement|Chicago Open Housing Movement]].  Also influential was the 1963 [[California Proposition 14 (1964)|Rumford Fair Housing Act]] in California, which had been backed by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] and [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]].&lt;ref name="wiu.edu"&gt;[http://www.wiu.edu/cas/history/wihr/pdfs/MilesWIHRSp09.pdf Darren Miles "Everett Dirksen’s Role in Civil Rights Legislation" Western Illinois Historical Review, Vol. I Spring 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://landlords.about.com/od/Landlord101/a/What-Is-Fair-Housing.htm Erin Eberlin "What is Fair Housing?" About.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1967 Milwaukee fair housing campaigns led by [[James Groppi]] and the [[NAACP Youth Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-05/news/mn-4337_1_roman-catholic-priest Burt Folkart "James Groppi, Ex-Priest, Civil Rights Activist, Dies" The Los Angeles Times, November 05, 1985|B]&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Walter Mondale]] advocated for the bill in Congress, but noted that over successive years, a federal fair housing bill was the most filibusted legislation in US history.&lt;ref name="propublica.org"&gt;[https://www.propublica.org/article/living-apart-how-the-government-betrayed-a-landmark-civil-rights-law Nikole Hannah-Jones, "Living Apart: How the Government Betrayed a Landmark Civil Rights Law" Propublica, Oct. 28, 2012,]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was opposed by most Northern and Southern senators, as well as the [[National Association of Real Estate Boards]].&lt;ref name="wiu.edu"/&gt; A proposed "Civil Rights Act of 1966" collapsed completely because of its fair housing provision. Mondale commented that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of [previous] civil rights [legislation] was about making the South behave and taking the teeth from [[George Wallace]]...This came right to the neighborhoods across the country. This was civil rights getting personal.:&lt;ref name="propublica.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of banned discrimination==
The Civil Rights Act of 1968 prohibited the following forms of discrimination:

* Refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of his/her race, color, religion or national origin.  People with disabilities and families with children were added to the list of protected classes by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988; gender was added in 1974 (see below).
* Discrimination against a person in the terms, conditions or privilege of the sale or rental of a dwelling.
* Advertising the sale or rental of a dwelling indicating preference of discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin (amended by Congress as part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to include sex&lt;ref name="fairhousing.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairhousing.com/include/media/pdf/35years.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216232015/http://fairhousing.com/include/media/pdf/35years.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as of 1988, people with disabilities and families with children.)
* Coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with a person's enjoyment or exercise of housing rights based on discriminatory reasons or retaliating against a person or organization that aids or encourages the exercise or enjoyment of [fair housing] rights.

==Subsequent legislative and judicial changes==
In 1988 Congress voted to weaken the ability of plaintiffs to prosecute cases of [[Housing discrimination (United States)|discriminatory treatment in housing]]. But the [[Fair Housing Act]] was also amended in 1988 to allow plaintiffs' attorneys to recover attorney's fees. Additionally, the 1988 amendment added people with disabilities and families with children to the classes covered by the Act.

In the early 1990s, in ''Trouillon v. City of Hawthorne'', the Legal Defense and Education Fund of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) successfully challenged an urban renewal plan on the basis of [[race discrimination]] by bringing suit under the Fair Housing Act. Previous litigation under the Act had largely been limited to discrimination in buying or renting housing.

Although he ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, Judge Davis nevertheless disputed the allegations of discrimination. He said he based his ruling in part on the city's failure to prove that the area had a higher crime rate and lower property values than other parts of the city. The city "did not act in bad faith or fraudulently", Davis wrote. It "did not discriminate against any minority or low or moderate income person and did not violate any person's Due Process, Equal Protection or other Civil Rights".&lt;ref&gt;Kim Kowsky, ''TIMES'', July 10, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawful discrimination==
Only certain kinds of discrimination are covered by fair housing laws. Landlords are not required by law to rent to any tenant who applies for a property. Landlords can select tenants based on objective business criteria, such as the applicant's ability to pay the rent and take care of the property. Landlords can lawfully discriminate against tenants with bad credit histories or low incomes, and (except in some areas) do not have to rent to tenants who will be receiving [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8 vouchers]]. Landlords must be consistent in the screening, treat tenants who are inside and outside the protected classes in the same manner, and should document any legitimate business reason for not renting to a prospective tenant. As of 2010, no federal protection against discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] is provided, but these protections do exist in some localities.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] has stated that buyers and renters may discriminate and may request real estate agents representing them to limit home searches to parameters that are discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;letter from HUD to Jill D. Levine, Esq. dated 10-02-1996 http://www.reintel.com/letters.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary purpose of the Fair Housing Act is to protect the buyer's (and renter's) right to seek a dwelling anywhere they choose.  It protects the buyer's right to discriminate by prohibiting certain discriminatory acts by sellers, landlords, and real estate agents.

==Housing discrimination==
{{further|Housing discrimination|Fair housing}}
The Civil Rights Act of 1968 defines ''[[housing discrimination]]'' as the "refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of his race, color, religion, or national origin". Title&amp;nbsp;VIII of this Act is commonly referred to as the [[Fair housing|Fair Housing Act of 1968]]. Later, the disabled and families with children were added to this list.&lt;ref name="fairhousing.com"/&gt; The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] within the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] is charged with administering and enforcing this law.

==Social steering==
{{See also|Racial steering}}
Social steering is a form of housing discrimination that involves housing authorities, real estate companies and even local governments steering certain groups of people, often minorities, into certain areas of a city. According to Realestateagent.com, it is "directing a particular race to a certain neighborhood and away from others.  An example is a real estate broker steering a black family away from a white neighborhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.realestateagent.com/real-estate-glossary/real-estate/racial-steering.html |title=Racial Steering |language=en |website=realestateagent.com |access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of housing projects can be taken as examples of steering.

Often housing projects concentrate poor minorities into a few buildings or blocks, concentrating the population and isolating them from most of the city. Often the areas where the steering tends to concentrate certain groups of people lack city resources that other parts of the city may have. For example, in [[Los Angeles]], the "[[ghetto]]" is not wired into key information circuits like the rest of the city such as education and cultural media.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
	
In the 1950s, governments across America took initiatives to destroy so-called slums and ghettos of the cities, and put up housing projects in place. These multistory, high-density projects were where whites began to push blacks who were dislocated by destruction of slums, also heavily avoided by the white population. Despite the Fair Housing Act, which included cases like Gautreaux and Shannon which prohibited placing projects exclusively in black neighborhoods, the trend did not end.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, 1993 p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Social steering can also be outside the economic institutions of real-estate a government policy decisions to build projects.  Often the people living in a neighborhood may not be so friendly to people moving in that are different from them. For example, in 1985 an interracial couple moved into an all-white neighborhood in [[Philadelphia]]. Upon arrival there was an angry mob waving torches and protesting the arrival of a person of color.&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Douglass, 1993 p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;  The attitudes of people in certain neighborhoods therefore can also contribute to the segregation and steering of people of certain backgrounds.
	
Before the Fair Housing Act many minorities were met with blatantly racist objects of deterrence such as signs in the neighborhood or at real estate companies explicitly saying they do not accept certain minorities. However, after the Fair Housing Act, steering took on the role of a subtle fashion, where realtors deceive and lie making it harder to learn about or rent/buy homes in certain neighborhoods. The minorities are guided or "steered" into neighborhoods with certain characteristics of economics and race.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Case studies===
A [[Cleveland]] study revealed that 10% of companies in the 1970s practiced racial steering.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, 1997 p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;  As recently as 2006 there was an investigation of a real estate company in [[Chicago]], where African-American and white testers attempted to buy [[condominium]]s. White testers were shown many more properties—around 36—while the African American testers only got to see on average 7.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, 1997 p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the ''Coldwell Banker vs. Illinois Attorney General'' (2006) case.

Another Detroit study showed that whites were rarely shown homes in non-white neighborhoods unless they asked to see them.  There are numerous cases and studies done that show the more subtle end of racial and social steering after the Fair Housing Act. On the average, 50% of the time African-Americans are discriminated against when searching for housing.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, 1992 p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redlining==
{{Main|Redlining}}
[[Redlining]] is related to steering because it is denying financial support and services to neighborhoods based on race, ethnicity, or economic status.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than subtly steering individual families towards certain areas or only giving them information on certain racial areas, redlining was a blatant but legally tolerated criterion for financial institutions to decide where to invest. Originating with the creation of the [[Federal Housing Administration]], this procedure was a protocol for deciding where federal, state and city funds would go for financial services. Affluent middle- and upper-middle-class white areas were outlined in green on a map, meaning that financial services were clear to be rendered and these areas were desirable for investment.  Minority areas, specifically African-American neighborhoods, were outlined in red, meaning they were undesirable neighborhood whose denizens were poor and [[Multiracial|racially mixed]].&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} These maps were used by banking institutions to construct guidelines for lending money. As a consequence, many of these redlined areas, which were also typically located in urban environments as whites tended to move out to the suburbs of America, experienced deterioration on a rapid scale. Since these areas have been neglected and redlined and cannot receive funds from banks to revitalize, they cannot attract businesses, which perpetuates the [[cycle of poverty]]. The poverty often leads to crime, and neighborhoods become further neglected because they continue to be unattractive to outside investment, and continue to be redlined by banks.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[When Work Disappears]]: The World of the New Urban Poor |first=William Julius |last=Wilson |year=1996 |isbn=0-679-72417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} Thus private banks and financial institutions as well as the U.S. government are accused of being responsible for these practices in several instances, which before the Fair Housing Act were widespread and blatant throughout the United States.  Redlining is still practiced today on a more subtle level. Instead of having official maps circulated to institutions, which is illegal, the public domain may tend to ignore poor neighborhoods by denying basic public services.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/opinion/13ehrenreich.html?pagewanted=print|title=The Recession's Racial Divide|date=September 13, 2009|work=The New York Times|last2=Muhammad|first2=Dedrick|first1=Barbara|last1=Ehrenreich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/us/07baltimore.html|title=Bank Accused of Pushing Mortgage Deals on Blacks|last=Powell|first=Michael|date=June 7, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Segregation Index==
Nancy A. Denton and Douglass S. Massey devised a segregation index to measure the degree of segregation of African-Americans and whites according to income levels.  Their objective was to show that the discrimination of African Americans when it comes to housing was not related to income level, which many thought to be true.  Many have argued that continuing segregation is due to African Americans generally making less money, which means they cannot afford to live in the same neighborhoods as affluent whites.  But as the segregation index by Denton and Massey showed, blacks still remained highly segregated from whites no matter what the income level was. For example, in 1980, black families earning $25,000 a year or less had an index level of 86 while those earning $50,000 or more had an index level of 83. This trend was common throughout most major metropolitan areas, especially prevalent in the northern cities. The goal of this index was to show that upward economic mobility did not affect the level of segregation in America’s cities.  It should be noted that Denton and Massey also surveyed Hispanics and Asians, and found on average the indices to be 64 which meant the poorest Hispanics and Asians were still less segregated than the most affluent blacks. Leslie Carr notes that in 1990, 74 percent of whites live in suburbs, while most African Americans and Hispanics live in urban areas, and that African Americans were a [[List of U.S. cities with large African-American populations|majority population in 14 cities]] (with populations over 100,000).&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Denton, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of this study was to show that housing practices are indeed racially and not economically discriminatory.

==Legislation==

;Civil Rights Act of 1866
:This is the law that declared all people born in the United States are legally citizens.  This means they could rent, hold, sell and buy property.  This law was meant to help former slaves, and those who refused to grant these new rights to slaves were guilty and punishable under law.  The penalty was a fine of $1000 or a maximum of one year in jail.

;Fair Housing Act of 1968 (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968)
:Extends the protection to color, religion, sex and national origin.

;The New York State Human Rights Law
:Extends the protection to marital status and age, aimed to prevent non-racial discrimination.

;Section 236 and 237 of the New York State Property Law
:Further extends the protection to include dwellings with children and mobile home parks.  This is meant to protect renters and sellers from discriminating based on number of children in a family.  Currently the Fair Housing Act protects against discrimination of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.  The law applies to all types of housing, [[rental home]]s, apartments, [[condo]]s and houses.  The only exception to the act is when an owner of a small rental building lives in the same building he lets.  Since he owns the building and also resides there, he can decide who lives there.

==Sexual orientation and gender identity==

Sexual orientation and gender identity are not protected under the Fair Housing Act; federal law in general does not protect gays and lesbians or other sexual minorities (transgender or transsexual) against discrimination in private housing.  There are twenty two states that have passed laws prohibiting discrimination in housing based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The states that have passed fair housing laws in regards to both sexual orientation and gender identity are:{{when|date=July 2015}} California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington State. In addition to the states above, the following three states prohibit discrimination in housing based on sexual orientation only: New Hampshire, New York and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Housing Laws and Policies|url=http://www.hrc.org/documents/Housing_Laws_and_Policies.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709075753/https://www.hrc.org/documents/Housing_Laws_and_Policies.pdf|archivedate=9 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, [[Austin, Texas]] has passed a law making discrimination based on sexual orientation illegal.&lt;ref name="AustinFH-SxOr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/hrights/ |title= City of Austin Equal Employment / Fair Housing Office |accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] issued a regulation to prohibit LGBT discrimination in federally assisted housing programs. The new regulations ensure that the Department's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

==Violations of the Fair Housing Act==

There are an estimated 2 million cases of housing discrimination each year according to HUD. The National Fair Housing Alliance, the largest fair housing non-profit in the country, estimates that number to be closer to 4 million per year, excluding instances of discrimination due to disability or familial status.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. King's Dream Denied: Forty Years of Failed Federal Enforcement: 2008 Fair Housing Trends Report." National Fair Housing Alliance. April 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Housing projects have also come under fire by researchers and NGOs alike.  Housing advocates Elizabeth Julian and Michael Daniel state:&lt;ref name="Shapiro1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Steven R.|title=Human Rights Violations in the United States: A Report on U.S. Compliance with The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neq8l3vBVYwC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=9 April 2018|year=1993|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=9781564321220|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;in addition to the inequality in the actual housing provided to low-income African-American families under the federal programs, the neighborhoods in which they receive assistance are usually subject to various adverse conditions not found in the neighborhoods surrounding the housing units in which whites receive the same assistance.  These conditions include inferior city-provided facilities and services, little or no new or newer residential housing, large numbers of seriously substandard structures, noxious environmental conditions, substandard or completely absent neighborhood service facilities, high crime rates, inadequate access to job centers, and little or no investment of new capital in the area by public and private entities.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Thus, this discrimination goes beyond being poor because white housing projects receive more attention and public investment, making housing discrimination overall a racial problem.

Although several legal measures have been taken to protect all kinds of people against housing discrimination in the U.S., still the most commonly targeted and largest victims are African-Americans.

==Hate crimes provisions==
{{main|Hate crime laws in the United States}}
The Civil Rights Act of 1968 also enacted {{UnitedStatesCode|18|245}}(b)(2), which permits federal prosecution of anyone who "willingly injures, intimidates or interferes with another person, or attempts to do so, by force because of the other person's race, color, religion or national origin" [https://web.archive.org/web/20110101133706/http://www.justice.gov/crt/crim/245.php] because of the victim's attempt to engage in one of six types of federally protected activities, such as attending school, patronizing a public place/facility, applying for employment, acting as a juror in a state court or voting.

Persons violating this law face a fine or imprisonment of up to one year, or both. If bodily injury results or if such acts of intimidation involve the use of firearms, explosives or fire, individuals can receive prison terms of up to 10 years, while crimes involving kidnapping, sexual assault, or murder can be punishable by life in prison or the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civil Rights Statutes |url=https://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/civilrights/statutes.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914205918/http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/civilrights/statutes.htm |archivedate=2010-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though sexual orientation and gender identity are also excluded from this law, they are included in a more recent Federal hate-crime law, the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]].

According to [[Constitution of Myanmar]], the '''Constitutional Tribunal of Myanmar''' ({{lang-my|နိုင်ငံတော်ဖွဲ့စည်းပုံအခြေခံဥပဒေဆိုင်ရာခုံရုံး}}) was founded on 31 March 2011. Its headquarters is located in Office No. 54, [[Ottarathiri Township]], Nay Pyi Taw City, [[Myanmar]]. There is one chairperson and eight members on the Tribunal, who serve five year terms. Members of the tribunal are elected proportionally by the [[President of Burma|President]], [[Pyithu Hluttaw]], and [[Amyotha Hluttaw]]. The members of the Constitutional Tribunal are all required to be legal experts.

'''Diamond-Star Motors''' ('''DSM''') was an [[automobile]]-manufacturing [[joint venture]] between the [[Chrysler Corporation]] and [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi Motors Corporation]] (MMC).&lt;ref name="nyt88"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/05/business/mixing-cultures-on-the-assembly-line.html "Mixing Cultures On the Assembly Line"], John Holusha, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The name came from the parent companies' respective [[logo]]s: three ''diamonds'' (Mitsubishi) and a penta''star'' (Chrysler).&lt;ref name="nyt91"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/15/business/business-people-mitsubishi-executive-joins-chrysler-venture.html " Business People; Mitsubishi Executive Joins Chrysler Venture"], John Holusha, ''The New York Times'', June 15, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond-Star Motors was officially renamed '''Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, Inc.''' ('''MMMA''') in 1995, four years after Mitsubishi took sole control of the plant, and from 2002 to 2016 its official name had been '''Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc.''' ('''MMNA''') '''Manufacturing Division'''.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/history/index.asp History of MMMA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117105954/http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/history/index.asp |date=2007-01-17 }}, MMMA official website&lt;/ref&gt;

In the automotive enthusiast community, ''DSM'', especially used in the singular (e.g. ''a DSM'') generally refers to the original first- and second-generation [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], [[Eagle Talon]], and [[Plymouth Laser]], which all shared the same Diamond-Star Motors [[vehicle platform]].

==Background==
The origins of Diamond-Star Motors can be traced back to 1970 when Chrysler Corporation took a 15 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors, as part of MMC's strategy of expansion through [[Business alliance|alliances]] with foreign partners. The U.S. company began distributing Mitsubishis as [[Chrysler]]-, [[Dodge]]-, and [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]]-branded [[captive import]]s (e.g. [[Dodge Colt]]), a successful venture as the [[compact car]]s met consumer demand for smaller and more [[fuel-efficient]] vehicles in the 1970s, filling a gap at the bottom of the Chrysler group's range.&lt;ref name="fund"&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Mitsubishi-Motors-Corporation-Company-History.html History of Mitsubishi], Funding Universe&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1982, Chrysler was importing 110,000 Mitsubishis annually. However, a minor conflict was forming as the Japanese now wanted to sell directly through their own-[[brand]]ed dealerships. A voluntary [[import quota]] system was in place at this time, restricting the number of cars Japanese [[automaker]]s could bring into the U.S. As the Japanese company began to open its own branded dealerships to sell directly, every imported [[Mitsubishi Cordia|Cordia]], [[Mitsubishi Tredia|Tredia]], and [[Mitsubishi Starion|Starion]] sold by Mitsubishi had to be discounted from Chrysler's allocation.&lt;ref name="fund"/&gt;

==Incorporation==

[[Image:04-06 Mitsubishi Galant.jpg|thumb|right|The ninth generation of the [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]] sedan was originally designed and built exclusively for the North American market, and was MMMA's volume seller.]]
In order to circumvent this, the two partners officially incorporated Diamond-Star Motors in October 1985. An incentive package worth [[US dollar|US$]]274&amp;nbsp;million, and an intense and controversial lobbying effort by state and local government authorities, meant that [[Illinois]] won the new auto plant,&lt;ref name="illinois"&gt;{{cite book | last = Chapman | first = Margaret L. | authorlink = |author2=Arun P. Elhance |author3=John D. Wenum  | title = Mitsubishi Motors in Illinois | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | date = 1995 | location = | pages = 129 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OGQ4u2gZKxwC&amp;dq | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-89930-972-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 1986 ground was broken on a {{convert|1900000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} production facility in the town of [[Normal, Illinois|Normal]]. The plant was completed in March 1988, with an annual capacity of 240,000 vehicles.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  In 1989, the workers at the plant formed [[United Auto Workers]] Local 2488, and signed their first contract with the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bntrades.org/news.php?id=20 "Working Class Voice: Labor Unions in McLean County"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917215933/http://bntrades.org/news.php?id=20 |date=2010-09-17 }}, Chapter 20: UAW 2488, Bloomington &amp; Normal Trades &amp; Labor Assembly web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, three models were produced at this facility. The [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], [[Plymouth Laser]], and [[Eagle Talon]] were smaller [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] sports cars on a new co-designed platform. Models subsequently produced during the next decade included the [[Mitsubishi Mirage]]/[[Eagle Summit]] sedans, the [[Mitsubishi Galant]], the [[Dodge Avenger|Dodge Avenger Coupe]]/[[Chrysler Sebring|Chrysler Sebring Coupe]], and the [[Dodge Stratus|Dodge Stratus Coupe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/vehicles/index.asp About the vehicles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021023044529/http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/vehicles/index.asp |date=2002-10-23 }}, MMMA official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departure of Chrysler==
Initially Diamond-Star Motors was a 50-50 [[joint venture]] between Chrysler and Mitsubishi. However, in 1991 the Japanese company purchased its partner's interest, and thereafter the manufacture of Chrysler vehicles was on a contractual basis. Chrysler sold its equity stake to Mitsubishi in 1993, and Diamond-Star Motors was renamed Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA) on July 1, 1995.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Despite the departure, the two companies have maintained various co-operative manufacturing agreements since and considered all vehicle produced until 1995&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allpar.com/history/mitsubishi.html&lt;/ref&gt; as Diamond Star Motors.

Formerly, the plant produced vehicles using the American-developed [[Mitsubishi PS platform]], including the current [[Mitsubishi Endeavor|Endeavor]], [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]], and [[Mitsubishi Eclipse|Eclipse]]. In mid-2012, the plant began producing the [[Mitsubishi RVR]] platform sold in United States as the Outlander Sport. Approximately 1,900 people work in the highly mechanized plant, alongside approximately 1,000 robots. An expansion in 2003 means that it now occupies {{convert|2400000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/facility/index.asp About the facility] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120907145605/http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/facility/index.asp |date=2012-09-07 }}, MMMA official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant closure announced==
In July 2015, Mitsubishi announced that it would end production at the plant in Normal. The plant had been operating well below capacity for several years.  In 2014, it produced just over 69,000 vehicles out of a capacity of 240,000 vehicles annually. Production would shift to Japan, with Mitsubishi importing all vehicles sold in North America. Mitsubishi said it would try to sell the plant to preserve jobs, but that the plant would be closed by November if no buyer was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20150727/OEM01/307279955/mitsubishi-throws-in-towel-on-fading-era | title=Mitsubishi throws in towel on fading era | date=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately a buyer was not found in time, and production ended on the 30th of November.  Most of the workers (900 out of 1200) were let go on that date, with the rest staying to build replacement parts until the final closure of the plant in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cinewsnow.com/news/local/Union-workers-say-goodbye-to-27-years-at-Mitsubishi-plant-359076501.html | title=Union workers say goodbye to 27 years at Mitsubishi plant | date=2015-11-30 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202174548/http://www.cinewsnow.com/news/local/Union-workers-say-goodbye-to-27-years-at-Mitsubishi-plant-359076501.html | archivedate=2015-12-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually the plant was sold to Maynards Industries, an auctioning and liquidation firm, with ownership to transfer June 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pekintimes.com/article/20160430/NEWS/160439995 | title=Mitsubishi plant sold | access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Estoppel forms part of the rules of equity, which were originally administered in the Chancery courts.]]
'''Estoppel in English law''' is a [[doctrine]] that may be used in certain situations to prevent a person from relying upon certain [[rights]], or upon a set of facts (e.g. words said or actions performed) which is different from an earlier set of facts.

[[Estoppel]] could arise in a situation where a [[creditor]] informs a [[debtor]] that a [[debt]] is forgiven, but then later insists upon repayment. In a case such as this, the creditor may be ''estopped'' from relying on their legal right to repayment, as the creditor has represented that he no longer treats the debt as extant. A landlord may tell his tenant that he is not required to pay rent for a period of time ("you don't need to pay rent until the war is over").  After the war is over, the landlord would be "estopped" from claiming rents during the war period. Estoppel is often important in [[insurance]] law, where some actions by the insurer or the [[insurance agent|agent]] estop the insurer from denying a claim.

There are a huge array of different types of estoppel which can arise under English law.  It has been judicially noted on more than one occasions that the link between them is often tenuous.  ''Treitel on Contracts'' notes that "unconscionability ... provides the link between them."  But they nevertheless have "separate requirements and different terrains of application."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Treitel on Contracts]]'', 14th ed. (2015) at '''3-090'''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The courts have generally abandoned any attempt to create a single general underlying rationale or principle; in ''First National Bank plc v Thompson'' [1996] Ch 231 [[Peter Millett, Baron Millett|Lord Millett]] said: "the attempt... to demonstrate that all estoppels... are now subsumed in the single and all-embracing estoppel by representation and that they are all governed by the same principle [has] never won general acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;at 236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliance-based estoppels==
Under English law, estoppel by, promissory estoppel and proprietary estoppel are regarded as ''''''reliance-based estoppels'''''' by ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', Vol 16(2), 2003.  Both ''Halsbury's'' and Spencer Bower (see below) describe all three estoppels collectively as '''estoppels by representation'''.  These estoppels can be invoked when a promisee/representee wishes to enforce a promise/representation when no consideration was provided by him.  The court will only enforce this lack-of-consideration promise if and only if it would be "unconscionable" for the promisor/representor to rescind from his promise/representation ("it's not fair!").  Estoppel when invoked in such a manner is often considered a rival or alternative to the doctrine of consideration under [[contract law]].  Only proprietary estoppel can create a cause of action in English law, though the other two can act in support of a cause of action or a reply to a defence.  Under American jurisprudence, equitable estoppel is available only as a defence, while promissory estoppel can be used as the basis of a cause of action.

The requirement of inducement and  reliance are broadly the same for all reliance-based estoppels: 
*(i) the representor must have intended (actual or presumed) the representee, or have been reasonably understood by the representee as having intended him, to act on the relevant representation (or promise),
*(ii) the form of reliance must have been reasonable or intended, and
*(iii) the representation must have caused the representee to act in such a way that it would be "unconscionable" for the representor to resile.  Detriment is measured at the time when the promisor proposes to withdraw his promise, not at the time when the promise is made.

Estoppel by representation of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive:  the former is based on representation of existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter is based on a promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e., an intention as to the future).  Proprietary estoppel can operate only between parties who, at the time of representation, were in a pre-existing relationship, while this is not a pre-requisite under estoppel by representation of fact.

English courts will consider '''unconscionability''' taking into account many factors, including the behaviour, state of mind, and circumstances of the parties.  Generally, the following eight factors are determinative (Michael Spence, ''Protecting Reliance: The Emergent Doctrine of Equitable Estoppel'', Oxford: 1999, pp60–66):
*how the promise/representation and reliance upon it were induced
*the content of the promise/representation
*relative knowledge of the parties
*parties' relative interest in the relevant activities in reliance
*nature and context of the parties' relationship
*parties' relative strength of position 
*history of the parties' relationship
*steps, if any, taken by the promisor/representor to ensure he has not caused preventible harm.

===Estoppel by representation===
Estoppel by representation of fact is a term coined by Spencer Bower. This species of estoppel is also referred to as "common law estoppel by representation" in ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', vol 16(2), 2003 reissue.

In ''The Law relating to Estoppel Representation'', 4th edition, 2004 at para I.2.2, Spencer Bower defines estoppel by representation of fact as follows:

{{Cquote|where one person (‘the representor’) has made a representation of fact to another person (‘the representee’) in words or by acts or conduct, or (being under a duty to the representee to speak or act) by silence or inaction, with the intention (actual or presumptive) and with the result of inducing the representee on the faith of such representation to alter his position to his detriment, the representor, in any litigation which may afterwards take place between him and the representee, is estopped, as against the representee, from making, or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment substantially at variance with his former representation, if the representee at the proper time, and in proper manner, objects thereto.}}

A second definition can be found at Wilken and Villiers, ''The Law of Waiver, Variation and Estoppel'', 2nd ed, Oxford: 2003, at para 9.02:

{{Cquote|An estoppel by representation [of fact] will arise between A and B if the following elements are made out.  First, A makes a false representation of fact to B or to a group of which B was a member.  [It is not necessary to demonstrate A knew that the representation was untrue.]  Second, in making the representation, A intended or [in the alternatively,] knew that it was likely to be acted upon.  Third, B, believing the representation, acts to its detriment in reliance on the representation.  [It must have been reasonable to rely on the representation.]  Fourth, A subsequently seeks to deny the truth of the representation.  Fifth, no defence to the estoppel can be raised by A.}}

A representation can be made by statement or conduct.  Although the representation must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care arises.  Under English law, estoppel by representation of fact is not a cause of action, though it may be a defence or acts in support of a cause of action. There is some debate whether under English law courts will take into account unconscionability under estoppel by representation of fact, although Australian courts clearly do.&lt;ref&gt;see Wilken and Villiers, para 9-03; ''[[The Commonwealth v Verwayen]]'' (1990) 170 CLR 394 at 444 per Deane J.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equitable estoppel ===
As noted above, under English law, promissory and proprietary estoppel are both species of equitable estoppel.

====Proprietary estoppel====
{{main|Proprietary estoppel}}
Proprietary estoppel arises when A purports to give but fails to effectively convey, or promises to give property or an interest in property, to B, while being generally aware (''[[Crabb v Arun District Council]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1976] Ch 179&lt;/ref&gt;) that B will expend money or otherwise act to his detriment in reliance of the supposed or promised gift, so much so that it would be "unconscionable" not to enforce the expectation (''[[Taylor Fashions v Liverpool Victoria Trustees]]).''&lt;ref&gt;(1982) QB 133&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in  ''[[Dillwyn v Llwellyn]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1862) 4 De G.F.&amp; J. 517&lt;/ref&gt; in Chancery a father promised a property to his son, who took possession, expended a large sum of money on the house and otherwise improved the property. The father never actually gifted the property to the son. After his death the son, claiming to be the equitable owner, obtained a court judgment forcing the trustees to convey the land to him.

Similarly in ''[[Inwards v Baker]]'' [1965] 2 QB 29, a father encouraged his son to build a house on his own land, promising to leave that land to the son in his will. Subsequently, the son built a house and lived there for some 30 years. No transfer of land was made in the father's will when he died. It was held that despite this the personal representatives of the father were estopped from evicting the son.

While the courts will generally uphold the expectations of parties, if the parties are themselves not clear about their expectations the court's starting point will be the detriment incurred by the parties (per Robert Walker LJ  ''[[Jennings v Rice]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2002] EWCA Civ 159''&lt;/ref&gt;). Proprietary estoppel claims, therefore do not necessarily result in the transfer of the property to the claimant; in ''[[Jennings v Rice]]'' itself, there was a monetary award.

In June 2008 the House of Lords re-visited the doctrine of proprietary estoppel, and in the process was quite fierce in describing its limits.  In that light, it must be very doubtful that Mr Jennings would have got the result he did: properly understood, ''Jennings v Rice'' is a bit of a muddle, probably concerning promissory estoppel, with a bit of ''quantum meruit'' thrown in for good measure.

In ''[[Yeomans Row Management Ltd v Cobbe]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2008] UKHL 55&lt;/ref&gt; the House overturned the decision of a fairly heavy-weight Court of Appeal on the very issue of estoppel, thereby illustrating the level of confusion about the meaning of the doctrine. Lord Scott of Foscote, with whom the other Lords agreed, described at length that someone who seeks to rely on proprietary estoppel must establish an actual or certain interest in the property to which he claimed a right. Without that, he is not off the starting blocks.

In particular he remarked that the following rationes of Deane J in ''[[Muschinski v Dodds]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1985) 160 CLR 583&lt;/ref&gt; "repay careful reading" (his Lordship said they applied to proprietary estoppel as they do to constructive trusts):

{{Cquote|The fact that the constructive trust remains predominantly remedial does not, however, mean that it represents a medium for the indulgence of idiosyncratic notions of fairness and justice.  As an equitable remedy, it is available only when warranted by established equitable principles or by the legitimate processes of legal reasoning, by analogy, induction and deduction, starting from the conceptual foundations of such principles...  Under the law of the land... proprietary rights fall to be governed by principles of law and not by some mix of judicial discretion, subjective views about which party 'ought to win'... and the 'formless void' of individual moral opinion.}}

Lord Scott added,

{{Cquote|A finding of proprietary estoppel, based on the unconscionability of the behaviour of the person against whom the finding was made but without any coherent formulation of the content of the estoppel or of the proprietary interest that the estoppel was designed to protect invites, in my opinion, criticism of the sort directed by Deane J in the passage cited...}}

He then found that that was exactly what the Court of Appeal, no less, had done. Once the proprietary right is established, then and only then will the court consider the conduct of the party seeking to deny the right and if that conduct is wanting, will estop him from denying the right.  The court should not begin with an examination of a party's behaviour.

====Promissory estoppel (contract law)====
Promissory estoppel is the [[doctrine]] that prevents a party from acting in a certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without [[consideration]] is generally not enforceable, and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one pound in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and enforceable in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule.

The doctrine of Promissory Estoppel was first developed in ''[[Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co]]'' but was lost for some time until it was resurrected by [[Lord Denning]] in the leading case of ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1947] KB 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the claimants let a block of flats to the defendants at an annual rent of £2500. However, they agreed to accept a reduction in rent to £1250, because the defendants were unable to find enough tenants due to the evacuation of London during [[World War II]]. This promise to accept a lesser rent was unsupported by consideration. At the end of the war the flats became fully let, and the claimants demanded the return to payment of full rent. Denning J held that they were entitled to this from the last two quarters of 1945. Denning mentioned in an ''obiter dictum'' that had the plaintiffs tried to be reimbursed for the full amount they would have been estopped from doing so even though no consideration was present. This is because the plaintiff represented that he would accept half the rent and the defendant acted upon this.

Promissory estoppel requires (1) an unequivocal promise by words or conduct, (2) a change in position of the promisee as a result of the promise (''not necessarily to their detriment''), (3) inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise. Estoppel is ''"a shield not a sword"'' – it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In ''High Trees'' the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent (although estopped back rent was lost) from early 1945, but would have been able to restore full rent at any time after the initial promise provided a suitable period of notice had been given.

Estoppel is an equitable (as opposed to common law) construct and is therefore discretionary. In the case of ''[[D &amp; C Builders v Rees]]'' the courts refused to recognise a promise to accept a part payment of £300 on a debt of £482 on the basis that it was extracted by duress. In ''[[Combe v Combe]]'' Denning elaborated on the equitable nature of estoppel by refusing to allow its use as a "sword" by an ex-wife to extract funds from the destitute husband.

Promissory estoppel is not available when one party promises to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, unless the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed. This is the rule formulated in ''[[Pinnel's Case]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1602) 5 Co Rep 117a&lt;/ref&gt; and affirmed in ''[[Foakes v Beer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1884) 9 App Cas 605&lt;/ref&gt; This rule has, however, been thrown into doubt by the recent decision of ''[[Collier v Wright Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2007] EWCA Civ 1329''&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that Promissory Estoppel should not be confused with Estoppel for Non-disclosure of Knowledge, colloquially known as 'Nolissory Estoppel'. This arises when a party to a contract indicates that they have some knowledge about the value or the potential success/failure of a contract to the other party, but refuses to share this knowledge or 'nol'. The party with the 'nol' is estopped from their non-disclosure, and is forced to impart it equitably.


Yet proprietary estoppel has also arisen by acquiescence. The leading case in this area is ''Ramadan v Dyson'' (1866) LR 1 HL 129.

=== Estoppel by acquiescence ===
A legally binding contract occurs when one party makes an offer and receives an acceptance from the other party. A contract must consist of an offer and acceptance, the intention to create legal relations and consideration all must be present to make the contract legally enforceable. In contract law consideration is concerned with the bargain of the contract, each party to a contract must be both a promisor and a promisee. They must each receive a benefit and each suffers a detriment. The classic definition of consideration was given by the court in the case of ''Currie v Misa'' (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor, Lush J: “A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other".

The doctrine of consideration can therefore be seen as a set of rules, which play the principal role in the decision by the courts as to which agreements or promises are found to be legally binding.

Promissory estoppel is a term used in contract law that applies where there may not otherwise be an enforceable contract.  The importance of promissory estoppel in contract law is that it has enabled legal obligations, which fall into the category of contract law but fail to show any consideration, to be argued for. Promissory estoppel provides a way in which promises can be legally binding even if no consideration has been given. Promissory estoppel relates to a form of future conduct. The doctrine of promissory estoppel may not make the total contract fully enforceable. The specific facts in the case must actually establish the elements of promissory estoppel before the contract becomes enforceable in law.

The promises within a contract will be enforced under the promissory estoppel doctrine, when enforcing the contract promises avoids injustice.

Lord Justice Denning is a leading figure in the field of promissory estoppel in the case of ''Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd'' [1947] KB 130 (the ''High Trees'' case), was concerned with the modification of the rent payable on a block of flats during the Second World War. The importance of the case, however, lies in an obiter statement of principle which Denning LJ set out, “a promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted on, and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms properly apply”. Applying this principle, Denning held that a promise to accept a lower rent during the war years was binding on the landlord, regardless of the fact that the tenant had supplied no consideration for it. 
There are limitations which must be satisfied to this doctrine which derived from both Lord Cairns in the case ''Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co.'' (1877) 2 AC 439 and Denning LJ in the ''High Trees'' case. They are: 
# There must be a promise
# There must be a clear promise intended to alter the contracted obligation. The court assesses intention objectively rather than taking evidence on the party's state of mind.
''Woodhouse Israel Cocoa Ltd v Nigerian Produce Marketing Board'' [1972] AC 741 held that a contract for the sale of some coffee beans was agreed to be payable in pound sterling. The sellers mistakenly sent an invoice stating price was payable in Nigerian pounds. At the time the value of sterling and Nigerian pounds was equal. The buyers accepted the delivery and invoice without objection. Subsequently the value of the pound fell quite dramatically in relation to Nigerian pounds. The buyers then sought to revert to pound sterling as stated in the contract. The buyers conduct in accepting the invoice unquestionably amounted to an implied clear and unambiguous promise to accept on those terms.

==== The doctrine can only be used as a ‘shield not a sword’ ====

The full force application of the equitable maxim estoppel only allows a litigant to “use it as a shield and not as a sword” restricts the application of this doctrine to as far as only to provide a defence to a party and not to be used as a cause of action against another. In ''Combe v Combe'' [1951] 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking promissory estoppel. The court held that promissory estoppel does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant. Promissory estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents the promisor from denying the truth of statement which the promisee had relied. Denning LJ said: "The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them". However, this requirement seemed changed in light of the decisions in ''Evenden v Guildford City AFC'' [1975] QB 917, here the courts held "that promissory estoppel can be a cause of action."
Early cases indicated that there had to be a clear and unequivocal undertaking. However this was overruled by Secretary of State for ''Employment v Globe Elastic Thread Co Ltd'' [1980] AC 506. 
The promise or representation must be “precise” and “unambiguous” although it does not mean that such promise or representation must be expressly made. The concept of ‘waiver’ has been recognised by both the common law and equity as a means by which certain rights can be suspended, but then revived by appropriate notice. 
In ''Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co.'' (1877) 2 App. 439 HL, It can be seen that this case did not involve a "promise" as such, but merely an "understanding". It had been suggested that Hughes could be restricted to "relief against forfeiture" cases, but this was specifically rejected in the later cases. This case was the one on which Denning placed considerable reliance in the ''High Trees'' case. It never applied to situations of part payment of debts, however, under the modern law the concept of waiver has been effectively considered within "promissory estoppel".

==== Contractual / Legal relationship ====

It remains unsettled whether promissory estoppel may arise in pre-contractual relationships. In the case ''Brikom Investments Ltd v Carr'' [1979] 2 All ER 753 CA, a landlord made an oral promise to his tenants that if they bought a 99 year lease to their flats he would repair the roofs of the flats at his own expense. After the leases had been signed by the tenants, the landlord repaired the roof at a cost of £15,000. The landlord then claimed a contribution from the tenants towards the cost of the repairs. The tenants refused to pay because of the promise made. The landlord claimed that Carr could not rely on her promise since she had not acted on his promise because she would have entered into the lease without any such promise having been made. However, Lord Denning was of the view that promissory estoppel may arise from promise made by parties negotiating contracts. Similar views was expressed in ''Durham Fancy Goods v Michael Jackson'' [1969] 2 QB 839,  where Donaldson J. held that contractual relationship is irrelevant provided that there is “a pre-existing legal relationship which could, in certain circumstances, give rise to liabilities and penalties”.

==== Detrimental reliance on the representation ====

The proof of possible detriment or prejudice, which will appear if the promisor is allowed to revert to his original promise, is required. In Ajayi V. Briscoe (1964) 1 WLR 1326 or where he alters his position as a result of relying on that promise when though he suffers no detriment. In Alan Co. Ltd V El Nasr &amp; Import Co. (1972) 2 QB 18, Denning detained that detriment is not an essential element of promissory estoppel. Therefore, for a plea of promissory estoppel to succeed, there must be a change in circumstances of the promisee. This elementary composition of promissory estoppel has been the core and central topic of discussion in the evolution of the doctrine.

==== Temporary suspension of contractual obligations and rights ====

This doctrine does not operate to completely extinguish the original rights of the parties accruing from the contract. It only provides for the suspension of such right, which can subsequently be revived after certain event or time. In ''Tool Metal Manufacturing v Tungsten'' [1955] 1 WLR 761 HL, The courts held that generally promissory estoppel will merely suspend legal rights rather than extinguish them. However, where periodic payments are involved and a promise has been made to reduce the payments because of pressing circumstances which are not likely to persist, promissory estoppel can be used to extinguish legal rights. This final limitation to the scope of estoppel operates in the sense that the doctrine applies to representations relating to past and present events only by excluding the future events executory promise. However, promissory estoppel may permanently extinguish the rights of the promisor to claim lump sum after part-payment. In ''D &amp; C Builders v Rees'' [1965] 2 QB 617, Lord Denning expressed that the: 
{{cquote|Promisor would not be allowed to revert to his strict legal rights and that the promissory estoppel will be final if promisee understood the promise to mean final extinguishing of promisor's strict legal rights}}
 
To conclude, the above limitations help to clearly outline its parameters. This essay has defined with the use of cases to demonstrate the successful attempts to depart from the traditional approach set by the Hughes and the High Trees cases. The parameters of this doctrine seem presently not to be clearly defined. These consequences have caused the parameters of promissory estoppel to be no longer an established and well-settled area, which may interpret a huge problem to the development of contract law. The threats to the limitations of promissory estoppel, manifested from the continuing evolution of promissory estoppel, may pose turbulence in contract law and open the flood gate to litigation. Therefore, the application of the modern promissory estoppel replaces the traditionally limitations set in the landmark cases. This equitable doctrine which originally acts as an exception to the doctrine of accord and satisfaction with subject to limitations now appears as an open and unlimited doctrine.

== Other estoppels ==

===Contractual estoppel===
The law relating to contractual estoppel was summarised in {{cite BAILII|litigants=Peekay Intermark Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd |court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=2006 |num=386 |date= }}:

{{cquote|There is no reason in principle why parties to a contract should not agree that a certain state of affairs should form the basis for the transaction, whether it be the case or not. For example, it may be desirable to settle a disagreement as to an existing state of affairs in order to establish a clear basis for the contract itself and its subsequent performance. Where parties express an agreement of that kind in a contractual document neither can subsequently deny the existence of the facts and matters upon which they have agreed, at least so far as concerns those aspects of their relationship to which the agreement was directed. The contract itself gives rise to an estoppel: ...&lt;ref&gt;''Peekay Intermark Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd'', at paragraph 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Issue estoppel ===
{{Main|Res judicata}}
The civil law use of issue estoppel or ''res judicata'' (literally translated as "the fact has been decided") is relatively uncontroversial. It expresses a general public interest that the same issue should not be litigated more than once even when the parties are different. The criminal law application, called ''double jeopardy'' provides that a person should not be tried twice for the same offence. A notable case occurred as a result of the [[Birmingham Six]] case where the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] ruled in ''[[Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1982)&lt;/ref&gt; that ''issue estoppel'' applied. [[Lord Diplock]] said:

{{Cquote|The inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050210/polan-3.htm ''Polanski v Conde Nast Publications Limited''] para 86&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other estoppels===
* '''Estoppel ''in pais'' ''' (literally “by act of notoriety", or "solemn formal act”) is the historical root of common law estoppel by representation and equitable estoppel.  Estoppel ''in pais'' and equitable estoppel are used interchangeably in American legal parlance.
* '''Estoppel by convention''' as understood in English law (also known as estoppel by agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract based on a shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) they both knew the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same.  It has been said that estoppel by convention is not truly an estoppel but merely an instance of estoppel by representation, promissory estoppel or proprietary estoppel, though the first of the three is its most frequent manifestation.
* '''Estoppel by deed''' is a rule of evidence.  A statement in a deed, usually facts stated in the recital of a deed, is evidentially conclusive against the parties of the deed.  The parties are estopped from asserting otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5299">In the United States, trademark law includes a '''fair use''' defense, sometimes called "'''trademark fair use'''" to distinguish it from the better-known [[fair use]] doctrine in [[copyright law|copyright]]. Fair use of trademarks is more limited than that which exists in the context of copyright.

Many trademarks are adapted from words or symbols that are common to the culture, as [[Apple, Inc.]] using a trademark that is based upon the [[apple]]. Other trademarks are  invented by the mark owner (such as [[Kodak]]) and have no common use until introduced by the owner. Courts have recognized that ownership of a trademark or service mark cannot be used to prevent others from using the word or symbol in accord with its plain and ordinary meaning, such as if the trademark is a descriptive word or common symbol such as a pine tree. As a result, the less distinctive or original the trademark, the less able the trademark owner will be to control how it is used.

For the potentially infringing use of a trademark or service mark, fair use by a non-owner of the mark falls under two categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Copyright and Trademark Protections for Song Titles and Lyrics|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/intellectual-property-law/copyright-trademark-song-titles-lyrics|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nominative fair use''': referencing a mark to identify the actual goods and services that the trademark holder identifies with the mark. For example, it is not trademark infringement to refer to a printer produced by [[Casio]] as a "Casio printer".
* '''Descriptive fair use''': Using a [[Trademark distinctiveness|descriptive mark]] in an ordinary, descriptive manner to describe a product or service. For example, describing a component within a dehumidifier as "honeycomb-shaped" was a fair use of a registered trademark for HONEYCOMBE dehumidifiers.&lt;ref&gt;''Munters Corp. v. Matsui Am., Inc.'', 730 F. Supp. 790 (N.D. Ill. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, for descriptive fair use to arise, the following must be true:
**Plaintiff owns a mark that is descriptive of its goods or services (i.e., it immediately conveys information regarding a quality, characteristic, function, feature, or intended use of the goods/services).  If Plaintiff's mark is ''suggestive'' (i.e., it requires thought or imagination to understand the nature of the underlying goods or services, such as TIDE for laundry detergent), ''arbitrary'' (i.e., a word or phrase that exists in language, but has no relation to the goods or services, such as APPLE for computers), or ''fanciful'' (i.e., a new word, created as a trademark, such as KODAK for cameras), descriptive fair use does &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; apply.
**Defendant uses the mark ''as a descriptive word or phrase'' (i.e., to accurately describe something).  If Defendant uses the mark as a trademark (i.e., a brand, product name, company name, etc.) or if Defendant uses the term in a ''suggestive'' manner, it is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; descriptive fair use.

Nominative fair use of a mark may also occur within the context of comparative advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Jia-Ming|first2=Shang|title=Trademark Infringement Claims Based on Nominative Use Get Boost from Circuit Court Ruling|journal=Intellectual Property &amp; Technology Law Journal|date=August 2011|volume=23|issue=8|page=8|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/6771b229c3feee6a6970c5ce67077363/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=42517|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] precedent, the fair use defense in trademark law is not precluded by the possibility of confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc., 543 US 111, 125 S. Ct. 542, 160 L.

[[Image:Motorola T5320 FRS Radio.jpg|thumb|Motorola T5320 FRS handheld radio]]

The '''Family Radio Service''' ('''FRS''') is an improved [[walkie-talkie]] radio system authorized in the United States since 1996. This personal radio service uses channelized frequencies around 462 and 467&amp;nbsp;MHz in the [[ultra high frequency]] (UHF) band. It does not suffer the interference effects found on [[Citizens band radio|citizens' band]] (CB) at 27 [[Hertz#SI multiples|MHz]], or the 49&amp;nbsp;MHz band also used by [[cordless telephone]]s, toys, and [[baby monitor]]s. FRS uses [[frequency modulation]] (FM) instead of [[amplitude modulation]] (AM). Since the UHF band has different [[radio propagation]] characteristics, short-range use of FRS may be more predictable than the more powerful license-free radios operating in the [[high frequency|HF]] CB band.

Initially proposed by [[RadioShack]] in 1994 for use by families, FRS has also seen significant adoption by business interests, as an unlicensed, low-cost alternative to the [[business band]].  New rules issued by the FCC in May 2017 clarify and simplify the overlap between FRS and [[GMRS]] radio services.

Worldwide, a number of similar personal radio services exist; these share the characteristics of low power, operation in the UHF (or upper VHF) band using FM, and simplified or no end-user licenses. Exact frequency allocations differ, so equipment legal to operate in one country may cause unacceptable interference in another. None of these radios working with frequencies in the FRS frequency band are legal to operate anywhere in Europe.

== Technical information ==

FRS radios use narrow-band frequency modulation (NBFM) with a maximum deviation of 2.5 kilohertz.  The channels are spaced at 12.5 kilohertz intervals.

After May 18, 2017, FRS radios are limited to 2 Watts on channel 1-7 and channels 15-22.&lt;ref name=FCC-GMRS-FRS-Reform-2017/&gt; Previously, FRS radios were limited to 500 [[watt|milliwatts]]. [[Channel (communications)|Channels]] 1 to 7 are shared with low-power interstitial channels of [[General Mobile Radio Service]] (GMRS).

FRS radios frequently have provisions for using sub-audible tone [[squelch]] ([[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] and [[Squelch#DCS|DCS]]) codes, filtering out unwanted chatter from other users on the same frequency. Although these codes are sometimes called "privacy codes" or "private line codes" (PL codes), they offer no protection from eavesdropping and are only intended to help reduce unwanted audio when sharing busy channels. Tone codes also do nothing to prevent desired transmissions from being swamped by stronger signals having a different code.

All equipment used on FRS must be type accepted according to FCC regulations. Radios are not type-accepted for use in this service if they exceed limits on power output, have a detachable antenna, allow for unauthorized selection of transmitting frequencies outside of the 22 frequencies designated for FRS, or for other reasons.&lt;ref name=FCC-GMRS-vs-FRS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/family-radio-service-frs&lt;/ref&gt;  After December 2017, the FCC no longer accepts applications to certify hand-held FRS units providing for transmission in any other radio band.

FRS radios must use only permanently attached antennas,&lt;ref name=FCC-GMRS-vs-FRS/&gt;; there are also table-top FRS "base station" radios that have whip antennas. This limitation intentionally restricts the range of communications, allowing greatest use of the available channels by the community. The use of duplex [[radio repeater]]s and interconnects to the [[public switched telephone network|telephone network]] are prohibited under FRS rules.

FRS manufacturers generally claim deceptively exaggerated range. The presence of large buildings, trees, etc., will reduce range. Under exceptional conditions, (such as hilltop to hilltop, or over open water) communication is possible at {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} or more, but that is rare. Under normal conditions, with line of sight blocked by a few buildings or trees, FRS has an actual range of about 0.5 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;km (0.3 to 1 mile).

== FRS/GMRS hybrid radios  ==

In May 2017, the FCC significantly revised the rules for combination FRS/GMRS radios. Combination radios will be permitted to radiate 2 watts on all channels, and all FRS channels are now considered shared with the GMRS service. Operation over 2 watts, or operation on GMRS repeater input channels, will still require GMRS licensing. The FCC will not certify combination FRS/GMRS radios that exceed the current power limits for the FRS service.&lt;ref name=FCC-GMRS-FRS-Reform-2017/&gt;

[[Image:Motorola FV150.jpg|thumb|100px|Motorola FV150 FRS and GMRS handheld radio]]
Hybrid FRS/GMRS consumer radios have been introduced that have 22 channels. Before May 2017, radios had been certified for unlicensed operation on the 7 FRS frequencies, channels 8–14, under FRS rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=service_home&amp;id=family FCC: Wireless Services: Family Radio Service: Family Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2017 revision, FCC rules required a GMRS license to operate on channels 1–7 using more than 0.5 watts.&lt;ref name=FCC-GMRS-vs-FRS/&gt; Many hybrid radios have an [[Effective radiated power|ERP]] that is lower than 0.5 watts on channels 1–7, or can be set by the user to operate at low power on these channels. This allows hybrid radios to be used under the license-free FRS rules if the ERP is less than 0.5 watts and the unit is certified for FRS operation on these frequencies.&lt;ref name=FCC-GMRS-vs-FRS/&gt; Beginning September 28, 2017, FRS operation is permitted at up to 2 watts on these channels.

Interference to licensed services may be investigated by the FCC.&lt;ref

Channels 8–14, formerly exclusive to FRS, since September 28, 2017 can be used by GMRS at 0.5 watts.  Channels 15–22, formerly  reserved exclusively for GMRS, can be used at up to 2 watts in the FRS.

Effective September 30, 2019, it becomes unlawful in the USA to import, manufacture, sell or offer to sell radio equipment capable of operating under both GMRS and FRS. This will not include [[amateur radio|amateur]] and other radio equipment that are not certified under Part 95, such as many handheld radios that are marketed for amateur use but are also able to transmit on FRS and GMRS frequencies.&lt;ref name=FCC-GMRS-FRS-Reform-2017/&gt;

* EIRP = [[Effective radiated power|Effective isotropic radiated power]]
* GMRS has other exclusive channels
* FRS channels 8-14 are exclusively FRS with no detachable antenna such as found on GMRS equipment. No FRS unit shall exceed 0.5 watt (EIRP) Effective Isotropic Radiated Power on channels 8-14. FRS Channels 15-22 are shared with GMRS also under 2 watt EIRP limit. However, if the device includes any of the following channels (467.5500, 467.5750, 467.6000, 467.6250, 467.6500, 467.6750, 467.7000, and 467.7250 MHz) a GMRS license is required. The only benefit of a GMRS license is the ability to use a repeater and communicate longer distances.  &lt;ref name=FCC-GMRS-FRS-Reform-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="GMRS-on-FRS-Channels"&gt;GMRS transmitting on channels 8-14 must follow FRS rules that are to be hand-held units with integral antennas, transmitting power on these channels will be limited to 0.5 Watts EIRP, emission bandwidth on these channels will be limited to 12.5 kilohertz, and frequency tolerance on these channels will be held to within 2.5 parts per million (ppm).&lt;/ref&gt;

== FRS radios in other countries ==
Personal UHF radio services similar to the American FRS exist in other countries, although since technical standards and frequency bands will differ, usually FCC-approved FRS equipment may not be used in other jurisdictions.

===Canada===
American-standard FRS radios have been approved for use in [[Canada]] since April 2000. As of 2016, only low-power (2W [[Effective radiated power|ERP]]), [[half duplex]] GMRS operation is permitted, but a license is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01320.html#aE|accessdate=4 November 2016|publisher=Industry Canada|title='RSS-210, Issue 9 - Low-power Licence-exempt Radiocommunication Devices (All Frequency Bands), Annex E'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeater and high-power operations are not permitted. This allows the use of dual-mode FRS/GMRS walkie-talkies, but precludes the use of higher-powered devices designed for vehicle and base-station purposes.

===Mexico===
Since [[tourism|tourists]] often bring their FRS radios with them, and since trade between the U.S., Canada, and [[Mexico]] is of great value to all three countries, the Mexican [[Secretary of Communication and Transportation]] has authorized use of the FRS frequencies and equipment similar to that in the US. However, dual-mode FRS/GMRS equipment is not approved in Mexico, so caution should be exercised in operating hybrid FRS/GMRS devices purchased elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20091026203800/http://geocities.com/wd9ewk/xe-frs.html ''Mexico's Family Radio Service (FRS) equivalent'' retrieved 23 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
Dual-mode GMRS/FRS equipment is also approved in [[Brazil]] (GMRS only in simplex mode, GMRS frequencies 462.550, 467.550, 462.725, 467.725 are not allowed)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anatel.gov.br/Portal/exibirPortalRedireciona.do?codigoDocumento=252434 ''RESOLUÇÃO No 506, DE 1o DE JULHO DE 2008'' page 28, Seção XIV,
 retrieved 12 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and most other [[South America]]n countries. Portable radios are heavily used in private communications, mainly by security staff in nightclubs and malls, but also in private parking, maintenance, and delivery services.

==Other personal radio services==
{{main article|Personal radio service}}
Many personal radio services similar to the FRS exist around the world. Because radio spectrum allocation varies around the world, a personal radio service device may not be usable outside its original area of purchase. FRS equipment may not be legally permitted in other countries because it uses frequencies allocated to services such as police or fire; however, many countries have equivalents to the FRS.

These modifications are meant to affect previous FRS/GMRS hybrid radios in the United State that were commonly sold to redefine them as FRS radios since many users that purchase these radios did not know the FCC license requirements. As a result, these users will not require a GMRS license. Radios transmitting higher than the new FRS power restrictions are re-defined as GMRS radios and users will require a GMRS license to use these devices.

{{Foreign Exchange}}
[[File:SA exchange controls 80s.jpg|thumb|Four exchange control stamps in a South African passport from the mid-1980s allowing the passport holder to take a particular amount of currency out of the country. Exchange controls such as these were imposed by the [[apartheid]]-era South African government to restrict the outflow of capital from the country.]]
'''Foreign exchange controls''' are various forms of controls imposed by a government on the purchase/sale of foreign [[currency|currencies]] by residents or on the purchase/sale of local currency by nonresidents.

Common foreign exchange controls include:

* Banning the use of foreign currency within the country
* Banning locals from possessing foreign currency
* Restricting currency exchange to government-approved exchangers
* Fixed exchange rates
* Restrictions on the amount of currency that may be imported or exported

Countries with foreign exchange controls are also known as "Article 14 countries", after the provision in the [[International Monetary Fund]] agreement allowing exchange controls for transitional economies. Such controls used to be common in most countries, particularly poorer ones, until the 1990s when free trade and globalization started a trend towards [[economic liberalization]]. Today, countries that still impose exchange controls are the exception rather than the rule.

Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies.  This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earnforex.com/articles/use-of-fx-controls-promote-economical-stability#_edn2 |title=The Use of Foreign Exchange Controls to Promote Economical Stability |website=earnforex.com |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Honda Motor Company v. Oberg''''', 512 U.S. 415 (1994), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that an [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] to the [[Oregon state constitution]] disallowing [[appellate review|judicial review]] of the size of [[punitive damages]] was a violation of [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;Varat, J.D. et al.  ''Constitutional Law Cases and Materials, Concise Thirteenth Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2009, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
In a [[products liability]] action, [[Honda]] was found [[liable]] for injuries received by the plaintiff in an [[All terrain vehicle|ATV]] accident.  Honda was liable for a $5 million punitive damage award, and both the state appellate court and the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] declined to review the award for excessiveness based on an amendment to the Oregon constitution.  The Supreme Court of United States held that the amendment to the Oregon constitution violated due process.  The Court held that judicial review of punitive damage awards for excessiveness was a long-standing [[common law]] tradition that was critical in protecting against arbitrary deprivations of property, and that Oregon had not instituted a substitute procedure to maintain these protections.&lt;ref&gt;Varat, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''ICSID Review'''—Foreign Investment Law Journal'' is a biannual [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering foreign investment law and international investment dispute settlement. Until 2011 it was published by the [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] on behalf of the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), an independent organ within the [[World Bank Group]]. From 2012, it is published by [[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of ICSID. The journal includes articles, case comments, documents, and [[book review]]s on the law and practice relating to foreign investments as well as the procedural and substantive law governing investment dispute resolution.

[[File:Wadala slums - Mumbai.jpg|thumb|[[Wadala]] slums. Over the years, [[slum]] development had started in Wadala adjacent to the railway tracks and a large colony began to form.

'''Illegal housing in India''' consists of [[shanty town|huts or shanties]] built on land not owned by the residents (i.e., [[squatting]]) and [[illegal building]]s constructed on land not owned by the builders or developers. Although illegal buildings may afford some basic services, such as [[electricity]], in general, illegal housing does not provide services that afford for healthy, safe environments.

Collapses of illegal buildings made with inadequate building supplies and practices may result in the deaths of their occupants. A recent example is the [[2013 Thane building collapse|4th April 2013 collapse]] of an eight-story building in the [[Shil Phata, India|Shil Phata]] area of [[Mumbra]], in the greater [[Mumbai]] area; 72 people were killed in the collapse.

Strategies to curb or mitigate illegal housing include creating more affordable housing structures, redeveloping the safe illegal buildings, developing a plan of action for residents of shanties or illegal buildings, and policing the construction of illegal buildings or shanties.

==Definition==
Illegal housing is a [[black economy]] activity, where individuals either encroach upon property illegally or pay for housing that is illegal. In such cases, there are little or no public services or utilities. In some cases electricity or water is accessed illegally. Illness is an issue due to poor water supply and the unavailability of sewage and garbage services.&lt;ref name="Kumar p. 160"&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Economy In India | publisher=Penguin Books India | author=Arun Kumar | year=2002 | pages=160–161 | isbn=0143028677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure continued residency in the illegally occupied area, its inhabitants generally bribe corrupt officials, [[corruption in India|corruption being an everlasting problem]] in India. More often than not, relationships with municipal offices, police and local representatives are organised by a third party with interests in ensuring that the illegal housing is not demolished. Because illegal property is not taxed, there is no income stream to pay for health or other municipal services that are required for its inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Kumar p. 160" /&gt;

==History and background==

===Legal environment===
Ineffective [[Land reform in India|land reform]] and [[rent control]] policies beginning in the 1950s and building height and [[Urban Land Ceiling Act (India)|land ceiling restrictions]] of the 1970s have "single-handedly exacerbated overcrowding and lack of urban space in India several times over," according to Vinayak Chatterjee, government and private sector [[infrastructure]] consultant. India had the world's lowest percentage of affordable housing by the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Nilekani p. 225"&gt;{{cite book  | title=Imagining India: The @idea of a Renewed Nation | publisher=Penguin | author=Nandan Nilekani | authorlink=Nandan Nilekani | year=2009 | pages=225 | isbn=1594202044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nandan Nilekani]], author of ''Imagining India: The idea of a Renewed Nation'' commented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A series of well-meaning but horribly counterproductive laws passed during this decade [1970s], which gave an immense leg up to interest groups in the city. The rent-control legislation and the [[Urban Land Ceiling Act (India)|Urban Land Ceiling Act]] had effects that, in the best of social tradition, were just the opposite of what they intended. The rent act, by stating minimal leasing periods and strict eviction limits, basically gave renters carte blanche to squat and quickly took unoccupied housing off the market, and the land ceiling act shifted large amounts of land into the illegal market.&lt;ref name="Nilekani p. 205"&gt;{{cite book  | title=Imagining India: The @idea of a Renewed Nation | publisher=Penguin | author=Nandan Nilekani | authorlink=Nandan Nilekani | year=2009 | pages=205 | isbn=1594202044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The real estate development market in Indian can exhibit [[monopoly|monopolistic]] and [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]] tendencies. Since the 1990s all of [[Mumbai]]'s available private land has been controlled by a small group of development organisations where land is "released in small quantities when prices were high." Governmental agencies, like the [[Delhi Development Authority]] (DDA), control the [[Delhi]] real estate market place since the Delhi Development Act of 1957, which prevents private developers from entering the market.&lt;ref name="Nilekani p. 205" /&gt;

The multiple initiative [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission]] was launched in 2005, but ineffective due to poor execution. Greater success could be found through improved, fair and effective regulation; stronger engagement of the private sector; and policies that allow for use of private capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Imagining India: The @idea of a Renewed Nation | publisher=Penguin | author=Nandan Nilekani | authorlink=Nandan Nilekani | year=2009 | pages=170–171, 493 | isbn=1594202044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enabling city governments to become more effective urban managers, through coordination or delegation of duties performed at the state level and training, will also create an environment for more effective urban renewal projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Imagining India: The @idea of a Renewed Nation | publisher=Penguin | author=Nandan Nilekani | authorlink=Nandan Nilekani | year=2009 | pages=210 | isbn=1594202044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early years of the 21st century have seen a worsening of urban services, including housing, resulting in "informal, non-state solutions" such as local efforts to provide utility services to slums for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Imagining India: The @idea of a Renewed Nation | publisher=Penguin | author=Nandan Nilekani | authorlink=Nandan Nilekani | year=2009 | pages=207 | isbn=1594202044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal housing==

===Illegal buildings===

To meet the demands of people moving to New Delhi, Mumbai and other large cities for jobs, and due to the unavailability of affordable housing, there are many buildings constructed illegally.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324504704578408722755780256 | title=India Arrests 9 People in Fatal Building Collapse | publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=7 April 2013 | accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Legal building construction requires filing of blueprints to municipal agencies, receiving blueprint approval and obtaining permits to connect to electricity, water and sewage services.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;|group="nb"}}  The buildings are often created quickly. Some builders neither follow proper building practices and laws, nor execute proper safety measures. Poor construction materials are also to blame in these circumstances.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; Within the Mumbai region there are estimated to be hundreds of illegal structures that have been built. Sameer Hashmi, BBC reporter, reports that activists "allege that unscrupulous builders often pay hefty bribes to authorities who turn a blind eye to these illegal structures and do not take any action against the builders."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

====Building collapses====
In the wake of the [[2013 Thane building collapse]] that killed 72 people, RT News reported that "...incidents of this kind are not rare in India, where builders often care more for cutting construction expenses than for the security and quality of the work being done."&lt;ref name="Orig RT citation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rt.com/news/india-mumbai-buildings-collapses-367/ | title=38 killed as building collapses in India (PHOTOS) | publisher=[[RT News]]|date=5 April 2013 | accessdate=5 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN 72"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/06/world/asia/india-fatal-bulding-collapse/index.html?hpt=hp_t3 |title=Death toll rises to 72 in India building collapse |publisher=CNN |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Delhi in November 2010, there were 67 people or more killed from the collapse of an apartment building.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

===Illegal huts or shanties===
Huts or shanties built on illegal land are sometimes assembled with brick and concrete, but often made with [[cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]], [[tin]] and [[plastic]]. Hut communities, or [[slum]]s, may be managed by slum lords, which may have access to water, but rarely sewer facilities.&lt;ref name="Nilekani p. 205,206, 225" /&gt; The term "slum" does not in all cases mean that the community is an illegal one; some slums are legal housing communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Challenge of Slums: Global Report on Human Settlements 2003 (4th edition) | publisher=UN-HABITAT | author=United Nations human settlements programme| year=2003 | pages=92 | isbn=1844070379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009 there were about 170 million people living in slums. About 66% of Mumbai's residents live in shanties, including about 40% of the city's police force. Mumbai's largest [[mafia]] organisation, [[D-Company]], has leased access to public lands that they have gained through squatting.&lt;ref name="Nilekani p. 205,206, 225"&gt;{{cite book  | title=Imagining India: The @idea of a Renewed Nation | publisher=Penguin | author=Nandan Nilekani | authorlink=Nandan Nilekani | year=2009 | pages=205–206, 225 | isbn=1594202044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political dynamics==
Actions and reactions to illegal housing run the gamut from entitlement to eviction. In 1991, a project called "Operation Eviction" of [[A R Antulay|A. R. Antulay]]'s government, thousands of people from [[Maharashtra]] slums were transported great distances from slum home. In the previous decade [[Arjun Singh]], the [[Madhya Pradesh]] Chief Minister, handed out land rights, called pattas, to illegal communities.&lt;ref name="Nilekani p. 225" /&gt;

==Strategies==
Strategies for curbing and managing illegal structures include:
;Affordable Housing
* Construction of affordable housing, perhaps replicating the [[residential cluster development|cluster development]] model used in Mumbai&lt;ref name="90% of Mumbra"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-06/mumbai/38327076_1_prithviraj-chavan-mumbra-illegal-structures | title=90% Mumbra buildings illegal or irregular: CM | publisher=Times of India | date=6 April 2013 | accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Identify and take action on illegal buildings
* Increased policing to curb illegal building construction&lt;ref name="90% of Mumbra" /&gt;
* Establish call centres to field complaints and track actions taken&lt;ref name="Illegal structures abound" /&gt;
* Use [[remote sensing]] technology to identify illegal buildings&lt;ref name="Illegal structures abound"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/illegal-structures-abound-in-thane/article4588979.ece | title=Illegal structures abound in Thane (photo of builders) | date=7 April 2013 | agency=The Hindu | accessdate=9 April 2013 | author=Alok Deshpande, Meena Menon | location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Development schemes

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">In the [[law of the European Union]], '''indicative limit values''', more exactly '''indicative occupational exposure limit values''' (IOELVs), are [[human]] [[Acute exposure|exposure]] limits to [[hazard]]ous [[Chemical substance|substances]] specified by the [[Council of the European Union]] based on expert [[research]] and advice.

They are not binding on [[European Union member state|member states]] but must be taken into consideration in setting national [[occupational exposure limit]]s. Some member states have pre-existing national limits lower than the IOELV and are not required to revise these upwards. In practice, most member states adopt the IOELV but there are some variances upwards and downwards.&lt;ref&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walters &amp; Grodzki (2006) ''pp''53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
A system of IOELVs was first introduced in 1980 by [[directive 80/1107/EEC]] but the first list of 27 substances was not  created until '''directive 91/322/EC''' in 1991. Member states had until 31 December 1993 to implement national limits. This first list was amended by directive 2006/15/EC in 2006 which transferred 10 of the 27 to a different regulatory regime. A second list was defined in directive 96/94/EEC but this was [[repeal]]ed by directive 2000/39/EC.&lt;ref name="dd"&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, directive 80/1107/EEC was repealed and replaced by a new regime under the chemical agents directive ([[directive 98/24/EC]]). The directive defines '''occupational exposure limit value''' as "the limit of the time-[[weighted average]] of the [[concentration]] of a chemical agent in the [[air]] within the [[breathing zone]] of a worker over a specified reference period."&lt;ref&gt;Art.2(d)&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 of the directive led to the creation of the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] to advise the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Union]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995D0320:EN:HTML L 188, 9.8.1995, p.14-15]&lt;/ref&gt; There have subsequently been two directives establishing further lists of IOELVs: 2000/39/EC and 2006/15/EC. {{As of|2008}}, the IOELVs under '''directive 91/322/EC''' remain in force but under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=European Commission | work=Health and Safety at Work | publisher=Employment and Social Affairs | accessdate=2008-04-24 | url=http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/health_safety/occupational_en.htm | title=Occupational Exposure Limits and Biological Limit Values | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416032949/http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/health_safety/occupational_en.htm | archivedate=2008-04-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third list of IOELVs, now under directive 98/24/EC, is expected in the first half of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/europe/euronews/dossiers/ioelv3.htm | publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]] | title=Third list of indicative occupational exposure limit values (IOELVs) (98/24/EC) | work=On the Horizon | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal positivism''' is a school of thought of [[analytical jurisprudence]] largely developed by legal thinkers in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]. While Bentham and Austin developed legal positivist theory, [[empiricism]] set the theoretical foundations for such developments to occur. The most prominent legal positivist writing in English has been [[H. L. A. Hart]], who in 1958 found common usages of "positivism" as applied to law to include the contentions that:
# laws are commands of human beings
# there is no necessary connection between law and morality, that is, between law as it is and as it ought to be.
# analysis (or study of the meaning) of legal concepts is worthwhile and is to be distinguished from history or sociology of law, as well as from criticism or appraisal of law, for example with regard to its moral value or to its social aims or functions
# a legal system is a closed, logical system in which correct decisions can be deduced from predetermined legal rules without reference to social considerations
# moral judgments, unlike statements of fact, cannot be established or defended by rational argument, evidence, or proof ("noncognitivism" in ethics)&lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals" (1958) 71 ''Harvard Law Review'' 593, 601-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, legal positivism sits in opposition to [[natural law]] theories of jurisprudence, with particular disagreement surrounding the natural lawyer's claim that there is a necessary connection between law and morality.

== Etymology ==
The term ''positivism'' is derived from ''ponere'', ''positum'', meaning, "to put". "Positive law" is that which is man-made, ''i.e.'', formally laid down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/legal-positivism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Green|first=Leslie|date=2009|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

==Legal validity and the sources of law==

In the positivist view, the "source" of a law is the establishment of that law by some socially recognised legal authority. The "merits" of a law are a separate issue: it may be a "bad law" by some standard, but if it was added to the system by a legitimate authority, it is still a law.

''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' summarises the distinction between merit and source like so: "The fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.); as we might say in a more modern idiom, positivism is the view that law is a [[social construction]]."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Green, Leslie, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal positivism does not claim that the laws so identified should be followed or obeyed or that there is value in having clear, identifiable rules (although some positivists may also make these claims). Indeed, the laws of a legal system may be quite unjust, and the state may be quite illegitimate. As a result, there may be no obligation to obey them.  Moreover, the fact that a law has been identified by a court as valid provides no guidance as to whether the court should apply it in a particular case. As John Gardner has said, legal positivism is 'normatively inert'; it is a theory of law, not a theory of legal practice, adjudication, or political obligation. Legal positivists believe that intellectual clarity is best achieved by leaving these questions to a separate investigation.

==Legal positivism and legal realism==
Legal positivism should be distinguished from ''[[legal realism]]''. The differences are both analytically and normatively important.  Both systems consider that law is a human construct. Unlike the American legal realists, positivists believe that in many instances, the law provides reasonably determinate guidance to its subjects and to judges, at least in trial courts.

[[Niklas Luhmann]] asserts "We can reduce... positive law to a formula, that law is not only posited (that is, selected) through decision, but also is valid by the power of decision (thus contingent and changeable)."&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; However, no positivist has ever asserted that law is made valid by anyone's decision.  In Hart's opinion, the validity of law is a matter of the customary and collective practices of the courts. As for the moral validity of law, both positivists and realists maintain that this is a matter of moral ''principles''.  'The power of decision' has no essential role in either, since individual decision rarely suffices to create a social practice of recognition, and it would be implausible to suppose that moral principles are made so by anyone's decision.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/moral-relativism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Gowans|first=Chris|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==History==

=== Antecedents of legal positivism ===
The main antecedent of legal positivism is [[Empiricism]], whose thinkers range back as far as [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], [[David Hume]], and [[Auguste Comte]]. Central to the empiricism is the claim that all knowledge of fact must be validated by sense experience or be inferred from propositions derived unambiguously from sense data. Further, empiricism stands in opposition to metaphysics; for instance, Hume rejected metaphysics as mere speculation beyond what can be learnt from sense experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/rationalism-empiricism/|title=Rationalism vs. Empiricism|last=Markie|first=Peter|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings of the empiricists acted as a harbinger for a systematic version of a positivist approach to problems of comprehension and analysis, which was later mirrored in legal positivism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jurisprudence Lecture Notes|last=Curzon|first=Peter|publisher=Cavendish Publishing|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=82.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Logical positivists]], such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer|Alfred Jules Ayer]] paved the way for another important tenet of legal positivism, namely, that propositions and the use of words must be examined in order to understand reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A sentence has literal significance if, and only if, it expresses something which is either tautologous or empirically verifiable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal positivism ===
'''Methodology'''

With the empiricist and logical positivist theoretical influences borne in mind, the essence of legal positivism as a descriptive investigation of particular legal orders is revealed, which, as Peter Curzon wrote, 'utilises in its investigations the inductive method (i.e., proceeding from observation of particular facts to generalisations concerning all such facts).'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During these investigations, matters of ethics, social policies and morality are eschewed; as [[Julius Stone]] wrote, it is concerned primarily with 'an analysis of legal terms, and an enquiry into the logical interrelations of legal propositions'. Further, law and its authority is seen as source-based; i.e., the validity of a legal norm depends not on the moral value attached thereto, but from the sources determined by a social community's rules and conventions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The source-based conception of law is reminiscent of the logical positivist, [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]], who starkly rejected metaphysics on the basis that it attempts to interpret the nature of reality beyond the physical and experiential.

'''Thomas Hobbes and ''Leviathan'''''

[[Thomas Hobbes]], in his seminal work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', postulated the first clear notion of law based on the notion of sovereign power. As Hampton writes, "law is understood [by Hobbes] to depend on the sovereign's will. No matter what a law's content, no matter how unjust it seems, if it has been commanded by the sovereign, then and only then is it law.'&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is, however, debate surrounding Hobbes's status as a legal positivist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hobbes and the Social Contract Tradition|last=Hampton|first=Jean|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=107.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Brian|date=1968|title=Warrender and His Critics|url=|journal=Philosophy 43, 117-37, 131-32.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C. Murphy|first=Mark|date=1995|title=Was Hobbes a Legal Positivist|jstor=2382114|journal=The University of Chicago Press,  Ethics, Vol. 105, No. 4.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeremy Bentham'''

The English jurist and philosopher, [[Jeremy Bentham]], is arguably the greatest historical figure in the British legal positivist movement. In ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,'' Bentham laid the groundwork for a theory of law as the expressed will of a sovereign. Bentham made a sharp distinction between the following types of people:
* '''Expositors''' – those who explained what the law in practice was; and
* '''Censors''' – those who criticised the law in practice and compared it to their notions of what it ought to be.
The philosophy of law, considered strictly, was to explain the real laws of the expositors, rather than the criticisms of the censors.

Bentham was also noted for calling natural law "nonsense upon stilts."

[[File:John Austin.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]]]
'''John Austin's command theory''' 
John Austin followed in the theoretical footsteps of Bentham by writing ''The Province of jurisprudence Determined.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Province of Jurisprudence Determined|last=Austin|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|origyear=1832|date=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,  Austin departed from Bentham on a number of points, for example, by supporting the common law.

Differences aside, Austin embraced Hobbes's and Bentham's conception of law as a sovereign command, whose authority is recognised by most members of a society; the authority of which is enforced by the use of sanctions, but which is not bound by any human superior.  The criterion for validity of a legal rule in such a society is that it has the warrant of the sovereign and will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents.

The three main tenets of Austin's command theory are:
* laws are commands issued by the uncommanded commander, i.e. the sovereign;
* such commands are enforced by sanctions; and
* a sovereign is one who is obeyed by the majority.

Austin considered the law as commands from a sovereign that are enforced by  threat of sanction. In determining 'a sovereign', Austin recognised it is one whom society obeys habitually. This sovereign can be a single person or a collective sovereign such as Parliament, with a number of individuals, with each having various authoritative powers. Austin's theory is also somewhat brief in his explanations of Constitutions, International Law, non-sanctioned rules, or law that ''gives'' rights. Insofar as non-sanctioned rules and laws that ''allow'' persons to do things, such as [[contract law]], Austin said that failure to obey the rules does result in sanctions; however, such sanctions are in the form of "the sanction of nullity."

'''Hans Kelsen and Germanic positivism'''

The British legal positivism hitherto mentioned was founded on empiricism; by contrast, Germanic legal positivism was founded on the transcendental idealism of the German philosopher, [[Immanuel Kant]]. Whereas British legal positivists regard law as distinct from morals, their Germanic counterparts regard law as both separate from both fact and morals. The most famous proponent of Germanic legal positivism is Hans Kelsen, whose central thesis on legal positivism is unpacked by [[Suri Ratnapala]], who writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The key elements of Kelsen's theory are these. Facts consist of things and events in the physical world. Facts are about what there is. When we wish to know what caused a fact we look for another fact. A stone thrown in the air comes down because of the force of Earth's gravity. There are seasons because the Earth's axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees. A norm, unlike a fact, is not about what there is but is about what ought to be done or not done. Whereas facts exist in the physical world, norms exist in the world of ideas. Facts are caused by other facts. Norms are imputed by other norms. The requirement that a person who commits theft ought to be punished is a norm. It does not cease being a norm because the thief is not punished. (He may not get caught.) The norm that the thief ought to be punished exists because another norm says so. Not all norms are laws. There are also moral norms. Legal norms are coercive; moral norms are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jurisprudence|last=Ratnapala|first=Suri|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn= 978-0-511-59483-0|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this framework, Kelsen opined that the regression of validated norms cannot go on infinitely and must arrive at a First Cause, which he called a ''Grundnorm.'' The legal system is therefore a system of legal norms connected to each other by their common origin, like the branches and leaves of a tree.

For Kelsen, "sovereignty" was a loaded concept: "We can derive from the concept of sovereignty nothing else other than what we have purposely put into its definition."

Kelsen attracted disciples among scholars of public law worldwide. These disciples developed "schools" of thought to extend his theories, such as the Vienna School in Austria and the Brno School in Czechoslovakia. In English-speaking countries, H. L. A. Hart and [[Joseph Raz]] are perhaps the most well-known authors who were influenced by Kelsen, though both schools differed from Kelsen's theories in several respects.
[[File:H.L.A.Hart.jpg|thumb|[[H.L.A. Hart]]]]
'''H. L. A. Hart'''

H. L. A. Hart later addressed Austin.  Hart liked Austin's theory of a sovereign, but claimed that Austin's Command Theory failed in several important respects.  In the book ''[[The Concept of Law]]'', Hart outlined several key points:
Among the many ideas developed in this book are:
*A critique of [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin's]] theory that law is the command of the sovereign enforced by the threat of punishment.
*A distinction between the internal and external considerations of law and rules, close to (and influenced by) [[Max Weber]]'s distinction between the sociological and the legal perspectives of law.
*A distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, such that a primary rule governs conduct, such as criminal law, and secondary rules that govern the procedural methods by which primary rules are enforced, prosecuted and so on.  Hart specifically enumerates three secondary rules; they are:
:# The [[Rule of Recognition]], the rule by which any member of society may check to discover what the primary rules of the society are.  In a simple society, Hart states, the recognition rule might only be what is written in a sacred book or what is said by a ruler.  Hart claimed the concept of rule of recognition as an evolution from [[Hans Kelsen]]'s "''[[Grundnorm]]''", or "basic norm."
:# The Rule of Change, the rule by which existing primary rules might be created, altered or deleted.
:#The Rule of Adjudication, the rule by which the society might determine when a rule has been violated and prescribe a remedy.
*A late reply (1994 Edition) to [[Ronald Dworkin]], who criticized legal positivism in general and especially Hart's account of law in ''Taking Rights Seriously'' (1977), ''A Matter of Principle'' (1985), and ''[[Law's Empire]]'' (1986).
'''Joseph Raz'''{{Main article|Joseph Raz}}

A pupil of [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[Joseph Raz]] has been important in continuing Hart's arguments of legal positivism since Hart's death. This has included editing a second edition of Hart's ''The Concept of Law'', with an additional section including Hart's responses to other philosophers' criticisms of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=H. L. A.|title=The Concept of Law|location=London|publisher=Oxford UP|date=1994|edition=2}};  superseded by 3rd edition 2012, edited by Leslie Green.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raz has also argued, contrary to Hart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concept of Law|last=Hart|first=H. L. A.|date=1994|publisher=Oxford UP|edition=2|location=London|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the validity of a law can ''never'' depend on its morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raz|first=Joseph|title=The Authority of Law: Essays on Law and Morality|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon P|date=1979|pages=47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Raz has come to accept that law may depend upon morality in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raz|first=Joseph|title=Between Authority and Interpretation|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford UP|date=2009|pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Morrell Folger''' ({{circa|1620}}&amp;ndash;1704) was the maternal grandmother of [[Benjamin Franklin]], a [[Founding Father]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt; In [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' she was cited as ancestor of the Folger whalers.

==Personal life==
Folger immigrated to [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] from [[Norwich]], England in 1635&lt;ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" /&gt; with Rev. [[Hugh Peter]]s and his family. She was an [[indentured servant]], working for the family as a maid&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Folger" /&gt; on the same ship as [[Peter Foulger|Peter Folger]] and his parents.&lt;ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" /&gt;  Peter Folger paid Hugh Peters the sum of 20 shillings to pay off Mary's servitude, which he declared was the best appropriation of money he had ever made.&lt;ref name="NEHGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Folger" /&gt;

She married Peter Folger in 1644.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; They lived in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]] before moving in 1660 to [[Martha's Vineyard]], where he was acquainted with the [[Thomas Mayhew|Mayhews]]. He was a strict teacher, surveyor, and translator for the [[Wampanoag people]].&lt;ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" /&gt;

They had nine children. Eight of their children were born on Martha's Vineyard.&lt;ref name="Douglas-Lithgow pp. 225-226" /&gt; In 1663, they moved to [[Nantucket]],&lt;ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" /&gt; where they were among the few people of European heritage.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; Their youngest daughter, [[Josiah Franklin#Marriage to Abiah Folger|Abiah]] (1667–1752) was born there. She married Boston candle-maker [[Josiah Franklin]] and they had a son, [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas-Lithgow" /&gt;

Her husband died in 1690&lt;ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" /&gt; and was buried at the Founders Burial Ground on Nantucket.&lt;ref name="Founders Burial Ground" /&gt; She died in 1704.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Folger was referenced in defense of the whaling industry in [[Herman Melville]]'s fictional ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref name="Melville" /&gt; In it, Melville sets up a series of objections to that industry, one of which is "No good blood in their veins?" The response is:

{{quote|They have something better than royal blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers—all kith and kin to noble Benjamin—this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.|Herman Melville, ''Moby-Dick''&lt;ref name="Melville" /&gt;}}

'''''McDonald v Coys of Kensington (Sales) Ltd''''' [2004] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/47.html EWCA Civ 47] is an [[English unjust enrichment law]] case, concerning the nature of an enrichment.

==Facts==
Coys of Kensington, an auctioneer, had sold a Mercedes 280 SL to Mr McDonald for £20,290. However, Coys mistakenly included the personalised number plate (TAC 1). This alone was worth £15,000. Mr McDonald became statutorily entitled to it and he registered it in his name. Coys compensated the car’s former owners with £13,608, Mr and Mrs Cressman, who were executors for the late Mr T A Cressman for the loss of the numberplate. Coys then sought a 100% contribution from Mr McDonald plus the remaining £1392 as assignees of the Cressmans’ cause of action.&lt;ref&gt;See A Burrows, E McKendrick and J Edelman, ''Cases and Materials on Restitution'' (OUP 2006) 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
Mance LJ held that the full £15,000 could be recovered from Mr McDonald. He was unjustly enriched, and it was not important that this was connected to the statutory scheme for registration of number plates. 

{{Cquote|28. The law's general concern is with benefit to the particular defendant, or so-called 'subjective devaluation'. Mr McDonald has not actually realised or received any monetary benefit from the mark. Professor Birks and [[Goff &amp; Jones]] both identify (a) free acceptance and (b) incontrovertible benefit as two main categories of case in which a defendant who has not realised any actual monetary benefit may be treated as unjustly enriched. [[Professor Birks]] (in response to a critique by [[Professor Burrows]]) has stressed that 'free acceptance' should not be understood as meaning that the recipient values the thing in question, but as unconscientious conduct precluding him or her from exercising the usual right to assert that he or she was not subjectively benefited: see In Defence of Free Acceptance in Essays on the Law of Restitution (ed. Burrows) (1991) pp. 105-146. Professor Burrows disagrees about the possibility of free acceptance - cf Free Acceptance and the Law of Restitution (1988) 104 LQR 576 and The Law of Restitution pp. 20-23 - basically because free acceptance may amount to "nothing more than indifference to the objective benefit being rendered". Consistently with that objection, he suggests that 'reprehensible seeking-out' (where a recipient's conduct clearly shows that he wants the benefit, but also that he is unwilling to pay for it) should suffice as a test of benefit (pp. 24-25). Citing some extreme examples (holding a pistol to a doctor's head and demanding medical treatment, stealing goods and intentionally using another's land without permission), he goes on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although there are no authorities specifically on this point, the defendant in such situations must be regarded as benefited (by the objective value of the subject matter). He cannot rationally say that he was indifferent to receiving the thing: and he cannot be allowed to raise the argument 'I was not willing to pay' because his reprehensible conduct shows a disregard for the bargaining process (ie the market system)."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a footnote he comments at this point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is arguable the 'seeking-out' is sufficient to outweigh the subjective devaluation objection. But as the argument for this test is one of principle, without direct support from the case law, it has been considered preferable to focus on the stronger case whether the conduct is also reprehensible"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is of interest to recall that Professor Birks' explanation of the theory of 'free acceptance' is that the recipient's 'unconscientious conduct' precludes him or her from denying subjective benefit. Professor Burrows' text continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Clearly this test runs close to free acceptance. But it is crucially distinct because in requiring a 'seeking-out' of the benefit rather than a standing-by it overcomes the indifference argument. Moreover the test is a test of benefit only. It is not intended to establish that the enrichment is unjust."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

29. 'Free acceptance' and 'reprehensible seeking out' represent tests focusing on the circumstances under which Mr McDonald came to have a car carrying the registration mark TAC 1, while 'incontrovertible benefit' focuses on the subjective value to him of the mark once acquired, regardless of those circumstances. Here, because of Coys' mistake, Mr McDonald acquired a car on 12th December 2000 which had, under the statutory scheme, a right to the mark TAC 1. His acquisition of the car on that date cannot have involved any 'free acceptance' of either the mark or the right to it. Mr Brownlee of Coys had reminded or told him and he knew on 12th December that he was not to get the old mark. But the process by which Mr McDonald came to have a car carrying that mark can, I think, be regarded as extending beyond 12th December 2000. In order to register himself as keeper he applied for a registration document, entering on the form V62 the mark TAC 1 in the knowledge that this would lead to the car being registered in his name with that mark. Notes B, C and E to the form Retention of Vehicle Registration Number V778/1 (trial document E14) indicate that Mr McDonald could, even on 13th December 2000, have applied to retain the mark, with a view to re-transferring it to the estate or its order. But he made, so far as appears, no enquiry and certainly did not pursue the obvious possibility that such a step could be taken.

30. Further, on 3rd January 2001, it is clear that his discussion with the DVLA covered the possibility of retention by the sellers, and he must have been aware that this was also a course open to him. By 5th January 2001, Mr McDonald was aware that the estate and Coys would be pursuing claims against him in relation to the mark. Notwithstanding that, he still did not make any application to retain the mark, with a view to its re-transfer to the estate. Only on or about 10th January 2001 did the DVLA register him as the keeper of the car with the mark TAC 1, so that he had every opportunity to correct the position before the mistake made in his favour was consolidated.

31. It is a salient feature of this case that Mr McDonald could have exercised a right of "retention" so as to re-transfer the registration mark to the Cressmans' order, and would then in lieu have received from the DVLA the age-related mark which he had expected; he could have done this at any stage after his acquisition of the car - at least until its gift to his partner which, as I have said, cannot have been before 8th February 2001; and he refused to do this knowing that he had received the mark by mistake contrary to the auction bargain. The mark was here not just realisable, but easily returnable. The case lies outside the scope of Pollock CJ's aphorism in Taylor v. Laird (1856) 25 L.J. Exch. 329, 332: "One man cleans another's shoes. What can the other do but put them on?".

32. If the case turned on whether there was 'free acceptance' or 'reprehensible seeking-out', it would be borderline. Bearing in mind the circumstances in which Mr McDonald came to register in his name a car carrying the mark TAC 1, it could, I think, be regarded as falling within the general principle of free acceptance advocated by Professor Birks and Goff &amp; Jones. On and after 13th December 2000 Mr McDonald was acting unconscientiously in seeking and in insisting upon such registration, in the knowledge that this was not in accordance with the bargain made and that there had been an obvious mistake. Professor Burrows' test of "reprehensible seeking-out" is on its face more stringent. But it is designed to overcome any suggestion of indifference, and it could be consistent with this rationale if the test were, if necessary, given a slightly wider re-formulation to cover circumstances such as the present. The qualification "reprehensible" derives from what Professor Burrows himself describes as "the stronger case" where the defendant shows a 'disregard for the bargaining process". Mere 'seeking-out' might in his view suffice. Here, there was positive conduct aimed at the registration in his name of his car with the old cherished mark contrary to the known bargain. What happened involved sufficient elements of knowledge, choice and action to overcome any suggestion of indifference, and can once again be seen as reprehensible in so far as it was in conscious disregard of the prior bargain. However, the case does not need to turn on whether or not its facts can be brought within a concept of 'free acceptance' or '[reprehensible] seeking-out'.

33. The alternative basis of restitutionary recovery on which Coys rely is "incontrovertible benefit". This does not depend on analysis of the circumstances in which the benefit came to be acquired and fully enjoyed. It depends on the nature and value of the benefit as and when acquired. This basis of recovery was approved in principle by [[David Hirst (judge)|Hirst J]] in a dictum in Procter &amp; Gamble Philippine Manufacturing Corpn. v. Peter Cremer GmbH (The Manila) [1988] 3 AER 843. In BP Exploration Co. (Libya) Ltd. v. Hunt (No. 2) [1979] 1 WLR 783, Robert Goff J used a similar phrase at p.805D in relation to the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943, which he explained at p.799D as grounded on principles of unjust enrichment. Professor Birks suggests as the test of incontrovertible benefit whether "no reasonable man would say that the defendant was not enriched". However he emphasises the major difference, in his view, between this and "the adoption of a straightforward objective standard of value" (p.116), and identifies two main cases in which the test should, in his view, be satisfied. They are cases of necessary expenditure (not here in issue) and cases of realised benefit. While he also identifies, under a third heading of "(c) others", some cases in which courts "simply took the view that the benefit was 'obvious'" (page 124), he evidently regards them as incompletely explained and exceptional cases of recourse to an objective standard.

34. In contrast, Goff &amp; Jones in addressing incontrovertible benefits submit that it should be sufficient "that the benefit is realisable" and that it should not be necessary to show that it has been realised (para. 1-023). They comment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is said that the principle of respect for the subjectivity of value would be subverted if this were accepted. But it may not be unreasonable, in some circumstances, to compel a person to sell an asset which another has mistakenly improved"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

35. Goff &amp; Jones recognise that not every financial gain may be said to be realisable, and refer in this connection to the landowner who "subject to the equitable doctrine of acquiescence, is not obliged to make restitution to the mistaken improver even though the land can of course be sold or mortgaged". In The Manila Hirst J recorded that it had been common ground between the parties that the test in cases of receipt of services was appropriately set out in Goff &amp; Jones as being whether the defendant had "gained a financial benefit readily realisable without detriment to himself" (p.855f). In Marston Construction Co. Ltd. v. Kigass Ltd. (1989) 46 BLR 109, HHJ Bowsher QC preferred Goff &amp; Jones's to Professor Birks' approach.
Professor Burrows advocates an approach lying midway between realisation and realisability. He suggests as the test of benefit whether it is reasonably certain that the defendant will realise the positive benefit in the future. He puts the position at p.19 as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A problem with the narrow Birks view is that the date of trial is made crucial. Realisation of the benefit after trial is ignored and wily defendants may therefore be encouraged simply to wait before realising the benefit. Goff and Jones' view avoids this problem but has its own weakness because what is realisable cannot depend just on whether it is land or a chattel that is improved. The circumstances of the individual are also relevant. An improvement to a car is not realisable to the person who cannot afford to sell it and buy a suitable replacement. An improvement to land may be realisable to an owner who does not live on the land. In any event if it is clear that the defendant will not realise the benefit can it be said that he is so obviously benefited just because he could easily realise it? The best approach seems to be to take Birks' realised test but to add that the defendant will also be regarded as incontrovertibly benefited where the court regards it as reasonably certain that he will realise the positive benefit. Assessment of the defendant's future conduct is necessarily speculative but the courts commonly have to predict future conduct in assessing damages for loss, precisely to avoid the nonsense of rigidly cutting off loss at the date of trial."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

36. Mr Purchas for Coys supports Goff &amp; Jones's approach, while Mr Swirsky submits on behalf of Mr McDonald that we should adopt Professor Burrows' intermediate approach. However, I think that Professor Burrows' approach might perhaps be open to the comment that it is too restrictive, and that a requirement of proof of intention might itself also encourage tactical stances or manoeuvring not too dissimilar to that which he fears on Professor Birks' approach.
Here, Mr McDonald received the mark. He did not realise any financial benefit from it, so if one were to treat Professor Birks' suggested requirement of actual realisation as relevant, it would not be met. However, Mr McDonald could easily have arranged for re-transfer of the mark to any car nominated by the estate and its financial value was easily realisable on the market, if he had so wished. If the test suggested by Goff &amp; Jones were accepted, there would of course be no difficulty in concluding that Mr McDonald received a readily realisable benefit. That he subsequently gave it away to his partner could go at most to a possible defence of change of position. Professor Burrows' modified approach, requiring us to consider whether it was also reasonably certain that Mr McDonald would realise the financial benefit, would seem difficult to apply in or adapt to the present situation. It would fit a case where the defendant retains the alleged benefit at trial, not a case where he has apparently chosen to give it away, in knowledge of the relevant facts and claims (unless perhaps one could treat the gift away as the realisation of a benefit). Even if one were to attempt to ignore the gift away, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to consider what a defendant's intention would have been regarding realisation, if he had not given the benefit away, when giving it away is what he actually chose to do.

37. Looking at the matter generally, I have no doubt that justice requires that a person, who (as a result of some mistake which it becomes evident has been made in the execution of an agreed bargain) has a benefit or the right to a benefit for which he knows that he has not bargained or paid, should reimburse the value of that benefit to the other party if it is readily returnable without substantial difficulty or detriment and he chooses to retain it (or give it away to a third party) rather than to re-transfer it on request. Even if realisable benefit alone is not generally sufficient, the law should recognise, as a distinct category of enrichment, cases where a benefit is readily returnable. A person who receives another's chattel must either return it or pay damages, commonly measured by reference to its value. The mark is not a chattel, and it was not suggested before us that its return could at any stage (even before the gift to the partner) have been enforced, or that its non-return could sound in damages. (There were allegations below of implied duties to co-operate in the return of the mark, but the judge did not accept them, and there is no appeal in that respect.) However, Mr McDonald's insistence on keeping the mark and the absence of any obvious means of compelling its re-transfer are reasons for analysing this case in terms of unjust enrichment. Mr McDonald knew that he had not bargained or paid for the mark. The mark or its benefit was in practice easily returnable. If Mr McDonald chose to keep it, then I see every reason for treating him as benefited.

38. It also seems to me unrealistic to suppose that Mr McDonald did not in the circumstances himself attach value to the mark. By refusing to effect a re-transfer, and by later giving the car with its mark away to his partner, Mr McDonald was exercising a deliberate preference to give himself and/or his partner the practical enjoyment of the mark for the meantime and the possibility of realising its monetary value in the longer term. Before giving the car to his partner, he could have re-transferred the mark to the estate's order, or he could have given her the car on the understanding that she would re-transfer the mark to the estate's order, if he so required. Further, although I would not go as far as the judge did in equating Mr McDonald and his partner for all purposes, the practical effect of their relationship and of Mr McDonald's evidence about it cannot be ignored. They were living together with a young family, and the car was for their joint use. The expectation would have been that both would continue to benefit both by the supposed cachet and by any future sale of the mark.

39. Mr McDonald's responses under cross-examination were to the general effect that the registration mark was a matter of indifference to him and to his partner (cf transcript pp.9-10 and judgment p.11F). If that had been so, then, as the judge said, it would be difficult to understand why he took the attitude he did and did not co-operate in a re-transfer to the estate. To my mind, Mr McDonald's attitude in and after December 2000, and his conduct in giving his partner the mark with the car, show that he attached and attaches a value to the mark. Whatever their motives, numbers of car-owners pay good money to have a personalised plate. The inference is that Mr McDonald, despite his denials, attached real value to the mark, and determined that it should be retained for that reason.

40. In these circumstances, and in agreement with the judge, I would conclude that Mr McDonald received an incontrovertible benefit in the market value of the mark. Viewing the matter in the terms in which counsel presented it, there could be no difficulty in reaching this conclusion on the simple test of realisability advocated by Goff &amp; Jones. Even if realisability is not alone generally sufficient, the ability to realise the mark in the future, coupled with the enjoyment of its possession and use in the meantime, seem to me considerable arguments in favour of a conclusion that Mr McDonald regarded himself as subjectively benefited by the mark and should be treated as benefited by its value. I would regard Professor Birks' test of realised benefit, if it were to be applied to this situation, as overly narrow, and Professor Burrows' test as inappropriate and inapplicable in the present context (unless in each case one were to treat the gift to the partner as a realisation of benefit, which seems artificial). In my view, however, the law must in any event recognise as a distinct category of enrichment cases of readily returnable benefit, of which the present is an example. I therefore conclude that Mr McDonald did obtain a benefit which he should prima facie reimburse, if not in kind then in cash.

''Change of position''

41. To rebut this prima facie conclusion, Mr Swirsky repeated before us the submission advanced below to the effect that Mr McDonald had changed his position and deprived himself of any benefit by giving the car with its mark to his partner. The wide view of the doctrine of change of position is that it "looks to any change of position, causally linked to the mistaken receipt, which makes it inequitable for the recipient to be required to make restitution": Scottish Equitable plc v. Derby [2001] EWCA 369; [2001] 3 AER 818, paras. 30-31 per Robert Walker LJ. Assuming this to be the correct view, still there can be nothing in the suggested defence in this case, having regard to the findings regarding the factual position set out in paragraphs 18-21 above. By the time Mr McDonald gave the car away, he knew that there had been a mistaken failure to obtain any right of retention under the statutory scheme and that both the estate and Coys would be pursuing him to recover the mark or its value. This negatives both any causal link and any inequity. A gift away made in such circumstances cannot have been made in reliance on the validity of the original receipt of the mark and cannot be regarded as having been made "in good faith", so there can be no defence of change of position: see Lipkin Gorman v. Karpnale Ltd. [1991] 2 AC 548, 560C per Lord Templeman and 580C per Lord Goff; and Niru Battery Manufacturing Co. v. Milestone Trading Ltd. [2002] EWCA 1425 (Comm.), paras. 134-5 per Moore-Bick J, approved [2003] EWCA (Civ.) 1446. Even if I had found that the gift to the partner took effect on the evening of 13th December 2000, I would also have considered that Mr McDonald was by then in possession of sufficient knowledge to exclude causal reliance and inequity or good faith: see paragraph 21 above.

A '''referendum on constitutional reform''' was held in [[Mexico]] on 22 September 1867.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=mx011867 Mexico, 22 September 1867: Constitutional Reform] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the execution of the [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]],  reinstated [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Benito Juárez]] adopted a decree on 14 August 1867 that called for general elections and five constitutional reforms:
* Bicameral [[Congress of the Union|legislature]] (i.e., establishment of a [[Senate of the Republic (Mexico)|senate]])
* [[Veto]] of the President by Congress, requiring a 2/3 [[supermajority]]
* Substituting written notice by executive officers for a previous requirement of personal presence
* Limiting the powers of the Congress Committee when Congress is not in session
* To provide a method of succession for both President and Chief Justice
The referendum was held alongside [[Mexican general election, 1867|general elections]].  The newly elected Congress opposed the growing power of the President and referred to articles 40 and 127 of the Constitution of 1857, which set up a purely representative system and gave only Congress the right to change the Constitution. In a compromise, Juárez was re-elected but the referendum results were not counted.  Juárez said he had called the referendum only because of extraordinary circumstances, and the Congress was satisfied by a reprimand to the President.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=mx011867&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mitchell v MNR''''', [2001] 1 S.C.R. 911 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] rights under [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|section 35(1)]] of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]''. The court held that Mitchell's claim to an aboriginal right to import goods across the [[Canada]]–[[United States|US]] border was invalid as he was unable to present enough evidence showing that the importation was an integral part of the band's distinctive culture.

In 1988, Grand Chief Michael Mitchell, a [[mohawk nation|Mohawk]] of Akwesasne, attempted to bring goods from the US into Canada. At the border he declared everything that he had purchased in the US but refused to pay any duty on it, claiming that he had an aboriginal right to bring goods across the border.

At trial, the Federal Court agreed with Mitchell and held that there was an aboriginal right to import goods. The decision was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal.

The Supreme Court overturned the decision, and held that Mitchell was required to pay duty for all of the goods he imported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3726">The '''Narcotics Rewards Program''' is a program of the [[United States Department of State]] that offers [[bounty (reward)|rewards]] up to [[US$]]5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of major international [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics traffickers]] who send drugs into the [[United States]]. It was established by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1986, and {{as of|lc=1|2011}} it has paid out over $62 million.

The Department of State’s [[Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] (INL) manages the program in close coordination with the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], [[U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and other interested U.S. agencies.

Proposals to pay rewards are submitted to the Department of State by the chief of mission at a U.S. embassy at the behest of a U.S. law enforcement agency. Reward proposals are carefully reviewed by an interagency committee, which makes a recommendation for a reward payment to the Secretary of State. Only the Secretary of State has the authority to determine if a reward should be paid, and, in cases where there is Federal criminal jurisdiction, the Secretary must obtain the concurrence of the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. It normally takes more than a year for the Department of State to pay a reward. although there are cases reported as diego leon montoya sanchez carrying more than eight years without pay the reward offered for his capture, the  reward posters offer a reward " up to" $5 million,people interested in a reward should know that the quoted phrase has been construed to include zero as its lower limit. See application of Michel, 470 F2d 638' 640 (C.C.P.A 1972); Arness v. Franks, 138 F2d 213, 216 (C.C.P.A 1943); see also Public service comm'n of Md. v. City of Annapolis, 526 A.2d 975, 981 (Md Ct Spec App 1987) ( " the statement of a maximum does not imply the existence of a minimum") also who any federal agent is authorized to promise that the reward will be pay, only the attorney  general can guarantee the pay

Overseas, individuals wishing to provide information on major narcotics traffickers may contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. In the U.S., individuals should contact the DEA, FBI, or ICE directly. The U.S. Government will ensure confidentiality to individuals who provide information on major narcotics traffickers, and, if appropriate, will relocate these individuals and their families.

In February 2014, the Guardian reported that some informants were not paid the rewards offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brodzinsky|first1=Sibylla|title=Informants who helped US catch drug lords say rewards have not been paid|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/informants-us-catch-drug-lords-rewards-not-paid|accessdate=24 January 2015|work=The Guardian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163019/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/informants-us-catch-drug-lords-rewards-not-paid|archivedate=31 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=December 2007}}

'''''Nezikin''''' ({{lang-he-n|נזיקין}} ''Neziqin'', "Damages") or '''''Seder Nezikin''''' ({{Hebrew|סדר נזיקין}}, "The Order of Damages") is the fourth [[Mishnah|Order]] of the [[Mishna]] (also the [[Tosefta]] and [[Talmud]]). It deals largely with Jewish criminal and civil law and the [[Beth Din|Jewish court system]].

Nezikin contains ten volumes (or "tractates"):

#'''''[[Bava Kamma]]''''' ({{Hebrew|בבא קמא}}, ''First Gate'') deals with civil matters, largely damages and compensation. 10 chapters. (See also [[Shomer]])
#'''''[[Bava Metzia]]''''' ({{Hebrew|בבא מציעא}}, ''Middle Gate'') deals with civil matters, largely torts and property law. 10 chapters.
#'''''[[Bava Batra]]''''' ({{Hebrew|בבא בתרא}}, ''Last Gate'') deals with civil matters, largely land ownership. 10 chapters.
#'''''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'''''  ({{Hebrew|סנהדרין}}, ''The [[Sanhedrin]]'') deals with the rules of court proceedings in the [[Sanhedrin]], the death penalty, and other criminal matters. 11 chapters.
#'''''[[Makkot]]''''' ({{Hebrew|מכות}}, ''Lashes'') deals with collusive witnesses, [[cities of refuge]] and the punishment of lashes. 3 chapters.
#'''''[[Shevu'ot]]''''' ({{Hebrew|שבועות}}, ''Oaths'') deals with the various types of oaths and their consequences. 8 chapters.
#'''''Eduyot''''' ({{Hebrew|עדויות}}, ''Testimonies'') presents case studies of legal disputes in Mishnaic times and the miscellaneous testimonies that illustrate various Sages and principles of [[halakha]]. 8 chapters.
#'''''[[Avodah Zarah]]''''' ({{Hebrew|עבודה זרה}}, ''Foreign worship'') deals with the laws of interactions between Jews and Gentiles and/or idolaters (from a Jewish perspective). 5 chapters.
#'''''[[Pirkei Avoth|Avot]]''''' ({{Hebrew|אבות}}, ''Fathers'') is a collection of the Sages' favourite ethical maxims. 6 chapters.
#'''''[[Horayot]]''''' ({{Hebrew|הוריות}}, ''Decisions'') deals with the communal sin-offering brought for major errors by the Sanhedrin. 3 chapters.

Originally, the first three volumes were counted as one single, very lengthy volume. Since it was the chief repository of "civil" law, it was simply called ''Massekhet Nezikin'' ("Tractate Damages"). The traditional reasoning for the order of the volumes of Nezikin is as follows: The Order begins with civil law (the first 3 tractates) because it is considered the cornerstone of righteousness within a Jewish state. Sanhedrin naturally follows, as it deals with criminal law. Next comes Makkot, as it is a continuation of Sanhedrin's subject matter in terms of criminal procedure. Then, Shevuot, which continues the general topic dealt with in Makkot of the false testimony. After outlining the main points of civil and criminal law, Eduyot follows to fit it all into a halakhic framework. After dealing with "damages" within a society, the next stage is Avodah Zarah placed after to highlight what is seen as behaviour that inflicts damage on the universe. Avot is probably placed next to counteract the negativity of the laws of Avodah Zarah and to relate maxims of the Sages, an essential aspect of whose teaching was to counteract idolatry. Finally, Horayot brings the discussion from lofty heights to a humble note, highlighting the concept that even the Sages and ''[[Beth Din|battei din]]'' can err.
There is both a Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud to each of the tractates except for Eduyot and Avot. This is probably because these two tractates aren't concerned with individual laws and therefore don't lend themselves to a [[Gemara]] style analysis.

The '''Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction''', known informally as the '''Ottawa Treaty''', the '''Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention''', or often simply the '''Mine Ban Treaty''', aims at eliminating [[anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel landmines]] (AP-mines) around the world. To date, there are 164 state parties to the [[treaty]]. One state (the [[Marshall Islands]]) has signed but not ratified the treaty, while [[List of parties to the Ottawa Treaty#Non-signatory states|32 UN states]], including the United States, Russia, China and India are non-signatories, making a total of 33 United Nations states not party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/en-gb/the-treaty/treaty-status.aspx|title=Treaty Status|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ICBL|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
'''1939'''

Landmines are first used widely in [[World War II]].

'''1977'''

During the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]], one provision is amended to prohibit the targeting of [[civilian]] populations by indiscriminate weapons in wartime.

'''1980'''

October: The [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons|Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects]] (CCW) is adopted by a United Nations Conference in Geneva. Among the three annexed Protocols the "Protocol on prohibitions or restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) established some restrictions on the use of anti-personnel landmines.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen: The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction. Point 0.29, p. 16 in: Oxford Commentaries on International Law, Commentaries on Arms Control Treaties, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2004; {{ISBN|0-19-926977-7}};&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1991'''

Six [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] supporting a ban of landmines begin organizing the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] (ICBL), established the following year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/media/342067/icb009_chronology_a5_v4-pages.pdf|title=Timeline of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ICBL|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1992'''

October: The Steering committee of the ICBL issued a call for an international ban on the use, production, stockpiling and sale, transfer or export of  anti-personnel landmines.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen, (2004) Point 0.35, note 98,  p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1993'''

9 February: France formally submitted a request to the Secretary-General of the UN to convene a Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) in accordance with its Article 8 in order to strengthen the provisions in the Convention on the use of anti-personnel landmines.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen,(2004) Point 0.34, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The First International NGO Conference on Landmines is held in London, organised by the ICBL and acknowledging [[Jody Williams]] as the organization's coordinator. The [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] publishes its report ''Hidden Killer: The Global Problem with Uncleared Landmines'',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the ICBL issues the study ''Landmines: A deadly Legacy''.

16 December: The UN General Assembly adopts Resolution 48/79 which formally welcomed the request to convene a Review Conference of the CCW, encouraged the establishment of a group of governmental experts to prepare this Conference and called upon the maximum number of States to attend.(operative paragraphs 5-7)  &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen,(2004) Point 0.34, p. 18/19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1994'''

24 February: The President of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), [[Cornelio Sommaruga]], declared that from a humanitarian point of view; a “worldwide ban on anti-personnel mines” was the only truly effective solution" to come to terms with the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.37, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, certain UN bodies such as the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) the [[United Nations Children’s Fund]] and the Secretary-General himself called for a total ban on anti-personnel mines.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.38, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
 
10 July: The [[Group of Seven Industrialised Nations]] (G7) at its meeting in Naples i. a. assigned priority to the problem of APM’s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), Point 0.38, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

September: At the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA) US President [[Bill Clinton]] called for the “eventual elimination” of anti-personnel mines.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

15 December: The UN  General Assembly adopts Resolution 49/75 D “Moratorium on the Export of Anti-Personnel Land-Mines”, which urges States to declare such a moratorium, stating i. a.:

“Recognizing that States can move effectively towards the ultimate goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable and humane alternatives are developed”.
 
“Emphasizes the importance of the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and its Protocols as the authoritative international instrument governing the responsible use of anti-personnel land-mines and related devices. (operative paragraph 4)

“Encourages further international efforts to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel-mines, with a view to their eventual elimination" (operative paragraph 6).&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit.Text of this Resolution in Appendix 2, p. 342-343&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1995'''

The first national law to ban anti-personnel landmines is passed in Belgium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

12 May:  The Council of the [[European Union]] adopts a “Common Action” on anti-personnel landmines including a common moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines.

The improvement of the legal restrictions on the use of anti-personnel mines contained in Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) proved to be an uphill task. Four meetings of the group of governmental experts were necessary to prepare the basis for the Review Conference of this Convention because of difficulties to reach consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.39, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

25 September to 13 October: The first '''Review Conference of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons''' (CCW) was finally held in Vienna (Austria). The focus was on its Protocol II, as it was the authoritative international instrument governing the responsible use of anti-personnel land-mines. Many improvements were proposed, but in spite of intensive debates, did not find consensus. The Review Conference therefore had to be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004)  Point 0.38, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

12 December: The United Nations General Assembly adopts Resolution 50/70 O  “Moratorium on the Export of Anti-Personnel Land-Mines”, urging States to declare such a moratorium and to build consensus towards an agreement when the Review Conference (of the CCW Convention) reconvenes. Stating i. a.:
“Also encourages further immediate international efforts to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, with a view to the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines; (operative paragraph 6) &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), Text in Appendix 2, p. 343-345&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1996'''

15-19 January: The Review Conference of the CCW resumed its work in Geneva but could not find consensus on the reforms proposed to improve Protocol II.

April: The '''first Draft''' of what later became the “Ottawa Convention” was informally made by the Austrian representative at the Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), Dr. Werner Ehrlich, out of frustration with the lack of progress achieved towards a total ban at this Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen: (2004) op. cit. Point 0.43, and note 128, page 24. The text of this first draft is quoted in Appendix 4, p. 397-397&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich, Auf dem Weg zu einer Konvention über das Verbot von Anti-Personen-Minen; page 194; in: Österreichisches Jahrbuch für internationale Politik; Österreichische Gesellschaft für Außenpolitik und internationale Beziehungen gemeinsam mit dem Österreichischen Institut für internationale Politik; Verlag Böhlau, 1996;&lt;/ref&gt;

This first Draft provided already for a complete prohibition of the employment, production, transfer and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines, required destruction of stockpiles within one year of entry into force, and clearance of laid anti-personnel mines within five years. It represents the essence of what would subsequently be elaborated into the first Austrian Draft text of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen, (2004) Point 0.47, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

22 April - 3 May 1996: The Review Conference of the CCW resumed again its work in Geneva.

28 April:  At the presentation of the first Draft of the Convention by the author at a meeting among States supporting a total ban and relevant NGO’s, this project was seen only as a “remote possibility”, and therefore not even discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich, (1996) p. 194;&lt;/ref&gt;

3 May: At the resumed Review Conference of the CCWC in Geneva the '''“Amended Protocol II”''' is finally adopted by consensus.
 
The reaction of many States to this result was quite negative as its provisions were widely considered to be overly complex and insufficiently stringent to deal with the humanitarian crisis created by APM’s.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. Point 0.40, p. 21/22&lt;/ref&gt; The new restrictions on the use of APM’s were qualified even as “woefully inadequate” by the ICRC.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. Point 0.41, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

At the closing session of the Review Conference Canada announced that it would host a meeting of pro-ban States in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. Point 0.44, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; while the Austrian Representative announced the preparation of the draft of a Convention on a total Ban of APM’s &lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich, (1996)  p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

May: At an expert meeting of the [[European Union]] Dr. Ehrlich proposed to revise the “Common Action” adopted on 12 May 1995, in order to move ahead and to support the project of a Convention on a total ban of APM’s; and suggested that the EU should prepare the draft of a Resolution on an enlarged moratorium (including use and production of APM’s) and on a total ban for the next General Assembly of the UN. The first proposal found consensus, not the second one, which was later taken up by Canada and by the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich, (1997) Point 3.b, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

26 June: First debate on the Draft by - sceptical - like-minded Countries and selected NGO’s at a small Strategy meeting at the Quaker UN Office in Geneva.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. Point 0.47, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

7 July: This Draft is circulated by the Quaker UN Office in Geneva to three like-minded Countries, Austria, Canada and Switzerland and to selected NGOs, to UNICEF and UNIDIR.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

30 September: An improved '''second Draft''' of the Convention on a total ban on APM’s, taking into account numerous comments and suggestions received, is prepared by Dr. Ehrlich for the 1996 Ottawa Conference,.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen, op. cit. point 0.52, p 28&lt;/ref&gt;

1 October:  The [[Council of the European Union]]  adopts - after difficult negotiations – a new ''' “Common Action”''' on APM’s, which constitutes a big step forward as its Article 2 supports the early conclusion of an international Agreement on a total ban of APM’s.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich (1997) Point 3.b, p- 195&lt;/ref&gt; This is a remarkable decision, as a number of EU-Members consider anti-personnel mines as military necessity, but this open support comes not without a mental reservation: As those negotiations were supposed to take place in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament, each Member would have the possibility to block them at any time.

3-5 October: '''The 1996 Ottawa Conference''' (The Ottawa International Strategy Conference). 
Due to the presence of Countries openly opposing a total ban in Ottawa, consensus was difficult to achieve. The political “Ottawa Declaration” was accepted only in the last moment, after protracted negotiations. The main document, the “Agenda for Action on Anti-Personnel (AP) Mines” failed to get consensus. Due to a compromise proposed by Austria it was finally accepted, but only as “paper of the Chairman”.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. Point 4 b, p. 196)&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the Conference was: “ to catalyze practical efforts to move toward a ban and to create partnerships... essential to building the necessary political will to achieve a global ban on AP mines”.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit. This purpose is defined in the second paragraph of the “Chairman’s Agenda for Action on Anti-Personnel Mines”. Text in Appendix 3, page 361&lt;/ref&gt;

The project of a Convention on a Total Ban of APM’s, advocated by the Austrian representative, Dr. Werner Ehrlich, was therefore low on the agenda and produced mainly negative reactions, including from likeminded countries, considering it to be premature,&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich, op. cit. p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[European Union]] - which blocked the distribution of the prepared Draft at the Conference &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit., Point 0.52 p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; and even from leading humanitarian organizations, such as the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]  (ICRC) and the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] (ICBL), fearing waste of time and detraction from the priority of urgent practical measures.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. point 4 c, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

The turning point was the announcement by the Austrian representative, that no time needs to be wasted as he had a complete Draft of such a Convention at his disposal &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen, op. cit. Point 0.52, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; and his invitation, to start immediately a fast-track, free-standing negotiating process in Vienna - outside the UN [[Conference on Disarmament]] (CD) – notoriously blocked for many years by the lack of consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich, (1996) op. cit. S. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Lloyd Axworthy]], instantly supported this proposal as a chance for a successful conclusion of the Conference and decided to task Austria to prepare the draft for these negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. point 4d, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that they should be concluded by the end of the year 1997 in Ottawa. This important decision is reflected in the text of the “Chairmen’s Agenda for Action on Anti-Personnel (AP) Mines” as follows: “To lay the necessary groundwork for a legally-binding international agreement to ban AP mines, Austria will produce a first draft and Canada will produce a possible framework for the verification of such an agreement”.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004): op. cit. Point 5 under Chapter A “Global Action” in the “Chairmen’s Agenda”. Text in Appendix 3, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister Lloyd Axworthy started thereby the so-called “Ottawa Process”, while countries opposed to a total ban were too shocked and too surprised to block this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004): op. cit. point 0.49, and note 139, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

November: A further enhanced '''third Draft''' of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention was prepared by Dr. Ehrlich and sent out worldwide. It was later known as the '''“First Austrian Draft”''' and was the basis for the forthcoming negotiations on this Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen, op. cit. Point 0.52, p. 28. . Text in Appendix 4, p. 407-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. p. 196, Text: on p. 201-205&lt;/ref&gt;

10 December: The General Assembly of the United Nations adopts Resolution 51/45 S: “An International Agreement to Ban Anti-Personnel Land-Mines”, which was supported by 115 co-sponsors. In its first operative paragraph States are urged:” to pursue vigorously an effective, legally binding international agreement to ban the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines with a view to completing the negotiations as soon as possible”.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004),  p. 29-30. The text of this resolution is in Appendix 2, p. 346-347&lt;/ref&gt;

20 December: '''Draft of the ICBL''': The International Campaign to Ban Landmines presents its own draft of a Convention on a total ban of APM’s. Much of its language would subsequently be reflected in the text of the Convention adopted.

'''Belgian Draft''': Belgium, one of the first supporters of a total ban treaty, also prepared a draft of such a treaty, which however appears to have had little direct influence on the later Austrian drafts.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004),  Point 0.55, p. 29. The text of the proposal of the ICBL is in Appendix 4, p. 398-404, the text of the Belgian draft follows on p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1997'''

10 January: [[Austria]] adopts the first law on a comprehensive, permanent total ban of APM*s. It goes beyond the earlier Belgian law which was limited in its effect to 5 years and did not exclude stockpiling of APM’s allowing thereby the use of APM in case of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. p. 193, Text: Bundesgesetzblatt Nr. 13/1997 vom 10. Jänner 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Threats to the comprehensive nature of the Convention''':

A major threat to the project of a Total ban Convention as endorsed by the 1996 Ottawa Conference was the danger of being watered down.

One example was the well-intended attempt made by Canada to win the support of Countries opposed to a total ban – in particular the USA – by  proposing a new approach: To replace the Draft Convention by a new text, composed of a “Chapeau-Convention”, containing generalities only, and four annexed protocols, each one dealing with one of the main prohibitions: production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.54, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; This approach would  allow some additional Countries to join the process but at the price of allowing them to pick and choose only those prohibitions compatible with their military needs. A concept, that would keep only the appearance of a total ban Treaty  would risk creating a confusing situation of varying legal situations, and would,in the first place, postpone a real comprehensive total ban “ad calendas graecas”. This proposal did however not materialise as the USA rebuffed the idea, believing that they could steer the negotiations into the Conference on Disarmament where it would be subject to the consensus rule.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

''' Attempts to block the project of a Total Ban Convention'''

Countries opposing a total ban of APM’s because of their military necessities had an obvious interest to prevent any negotiations on a total ban and in particular in free standing negotiations as proposed by Austria.  
 
The smart way to achieve this aim was to insist on holding the relevant negotiations in the framework of the competent forum of the UN for disarmament negotiations, the Conference on Disarmament (CD). The catch is, that the CD had become since many years a dead end, because of fundamental disagreements among States Members on its agenda and because of the rule of consensus giving each member de facto the right of veto.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich (1996) Point 4.b, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

17 January: The [[White House]] declared that the USA will seek to initiate negotiations on a worldwide treaty banning the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva.

30 January: In the CD the [[United Kingdom]] proposed the mandate for an ad hoc committee on a ban on APM’s, which however was not accepted.
 
In the CD later Hungary and Japan made other, similarly unsuccessful, attempts in this direction &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004),p. 45, and note 223 on p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

12-14 February: ''' The 1997 Vienna Conference ''' (The Expert Meeting on the Text of a Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines) was the first formal follow-up to the 1996 Ottawa Conference. It provided States with an initial opportunity to comment directly on the “First Austrian Draft” of the Convention. Representatives of 111 Governments attended this Conference. NGO’s were allowed to attend the plenary sessions, the UN and the ICRC were invited to participate even in the closed meetings. Only few governments spoke out against a total ban treaty &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit. points 0.58/0.59  and note 170 p. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

14 March: The '''“Second Austrian Draft”''' was completed, which, due to comments and suggestions received at the Vienna Conference, differed quite significantly from the first draft.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen, op. cit. points 0.62 and 0.63  p. 32/33&lt;/ref&gt;

March: Other attempts to replace the “Ottawa Process” by negotiations in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) were undertaken by opponents of a total ban:

Some EU Countries prompted the Netherlands to propose in the CD a draft mandate for negotiations on a total ban of APM’s. But this proposal was blocked by other EU States opposing an immediate ban.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit. Point 0.94, p.45/46.&lt;/ref&gt;

27 March: At the CD Finland and Poland tabled a formal proposal to appoint a Special Coordinator for mine negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004),  p. 6, note 227&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
5-24 April: ''' The 1997 Bonn Conference ''' (FRG) (The International Expert Meeting on Possible Verification Measures to Ban Anti-Personnel Landmines in Bonn), was the second formal follow-up gathering to the 1996 Ottawa Conference and was attended by 121 governments. The German “Options Paper for a possible verification scheme for a convention to ban anti-personnel landmines” suggested significant and intrusive verification measures common in disarmament treaties. As opinions diverged, only some progress in this field was achieved. The spirit of the concept is reflected i. a. in the first paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen, op. cit. points 0.64/0.65 p. 33/34&lt;/ref&gt;

End of April: [[France]], previously an ardent supporter of tackling the mine issue in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament (CD), realized that the free negotiating process was irreversible and joined the process as the first member of the Security Council of the UN &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen, op. cit. point 0.68 on p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

14 May: The '''“Third Austrian Draft”''' was issued. It included small changes from the previous Second Draft, e. g. regarding compliance issues, the question of duration and the possibility of withdrawal from the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Text in Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit.,Point 0.67, p. 34; Text in Appendix 4 p. 416 -422&lt;/ref&gt;

21 May: The [[United Kingdom]]  – previously supporting negotiations in the CD - announced that it was joining the process as the second member of the UN Security Council.

24-27 June: '''The 1997 Brussels Conference ''' (The Brussels International Conference for a Comprehensive Ban on Anti-Personnel Landmines) It provided a clear selection process for the forthcoming diplomatic conference in Oslo: It identified the Third Austrian Draft formally as the basis for its negotiations, agreed that a two-third majority was necessary for any substantive changes of this Draft,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004)  Point 0.81, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  limited the voting right to States having adhered to the Brussels Declaration and allowed the ICBL to participate as a full observer, despite concerns from a number of States.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.80,  p. 38/39&lt;/ref&gt; The essential elements of the Convention were resumed in the “Brussels Declaration”, signed by 97 of the 156 States attending the Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) Points  0.76, p. 37, Text of the Declaration in Appendix 2,  p 376-380&lt;/ref&gt;

Even during the Brussels Conference new attempts were made to divert the negotiations on the Convention to the Conference on Disarmament:
	     
26 June: In the CD an agreement was reached to appoint a Special Coordinator for APM’s tasked to try to find an agreed mandate that could form the basis for discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit.Point 0.75, and note 190 on p. 37 and Point 0.95, on  p.46&lt;/ref&gt;
 
14 August: In the CD the special Coordinator for APM’s declared that there was little point in the CD taking any decisions on a possible mandate on APM’s until the outcome of the Ottawa Process was known in December 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit.; point 0.95, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; This signaled the end of efforts to undercut the Ottawa Process in the CD.

18 August: The [[United States]] finally joined the Ottawa Process. The White House announced that the USA would be a full participant in the negotiations at the forthcoming Oslo Diplomatic Conference. But in a letter to key foreign ministers the US Secretary of State, [[Madeleine Albright]], laid down five conditions for the USA’s eventual signature of the treaty:
* a geographical exception for the use of mines in South Korea;
* a change of the definition of APM’s to allow the use of mixed anti-tank and anti-personnel “munitions” systems;
* a transition period requiring, either through entry into force requiring  60 countries, including all five permanent members of the Security Council and at least 75 per cent of historic producers and users of APM’s, or an optional nine-year deferral period for compliance with certain provisions;
* a strengthening of the verification regime; and 
* a clause permitting a party to withdraw when its superior national interests were threatened.  
&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. point 0.84, and note 198, p. 39/40&lt;/ref&gt;

1-19 September: The '''1997 Oslo Conference''' (The Oslo Diplomatic Conference on an International Total Ban on Anti-Personnel Land Mines). Its purpose, the final negotiation and formal adoption of the Treaty was achieved only after intensive debates on the conditions presented by the US and on numerous other new proposals on 18 September 1997, after the US delegation announced that it was withdrawing its proposals as it had been unable to garner the necessary support for them. The Convention was then formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. point 0.90, p. 43. Texts of the proposals in Appendix 5; p. 423-450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/en-gb/problem/why-the-ban.aspx|title=Why the Ban|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ICBL|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3-4 December: '''The 1997 Ottawa Conference''' (The Convention signing Conference and Mine Action Forum). In accordance with its Article 15, the Convention was opened for signature in Ottawa at a formal treaty signing conference. In total 150 governments attended the Conference and 121 signed the Convention at the Conference (Kenya (nr. 122) signed on 5 December).&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit., point 0.91  and note 216 on p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

This achievement was described by the Canadian Prime Minister, [[Jean Chrétien]], as “without precedent or parallel in either international disarmament or international humanitarian law.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit., point 0.91 on p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The final Conference Document, the 67-page “Program for Mine Action” detailed pledges of more than 500 million $ to the mine effort over a five-year period. “ &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit., point 0.93 on p. 44. Text of the main part of the Final Document in Appendix 3, p. 388-395&lt;/ref&gt;

5 December: The Convention is deposed in New York with the Secretary General of the United Nations, and opened for further signatures.

9 December: The General Assembly of the United Nations adopts by 142 votes Resolution 52/38&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/documents/gares52/res5238.htm|title=A/RES/52/38|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A “Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction”, welcoming i. a. the conclusion of negotiations on 18 September of the Convention in Oslo, inviting “all States to sign the Convention…” (operative paragraph 1) and urging “all States to ratify the Convention without delay subsequent to their signatures” (operative paragraph 2) &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit.; Text in Appendix  2;  p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
=== Treaty terms ===
Besides ceasing the production and development of anti-personnel mines, a party to the treaty must destroy its stockpile of anti-personnel mines within four years, although it may retain a small number for training purposes ([[Demining|mine-clearance]], detection, etc.). Within ten years after ratifying the treaty, the country should have cleared all of its mined areas. This is a difficult task for many countries, but at the annual meetings of the States Parties they may request an extension and assistance. The treaty also calls on States Parties to provide assistance to mine-affected persons in their own country and to provide assistance to other countries in meeting their treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/index.php/icbl/Work/MBT/Victim-Assistance|title=Six Pillars of Victim Assistance - Finish the Job -  ICBL|website=Icbl.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/index.php/icbl/Work/MBT/Other-Obligations|title=International Cooperation and Assistance - Finish the Job|website=Icbl.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty covers only anti-personnel mines; it does not address mixed mines, [[anti-tank mine]]s, remote-controlled [[M18 Claymore mine|claymore mines]], anti-handling devices ([[booby trap]]s), and other "static" explosive devices.

=== Destruction of stockpiles ===
Signatory nations have destroyed more than 48 million stockpiled mines since the treaty's entry into force on 1 March 1999. One hundred and fifty-nine (159) countries have completed the destruction of their stockpiles or declared that they did not possess stockpiles to destroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apminebanconvention.org/background-status-of-the-convention/destroying-stockpiled-mines/|title=AP Mine Ban Convention: Destroying Stockpiled Mines|website=Apminebanconvention.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retention of landmines===
Article 3 of the treaty permits countries to retain landmines for use in training in mine detection, mine clearance, or mine destruction techniques. 72 countries have taken this option. Of this group, 26 States Parties retain fewer than 1,000 mines. Only two have retained more than 10,000 mines: Turkey (15,100) and [[Bangladesh]] (12,500). A total of 83 States Parties have declared that they do not retain any antipersonnel mines, including 27 states that stockpiled antipersonnel mines in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Landmine Monitor Report 2012, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landmine-free countries ===
Through 2015, 29 countries had cleared all known mined areas from their territory: [[Albania]], [[Bhutan]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Burundi]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Costa Rica]], Denmark, [[Djibouti]], France, [[The Gambia|Gambia]], Germany, [[Guinea-Bissau]], Greece, [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Hungary]], [[Jordan]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Malawi]],  [[Mozambique]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[Suriname]], [[Swaziland]], [[Tunisia]], [[Uganda]], and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apminebanconvention.org/background-status-of-the-convention/clearing-mined-areas/states-parties-that-have-completed-article-5/|title=Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention|last=|first=|date=|website=Apminebanconvention.org|access-date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[El Salvador]] finished clearing its landmines before joining the Treaty.

At the November–December 2009 Cartagena Summit for a Mine-Free World, Albania, Greece, Rwanda, and [[Zambia]] were also declared mine-free.&lt;ref&gt;ICBL, "Four New Countries Declared Mine-Free at Landmine Summit," http://www.icbl.org/index.php/icbl/Library/News-Articles/Work/pr-4dec2009 (4 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2009, Rwanda was declared [[demining|free of landmines]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8388822.stm|title=Rwanda – first landmine-free country|date=2 December 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed a three-year campaign by 180 Rwandan soldiers, supervised by the [[Mine clearance agency#Mine Awareness Trust|Mine Awareness Trust]] and trained in [[Kenya]], to remove over 9,000 mines laid in the country between 1990 and 1994.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The soldiers checked and cleared 1.3 square km of land in twenty minefields.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The official Cartagena Summit announcement came after the [[Ministry of Defence (Rwanda)|Rwandan Ministry of Defence]]'s own announcement of the completion of the demining process on 29 November 2009.&lt;ref name="africa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200911300008.html|title=Rwanda: Country Declared Mine-Free |date=30 November 2009|publisher=All Africa|accessdate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 5 of the Ottawa Treaty, Rwanda was requested to become mine-free by 1 December 2010.&lt;ref name="africa"/&gt;

Two more countries became free of landmines in 2011.

On 5 December 2012 at the 12th Meeting of the States Parties, six states declared themselves landmine-free. These were the Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Jordan, and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apminebanconvention.org/meetings-of-the-states-parties/12msp/what-happened-at-the-12msp/day-3-wednesday-5-december/ |title=Day 3 &amp;#124; Wednesday 5 December |publisher=AP Mine Ban Convention |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2015, Mozambique was declared free of land mines after the last of some nearly 171,000 had been cleared over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34275604|title=Mozambique declared free of mines|date=17 September 2015|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor ==
The Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor ("the Monitor") is an initiative providing research for the ICBL and the [[Cluster Munition Coalition]] (CMC), and acting as their de facto monitoring regime.

As an initiative of ICBL which was founded in 1998 through Human Rights Watch, the Monitor gives monitoring on the humanitarian development and uses of landmines, cluster munitions, and [[explosive remnants of war]] (ERW). It provides reports on all aspects of the landmine,cluster munitions, and ERW issues. It issues annual report updates on all countries in the world, keeps an international network with experts, provides research findings for all mediums, and remains flexible to adapt its reports to any changes. The Monitor has earned respect with its transparency whose states must be provided under the relevant treaties for independent reporting. Its main audiences are not only governments, NGOs, and other international organizations, but also media, academics and the public.&lt;ref name="About the Monitor"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Monitor?|url=http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/LM/About-Us/What-is-the-Monitor|publisher=Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== States Parties ==
{{Main|List of parties to the Ottawa Treaty}}
The Convention gained 122 country signatures when it opened for signing on 3 December 1997 in Ottawa, Canada. Currently, there are 164 States Parties to the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbl.org/en-gb/the-treaty/treaty-status.aspx Treaty Status], ''[[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-three countries have not signed the treaty and one more has signed but did not ratify. The [[List of parties to the Ottawa Treaty#Non-signatory states|states that have not signed the treaty]] includes a majority of the permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]: China, the United States, and Russia. In 2014, the United States declared that it will abide by the terms of the Treaty, except for landmines used on the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140926152359/http://www.armytimes.com/article/20140923/NEWS08/309230055/Obama-administration-creates-Korean-land-mine-exception]&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea, like North Korea, has not signed the treaty, believing the use of landmines to be crucial to the defense of their territory against the other.

== Criticism ==
Criticism from academics, security officials, and diplomats is based on both the political process and the substance.  The campaign for what became the Ottawa Treaty was led by a group of powerful non-governmental organizations, and instead of working within existing multilateral frameworks, including the [[Conference on Disarmament]], based at the UN compound in Geneva (the [[Palace of Nations|Palais des Nations]]), an ad hoc framework was created that detoured around existing intergovernmental processes. Critics alleged that this represented a challenge to the sovereignty and responsibility of nation states for the defense of their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davenport|first=David|date=December 1, 2002|title=The New Diplomacy|url=http://www.hoover.org/research/new-diplomacy|journal=Policy Review|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantively, critics view the treaty as naive and idealistic, in attempting to erase the reality of security threats that lead armies and defense forces to rely on landmines for protection against invasion and terror attacks. As a result, ratification has been far from universal, and many of the states that do not currently intend to ratify the treaty possess large stockpiles of anti-personnel mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/content/view/full/18719#h2 |title=Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor |publisher=The-monitor.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far 35 countries have not signed the treaty; nonsignatories include the United States, Russia, China, Myanmar, United Arab Emirates, Cuba, Egypt, India, Israel, and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/treaty/snp |title=English / Treaty Text in Many Languages / MBT / Treaty / Home - International Campaign to Ban Landmines |publisher=Icbl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the [[National Coalition Party]] and the [[Finns Party]] proposed withdrawing from the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288702262084.html|title=Jussi Niinistö osoittaa sormella Halosta ja Kataista: "Tämä oli päätös, joka maksaa tositilanteessa suomalaista verta"|date=16 June 2014|website=Iltasanomat.fi|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/ncp_wants_finland_to_quit_landmine_ban_treaty/7300114 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621102205/http://yle.fi/uutiset/ncp_wants_finland_to_quit_landmine_ban_treaty/7300114 |archivedate=21 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stance is supported by the [[Ministry of Defence (Finland)|Finnish Ministry of Defence]] report from 2003, which sees landmines as an effective weapon against a mechanised invasion force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defmin.fi/files/320/2525_1825_PuolustusministeriOn_JalkavAkimiinaselvitystyOryhmAn_vAliraportti_1_.pdf|title=PUOLUSTUSMINISTERIÖN JALKAVÄKIMIINASELVITYSTYÖRYHMÄN VÄLIRAPORTTI|publisher=Finnish Ministry of Defence|date=2003-12-19|accessdate=2016-02-04|language=FI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, in early 2018, an MP from the National Coalition Party started a citizens' initiative to withdraw from the Ottawa Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iltalehti.fi/politiikka/201802022200715346_pi.shtml|title=Kansanedustaja Eero Lehti yrittää vapauttaa maamiinat kansalaisaloitteella - ei tiennyt puolueensa päätöksestä ajaa samaa asiaa|publisher=[[Alma Media]]|website=iltalehti.fi|date=2018-02-02|accessdate=2018-07-16|language=FI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Minister of Defence (Finland)|Minister of Defence]] [[Jussi Niinistö]] ([[Blue Reform]]; formerly [[Finns Party]] prior to its split) has been supporting withdrawal from the treaty, saying that he "wants to rip it in half".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/puolustusministeri-niiniston-suomiareenassa-haluan-repia-jalkavakimiinat-kieltavan-ottawan-sopimuksen/6995132|title=Puolustusministeri Niinistö SuomiAreenassa: Haluan repiä jalkaväkimiinat kieltävän Ottawan sopimuksen|publisher=[[Bonnier Group]]|website=mtv.fi|date=2018-07-16|accessdate=2018-07-16|language=FI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine has also signaled that they might have to withdraw from the treaty due to military necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/06/21/nearly-two-decades-after-leading-role-remains-sidelines-treaty-banning-landmines/oMeRDQjDB3W2vj4VtuYqWK/story.html|title=Nearly two decades after leading role, US remains on sidelines of treaty banning landmines|publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2014-06-22|accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of banning anti-personnel mines give several reasons, among them that mines are a cheap and therefore cost-effective [[area denial weapon]]. Opponents claim that when used correctly, anti-personnel mines are defensive weapons that harm only attackers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.eduskunta.fi/Resource.phx/pubman/templates/1.htx?id=4512 |title=Julkaisutyökalu &amp;#124; Eduskunta |publisher=Web.eduskunta.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike ranged weapons such as ballistic missiles that are most effective if used for preemptive attacks. Furthermore, opponents claim that the psychological effect of mines increases the threshold to attack and thus reduces the risk of war.&lt;ref name="kokoomusnuoret"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansalliset.fi/node/21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101133429/http://www.kansalliset.fi/node/21 |archivedate=2007-11-01 |title=Maamiinat säilytettävä &amp;#124; Helsingin Kansalliset Nuoret |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottawa Treaty does not cover all types of unexploded ordnance. [[Cluster bomb]]s, for example, introduce the same problem as mines: unexploded bomblets can remain a hazard for civilians long after a conflict has ended. A separate [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]] was drafted in 2008 and was adopted and entered into force in 2010. As of January 2016, there are 98 state parties of the CCM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/%28httpPages%29/67DC5063EB530E02C12574F8002E9E49?OpenDocument |title=Where global solutions are shaped for you &amp;#124; Disarmament &amp;#124; Signatories and Ratifying States |publisher=Unog.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, mines could be replaced by manually triggered [[Claymore mine]]s, but this requires the posting of a sentry, which makes it much more expensive than using other indiscriminate weapons such as cluster bombs or artillery bombardment.

Opponents point out that the Ottawa Convention places no restriction whatever on anti-vehicle mines which kill civilians on tractors, on school buses, etc. The position of the United States is that the inhumane nature of landmines stems not from whether they are anti-personnel as opposed to antivehicle but from their persistence. The United States has unilaterally committed to never using persistent landmines of any kind, whether anti-personnel or anti-vehicle, which they say is a more comprehensive humanitarian measure than the Ottawa Convention. All US landmines now self-destruct in two days or less, in most cases four hours. While the self-destruct mechanism has never failed in more than 65,000 random tests, if self-destruct were to fail the mine will self-deactivate because its battery will run down in two weeks or less.{{failed verification|date=September 2014}} That compares with persistent anti-vehicle mines which remain lethal for about 30 years and are legal under the Ottawa Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/t/pm/wra/c11735.htm|title=U.S. Landmine Policy|website=State.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/landmines/FactSheet_FAQ_NewUSLandminePolicy_2-27-04.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407040742/http://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/landmines/FactSheet_FAQ_NewUSLandminePolicy_2-27-04.htm |archivedate=7 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little progress in actual reduction of mine usage has been achieved. In 2011, the number of landmines dispersed is higher than ever since 2004, landmines being dispersed in Libya, Syria, and Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/ulkomaat/J%C3%A4rjest%C3%B6+Maamiinoja+asennettu+enemm%C3%A4n+kuin+vuosiin/a1305549920622|title=Järjestö: Maamiinoja asennettu enemmän kuin vuosiin|date=23 November 2011|website=Hs.fi|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey reported that between 1957 and 1998, Turkish forces laid 615,419 antipersonnel mines along the Syrian border "to prevent illegal border crossings". These mines are killing Syrians stuck on the border or trying to cross near [[Kobanî]]. Turkey is required under the treaty to destroy all antipersonnel mines, but has missed deadlines. [[Human Rights Watch]] claims in its report that as of November 18, 2014, over 2,000 civilians were still in the Tel Shair corridor section of the mine belt because Turkey had been refusing entry for cars or livestock, and the refugees did not want to leave behind their belongings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/12/02/syria/turkey-landmines-kill-civilians-fleeing-kobani|title=Syria/Turkey: Landmines Kill Civilians Fleeing Kobani|date=2 December 2014|website=Hrw.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Nations General Assembly Annual Resolutions ==
A recurrent opportunity for States to indicate their support for the ban on antipersonnel mines is their vote on the annual UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution calling for universalization and full implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty. UNGA Resolution 66/29, for example, was adopted on 2 December 2011 by a vote of 162 in favor, none opposed, and 18 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/disarmament.nsf/%28httpPages%29/A8553DFE8D8066E0C125726B005421FC?OpenDocument&amp;unid=CA826818C8330D2BC1257180004B1B2E |title=Where global solutions are shaped for you &amp;#124; Disarmament &amp;#124; UNGA resolution on APLC |publisher=Unog.ch |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the first UNGA resolution supporting the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997, the number of states voting in favor has ranged from a low of 139 in 1999 to a high of 165 in 2010. The number of states abstaining has ranged from a high of 23 in 2002 and 2003 to a low of 17 in 2005 and 2006.

Of the 19 states not party that voted in support of Resolution 66/29 on 2 December 2011, nine have voted in favor of every Mine Ban Treaty resolution since 1997 (Armenia, Bahrain, Finland, Georgia, Oman, Poland, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates); 10
that consistently abstained or were absent previously now vote in favor (Azerbaijan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lao PDR, Marshall Islands, Micronesia FS, Mongolia, Morocco, and Tonga). Somalia, now a State Party, was absent from the 2011 resolution, but has voted in favor in previous years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Landmine Monitor Report 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of states abstaining from supporting the resolution has ranged from a high of 23 in 2002 and 2003 to a low of 17 in 2010, 2005 and 2006. The group of states that could be described as most concerned about the security implications of the Mine Ban Treaty are the 15 states not party that have voted against consecutive resolutions since 1997: Cuba, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Libya (since 1998), Myanmar, North Korea (since 2007), Pakistan, Russia, South Korea, Syria, Uzbekistan (since 1999), the United States, and Vietnam (since 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Key figures in the making of the Ottawa Treaty/Mine Ban Treaty ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--many paragraphs are lacking citations--&gt;

=== Letter-writers and non-governmental organizations ===
The Ottawa Anti-Personnel Mines Treaty would not likely have been possible without the sustained effort of thousands of global citizens writing their elected officials in the lead up to the treaty's creation and signing in 1997. A small number of core groups mobilized on the landmines problem worked closely with a wider variety of NGOs, including Churches, prominent Children's and Women's rights groups, disarmament and development groups, in order to produce concerted political pressure, as well as with the media to keep the issue in the forefront. Because of this unparalleled involvement of the global public, and their success in lobbying for this initiative, University Political Science and Law Departments frequently study the socio-historical initiatives that led to the Ottawa Process, arguing it is a leading modern example of the power of peaceful democratic expression and a method for mobilization on disarmament issues or more broadly.

===Jody Williams and The International Campaign to Ban Landmines===
The organization the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] and its founding coordinator, [[Jody Williams]], were instrumental in the passage of the Ottawa Treaty, and for these efforts they jointly received the 1997 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. However, since efforts to secure the treaty started over a decade before Ms. Williams involvement and the fact that the treaty was a joint effort of so many people from all over the world, including hundreds of influential political and private leaders, some felt that Ms. Williams should decline to personally benefit from the award of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.

===Werner Ehrlich===
Available sources such as the excellent study on the Ottawa Treaty made by Stuart Maslen &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maslen: The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction. In: Oxford Commentaries on International Law, Commentaries on Arms Control Treaties, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2004; {{ISBN|0-19-926977-7}};&lt;/ref&gt; and an article published by Werner Ehrlich in 1996  &lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich, Auf dem Weg zu einer Konvention über das Verbot von Anti-Personen-Minen; Österreichisches Jahrbuch für internationale Politik; Österreichische Gesellschaft für Außenpolitik und internationale Beziehungen gemeinsam mit dem Österreichischen Institut für internationale Politik; Verlag Böhlau, 1996;&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that the key figure in the making of the Ottawa Treaty was the Austrian diplomat Dr. Werner Ehrlich, head of the Disarmament Unit at the Austrian Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1995/96:

He initiated the process by making the first draft of the future Treaty in April 1996 and succeeded to get this project and the proposed unorthodox procedure – to negotiate this Convention outside the Conference on Disarmament (CD) – adopted by the Ottawa Conference in October 1996 – in spite of nearly universal opposition.
  
It was an uphill struggle. This proposal was understandably rejected by countries which see anti-personnel mines as essential for national defense. Consequently, they tried repeatedly to block the project or to steer it to a dead end in the CD.

The proposal was however also opposed by Countries and NGO’s supporting a total ban, because of their conviction that practical measures would be more conducive to a total ban than a Convention, A view which was reflected in the “purpose” of the 1996 Ottawa Conference: “to catalyze practical efforts to move toward a ban and to create partnerships essential to building the necessary political will to achieve a global ban on AP mines. 
But this meant in fact, that a total ban was postponed to a remote future:	until practical efforts may have convinced one day Countries depending	on APM’s for their defense, that APM’s are useless or counterproductive.

The approach of Werner Ehrlich was different:

It was essential to delegitimize as soon as possible any use of APM’s by the adoption of an instrument of international law on a total ban of APM’s, because it would not only bind the Parties to the Convention but would also have at least a moral effect on Countries not Parties by clearly contradicting the idea that the use of APM’s is legal.

It was also essential to elaborate this Treaty in a free standing negotiating process outside the Conference on Disarmament (CD), as there mine-affected Countries not Members of the CD would be excluded and opponents of a total ban could block the project immediately, e. g. simply by denying consensus to put it on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich, (1997) Point 4b, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Ottawa Conference in October 1996 Dr. Ehrlich defended the project of a Total Ban Convention, against opponents of a total ban as well as even against leading humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which at the beginning saw the project as premature, as detraction or even as a waste of time.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Ehrlich (1976) Point 4c, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded finally against all odds – due in particular to the inspired and timely support of the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Lloyd Axworthy]] - to get his project indorsed by the Conference:  Austria was tasked to draft the text for the negotiations which were to be held - as proposed - in a free standing negotiating process, a procedure later called the “Ottawa Process”.

His third and final draft before leaving disarmament at the end of 1996 to become Austria’s Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran &lt;ref name="Stuart Maslen 2004 p. 28"&gt;Stuart Maslen, (2004) op. cit. point 0.53, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; was known as the ”First Austrian Draft” &lt;ref name="Stuart Maslen 2004 p. 28"/&gt; and served as the basis for the following negotiations leading to the adoption of the Mine Ban Treaty in December 1997

=== Canada's Mine Action ===
Mines Action Canada grew out of the efforts of Canadian non-governmental agencies concerned about the rapidly spreading impact of landmines and cluster munitions.  The group was successful in garnering positive Canadian government attention to the call for a ban by mobilizing Canadians to demand action.  By 1996, sustained and growing citizen action led Minister Axworthy of the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to collaborate with Mines Action Canada and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.  This in turn led to the Government of Canada challenging other countries to negotiate and sign a treaty banning ban landmines within one year.  This call to action led directly to the signing of the "Convention on the Prohibition on the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction"  commonly known as the 'mine ban treaty' one year later in December 1997.  Mines Action Canada was hosted by Physicians for Global Survival, chaired by Valerie Warmington and coordinated by Celina Tuttle from the coalition's inception until after the treaty was signed.

=== Diana, Princess of Wales ===
Once in the final stages leading into the treaty, the Ottawa Treaty was ardently championed by [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. In January 1997, she visited [[Angola]] and walked near a [[minefield]] to dramatize its dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/08/world/americas/08mine.html | work=The New York Times | first=Mark | last=Landler | title=White House Is Being Pressed to Reverse Course and Join Land Mine Ban | date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1997, Angola's population was approximately 10 million and had about 10–20 million land mines in place from its civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/LANDMINE.HTM|title=Angola's Landmines|website=Gurukul.ucc.american.edu|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1997, she visited [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] with the [[Landmine Survivors Network]]. Her work with landmines focused on the injuries and deaths inflicted on children. When the Second Reading of the Landmines Bill took place in 1998 in the British [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Robin Cook]] praised Diana and paid tribute to her work on landmines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dianacelebration.com/charity.htm |title=Charity – Diana, Princess of Wales |publisher=Dianacelebration.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208095350/http://www.dianacelebration.com/charity.htm |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lloyd Axworthy ===
In his Canadian Foreign Affairs portfolio (1996–2000), [[Lloyd Axworthy]] became internationally known (and criticized in some quarters) for his advancement of the concept of human security and including the Ottawa Treaty, and the creation of the International Criminal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lloyd Axworthy|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lloyd-axworthy/|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=5 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505025724/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lloyd-axworthy/|archivedate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bobby Muller===
[[Bobby Muller|Robert O. (Bobby) Muller]] (born 1946) is an American peace advocate. He participated in the Vietnam War as a young soldier, and after returning from Vietnam, Muller began to work for veterans' rights and became a peace activist. Since then, Muller founded Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) in 1978 and Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF) in 1980. The VVAF co-founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which won a 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;ref name="The Humanitarian: Bobby Muller"&gt;{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Cecilia Capuzzi|title=The Humanitarian: Bobby Muller|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200603/the-humanitarian-bobby-muller|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=Psychology Today|date=1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and introduction to tort law:

'''[[Tort law]]''' &amp;ndash; defines what a legal injury is and, therefore, whether a person may be held liable for an injury they have caused. Legal injuries are not limited to physical injuries. They may also include emotional, economic, or reputational injuries as well as violations of privacy, property, or constitutional rights.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Types of torts==
===Intentional torts===
[[Intentional tort]] &amp;ndash; category of torts that describes a civil wrong resulting from an intentional act on the part of the tortfeasor (alleged wrongdoer).
* [[Assault (tort)]] &amp;ndash;  intentionally and voluntarily causing the reasonable apprehension of an immediate harmful or offensive contact.
* [[Battery (tort)]] &amp;ndash;  Bringing about an unconsentful harmful or offensive contact with a person or to something closely associated with that person (such as an item of clothing).  It differs from assault in that it requires actual contact.
* [[False imprisonment]] &amp;ndash;  A person is intentionally confined without legal authority.
* [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress]] &amp;ndash;  Intentional conduct that results in extreme emotional distress.
* [[Consent]] &amp;ndash;  A possible excuse against civil or criminal liability under the defense that they should not be held liable as the actions were not taken without their permission.
* [[Necessity (tort)]] &amp;ndash;  The defense of necessity gives the state or individual property of another; typically invoked only against the intentional torts of [[Trespass to chattels]], [[trespass to land]], or [[conversion (law)]].  It is expressed in Latin as ''necessitas inducit privilegium quod jura privata'', "Necessity induces a privilege because of a private right."
* [[Self-defense]] &amp;ndash;  Civilians acting on their own behalf to engage in violence for the sake of self-defense of one's own life or the lives of others, including the use of [[deadly force]].  Differs from necessity in that it is usually the response to an immediate danger.

===Property torts===
* [[Trespass to land]] &amp;ndash;  Committed when an individual intentionally enters the land of another without lawful excuse.  It is actionable ''per se'', and thus the party whose land was entered may sue even if no actual harm is done.
* [[Conversion (law)]] &amp;ndash;  An intentional tort to personal property where the defendant's willful interference with the chattel deprives plaintiff of the possession of the same.
* [[Detinue]] &amp;ndash;  An action for the wrongful detention of goods, initiated by an individual who claims to have a greater right to their immediate possession than the current possessor or holder.
* [[Replevin]] &amp;ndash;  Signifies the recovery by a person of goods unlawfully taken out of his or her possession by a legal process.
* [[Trover]] &amp;ndash;  A form of lawsuit for recovery of damages for wrongful taking of personal property.
===Dignitary torts===
[[Dignitary torts]] &amp;ndash; a specific category of intentional torts where the cause of action is being subjected to certain kinds of indignities.
* [[Defamation]] &amp;ndash;  The communication of a statement that makes a false claim, expressively stated or implied to be factual, that may harm the reputation of an entity.
* [[Invasion of privacy]] &amp;ndash;  The unlawful intrusion into the personal life of another person without just cause.
* [[Breach of confidence]] &amp;ndash;  Protects private information conveyed in confidence; typically requires that the information be of a confidential nature, communicated in confidence, and was disclosed to the detriment of the claimant.
* [[Abuse of process]] &amp;ndash;  A malicious and deliberate misuse or pervision of regularly issued court process not justified by the underlying legal action.
* [[Malicious prosecution]] &amp;ndash;  Similar to [[abuse of process]], but includes intent, pursuing without probable cause, and dismissal in favor of the victim.  In some jurisdictions, ''malicious prosecution'' is reserved for the wrongful initiation of criminal proceedings, while ''malicious use of process'' refers to the wrongful initiation of civil proceedings.
* [[Alienation of affections]] &amp;ndash;  Brought by a deserted spouse against a third party whom the spouse believes to be responsible for the failure of the marriage.

===Economic torts===

[[Economic torts]] &amp;ndash; torts that provide the common law rules on liability which arise out of business transactions such as interference with economic or business relationships and are likely to involve pure economic loss. Also called business torts.
* [[Fraud]] &amp;ndash;  Making of a false representation by one party with an intention to induce another party into an act of commission or omission owing to which the later party suffers a damage. The first Party may or may not be the benefited by the damage caused to second party. Also, the first party need not be in collusion with someone who actually benefited.
* [[Tortious interference]] &amp;ndash;  One person intentionally damages the plaintiff's contractual or other business relationships.
* [[Conspiracy (civil)]] &amp;ndash;  An agreement between two or more parties to deprive a third party of legal rights or deceive a third party to obtain an illegal objective.
* [[Restraint of trade]] &amp;ndash;  Contractual obligations not to trade are illegal agreements on public policy grounds unless they are reasonable in the interests concerning both parties and the public at large; this mainly affects post-termination restrictive covenants in employment contracts.

===Nuisance===
* [[Nuisance]] &amp;ndash;  Denial of quiet enjoyment to owners of [[real property]]. A private nuisance is an unreasonable, unwarranted, or unlawful interference with another person's private use and enjoyment of his or her property; whereas a public nuisance is an interference with the rights of the public generally. The test to determine whether an interference is reasonable is whether the gravity of the harm is outweighed by the social benefit of the nuisance.

===Negligence===
[[Negligence]] &amp;ndash; failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances
* [[Duty of care]] &amp;ndash;  Obligation imposed on an individual requiring that they adhere to a reasonable [[standard of care]] while performing acts that could possibly harm others.
* [[Negligence#Breach_of_duty|Breach of duty]] &amp;ndash;  There can be no liability in negligence unless the claimant established that he or she was owed a [[duty of care]] by the defendant and that there has been a breach of that duty.
* [[Causation (law)|Factual causation]] &amp;ndash;  Whether or not a given injury would have occurred without a breach of duty.
* [[Negligence#Legal_causation_or_remoteness|Legal causation or remoteness]] &amp;ndash;  The idea that liability may be so remote from the defendant that the negligence was not foreseeable or preventable by that party.
* [[Damages]] &amp;ndash;  Places a monetary value on the harm done, following the principle of ''[[restitutio in integrum]]'', "restoration to the original condition".
* [[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress]] - The idea that one has a [[Duty of care|legal duty]] to use reasonable care to avoid causing [[Emotion|emotional]] [[Stress (medicine)|distress]] to another individual.

===Duty to visitors===
* [[Attractive nuisance]] &amp;ndash;  A landowner may be liable for injuries to children trespassing on the land if the injury is caused by a hazardous object or condition on the land is likely to attract children.
The duty to visitors in tort law is dependent on how the party involved not owning the land has entered the land.
* [[Trespasser]] &amp;ndash;  A person who is trespassing on a property without the permission on the owner.  Conversely, the status of a visitor as a trespasser grants certain rights to the visitor if they are injured due to the negligence of the property owner.
* [[Licensee]] &amp;ndash;  A person who is on the property of another, despite the fact that the property is not open to the general public; historically, [[emergency workers]] have been considered licensees.
* [[Invitee]] &amp;ndash;  A person who is invited to the land by the possessor of the land, either as a guest or to conduct business.

===Strict liability torts===
{{see|Strict liability}}
* [[Product liability]] &amp;ndash;  The area of law in which products manufacturers, distributors and sellers are held responsible for the injuries caused by their products.  Generally, a product liability claim is based on either a design defect, a manufacturing defect, or a failure to warn.  This topic is closely associated with [[negligence]], [[breach of warranty]] and [[consumer protection]].
* [[Ultrahazardous activity]] &amp;ndash;  An activity so dangerous that a person engaged in such an activity can be held strictly liable for injuries caused to another person, regardless of whether or not reasonable precautions were taken to prevent others from being injured.

==Liability, defenses, remedies==
* [[Comparative negligence]] &amp;ndash;  A partial defense that reduces the amount of damages a plaintiff can claim based upon the degree to which the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to the damages. Most jurisdictions have adopted this doctrine; those not adopting it are Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, And Washington D.C.
* [[Contributory negligence]] &amp;ndash;  A defense based on negligence of the plaintiff wherein the plaintiff's actions caused the event which drew the suit.  An example of this is a pedestrian crossing a road carelessly and was hit by a driver driving carelessly.
* [[Last clear chance]] &amp;ndash;  Doctrine under which a plaintiff can recover against comparative and contributory negligence defenses if they can demonstrate that the defendant had the last opportunity to avoid the accident.
* [[Eggshell skull]] &amp;ndash;  Doctrine under which an individual is held liable for all consequences resulting from his actions even if the victim suffers an unusually high levels of damage (i.e., a pre-existing vulnerability or medical condition).  The term comes an example argument that if a person had a skull as delicate as the shell of an egg, and an assailant was unaware of that condition hit that person on the head and it subsequently broke, the responsible party should be liable for all damages resulting from the content.
* [[Vicarious liability]] &amp;ndash;  A form of strict secondary liability arising from [[respondeat superior]].  The responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinates, under which, they are responsible for negligent acts committed by their employees during the course of their employment.&lt;ref&gt;Construction Accident Law: A Comprehensive Guide to Legal Liability.  Marc M. Schneier.  American Bar Association, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Volenti non fit injuria]] &amp;ndash;  Latin for "To a willing person, no injury is done", this common law doctrine means that if someone willingly puts themselves in a position where harm might result, they can not sue if harm occurs.  That is, a boxer consents to being hit, and the injuries related to boxing are thus not actionable (although if his opponent were to hit him with an iron bar, that would be actionable as he did not know such things would occur).&lt;ref&gt;A Selection of Legal Maxims, Classified and Illustrated.  Herbert Broom, Herbert Francis Manisty, Charles Francis Cagney.  W. Maxwell, 1884, p 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ex turpi causa non oritur actio]] &amp;ndash;  "From a dishonorable cause an action does not arise".  In The United States, this legal doctrine is more commonly known as equitability of [[unclean hands]], and it prevents a criminal from bringing a claim against another criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Sourcebook on tort law.  Graham Stephenson.  Routledge Cavendish, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public–private partnership''' ('''PPP''', '''3P''' or '''P3''') is a cooperative arrangement between two or more public and private sectors, typically of a long-term nature.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G 2007 pp.54ku558"&gt;Hodge, G.

(2019), The Public–Private Interface: Surveying the History, in G. Hodge and C. Greve (eds.), The Challenge of Public–Privapppte Partnerships: Learning from International Experience, Cheltenham UK: Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wettenhall, R. (2000), Mixes and partnerships through time, in G.A. Hodge, C. Greve and A. Boardman (eds.),''International Handbook in Public–Private Partnerships'', Cheltenham UK: Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; However, the late 20th century and early 21st century{{When|date=May 2018}} have seen a clear trend towards governments across the globe making greater use of various PPP arrangements.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G 2007 pp.54ku558" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is no consensus about how to define a PPP.&lt;ref name="Marta Marsilio 2011 pp.763-782"&gt;Marta Marsilio, M., Cappellaro, G and Cuccurullo, C. (2011), The Intellectual Structure Of Research Into PPPs, ''Public Management Review'', Vol 13 (6), pp.763–782&lt;/ref&gt; PPPs can be understood of both as a governance mechanism and a language game.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G 2007 pp.54ku558" /&gt;   When understood as a language game, or brand, the PPP phrase can cover hundreds of different types of long term contracts with a wide range of risk allocations, funding arrangements and transparency requirements. And as a brand, the PPP concept is also closely related to concepts such as privatization and the contracting out of government services.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G 2007 pp.54ku558" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marta Marsilio 2011 pp.763-782"/&gt; When understood as a governance mechanism the PPP concept encompasses at least five families of potential arrangements, one of which is the long term infrastructure contract in the model of the UK's Private Finance Initiative (PFI).&lt;ref name="Hodge, G 2007 pp.54ku558" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marta Marsilio 2011 pp.763-782"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weihe, G. (2006) 'Public–Private Partnerships: Addressing a Nebulous Concept'. 10th International Research Symposium on Public Management. Glasgow, Scotland, 10–16 April&lt;/ref&gt; Particular types of arrangements have been favored in different countries at different times.

Infrastructure PPPs as a phenomenon can be understood at five different levels: as a particular project or activity, as a form of [[Project delivery method|project delivery]], as a statement of government policy, as a tool of government, or as a wider cultural phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G.A 2016 pp.1-24"&gt;Hodge, G.A. and Greve, C. (2016), On Public–Private Partnership Performance: A Contemporary Review, Public Works Management &amp; Policy, pp. 1–24&lt;/ref&gt; Different disciplines commonly emphasize different aspects of the PPP phenomena.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G.A 2016 pp.1-24"/&gt; The engineering and economics professions primarily take a utilitarian, functional focus emphasising concerns such as project delivery and relative value-for-money (VfM) compared to the traditional ways of delivering large infrastructure projects.  In contrast, public administrators and political scientists tend to view PPPs more as a policy brand, and as a useful tool for governments to achieve their objectives.

Common themes of PPPs are the sharing of risk and the development of innovative, long-term relationships between the public and private sectors.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G.A 2016 pp.1-24"/&gt;  The use of private finance is another key dimension of many PPPs, particularly those influenced by the UK PFI model, although this aspect has waned since the global financial crisis of 2008.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G.A 2016 pp.1-24"/&gt;
The PPP phenomenon has been controversial. The lack of a shared understanding of what a PPP is makes the process of evaluating whether PPPs have been successful complex.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G.A 2016 pp.1-24"/&gt;  Evidence of PPP performance in terms of VfM and efficiency, for example, is mixed and often unavailable.&lt;ref name="Hodge, G.A 2016 pp.1-24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodge, G.A 2016 pp.1-24"/&gt;

According to Weimer and Vining, "A P3 typically involves a private entity financing, constructing, or managing a project in return for a promised stream of payments directly from government or indirectly from users over the projected life of the project or some other specified period of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Policy Analysis Edition No.05|last=|first=|publisher=Pearson, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-0-205-78130-0|location=|pages=309|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because P3s are directly responsible for a variety of activities, as indicated by Weimer and Vining, P3s can evolve into monopolies motivated by rent-seeking behavior(s).

== Long term infrastructure contracts ==

PPPs often involve a contract between a [[public sector]] authority and a private party, in which the private party provides a public service or project and assumes substantial financial, technical and operational risk in the project. In some types of PPP, the cost of using the service is borne exclusively by the users of the service and not by the taxpayer.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barlow | first1 = J. | last2 = Roehrich | first2 = J.K. | last3 = Wright | first3 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Europe Sees Mixed Results From Public–Private Partnerships For Building And Managing Health Care Facilities And Services | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 146–154 | pmid = 23297282 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.1223}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;In other types (notably the PFI), capital investment is made by the private sector on the basis of a contract with government to provide agreed services and the cost of providing the service is borne wholly or in part by the government. Government contributions to a PPP may also be in kind (notably the transfer of existing assets). In projects that are aimed at creating [[public good]]s like in the [[infrastructure]] sector, the government may provide a capital subsidy in the form of a one-time [[Grant (money)|grant]], so as to make the project economically viable. In some other cases, the government may support the project by providing revenue subsidies, including [[tax break]]s or by [[Annuity (finance theory)|guaranteed annual revenues]] for a fixed time period. In all cases, the partnerships include a transfer of significant risks to the private sector, generally in an integrated and holistic way, minimizing interfaces for the public entity. An optimal risk allocation is the main value generator for this model of delivering public service.

There are many drivers for PPPs&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco-mars.com/pdf_document/Peccia_et_al._Public_private_partnership_VIII_1_2017_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. One common driver involves the claim that PPPs enable the public sector to harness the expertise and efficiencies that the private sector can bring to the delivery of certain facilities and services traditionally procured and delivered by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Caldwell, N.; Roehrich, J.K. and George, G. (2017). Social value creation and relational coordination in public-private collaborations. ''Journal of Management Studies,'' Vol. 54 No. 6, pp. 906-928.[https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joms.12268]&lt;/ref&gt; Another common driver is that PPPs may be structured so that the public sector body seeking to make a capital investment does not incur any borrowing. Rather, the PPP borrowing is incurred by the private sector vehicle implementing the project. On PPP projects where the cost of using the service is intended to be borne exclusively by the end user, the PPP is, from the public sector's perspective, an "off-balance sheet" method of financing the delivery of new or refurbished public sector assets. On PPP projects where the public sector intends to compensate the private sector through availability payments once the facility is established or renewed, the financing is, from the public sector's perspective, "on-balance sheet"; however, the public sector will regularly benefit from significantly deferred cash flows. Generally, financing costs will be higher for a PPP than for a traditional public financing, because of the private sector higher cost of capital. However, extra financing costs can be offset by private sector efficiency, savings resulting from a holistic approach to delivering the project or service, and from the better risk allocation in the long run.

Typically, a private sector consortium forms a special company called a "[[special purpose vehicle]]" (SPV) to develop, build, maintain and operate the asset for the contracted period.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zheng | first1 = J. | last2 = Roehrich | first2 = J.K. | last3 = Lewis | first3 = M.A. | year = 2008 | title = The dynamics of contractual and relational governance: Evidence from long-term public–private procurement arrangements | url = https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-41049112855&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=yXIvJQ7AsPq0YyDQfJmJLCa%3a2 | journal = Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 43–54 | doi=10.1016/j.pursup.2008.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where the government has invested in the project, it is typically (but not always) allotted an [[Ownership equity|equity]] share in the SPV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1087179 Moszoro M., Gasiorowski P. (2008), 'Optimal Capital Structure of Public–Private Partnerships', IMF Working Paper 1/2008]. Papers.ssrn.com (2008-01-25). Retrieved on 2011-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The consortium is usually made up of a building contractor, a maintenance company and equity investor(s). It is the SPV that signs the contract with the government and with subcontractors to build the facility and then maintain it. In the [[infrastructure]] sector, complex arrangements and contracts that guarantee and secure the [[cash flow]]s make PPP projects prime candidates for [[Project Finance|project financing]]. A typical PPP example would be a hospital building financed and constructed by a private developer and then leased to the hospital authority. The private developer then acts as landlord, providing housekeeping and other non-medical services while the hospital itself provides medical services.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

==Origins==
Pressure to change the standard model of public procurement arose initially from concerns about the level [[public debt]], which grew rapidly during the [[macroeconomic]] dislocation of the 1970s and 1980s. Governments sought to encourage private [[investment]] in [[infrastructure]], initially on the basis of [[accounting]] fallacies arising 
from the fact that public accounts did not distinguish between recurrent and capital expenditures.

The idea that private provision of infrastructure represented a way of providing infrastructure at no cost to the public has now been generally abandoned; however, interest in alternatives to the standard model of public procurement persisted. In particular, it has been argued that models involving an enhanced role for the private sector, with a single private-sector organization taking responsibility for most aspects of service provisions for a given project, could yield an improved allocation of [[risk]], while maintaining public [[accountability]] for essential aspects of service provision.

Initially, most public–private partnerships were negotiated individually, as one-off deals, and much of this activity began in the early 1990s in the UK.

PPPs are organized along a continuum between public and private nodes and needs as they integrate normative, albeit separate and distinct, functions of society—the market and the commons.  A common challenge for PPPs is allowing for these fluctuations and reinforcing the intended partnership without diminishing either sector.  Multisectoral, or collaborative, partnering is experienced on a continuum of private to public in varying degrees of implementation according to the need, time restraints, and the issue at hand.  Even though these partnerships are now common, it is normal for both private and public sectors to be critical of the other's approach and methods.  It is at the merger of these sectors that we see how a unified partnership has immediate impact in the development of communities and the provision of public services.

==In specific countries==

===Australia===
A number of [[Australian state]] governments have adopted systematic programmes based on the PFI. The first, and the model for most others, is Partnerships Victoria.

===Canada===
The federal conservative government under Stephen Harper in Canada solidified its commitment to P3s with the creation of a crown corporation, P3 Canada Inc., in 2009. The Canadian vanguards for P3s have been provincial organizations, supported by the Canadian Council for Public–Private Partnerships established in 1993 (a member-sponsored organization with representatives from both the public and the private sectors). As a proponent of the concept of P3s, the Council conducts research, publishes findings, facilitates forums for discussion and sponsors an Annual Conference on relevant topics, both domestic and international. Each year the Council celebrates successful public–private partnerships through the National Awards Program held concurrently with the annual conference in November.

At lower levels of government P3s have been used to build major infrastructure projects like transit systems, such as [[Viva Rapid Transit]] and [[Ontario Highway 407]], and to build public buildings such as schools.

===China===
There are more than 14,000 existing P3 projects in China, totaling $2.7 trillion in aggregate value, according to the finance ministry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-ppp/china-overhauls-2-69-trillion-public-private-projects-as-debt-fears-rise-idUSKBN1DH0DE|title=China overhauls $2.69 trillion public-private projects as debt...|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpppc.org/en/about/index.jhtml|title=CPPPC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612182157/http://www.cpppc.org/en/about/index.jhtml|archive-date=2017-06-12|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The municipal government of [[Shantou]], China signed a 50-billion RMB PPP agreement with the [[CITIC]] group to develop a massive residential project spanning an area of 168 square kilometers, locating on the southern district of the city's central business district.&lt;ref name="shantoucitic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=线|first1=丽阳|title=中信地产：PPP模式啖头汤|url=http://estate.caijing.com.cn/20141103/3739093.shtml|website=CITC Real Estate|accessdate=4 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104063140/http://estate.caijing.com.cn/20141103/3739093.shtml|archive-date=2014-11-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project includes real estate development, infrastructure construction including a cross-harbor tunnel, and industry developments. The project, named Shantou Coastal New Town, aims itself to be a high-end cultural, leisure, business hub of the East Guangdong area.

===Egypt===
[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] utilized "[[concession (contract)|concessions]]" in the early 1800s to obtain public works for minimal cost while the concessionaires' companies made most of the profits from projects such as railroads and dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=34|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{main article|Public–private partnerships in India}}
The [[Government of India]] defines a P3 as "a partnership between a public sector entity (sponsoring authority) and a private sector entity (a legal entity in which 51% or more of equity is with the private partner/s) for the creation and/or management of infrastructure for public purpose for a specified period of time (concession period) on commercial terms and in which the private partner has been procured through a transparent and open procurement system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=PPP|url=http://jurisonline.in/2010/11/public-private-partnership-in-india/|publisher=Department of Economic Affairs, [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]], Government of India|year=2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616055409/http://jurisonline.in/2010/11/public-private-partnership-in-india/|archivedate=2012-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The union government has estimated an investment of $320 billion in infrastructure in the 10th plan.&lt;ref name="SSRaju_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author = S.S. Raju |title= A successful Indian model | journal=[[The Hindu]] Survey of Indian Industry 2011 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The major infrastructure development projects in the Indian state of Maharashtra (more than 50%) are based on the P3 model. In the 2000s, other states such as Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu also adopted this model.  Sector-wise, road projects account for about 53.4% of the total projects in numbers, and 46% in terms of value. Ports come in second place and account for 8% of the total projects (21% of the total value).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pppindiadatabase.com/Uploads/Status%20of%20PPP%20Projects%20as%20on%20July%2031,%202011.pdf|title=Status of PPP Projects as on July 31, 2011|accessdate=8 March 2014|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002064419/http://www.pppindiadatabase.com/Uploads/Status%20of%20PPP%20Projects%20as%20on%20July%2031,%202011.pdf|archive-date=2 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sectors including power, irrigation, telecommunication, water supply and airports, have gained momentum through the P3 model. {{As of|2011}}, these sectors are expected to get an investment of Rs. 2,027,169 crore (according to 2006–2007 [[Wholesale price index|WPI]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=PPP|url=http://www.pppinindia.com/overview.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421015129/http://www.pppinindia.com/overview.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In Japan since the 1980s, the {{Nihongo|third sector|第三セクター|daisan sekutā}} refers to joint [[corporation]]s invested in by both public and private sectors.

In [[rail transport in Japan|rail transport]] terms, a [[:Category:Japanese third-sector railway lines|''third-sector'' railway line]] is a short line or network of lines operated by a small operating company jointly owned by a prefectural/municipal government and smaller private interests. Third-sector lines are generally former [[Japan Railways Group|JR Group]] – or, before 1987, [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) – lines that have been divested from those larger companies.

===Philippines===
The Philippine Government ([[Filipino Language|Filipino]] ''Pag tutulungan ng Pampubliko - at Pribadong Sektor '') maintains an online list of PPP projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ppp.gov.ph/?page_id=5663 |title=List of PPP Projects |publisher=Philippine government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622060222/http://ppp.gov.ph/?page_id=5663 |archivedate=2014-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia articles on specific PPP projects in the Philippines are categorized into [[:Category:Proposed infrastructure in the Philippines]].

The Philippine BOT Law has been passed on May 5, 1994 and had been subsequently amended in 2012&lt;ref name=PPP&gt;[http://ppp.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BOT-IRR-2012_FINAL.pdf PPPCenter – R.A. 7718 The Philippine Amended BOT Law and its Revised Implementing Rules &amp; Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Nowadays there are special laws about PPP in 69 subjects of Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rbcdaily.ru/economy/562949986141162 | script-title=ru:Правительство одобрило закон о государственно-частном партнерстве | accessdate=27 March 2013 | last=Геворкян | first=Арфи |author2=Литвинова, Анастасия | language=Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the biggest part of them are just declarations.

In February 2013 experts rated subjects of Russian Federation according to their preparedness for implementing projects via public–private partnership. The most developed region was [[Saint Petersburg]] (with rating 7.8), the least [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]] (rating 0.0).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

By 2013 there were almost 300 public–private partnership projects in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gradient-alpha.ru/assets/docs/PPP-Research-14.03.2014.pdf | author=Гагарин П.А. | author2=Двинянин Е.А. | script-title=ru:Государственно-частное партнерство как инструмент реализации масштабных проектов | accessdate=27 March 2013 | language=Russian | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FclsScjo?url=http://www.gradient-alpha.ru/assets/docs/PPP-Research-14.03.2014.pdf | archivedate=4 April 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In 1992, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[John Major]] in the UK introduced the [[Private finance initiative|PFI]],&lt;ref name="RP01-117"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Grahame|title=The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) Commons Briefing papers RP01-117|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP01-117/RP01-117.pdf|website=UK Parliament: House of Commons Library|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=20 January 2018|ref=RP01-117}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first systematic programme aimed at encouraging public–private partnerships. The 1992 programme focused on reducing the [[public sector borrowing requirement]], although, as already noted, the effect on public accounts was largely illusory. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]], elected in 1997, expanded the PFI initiative but sought to shift the emphasis to the achievement of "value for money," mainly through an appropriate allocation of risk. However, it has since been found that many programs ran dramatically over budget and have not presented as value for money for the taxpayer, with some projects costing more to cancel than to complete.

===United States===
The [[West Coast Infrastructure Exchange (WCX)]], a State/Provincial Government-level partnership between [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[British Columbia]] that was launched in 2012, conducts business case evaluations for selected infrastructure projects and connects private investment with public infrastructure opportunities. The platform aims to replace traditional approaches to infrastructure financing and development with "performance-based infrastructure" marked by projects that are funded where possible by [[internal rate of return|internal rates of return]], as opposed to tax dollars, and evaluated according to [[life-cycle assessment|life-cycle]] social, ecological and economic impacts, as opposed to [[productive capacity|capacity]] addition and [[capital cost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://westcoastx.com/assets/documents/WCX_CH2MHill-summary.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213023137/http://westcoastx.com/assets/documents/WCX_CH2MHill-summary.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 December 2014|title=West Coast Infrastructure Exchange CH2M HILL Report Summary|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[My Brother's Keeper Challenge]] is another example of a public–private partnership.

In 2017, the State of [[Texas]] sought its first ever private partner to join in a project to renovate the G. J. Sutton Building in [[Downtown San Antonio]] near the [[Alamodome]], according to Mike Novak, the chairman of the [[Texas Facilities Commission]]. Local governments in Texas have already entered into such partnerships including the redevelopment of the [[HemisFair Arena]] and the construction by Weston Urban of a new [[Frost Bank Tower (San Antonio)|Frost Bank Tower]] in San Antonio. Named for [[G. J. Sutton]], the first [[African-American]] elected official in San Antonio, the six-acre complex was vacated by the state in 2014 because of [[bat]] infestation and a deteriorating foundation. In 2015, [[governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Greg Abbott]], counter to the wishes of [[List of mayors of San Antonio|Mayor]] [[Ivy Taylor]], used his [[line-item veto]] to remove $132 million which would have funded the rehabilitation of The Sutton. The state expects to see the property used at some point in the future for office space and parking slots.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Webner, 
"State seeking builder for Sutton rehab", ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', April 15, 2017, p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Billy Nungesser]], the [[lieutenant governor of Louisiana]], proposed in 2017 that public–private partnerships be established for many of his state's financially-strapped state parks, which fall under his jurisdiction, particularly citing two popular facilities in [[Sabine Parish, Louisiana|Sabine Parish]]: [[North Toledo Bend State Park]] and  [[Hodges Gardens State Park]], at which operating costs vastly outstrip revenues from the $1 park admission fees. Because of recurring state financial issues, the fate of state parks in Louisiana remain in doubt after July 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/travel/2017/04/14/state-parks-closing/100142076 |title=Are State Parks closing?|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|The Alexandria Town Talk]]''|date=April 16, 2017|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Massachusetts, arrangements to allow the state Department of Conservation and Recreation to pave over gravel utility roads under high-voltage transmission lines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-partners-with-eversource-energy-to-construct-new-section-of-mass|title=Baker-Polito Administration Partners with Eversource Energy to Construct New Section of Mass Central Rail Trail|website=Mass.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; operated by utilities have been branded by the Baker Administration and Eversource Energy as "public-private partnerships" to create alternative transportation corridors.  This particular arrangement involves no financial risk to the for-profit utility.  Where the utility has existing easements, they share the right-of-way.  Where the utility does not have an existing easement but wishes to gain state approval for constructing new transmission lines on state property, the utility reproduces designs of rail trails in its petition to the state Energy Facilities Siting Board (EFSB).  Approval would enable the utility to have construction of transmission lines and gravel utility paths fully funded through electric ratepayer bills.  "Piggybacking" onto an electric 'reliability' project leverages the rights of the for-profit 'public utility' to overcome environmental and zoning bylaws which a rail trail might otherwise be subject to.  The legality of steering greenfield transmission projects into environmentally sensitive conservation and wetlands, and using electric ratepayer funds for non-reliability purposes is being tested.  In a related case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that electricity customers can no longer be asked to help cover the costs of building gas pipelines.

Much of the early infrastructure of the United States was built by what can be considered public-private partnerships. This includes an early steamboat line between [[Gibbons v. Ogden#Background|New York and New Jersey]] in 1808, many of the railroads including the nation's [[United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company#History|first railroad]] chartered in New Jersey in 1815, and most of the modern [[Energy policy of the United States|electric grid]].

==Growth and decline==

From 1990 to 2009 nearly 1,400 PPP deals were signed in the European Union, representing a capital value of approximately €260 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bei.europa.eu/attachments/efs/efr_2010_v04_en.pdf Public Private Partnerships in Europe.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808124736/http://www.bei.europa.eu/attachments/efs/efr_2010_v04_en.pdf |date=2010-08-08 }}.

Investments in public sector infrastructure are seen as an important means of maintaining economic activity, as was highlighted in a European Commission communication on PPPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eib.org/epec/infocentre/documents/Commission%20Communication%20on%20PPP-en.pdf European Commission Communication on PPP November 2009]{{Dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the significant role that PPPs have adopted in the development of public sector infrastructure, in addition to the complexity of such transactions, the [[European PPP Expertise Centre (EPEC)]] was established to support public-sector capacity to implement PPPs and share timely solutions to problems common across Europe in PPPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eib.org/epec/ European PPP Expertise Centre]. Eib.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

PPPs provide a unique perspective on the collaborative and network aspects of public management. The advancement of PPPs, as a concept and a practice, is a product of the [[new public management]] of the late 20th century and globalization pressures. The term "public–private partnership" is prey to thinking in parts rather than the whole of the partnership, which makes it difficult to pin down a universally accepted definition of PPPs.

U.S. city managers' motivations for exploring public–private service delivery vary. According to a 2007 survey, two primary reasons were expressed: cost reduction (86.7%) and external fiscal pressures, including tax restrictions (50.3%). No other motivations expressed exceeded 16%. In the 2012 survey, however, interest had shifted to the need for better processes (69%), relationship building (77%), better outcomes (81%), leveraging resources (84%), and belief that collaborative service delivery is "the right thing to do" (86%). Among those surveyed, the provision of public services through contracts with private firms peaked in 1977 at 18% and has declined since. The most common form of shared service delivery now involves contracts between governments, growing from 17% in 2002 to 20% in 2007. "At the same time, approximately 22% of the local governments in the survey indicated that they had brought back in-house at least one service that they had previously provided through some alternative private arrangement."&lt;ref name="JR-study"/&gt;

==Controversy==
A common problem with PPP projects is that private investors obtained a [[rate of return]] that was higher than the government's [[Bond (finance)|bond rate]], even though most or all of the income risk associated with the project was borne by the public sector.&lt;ref name="Barlow, J. Roehrich 2010"/&gt;The UK Parliament report &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news-parliament-2017/private-finance-initiatives-report-published-17-19/|title=Treasury must set out clear position on PFI - News from Parliament|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;underlines that some private investors have made large returns from PPP deals, suggesting that departments are overpaying for transferring the risks of projects to the private sector, one of the Treasury’s stated benefits of PPP.

A 2008 report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers argued that the comparison between public and private borrowing rates is not fair, because there are "constraints on public borrowing", which may imply that public borrowing is too high, and so PFI projects can be beneficial by not putting debt directly on government books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Public Sector Research Center|title=The Value of PFI: Hanging in the balance (sheet)?|publisher=[[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]]|accessdate=26 October 2015|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that PPPs debt is not recorded as debt and remains largely "off balance sheet" is a raising concern.  Indeed, keeping the PPP project and its contingent liabilities ‘off balance sheet,’ means that the true cost of the project is hidden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What lies beneath?

According to the IMF, economic ownership of the asset should determine whether to record PPP-related assets and liabilities in the government’s or the private corporation’s balance sheet is not straightforward&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=GOVERNMENT FINANCE STATISTICS MANUAL 2014|last=|first=|publisher=IMF|year=2014|isbn=978-1-49834-376-3|location=Washington|pages=324-327}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A number of Australian studies of early initiatives to promote private investment in infrastructure concluded that, in most cases, the schemes being proposed were inferior to the standard model of [[public procurement]] based on competitively tendered construction of publicly owned assets.&lt;ref&gt;Economic Planning Advisory Commission (EPAC) 1995a,b; House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications Transport and Microeconomic Reform 1997; Harris 1996; Industry Commission 1996; Quiggin 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[New Zealand Treasury]], in response to inquiries by the new [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] government, released a report on PPP schemes that concluded that "there is little reliable empirical evidence about the costs and benefits of PPPs" and that there "are other ways of obtaining private sector finance", as well as that "the advantages of PPPs must be weighed against the contractual complexities and rigidities they entail".&lt;ref name="MISGUIDED"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10575753|title=Brian Rudman:  Promised electric trains derailed by misguided enthusiasm|date=1 June 2009|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One response to these negative findings was the development of formal procedures for the assessment of PPPs in which the focus was on "[[value for money]]" rather than [[debt reduction|reductions in debt]]. The underlying framework was one in which value for money was achieved by an appropriate allocation of risk. These assessment procedures were incorporated in the private finance initiative and its Australian counterparts from the late 1990s onwards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Another model being discussed is the public–private community partnership (PPCP), in which both the government and private players work together for social welfare, eliminating the prime focus of private players on profit.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} This model is being applied more in developing nations such as India.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Clarence N. Stone frames the public private partnership as 'governing coalitions'. In Regime Politics Governing Atlanta 1946–1988, he specifically analyzes the 'crosscurrents in coalition mobilization'. Government coalitions are revealed as susceptible to a number of problems primarily corruption and conflicts of interests. This slippery slope is generally created by a lack of sufficient oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Regime Politics Governing Atlanta, 1946–1988|last=Stone|first=Clarence N.|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=1989|isbn=|location=0-7006-0415-4|pages=148–149|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption and conflicts of interests, in this case, leads to costs of opportunism; other costs related to P3's are production and bargaining costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Policy Analysis Edition No.05|last=|first=|publisher=Pearson, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-0-205-78130-0|location=|pages=311–315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privatisation of water ===
After a wave of [[water privatization|privatisation of many water services]] in the 1990s, mostly in developing countries, experiences show that global [[water corporation]]s have not brought the promised improvements in [[public water supply|public water]] utilities. Instead of lower prices, large volumes of investment and improvements in the connection of the poor to water and sanitation, [[water tariff]]s have increased out of reach of poor households. Water multinationals are withdrawing from developing countries and the [[World Bank]] is reluctant to provide support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tni.org/article/public-water-services the Water Justice Project] on Transnational Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

The privatisation of the water services of the city of Paris was proven to be unwanted and at the end of 2009 the city did not renew its contract with two of the French water corporations, [[Suez (company)|Suez]] and [[Veolia Water|Veolia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cupe.ca/privatization/paris-water-public-hands Reversal of privatisation of Paris' water].

Contract management is a crucial factor in shared service delivery, and services that are more challenging to monitor or fully capture in contractual language often remain in municipal control. In the 2007 survey of U.S. city managers, the most difficult was judged to be the operation and management of hospitals, and the least difficult the cleaning of streets and parking lots. The study revealed that communities often fail to sufficiently monitor collaborative agreements or other forms of service delivery: "For instance, in 2002, only 47.3% of managers involved with private firms as delivery partners reported that they evaluate that service delivery. By 2007, that was down to 45.4%. [[Performance monitoring]] is a general concern from these surveys and in the scholarly criticisms of these arrangements."&lt;ref name="JR-study"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JR-post"/&gt;

==Health services==
A [[health service]]s PPP can be described as a long-term contract (typically 15–30 years) between a public-sector authority and one or more private sector companies operating as a legal entity.  The government provides the strength of its purchasing power, outlines goals for an optimal health system, and empowers private enterprise to innovate, build, maintain and/or manage delivery of agreed-upon services over the term of the contract. The private sector receives payment for its services and assumes substantial financial, technical and operational risk while benefitting from the upside potential of shared cost savings.

The private entity is made up of any combination of participants who have a vested interested in working together to provide core competencies in operations, technology, funding and technical expertise. The opportunity for multi-sector market participants includes hospital providers and physician groups, technology companies, [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] and [[medical device]] companies, [[private health insurance|private health insurers]], [[facilities manager]]s and [[construction firm]]s.  Funding sources could include banks, [[private equity firm]]s, philanthropists and [[pension fund]] managers.

For more than two decades public–private partnerships have been used to finance [[health infrastructure]]. Governments are increasingly looking to the PPP-model to solve larger problems in healthcare delivery.  There is not a country in the world where healthcare is financed entirely by the government.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} While the provision of health is widely recognized as the responsibility of government, private capital and expertise are increasingly viewed as sources to induce [[efficiency]] and [[innovation]].  As PPPs move from financing infrastructure to managing care delivery, there is an opportunity to [[cost reduction|reduce overall]] [[healthcare costs|cost of healthcare]].

The larger scope of health PPPs to manage and finance care delivery and infrastructure means a larger potential market for private organizations. PricewaterhouseCoopers projects that spending on healthcare among the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[BRIC]] nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China will grow by 51 percent between 2010 and 2020, amounting to a cumulative total of more than $71 trillion.&lt;ref name="pwc.com"&gt;PricewaterhouseCoopers' Health Research Institute, (2010). [Build and Beyond: The (r)evolution of healthcare PPPs] http://www.pwc.com/us/ppphealth, p9.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, $3.6 trillion is projected to be spent on health infrastructure and $68.1 trillion will be spent on non-infrastructure health spending cumulatively over the next decade. Annually, spending on health infrastructure among the OECD and BRIC nations is projected to increase to $397 billion by 2020, up from $263 billion in 2010. The larger market for health PPPs is projected to be in non-infrastructure spending, estimated to be more than $7.5 trillion annually, up from $5 trillion in 2010.&lt;ref name="pwc.com"/&gt;

Health spending in the United States accounts for approximately half of all health spending among OECD nations, but the biggest growth will be outside of the U.S. According to PwC projections, the countries that are expected to have the highest health spending growth between 2010 and 2020 are China, where health spending is expected to increase by 166 percent, and India, which will see a 140 percent increase. As health spending increases it is putting pressure on governments and spurring them to look for private capital and expertise.&lt;ref name="pwc.com"/&gt;

==Product development partnerships==
Product development partnerships (PDPs) are a class of public–private partnerships that focus on pharmaceutical product development for diseases of the developing world. These include preventive medicines such as vaccines and microbicides, as well as treatments for otherwise neglected diseases. PDPs were first created in the 1990s to unite the public sector's commitment to international public goods for health with industry's intellectual property, expertise in product development, and marketing.

International PDPs work to accelerate research and development of pharmaceutical products for underserved populations that are not profitable for private companies. They may also be involved in helping plan for access and availability of the products they develop to those in need in their target populations. Publicly financed, with intellectual property rights granted by pharmaceutical industry partners for specific markets, PDPs are able to focus on their missions rather than concerns about recouping development costs through the profitability of the products being developed. These not-for-profit organizations bridge public- and private-sector interests, with a view toward resolving the specific incentive and financial barriers to increased industry involvement in the development of safe and effective pharmaceutical products.

International product development partnerships and public–private partnerships include:

* The [http://www.malariavaccine.org PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative] (MVI) is a global program of the international nonprofit organization [[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health]] (PATH). MVI was established in 1999 to accelerate the development of malaria vaccines and ensure their availability and accessibility in the developing world.
* The [[Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership]] was founded in 1998. RBM is the global framework for coordinated action against malaria. It forges consensus among key actors in malaria control, harmonises action and mobilises resources to fight malaria in endemic countries.
* The [[Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative]] (DNDi) was founded in 2003 as a not-for-profit drug development organization focused on developing novel treatments for patients suffering from neglected diseases.
* [[Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation]] is a PDP dedicated to the development of effective [[tuberculosis]] (TB) vaccine regimens that will prevent TB in all age groups and will be affordable, available and adopted worldwide.
* FIND [http://www.finddiagnostics.org/] is a Swiss-based non-profit organization established in 2003 to develop and roll out new and affordable diagnostic tests and other tools for poverty-related diseases.
* The [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]] is financed per 75% (750 Mio.US$) by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], which has a permanent seat on its supervisory board.
* [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis &amp; Malaria]], a [[Geneva]]-based UN-connected organisation, was established in 2002 to dramatically scale up global financing of interventions against the three pandemics.
* The [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] (IAVI), a biomedical public–private product development partnership (PDP), was established in 1996 to accelerate the development of a vaccine to prevent HIV infection and AIDS. IAVI is financially supported by governments, multilateral organizations, and major private-sector institutions and individuals.
* The [[International Partnership for Microbicides]] is a non-profit product development partnership (PDP), founded in 2002, dedicated to the development and availability of safe, effective microbicides for use by women in developing countries to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. See also [[Microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases]].
* [[Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV)]] is a not-for-profit drug discovery, development and delivery organization, established as a Swiss foundation in 1999, based in [[Geneva]]. MMV is supported by a number of foundations, governments and other donors.
* The [[TB Alliance]] is financed by public agencies and private foundations, and partners with research institutes and private pharmaceutical companies to develop faster-acting, novel treatments for tuberculosis that are affordable and accessible to the developing world.
* A UN agency, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), is financed through the UN system by contributions from member states. In recent years, WHO's work has involved more collaboration with NGOs and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as with foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. Some of these collaborations may be considered global public–private partnerships (GPPPs); 15% of WHO's total revenue in 2012 was financed by private foundations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/A66_29-en.pdf Sixty – sixth world assembly], WHO&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[United Nations Foundation]] &amp; Vodafone Foundation Technology Partnership, a five-year, $30 million commitment, leverages the power of mobile technology to support and strengthen humanitarian work worldwide.  Partners include the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[Magpi|DataDyne]], the mHealth Alliance, the [[World Food Program]] (WFP), Telecoms Sans Frontieres, and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

A good resource on the origins, challenges, and benefits of PDPs is in this NBR interview: http://nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=477

Similar public–private partnerships outside the realm of specific public-health goods include:
* The [http://www.unisdr.org/partners/private-sector United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)] is part of the United Nations Secretariat and its functions span the development and humanitarian fields. Public–private partnerships for disaster management bring together the private sector for PPP models with a tool box of partnership opportunities towards resilience, capacity building, and sustainability goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=PPP in disaster risk reduction|url=http://www.unisdr.org/partners/private-sector|publisher=United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The public–private partnership for improving teaching and learning in schools in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

==Financing==
A key motivation for governments considering public–private partnerships is the possibility of bringing in new sources of financing for funding public infrastructure and service needs.&lt;ref name="Barlow, J. Roehrich 2010"/&gt; It is important to understand{{Opinion|date=May 2017}} the main mechanisms for infrastructure projects, the principal investors in developing countries, sources of finance (limited recourse, debt, equity, etc.), the typical project finance structure, and key issues arising from developing project financed transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center|url=http://pppirc.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/financing|publisher=World Bank|access-date=23 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026231706/http://pppirc.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/financing|archive-date=2014-10-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An interesting aspect,{{Opinion|date=May 2017}} quite ubiquitous in project finance, is the dual nature of the parties involved, being both service providers to and contracted with the newly created entity ([[Special purpose entity]]), and shareholders of that entity. For example, it is quite common for the construction contractor or operations and maintenance service provider to hold an equity stake in a project finance's capital structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Project Finance in Theory and Practice: Designing, Structuring, and Financing Private and Public Projects|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-YRGMr13450C&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions|publisher = Academic Press|date = 1 January 2013|isbn = 9780123919465|language = en|first = Stefano|last = Gatti}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments utilize a [[public sector comparator]] for assessing the financial benefit of a public–private partnership and the optimal level of private sector involvement.

A number of key risks need to be taken into consideration as well. These risks will need to be allocated and managed to ensure the successful financing of the project. The party that is best placed to manage these risks in a cost-effective way may not necessarily always be the private sector. However, there are a number of mechanisms products available in the market for project sponsors, lenders and governments to mitigate some of the project risks, such as: Hedging and futures contracts; insurance; and risk mitigation products provided by [[international finance institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Risk Mitigation Mechanisms &amp; Products – PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center|url=http://pppirc.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/financing/risk-mitigation-mechanisms-products|publisher=World Bank|access-date=23 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027003441/http://pppirc.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/financing/risk-mitigation-mechanisms-products|archive-date=2014-10-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In designing such risk-hedging mechanisms, it is more difficult to address the risks of developing countries' infrastructure markets as their markets involve higher risks.&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Jae Myong (2018) ''Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects'', Palgrave Macmillan, pp.109-130. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralised units==

The [[World Bank]] (2007)&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2007) "Public–Private Partnership Units: Lessons for their designs and use in infrastructure"&lt;/ref&gt; states that governments tend to create Centralised PPP Units as a response to weaknesses in the central government's ability to effectively manage PPP programmes. Different governments suffer from different institutional failures in the PPP procurement process, hence these Centralised PPP units need to address these different issues by shaping their functions to suit the individual government needs. The function, location (within government) and jurisdiction (i.e. who controls it) of dedicated PPP Units may differ amongst countries, but generally these include:

*[[Policy advocacy|Policy guidance]] and advice on the content of national legislation. Guidance also includes defining which sectors are eligible for PPPs as well as which PPP methods and schemes can be carried out. 
*Approving or rejecting proposed PPP projects i.e. playing a gatekeeper role that can occur at any stage of the process i.e. at the initial planning stage or at the final approval stage. 
*Providing technical support to government organisations at the project identification, evaluation, [[procurement]] or contract management phase. 
*Capacity building i.e. training of public sector officials that are involved in PPP programmes or are interested in the PPP process. 
*Promote PPPs within the private sector i.e. PPP [[market development]].

A 2013 review&lt;ref name= "Literature Review: Evaluating the Costs and Benefits of Centralised PPP Units"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://partnerplatform.org/?52awcpfx | title= Literature Review: Evaluating the Costs and Benefits of Centralised PPP Units| author=Alberto Lemma| publisher=EPS PEAKS}}&lt;/ref&gt; which targeted research based on the value of centralised PPP Units (and does not look at the value of PPPs in general or any other type of PPP arrangement as the review was aimed at providing evidence needed to decide whether or not to set up a Centralised PPP Unit) found-

*No quantitative evidence: There is very little quantitative evidence of the value of centralised PPP coordination units against ministries or government agencies individually procuring PPP projects. Most of the studies available on PPP Units tend to focus on their role and only carry out brief descriptive analyses of their value.
*Limited Authority: The majority of the PPP Units reviewed in the literature do not play a particularly important role in approving or rejecting PPP programmes or projects. Whilst their advice is used in the decision making process by other government bodies, the majority do not actually have any executive power to make such decisions themselves. Hence, when they have more authority their value is seen to be higher.
*PPP Units differ by country and sector: Government failures, in regards to PPP units, vary by government. The requirements for PPPs also vary by country and sector and so do the risks involved (i.e. [[financial risk|financial]], social etc.) for the country government. Hence, PPP Units need to be tailored to solve these failures, properly assess risks and be located in the correct government departments where it can command the most power. PPP Units can play a number of important roles in the PPP process; however, not all PPP Units will play the same role as their functions have been tailored to individual country needs. In some cases, limits to their authority have curtailed their effectiveness.
*Implicit value: The lack of rigorous evidence does not prove that PPP Units are not an important contributor to the success of a country's PPP programme. The literature review does show that whilst there is no quantitative data, there are widespread perceptions on the importance of a well-functioning PPP unit for the success of a country's PPP programme.

The author of the 2013 review&lt;ref name="Literature Review: Evaluating the Costs and Benefits of Centralised PPP Units"/&gt;  found no literature that rigorously evaluates the usefulness of PPP Units. The literature does show that PPP Units should be individually tailored to different government functions, address different government failures and be appropriately positioned to support the country's PPP Programme. Where these conditions seem to have been met, there is consensus that PPP Units have played a positive role in national PPP Programmes.

==Specific cases==
While some PPP projects have proceeded smoothly, others have been highly controversial. Australian examples include the [[Airport railway line, Sydney|Airport Link]], the [[Cross City Tunnel]],&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Matthew, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/open-secrets/2005/10/30/1130607152241.html "Open Secrets"], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 31 October 2005.

In [[India]], public–private partnerships have been extremely successful in developing infrastructure, particularly road assets under the [[National Highways Authority of India]] and [[Midday Meal Scheme]] with [[Akshaya Patra Foundation]].{{Opinion|date=May 2017}}

In [[Canada]], public–private partnerships have become significant in both social and infrastructure development. PPP Canada Inc. was created as a Crown corporation with an independent board of directors reporting through the Minister of Finance to Parliament. Its mandate is to improve the delivery of public infrastructure by achieving better value, timeliness and accountability to taxpayers, through P3s. The Corporation became operational in February 2009 with the appointments of a chair of the board of directors and a chief executive officer.

PPPs exist in a variety of forms in [[British Columbia]] through the focused efforts of Partnerships BC, a company registered under the Business Corporations Act, that is wholly owned by the Province of British Columbia and reports to its shareholder the Minister of Finance. Projects include the [[Canada Line]] [[rapid transit]] line, the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] Hospital and Cancer Centre and the Sea-to-Sky Highway project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.partnershipsbc.ca/pdf/An%20Introduction%20to%20P3%20-June03.pdf An Introduction to Public Private Partnerships]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Quebec]], PPPs include the [[McGill University Health Centre]], the new western extension of [[Quebec Autoroute 30|Autoroute 30]] and [[Université de Montréal]]'s Hospital Research Center.

In the UK, two-thirds of the [[History of the London Underground#Public–private partnership|London Underground PPP]] was taken back into public control in July 2007 after only four and a half years at an estimated cost of £2 billion and the remaining one-third was taken back into public control in May 2010 after seven and a half years for a purchase price of £310 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8669823.stm|title=Tube maintenance back 'in house' as new deal is signed|date=8 May 2010|access-date=10 May 2010|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government had paid advisers £180 million for structuring, negotiating and implementing the PPP and had reimbursed £275 million of bid costs to the winning bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0304/london_underground_ppp.aspx?alreadysearchfor=yes|title=London Underground PPP: Were they good deals?|date=17 June 2004|publisher=National Audit Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 30-year PPP contract for the refurbishment of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)#Property portfolio|MOD Main Building]] in London was estimated to give a saving of £100,000 as compared to the £746.2 million cost of public procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0102/redevelopment_of_mod_building.aspx|title=Ministry of Defence: Redevelopment of MOD Main Building|publisher=National Audit Office|date=18 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinancing of the [[Altcourse (HM Prison)|Fazakerley Prison]] PFI contract following the completion of construction delivered an 81% gain to the private sector operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/9900/the_refinancing_of_the_fazaker.aspx|title=The Refinancing of the Fazakerley PFI Prison Contract|publisher=National Audit Office|date=29 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Air Traffic Services#Ownership structure and management|NATS PPP]] saw 51% of the UK's air traffic control service transferred to the private sector; however, following the decline in air traffic after the [[September 11 attacks]], the government and [[BAA Limited]] each invested £65 million in the private sector operator in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0304/refinancing_nats.aspx?alreadysearchfor=yes|title=Refinancing the Public Private Partnership for National Air Traffic Services|publisher=National Audit Office|date=7 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, during the Robert Moses era, public private partnership ran rampant.{{Opinion|date=May 2017}} PPPs during this period were best described and known as ''public authorities''; for example, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, Henry Hudson Parkway Authority, and the Port Authority. Moses manipulated various public authorities, either seeking their success of failure, in order to gain political power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power Broker Robert Moses and the Fall of New York|last=Caro|first=Robert A.|publisher=Random House, Inc.|year=1974|isbn=0-394-72024-5|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the new [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017–present)|Governor Mario M.

==Studies==

A 2013 study published in ''[[State and Local Government Review]]'' found that definitions of public–private partnerships vary widely between municipalities: "Many public and private officials tout public–private partnerships for any number of activities, when in truth the relationship is contractual, a franchise, or the load shedding of some previously public service to a private or nonprofit entity." A more general term for such agreements is "shared service delivery" — municipalities joining together, with private firms, or with nonprofits to provide services to citizens.&lt;ref name="JR-study"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilvert | first1 = Cheryl | last2 =  Swindell | first2 = David | year = 2014 | title =Collaborative Service Delivery: What Every Local Government Manager Should Know | journal = [[State and Local Government Review]] | volume = 45 | url = http://slg.sagepub.com/content/45/4/240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JR-post"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/municipal/local-government-service-contracts-best-practices-issues | title=Local government services and contracts: Best practices and key issues to watch}} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved February 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic theory ==
In economic theory, public–private partnerships have been studied through the lens of [[contract theory]]. The first theoretical study on PPPs has been conducted by [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Incomplete Contracts and Public Ownership: Remarks, and an Application to Public–Private Partnerships*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0297.00119/abstract|journal = The Economic Journal|date = 2003|issn = 1468-0297|pages = C69-C76|volume = 113|issue = 486|doi = 10.1111/1468-0297.00119|language = en|first = Oliver|last = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an economic theory perspective, what distinguishes a PPP from traditional public procurement of infrastructure services is the fact that the building and operating stages are bundled in the case of PPPs. Hence, the private firm has strong incentives in the building stage to make investments with regard to the operating stage. These investments can be desirable but may also be undesirable (e.g., when the investments not only reduce operating costs, but also reduce service quality). Hence, there is a trade-off and it depends on the particular situation whether a PPP or traditional procurement is to be preferred. Hart's model has been extended in several directions. For instance, authors have studied various externalities between the building and operating stages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Building and managing facilities for public services|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272706000569|journal = Journal of Public Economics|date = 2006|pages = 2143–2160|volume = 90|issue = 10–11|doi = 10.1016/j.jpubeco.2006.04.001|first = John|last = Bennett|first2 = Elisabetta|last2 = Iossa}}&lt;/ref&gt; insurance when firms are risk-averse,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Risk allocation and the costs and benefits of public–private partnerships|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2012.00181.x/abstract|journal = The RAND Journal of Economics|date = 2012|issn = 1756-2171|pages = 442–474|volume = 43|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1756-2171.2012.00181.x|language = en|first = Elisabetta|last = Iossa|first2 = David|last2 = Martimort}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implications of PPPs for incentives to innovate and gather information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Public–private partnerships versus traditional procurement: Innovation incentives and information gathering|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1756-2171.12010/abstract|journal = The RAND Journal of Economics|date = 2013|issn = 1756-2171|pages = 56–74|volume = 44|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1756-2171.12010|language = en|first = Eva I.|last = Hoppe|first2 = Patrick W.|last2 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges and barriers==

Public–private partnerships have seen a large increase over the years in part because local and state governments rely heavily on the growing number of non-profits to provide many public services that they cannot.&lt;ref name="Smith 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Smith, S. |year=2008 |title=The Challenge of Strengthening Nonprofits and Civil Society |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=68 |issue=supplement s1 |pages=132–145 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00984.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entering into a public–private partnership can be rewarding as well as destructive if not done with caution and education. Partnerships need balance from both parties as well as continuous maintenance. If entered into lightly, one can find its organization falling in various areas proving to be one of many partnership failures.&lt;ref name="Babiak &amp; Thibault"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Babiak, K.|author2=Thibault, L.|last-author-amp=yes |year=2009 |title=Challenges in Multiple Cross-Sector Partnerships |journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=117–143 |doi=10.1177/0899764008316054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Flexibility''' between the two partners as the contract and staff involved throughout the process: If one party feels they are losing some of the control they may work on adopting more rules and regulations throughout the process instead of working together to be flexible and mediate an issue.&lt;ref name="Babiak &amp; Thibault"/&gt;
#'''Timeline''': Non-profits are working on a long-term timeline. Many of their goals can only be achieved with long-term commitment; this is where their focus will lie. For-profit organizations are more short-term oriented because of short-term goals focusing primarily on profitability. Finally, government agencies' timeline depends a lot on election timelines and therefore can change regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferris | first1 = J. | last2 = Williams | first2 = N. | year = 2013 | title = Offices of Strategic Partnerships: Helping Philanthropy and Government Work Better Together | url = | journal = Foundation Review | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 24–36 | doi=10.9707/1944-5660.1180}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#'''Focus of the project''': Partners may not have the same focus when entering into a partnership even though they think they might.
#'''Funding priorities''': When parties cannot agree on where funding should go this can sometimes lead to losses in time, resources, and the overall funding for the project.&lt;ref name="Babiak &amp; Thibault"/&gt; Funding priorities for government bodies looks typically at where the public's funds were spent in relation to the contract made. This then typically is looked at as in how many hours of participations, forms filled out, meals served, etc.&lt;ref name="Smith 2008"/&gt; Neighborhood organizations or small and local non-profits saw a broad source of funding during the early years but there has been a shift in funding more recently reducing the overall funding and seeing more of it go to larger agencies focusing on large grants. 
#'''[[Accountability]]''': With the rise in public–private partnerships there is also a rise in the responsibility that the non-profits tend to hold. With the government relying on many more of these organizations to provide the public services they cannot it is also proving difficult for the government to hold these non-profits responsible.&lt;ref name="Smith 2008"/&gt; When responsibilities are not set to the letter this can cause some in managerial positions to take the back seat, seeing their counterparts taking the initiative to get tasks done. This leaves an unbalance of work and sometimes those with the most skills are not doing the job. This can also be brought on by undermanagement causing more problems such as a lack of focus for the projects, mismanaged funding, and miscommunication.&lt;ref name="Babiak &amp; Thibault"/&gt; Too many projects and partnerships can also lead to a lack of accountability. When there are too many tasks they seem to all fall short of the hoped perfection.&lt;ref name="Babiak &amp; Thibault"/&gt; Some partners may be taking over roles of others because accountability has not been well defined. This can also lead to some taking advantage of others when they note the any weakness. This can cause a distrustful partnership.&lt;ref name="Eschenfelder 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eschenfelder, B. |year=2011 |title=Funder-Initiated Integration Partnership Challenges and Strategies |journal=Nonprofit Management and Leadership |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=273–288 |doi=10.1002/nml.20025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Communication or understanding''': One of the largest issues that can be discussed, communication can be a huge downfall and can contribute to many of the other risks within partnerships. It can be said that when entering into a cross-sector partnership it is difficult to understand and collaborate due to the diversity and differing languages spoken amongst the sectors. Items like performance measures, goal measurements, government regulations, and the nature of funding can all be interpreted differently thus causing blurred lines of communication.&lt;ref name="Babiak &amp; Thibault"/&gt;
#'''Autonomy within the partnership''': While working together is important it is still a strength to be able to work on parts of the project alone, take initiative when needed, and keep some individualism throughout the process. This is beginning to happen more with the privatization of public–private partnerships where the private organization may own the partnership itself and the government then keeps full responsibility for it. This keeps parts of the partnership separate for focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muralidhar | first1 = D. | last2 = Koteswara Rao | first2 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Development of Public Libraries through Public–private Partnership in India: Issues and Challenges | url = | journal = DESIDOC Journal of Library &amp; Information Technology | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 21–24 | doi=10.14429/djlit.33.1.3725}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Conflicts''': These can arise from any of the above topics but even outside issues or forces may bring a partnership to a halt. Even though these partnerships are entered into with the best of intentions even the most trivial issues can snowball into greater conflict halting a partnership dead in its tracks.&lt;ref name="Eschenfelder 2011"/&gt; Having no understanding and communication between parties can cause conflicts with use of language, stereotyping, negative assumptions, and prejudice about the other organization. These conflicts can be related to territorialism or protectionism, and a lack of commitment to working within the partnership.&lt;ref name="Cairns &amp; Harris 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cairns, B. |author2=Harris, M.  |last-author-amp=yes|year=2011 |title=Local cross-sector partnerships |journal=Nonprofit Management and Leadership |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=311–324 |doi=10.1002/nml.20027}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Possible solutions''': Partnerships might not be natural for business and managers do not want to depend on others but it is possible with careful solutions.&lt;ref name="Babiak &amp; Thibault"/&gt;
##Creating an ongoing narrative about partnerships and how will these be developed, maintained, terminated. This is especially prevalent to the local and state governments who rely heavily on the non-profits for the public services.&lt;ref name="Smith 2008"/&gt; A business partnership model would not be accurate or appropriate for a P3.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bloomfield, P. |year=2006 |title=The Challenging Business of Long-Term Public–Private Partnerships: Reflections on Local Experience |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=400–411| doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00597.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many partnerships can be terminated early due to issues with trust and cooperation during the contract implementation process. These issues can be avoided when the organization has initial guidelines for dos and don'ts.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 2006"/&gt;
##Creating a formal control mechanism for the partnership.&lt;ref name="Babiak &amp; Thibault"/&gt;
###Ensure that there is a continuous commitment with negotiations in any time of trouble and even an outline for termination procedures if necessary.&lt;ref name="Babiak &amp; Thibault"/&gt;
###Conflict resolution, outreach and organizational development are items that managers can work on and even assign specialists to each task. Creating a timeline to be followed throughout the partnership assists in mutual understanding and communication as well.&lt;ref name="Smith 2008"/&gt; Assigning specialists to work with skills in communication, conflict resolution, negotiation and policy analysis cross-sector partnerships have also been able to flourish.&lt;ref name="Cairns &amp; Harris 2011"/&gt;

[[Image:ComisionRettig.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Supreme Decree No. 355, creating the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission.]]
The '''Rettig Report''', officially '''The National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation Report''', is a 1991 report by a commission designated by then-President [[Patricio Aylwin]] (from the ''[[Concertación]]'') encompassing [[human rights]] abuses resulting in death or disappearance that occurred in [[Chile]] during the years of military dictatorship under [[Augusto Pinochet]], which began on September 11, 1973 and ended on March 11, 1990. They found that over 2,000 people had been killed for political reasons, and dozens of military personnel have been convicted of human rights abuses.

==Members==
The commissioners had diverse affiliations. Three commissioners were associated with the Pinochet government, two were exiles under Pinochet, and [[Raúl Rettig]] was an ambassador under President [[Salvador Allende]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weissbrodt|first=David|last2=Fraser|first2=Paul|year=1992|title=Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation|jstor=762329|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=14|issue=4|pages=601-622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight-member commission, including [[Jaime Castillo Velasco]], [[José Luis Cea Egaña]], [[Mónica Jiménez]], [[Laura Novoa Vásquez]], [[José Zalaquett Daher]], [[Ricardo Martin Díaz]], and [[Gonzalo Vial Correa]] (minister of Education 1978-79), released its report in February 1991.

== Goals ==
In the presidential decree in which President [[Patricio Aylwin]] created the Rettig Commission was a set of goals:
* To create as complete a picture as possible of the most serious human rights violations
* To gather evidence to allow the creation of a list that identifies the victims' name, fate, and whereabouts
* To recommend reparations for the families of victims 
* To recommend legal and administrative measures to prevent future violations&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ensalaco|first=Mark|year=1994|title=Truth Commissions for Chile and El Salvador: A Report and Assessment|jstor=762563|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=16|issue=4|pages=656-675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figures==
The report determined that 2,279 persons were killed for political reasons. This figure included 957 [[forced disappearance|disappeared]] after arrest and 164 "victims of political violence", a figure that included police officers and others killed by left-wing extremists.&lt;ref name="rettigreport.en"&gt;[http://www.usip.org/files/resources/collections/truth_commissions/Chile90-Report/Chile90-Report.pdf Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=1122}}

In 641 cases, the commission could not conclusively determine that the person was killed for political reasons. It found 508 cases that were beyond its mandate, and that in 449 cases, no information beyond the name of a disappeared person could be determined.&lt;ref name="rettigreport.en"/&gt;{{rp|page=1122}}

==Judgment==
As of May 2012, 76 agents had been condemned for violations of human rights and 67 were convicted: 36 of the [[Chilean Army|Army]], 27 [[Carabineros de Chile|Carabineros]], 2 of the [[Chilean Air Force|Air Force]], one of the [[Chilean Navy|Navy]] and one of the [[Investigations Police of Chile|PDI]]. Three condemned agents died and six agents got conditional sentences. 350 cases, pertaining to disappeared persons, illegal detainees and torture, remain open. There are 700 military and civilian persons involved in these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=[[Agence France Presse]]|title=Estudio revela que 76 son los agentes de la dictadura condenados por violaciones a DDHH|journal=Chiliean newspaper [[La Tercera]]|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2012/06/680-465560-9-estudio-revela-que-76-son-los-agentes-de-la-dictadura-condenados-por-violaciones.shtml|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recommendations ==
The report included recommendations to prevent future human rights violations in Chile:
* Ratification of [[human rights treaty bodies|international human rights treaties]]
* Modifying the national laws to match international standards of [[international human rights law|human rights law]]
* Assuring the independence of the judiciary
* Creating a society in which the armed forces, the police, and the security forces respect human rights
* Creating a [[ombudsman|permanent office]] to work to protect citizens from future human rights violations&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Implications ==
The Rettig Report's listing of a disappeared person as deceased and the victim of a human rights violation created a legal determination of the victim's situation. That would allow the surviving family members with benefits such as making it possible for them to resolve property and inheritance claims, apply for social security and any reparation benefits, as well as impacting the marital status of spouses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The human rights violations have been looked at again in the [[Valech Report]].

'''Securities market participants''' in the [[United States]] include corporations and governments issuing securities, persons and corporations buying and selling a [[security (finance)|security]], the [[broker-dealer]]s and exchanges which facilitate such trading, banks which safe keep assets, and regulators who monitor the markets' activities.  Investors buy and sell through broker-dealers and have their assets retained by either their executing broker-dealer,  a [[custodian bank]] or a [[Prime brokerage|prime broker]]. These transactions take place in the environment of equity and equity options [[Stock Exchange|exchanges]], regulated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), or derivative exchanges, regulated by the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC). For transactions involving stocks and bonds, [[transfer agent]]s assure that the ownership in each transaction is properly assigned to and held on behalf of each investor.

Supporting these transactions, there are three [[central securities depository|central securities depositories]] and four clearing organizations that assure the settlement of large volumes of trades. Market data consolidators inform investors and regulators in real time of the bid and offer prices of each security through one of two securities information processing systems. The basis for these transactions is controlled both through [[self-regulatory organization]]s and the two [[securities commission]]s, the SEC and the CFTC.

This article covers those who deal in securities and futures in US markets. Securities include equities ([[stock]]s), [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] (US Government, corporate and municipal), and [[Option (finance)|options]] thereon. [[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] include [[Futures contract|futures]] and options thereon as well as swaps. The distinction in the US relates to having two regulators. Markets in other countries have similar categories of securities and types of participants, though not two regulators.

==Parties to transactions==
Parties to investment transactions include corporations and governments which raise capital by issuing equity and debt, the selling and buying investors, the broker-dealers and stock exchanges that have the means to transact those deals.

===Issuers===

Investors may not be members of stock exchanges. Rather they must buy and sell securities through broker-dealers which are registered with the appropriate regulatory body for that purpose. In accepting investors as clients, broker-dealers take on the risks of their clients not being able to meet their financial obligations. Hence retail (individual) investors generally are required to keep their investment assets in custody with the broker-dealer through which they buy and sell securities. A broker-dealer would normally not accept an order to buy from a retail clients unless there is sufficient cash on deposit with the broker-dealer to cover the cost of the order, nor sell unless the client already has the security in the broker-dealer's custody.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Institutional investor]]s buy and sell on behalf of their individual clients, be they pension funds, endowments and the like, or pooled funds such as mutual funds, unit trusts or hedge funds. As such, their client assets are safe kept with either [[custodian bank]]s or broker-dealers ([[Prime brokerage]]). Furthermore, institutional investors may buy and sell through any number of broker-dealers which in turn settle such trades at the designated custodians and prime brokers. Investment managers generally differ from hedge funds on how much risk each pursues in its investment strategies. For example, investment managers generally do not [[sell short]], but hedge funds do.&lt;ref name = theArt&gt;

Institutional investors must inform their executing broker-dealers as to whether orders are long or short, since those brokers have no way of knowing their clients' positions are in each security.

Were investors able either to buy short naked (without borrowing money to pay), or sell short naked (without borrowing securities to deliver), such practices could easily lead to [[market manipulation]] of stock prices: since buyers or sellers would not have the restraint of providing cash or securities, they could conceivably have unlimited buys or sells, which would drive prices up or down. Naked short buying is not a problem because custodians and prime brokers have their own finances from which to lend money to their clients in order to settle the trades. Naked short selling can be a problem. It occurs when a prime broker is unable to borrow the stock simply because there is none available for that purpose. Hedge funds are expected to find sources of stock which can be borrowed before executing short sell orders. If they fail to do so, and their prime broker cannot borrow for them, then the settlement of such trades cannot take place on the settlement date. Whether such a "fail" is due to poor co-ordination among the various parties (hedge fund, lending entity and prime broker) or to a [[naked short sale]] is impossible to determine. In the US the SEC effectively ended such instances by making the cost of a failed short sell too expensive for the hedge fund to risk. If on the morning the short sell is scheduled to settle the prime broker cannot deliver the securities to the executing broker, then the latter is obligated to buy-in the shares (in effect, making the delivery). The buy-in occurs at the then prevailing market price. This may be much higher than the price at which the hedge fund first sold the securities, resulting in a potentially substantial loss to the hedge fund.&lt;ref name = SHO&gt;

===Stock exchanges===
[[File:5.2.11NewYorkStockExchangeByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), a host of transactions in securities.]]
{{Main|Stock exchange}}
A stock [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] is a physical or digital place to which brokers and dealers send buy and sell orders in [[stock]]s (also called shares), [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. [[Price discovery]] is optimized by bringing together at one point in time and place all buy and sell orders for a particular security.

Securities traded on a stock exchange include stock issued by listed companies, [[unit trust]]s, [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], pooled investment products and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. Stock exchanges often function as "continuous auction" markets, with buyers and sellers consummating transactions at a central location, such as the [[Open outcry|floor of the exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', §2:3 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify for trading on an exchange, a security must first be [[Listing (finance)|listed]], having met the requirements of the listing exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web
 | title = Listing Standards
 | website = NYSE
 | url = https://www.nyse.com/get-started/reference#Standards
 | access-date = 24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks, [[alternative trading system]]s and "[[dark pool]]s" have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', §§2:25 - 2:30 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Exchanges for equities, options, futures and derivatives include:
* Equities - multiple exchanges ([[NYSE]], [[Nasdaq]], [[BATS Global Markets]] and others) compete for order flow from brokers with different products and pricing&lt;ref name = NatSecExch&gt;{{cite web
 | title = National Securities Exchanges
 | website = SEC
 | url = https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/divisionsmarketregmrexchangesshtml.html
 | access-date = 24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Options on equities - similar to equities but including the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] and the [[International Securities Exchange]]&lt;ref name = NatSecExch/&gt;
* Futures and derivatives - the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], including its acquisitions of similar exchanges, is the sole venue for many derivative contracts, which must be cleared at the same exchanges&lt;ref name = TradingOrganizations&gt;{{cite web

* Energy related derivatives - the [[Intercontinental Exchange]] (which now owns the NYSE among a number of acquisitions) dominates energy related derivative trading, again with its own clearing arrangements.&lt;ref name = TradingOrganizations/&gt;
 
US government debt does not trade on exchanges. Rather there are a number of [[primary dealer]]s which buy directly from the government and resell to other broker-dealers and institutional investors.&lt;ref name="policies"&gt;[http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/pridealers_policies.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York:Primary Dealer Policies].

==Post-trade environment==
[[File:270 Park Avenue (WTM by official-ly cool 100).jpg|thumb|[[JPMorgan Chase]] headquarters in [[New York City]]—one of the largest [[custodian bank]]s]]
Custodian banks, prime brokers, transfer agents, and central securities depositories provide a medium for performing trades and providing safekeeping of securities.

===Custodian banks===
{{Main|Custodian bank}}

[[Custodian bank]]s offer active safekeeping and administration of clients' securities portfolios. Banks also offer passive safekeeping with safety deposit boxes, but this service is limited to clients' accessing their rented storage boxes. Active safekeeping (custody) involves:&lt;ref name = Custody/&gt;

* Receiving securities against payment or free delivery, based on client instructions
* Delivering securities against payment or free delivery, based on client instructions
* Providing clients with monthly statements of all holdings
* Crediting client accounts with dividends, interests and other types of income
* Alerting clients to pending [[corporate action]]s and acting on client instructions
* Providing annual tax related information

Clients of custodians are generally institutional investors.&lt;ref name = Custody&gt;{{cit web

 | access-date = 22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prime brokers===
{{Main|Prime brokerage}}

Prime brokers are broker-dealers which offer custody and other services to hedge funds. Prime brokerage has generally been considered as more risky than traditional custody, primarily because hedge funds have been viewed as more risky than institutional investors.&lt;ref&gt;

 | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/the-fall-of-long-term-capital-management-2014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the US a hedge fund may execute trades through any number of broker-dealers. But in the settlement process, those trades become the trades of the prime broker, as though the hedge fund had executed the trades only through that broker. The risk of the hedge fund's inability to settle those trades becomes that of the prime broker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web

The "prime" in the term originally referred to a hedge fund having one broker-dealer for its custody and borrowing purposes. With the events of 2008, most large hedge funds have diversified their holdings among several prime brokers in an effort to limit their risks of a prime broker's failure, such as with [[Lehman Brothers]] Europe in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Transfer agent===
{{Main|Transfer agent}}

Transfer agents provide a variety of services to issuing companies, including: maintaining a registry of all shareholders, paying dividends and conducting proxy campaigns. Most investments in US equities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds are now held in [[book entry]] form, rather than  certificates as was the case as recently as the early 1970s when [[Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation]] (DTCC) began operations. Thus with the general acceptance of stock immobilization at the central depository, most of the registry function has shifted to reconciling daily immobilized positions with DTCC's nominee firm, [[Cede and Company|Cede &amp; Co.]] For example, a company has issued 10 million shares. 100,000 shares have been issued in certificated form to a variety of investors. The transfer agent keeps detailed records of these, and verifies the legitimacy of any certificate presented to it. The other 9,900,000 have been purchased by investors who hold them in book entry form through accounts at broker-dealers (retail), custodians and prime brokers (institutional). The "owner" of those 9,900,000 shares on the transfer agent's registry would be Cede &amp; Co., DTCC's nominee company.&lt;ref&gt;

US equities, corporate and municipal bonds can be issued in certificated form, though this practice has been largely replaced due to the costs and inefficiencies of keeping them. Rather holdings are kept as "immobilized" or "street name", with the beneficial owners keeping them in accounts at broker-dealers and banks, just as they do for currencies. DTCC uses a nominee firm, Cede &amp; Co., in whose name a share certificate is held in the DTCC vaults. Each day DTCC reconciles with the relevant transfer agent the number of shares held in its accounts for its member banks and broker-dealers. In turn, other banks and broker-dealers hold accounts with DTCC member firms, creating a chain of ownership down to the beneficial owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22429124 |title=Cede &amp; Company: Private Company Information - Businessweek |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great advantage of this approach is the efficiency and low cost involved in settling large volumes of trades. The inconvenience is that the issuing corporation no longer knows who its owners are, since its transfer agent has all the immobilized shares recorded as the owner being Cede &amp; Co. For purposes of sending proxy notices and other communications with beneficial owners, the transfer agent, acting on a request of the issuing corporation, sends an inquiry to DTCC, which in turn sends inquiries to its members and so on down the chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web

==Market data consolidators==

Market data consolidators address the needs of investors and regulators who wish to know, at any instant during the trading day, what the National Best Bid and Offer is for any security, the last sale price and other pertinent information related to trading the security. Since both the equity and equity options markets have multiple exchanges, quotation and last trades data from all must be consolidated in real time to provide a market view, rather than an individual exchange view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web

All the equity and equity options exchanges broadcast in real time their quotations, last trade and other data to these organizations, which in turn calculate the best bid and offer and redistribute the data to market participants.

The names for these organizations originated several decades ago, when the NYSE and American Stock Exchange were the two venues for corporations to list their stocks. Data from these listings are known as Tape A (NYSE listed) and Tape B (AMEX). At the time, Nasdaq was a quotation system and not an exchange. This explains the name still used: Over the Counter/Unlisted Trading Privilege for data known as Tape C (Nasdaq).&lt;ref name = UTP/&gt;

==Oversight==
[[File:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission headquarters.JPG|thumb|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The SEC provides oversight for many securities transactions.]]
The securities markets are overseen by the SEC, by individual state securities commissions established under [[blue sky law]]s, and the self-regulatory organizations, which are overseen by the SEC. The CFTC and NFA also have a role with respect to security futures and security-based swaps. In turn, the CFTC and NFA oversee the derivative markets.

===Self-regulatory organizations===

Gaudry page 8 of 53.png|thumb|right|A single page from the Spanish land grant claim of Spanish nobleman John B. Gaudry, who founded a plantation near [[DeLeon Springs, Florida]] after he received a land grant in 1807. This is page 8 of 53, depicting a parcel of land adjacent to the [[St. Johns River]].]]
'''Spanish land grants''' documented claims of land ownership when [[Spain]] ceded the territory of [[Florida]] to the [[United States]] in 1821. Under Spanish rule, land grants were offered to settlers beginning in 1790, to induce settlement of the colony. The United States agreed to honor these land grants when it gained control of the territory, provided that they were shown to be valid.

==History==
In 1819, under the terms of the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]], Spain ceded Florida to the United States in exchange for $5 million and the American renunciation of any claims on Texas that they might have from the Louisiana Purchase.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602475/Transcontinental-Treaty | title=Transcontinental Treaty | publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States required that residents had documented or testimonial proof of the validity of their land grants. Land commissions and other government bodies reviewed these claims, either confirming or denying their validity, and thus the ownership of the land. Dossiers were assembled for each land parcel, consisting of survey plats, deeds, wills, royal grants, and other documents supporting the claims.&lt;ref name=WDL&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4012/ | title=Spanish Land Grant Papers of John B. Gaudry | publisher=[[World Digital Library]] | date=January 23, 2012 | accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
In 1942, the Spanish land grants were first published by the [[Work Projects Administration|Work Projects Administration's]] (WPA) Florida Historical Records Survey. The records were transcribed into a five volumes, with an introduction written by historian Louise Biles Hill. More recently, the State Library and Archives of Florida published digitized copies of the land grants online.&lt;ref name="Florida Memory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.floridamemory.com/collections/spanishlandgrants/ | title=Spanish Land Grants | publisher=Florida Memory | accessdate=May 20, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502174501/http://floridamemory.com/collections/spanishlandgrants/ | archivedate=May 2, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7503">'''The Stelly Plan''' is a since repealed 2002 tax measure in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]] designed to shift certain state [[sales tax]]es on food for home consumption and utilities to increases in [[state income tax]]es. Narrowly approved by voters, the proposal soon ran into  criticism as middle-class taxpayers complained of paying much more in state income taxes than the amount of reduced sales taxes. The plan is named for former [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Vic Stelly|Victor T. "Vic" Stelly]], a [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], who served in the House from 1988-2004. Removal of the Stelly income tax tables began in calendar year 2009.

In the November 5, 2002, [[general election]], Louisiana voters approved the Stelly Plan, listed on the ballot as Act 88-2002, actually a constitutional amendment. The tabulation was 534,989 (51 percent) to 506,938 (49 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisiana election returns, November 5, 2002|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11052002/11052002_Statewide.html|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


==Details of Stelly Plan==

Under the Stelly Plan, the state sales tax on food for home consumption and the sales tax on [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], and water for residential use was lowered on January 1, 2003, from 3.9 cents to 2 cents per dollar. Taxes on those items were then eliminated on July 1, 2003. To replace revenue lost through Stelly, individual income tax brackets were adjusted upward. Because individual tax returns for taxable year 2003 were not filed until after January 1, 2004, the withholding tax tables were revised, and the new rates went into effect on January 1, 2003.&lt;ref name=revenue&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revenue.louisiana.gov/sections/publications/viewrelease.aspx?id=108|title="Information Available on Recent Tax Changes", January 21, 2003|publisher=revenue.louisiana.gov|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stelly did not affect local sales taxes on food. Only food requiring preparation at home was covered by the reduction in state sales tax.  Single-use portions or restaurant meals were not affected by the Stelly Plan.  Prescription drugs were already exempt from sales taxes, but Stelly placed that exemption in the state Constitution. Louisiana does not exempt over-the-counter drugs from sales tax, but such items are exempt in neighboring [[Texas]]. Stelly also allowed the tax owed by the individual to be distributed over the year 2003. The increase in taxpayer withholding was to have been the same as the savings realized from the elimination of sales taxes under the Stelly Plan. Taxpayers making approximately $80,000 annually saw increases in total state taxes.&lt;ref name=revenue/&gt;

==Repeal==

After years of criticism from those who faced higher taxes as a result of the Stelly Plan, the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] in 2008 repealed Stelly. The highest income brackets were returned to the level they were prior to 2003. The tax reduction began in 2009, but the state revenue department did not alter the withholding on individual income tax tables until July 1 of that year. Hence individuals did not receive more disposable income in their paychecks until after July 1 unless they had individually requested that their employers adjust their tax schedules prior to July. The repeal of Stelly could cost the state treasury some $358 million in taxes for the 2009-2010 fiscal year and somewhat less for each year thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labudget.org/lbp/2009/01/stelly-plan-in-action/|title=Maria Mathews, "Stelly Plan in Action", January 27l, 2009|publisher=labudget.org|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Stelly defenders==

The ''[[Lafayette Daily Advertiser]]'' in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], which supported the Stelly Plan, described the measure as a "sensible fiscal measure . . . developed essentially to make income taxes, instead of sales taxes, the primary funding mechanism for government."&lt;ref name=advertiser&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-par.org/PAR%20News%20Files/advertiser_01.05.2009.pdf|title="Stelly Plan action: Bad timing"|publisher=''[[Lafayette Daily Advertiser]]'', January 5, 2009|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Public Affairs Research Council, a business [[think-tank]], said that the loss of income tax revenues would make Louisiana more reliant on less stable [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] revenues and creates the potential for a resumption of the "boom-and-bust cycle".&lt;ref name=advertiser/&gt;

''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|The Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]'' editorially opposed the Stelly Plan repeal, which it determined reflects legislators yielding to pressure from higher-income taxpayers. The newspaper questioned the repeal of a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] income-tax-for sales-tax swap and came up with this possible explanation:

"Part of it is human nature: People benefit a little bit every day from the sales taxes eliminated in 2002 by passage of the Stelly Plan. But everybody notices when they write a larger check for state income tax. Lawmakers are responding to aggrieved, mostly affluent constituents who pay big income tax bills.

"This is a commonly cited problem with the sales tax: even the low-income folks who are hit hardest by it often don't notice, because they pay a nickel here and a nickel there rather than one big lump sum. If people don't notice the sales tax when they pay it, it's easy to understand that they wouldn't notice when (as a result of the Stelly sales tax cuts) they're not longer paying it. . . . "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisianataxblog.blogspot.com/2007/05/advocate-keep-stelly-plan.html|title=''The Advocate'': "Keep the Stelly Plan", May 11, 2007|publisher=louisianataxblog.blogspot.com|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stelly critics==

[[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] at first opposed the repeal as too costly to declining state coffers but then championed it as public reaction against the measure accelerated.&lt;ref name=advertiser/&gt;

[[Jeffrey D. Sadow]], a [[professor]] of [[political science]] at [[Louisiana State University in Shreveport]] and active conservative blogger, in 2005 described the Stelly Plan, accordingly: "In essence . . . just another link in the long history of Louisiana tax policy that favors redistribution and discourages economic development. It's that kind of thinking that has gotten us into an economic mess . . . "&lt;ref name=sadow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeffsadow.blogspot.com/2005/03/stelly-still-trying-to-make-silk-purse.html|title=''Between the Lines'': "Stelly still trying to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear"|publisher=jeffsadow.blogspot.com|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several lawmakers have also opposed the Stelly Plan's removal of certain state income tax deductions. Former legislators [[Pete Schneider (Louisiana politician)|Pete Schneider]] of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], [[James David Cain]] of [[Beauregard Parish, Louisiana|Beauregarde Parish]], and [[Peppi Bruneau]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] attempted unsuccessfully to restore deductions removed for charitable contributions and home mortgage interest.&lt;ref name=sadow/&gt;

'''Sustainable architecture''' is [[architecture]] that seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings by efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, and development space and the ecosystem at large. Sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Architecture and Simulation Modelling", Dublin Institute of Technology, [http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html#_Toc397853444] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506035740/http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html |date=2013-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of sustainability, or [[ecological design]], is to ensure that our actions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Doerr Architecture, Definition of Sustainability and the Impacts of Buildings [http://www.doerr.org/services/sustainability.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable energy use==
{{Main|Low-energy house|Zero-energy building}}
[[File:K2 apartments windsor.jpg|thumb|K2 sustainable apartments in [[Windsor, Victoria]], Australia by DesignInc (2006) features [[passive solar building design|passive solar design]], recycled and sustainable materials, [[photovoltaic cells]], [[wastewater]] treatment, [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater collection]] and [[solar hot water]].]]
[[File:Passivhaus section en.jpg|thumb|The [[passivhaus]] standard combines a variety of techniques and technologies to achieve ultra-low energy use.]]
[[File:Arts Center Greensburg, Kansas, Photo by Eric Ascalon.jpg|thumb|Following its destruction by a tornado in 2007, the town of [[Greensburg, Kansas]] (United States) elected to rebuild to highly stringent LEED Platinum environmental standards.  Shown is the town's new art center, which integrates its own solar panels and wind generators for energy self-sufficiency.]]

[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] over the entire life cycle of a building is the most important goal of sustainable architecture. [[Architect]]s use many different passive and active techniques to reduce the energy needs of buildings and increase their ability to capture or generate their own energy.&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown"&gt;M. DeKay &amp; G.Z. Brown, Sun Wind &amp; Light, architectural design strategies, 3rd ed. ''Wiley'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One of the keys to exploit local environmental resources and influence energy-related factors such as daylight, solar heat gains and ventilation is the use of [[site analysis]].

===Heating, ventilation and cooling system efficiency===
Numerous passive architectural strategies have been developed over time. Examples of such strategies include the arrangement of rooms or the sizing and orientation of windows in a building,&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown" /&gt; and the orientation of facades and streets or the ratio between building heights and street widths for urban planning.&lt;ref name ="Montavon"&gt;M. Montavon, Optimization of Urban Form by the Evaluation of the Solar Potential, ''EPFL'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An important and [[Cost-effectiveness|cost-effective]] element of an efficient [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC)]] system is a [[Building insulation|well-insulated building]]. A more efficient building requires less heat generating or dissipating power, but may require more ventilation capacity to expel [[indoor air quality|polluted indoor air]].

Significant amounts of energy are flushed out of buildings in the water, air and [[compost]] streams. [[Commercial off-the-shelf|Off the shelf]], on-site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture [[Waste-to-energy|energy from waste]] hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water or fresh air. Recapture of energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]].

HVAC systems are powered by motors. [[Copper]], versus other metal conductors, helps to improve the electrical energy efficiencies of motors, thereby enhancing the sustainability of electrical building components. 

Site and building orientation have some major effects on a building's HVAC efficiency.

[[Passive solar building design]] allows buildings to harness the energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any [[active solar]] mechanisms such as [[photovoltaic cell]]s or [[solar hot water|solar hot water panels]]. Typically [[passive solar]] building designs incorporate materials with high [[thermal mass]] that retain heat effectively and strong [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] that works to prevent heat escape. Low energy designs also requires the use of solar shading, by means of awnings, blinds or shutters, to relieve the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling.  In addition, [[low energy building]]s typically have a very low surface area to volume ratio to minimize heat loss. This means that sprawling multi-winged building designs (often thought to look more "organic") are often avoided in favor of more centralized structures. Traditional cold climate buildings such as [[United States|American]] [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] [[saltbox]] designs provide a good historical model for centralized heat efficiency in a small-scale building.

Windows are placed to maximize the input of heat-creating light while minimizing the loss of heat through glass, a poor insulator. In the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]] this usually involves installing a large number of south-facing windows to collect direct sun and severely restricting the number of north-facing windows. Certain window types, such as double or triple glazed [[insulated glazing|insulated windows]] with gas filled spaces and [[Low-emissivity|low emissivity (low-E)]] coatings, provide much better insulation than single-pane glass windows. Preventing excess solar gain by means of solar shading devices in the summer months is important to reduce cooling needs.  [[Deciduous trees]] are often planted in front of windows to block excessive sun in summer with their leaves but allow light through in winter when their leaves fall off.  Louvers or light shelves are installed to allow the sunlight in during the winter (when the sun is lower in the sky) and keep it out in the summer (when the sun is high in the sky).  [[Coniferous]] or [[Evergreen|evergreen plants]] are often planted to the north of buildings to shield against cold north winds.

In colder climates, heating systems are a primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one of the largest single energy drains in buildings.

In warmer climates where cooling is a primary concern, passive solar designs can also be very effective. Masonry [[building material]]s with [[high thermal mass]] are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures of night throughout the day. In addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures in order to maximize surface area and heat loss.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Buildings are often designed to capture and channel existing winds, particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby [[Body of water|bodies of water]]. Many of these valuable strategies are employed in some way by the [[Vernacular architecture|traditional architecture]] of warm regions, such as south-western mission buildings.

In climates with four seasons, an integrated energy system will increase in efficiency: when the building is well insulated, when it is sited to work with the forces of nature, when heat is recaptured (to be used immediately or stored), when the heat plant relying on [[fossil fuel]]s or electricity is greater than 100% efficient, and when [[renewable energy]] is used.

====Solar panels====
{{Main|Solar PV}}
[[Active solar]] devices such as [[photovoltaic]] [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s help to provide sustainable electricity for any use. Electrical output of a solar panel is dependent on orientation, efficiency, latitude, and climate—solar gain varies even at the same latitude. Typical efficiencies for commercially available PV panels range from 4% to 28%. The low efficiency of certain photovoltaic panels can significantly affect the payback period of their installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=shamilton |url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/Moduleprices.htm |title=Module Pricing |publisher=Solarbuzz |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low efficiency does not mean that solar panels are not a viable energy alternative. In Germany for example, Solar Panels are commonly installed in residential home construction.

Roofs are often angled toward the sun to allow photovoltaic panels to collect at maximum efficiency. In the northern hemisphere, a true-south facing orientation maximizes yield for solar panels. If true-south is not possible, solar panels can produce adequate energy if aligned within 30° of south. However, at higher latitudes, winter energy yield will be significantly reduced for non-south orientation.

To maximize efficiency in winter, the collector can be angled above horizontal Latitude +15°. To maximize efficiency in summer, the angle should be Latitude -15°. However, for an annual maximum production, the angle of the panel above horizontal should be equal to its latitude.&lt;ref&gt;G.Z. Brown, Mark DeKay. Sun, Wind &amp; Light. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind turbines====
{{Main|Wind power}}
The use of undersized wind turbines in energy production in sustainable structures requires the consideration of many factors. In considering costs, small wind systems are generally more expensive than larger wind turbines relative to the amount of energy they produce. For small wind turbines, maintenance costs can be a deciding factor at sites with marginal wind-harnessing capabilities. At low-wind sites, maintenance can consume much of a small wind turbine's revenue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brower, Michael; ''Cool Energy, The Renewable Solution to Global Warming''; Union of Concerned Scientists, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines begin operating when winds reach 8&amp;nbsp;mph, achieve energy production capacity at speeds of 32-37&amp;nbsp;mph, and shut off to avoid damage at speeds exceeding 55&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The energy potential of a wind turbine is proportional to the square of the length of its blades and to the cube of the speed at which its blades spin. Though wind turbines are available that can supplement power for a single building, because of these factors, the efficiency of the wind turbine depends much upon the wind conditions at the building site. For these reasons, for wind turbines to be at all efficient, they must be installed at locations that are known to receive a constant amount of wind (with average wind speeds of more than 15&amp;nbsp;mph), rather than locations that receive wind sporadically.&lt;ref&gt;Gipe, Paul; ''Wind Power: Renewable Energy for Farm and Business''; Chelsea Green Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A small wind turbine can be installed on a roof. Installation issues then include the strength of the roof, vibration, and the turbulence caused by the roof ledge. Small-scale rooftop wind turbines have been known to be able to generate power from 10% to up to 25% of the electricity required of a regular domestic household dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article706123.ece The Sunday Times, "Home wind turbines dealt killer blow"], April 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Turbines for residential scale use are usually between 7 feet (2 m) to 25 feet (8 m) in diameter and produce electricity at a rate of 900 watts to 10,000 watts at their tested wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com "Wind turbine, a powerful investment", Rapid City Journal], February 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Building integrated wind turbine performance can be enhanced with the addition of an aerofoil wing on top of a roof mounted turbine.&lt;ref&gt;Factors enhancing aerofoil wings for wind energy harnessing in buildings,7 November 2013 http://bse.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/11/07/0143624413509097.abstract?papetoc&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar water heating====
{{Main|Solar thermal power}}
[[Solar water heater]]s, also called solar domestic hot water systems, can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for a home. They can be used in any climate, and the fuel they use—sunshine—is free.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Solar Water Heaters, March 24, 2009 [http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of solar water systems- active and passive. An active solar collector system can produce about 80 to 100 gallons of hot water per day. A passive system will have a lower capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |title=Solar Water Heaters |publisher=Toolbase.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415230351/http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two types of circulation, direct circulation systems and indirect circulation systems. Direct circulation systems loop the domestic water through the panels. They should not be used in climates with temperatures below freezing. Indirect circulation loops glycol or some other fluid through the solar panels and uses a heat exchanger to heat up the domestic water.

The two most common types of collector panels are Flat-Plate and Evacuated-tube. The two work similarly except that evacuated tubes do not convectively lose heat, which greatly improves their efficiency (5%-25% more efficient). With these higher efficiencies, Evacuated-tube solar collectors can also produce higher-temperature space heating, and even higher temperatures for absorption cooling systems.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"&gt;John Randolph and Gilbert M. Masters, 2008. "Energy for Sustainability: Technology, Planning, Policy," Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric-resistance water heaters that are common in homes today have an electrical demand around 4500&amp;nbsp;kW·h/year. With the use of solar collectors, the energy use is cut in half. The up-front cost of installing solar collectors is high, but with the annual energy savings, payback periods are relatively short.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

====Heat pumps====
Air-source heat pumps (ASHP) can be thought of as reversible air conditioners. Like an air conditioner, an ASHP can take heat from a relatively cool space (e.g. a house at 70&amp;nbsp;°F) and dump it into a hot place (e.g. outside at 85&amp;nbsp;°F). However, unlike an air conditioner, the condenser and evaporator of an ASHP can switch roles and absorb heat from the cool outside air and dump it into a warm house.

Air-source heat pumps are inexpensive relative to other heat pump systems. However, the efficiency of air-source heat pumps decline when the outdoor temperature is very cold or very hot; therefore, they are only really applicable in temperate climates.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

For areas not located in temperate climates, ground-source (or geothermal) heat pumps provide an efficient alternative. The difference between the two heat pumps is that the ground-source has one of its heat exchangers placed underground—usually in a horizontal or vertical arrangement. Ground-source takes advantage of the relatively constant, mild temperatures underground, which means their efficiencies can be much greater than that of an air-source heat pump. The in-ground heat exchanger generally needs a considerable amount of area. Designers have placed them in an open area next to the building or underneath a parking lot.

Energy Star ground-source heat pumps can be 40% to 60% more efficient than their air-source counterparts. They are also quieter and can also be applied to other functions like domestic hot water heating.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

In terms of initial cost, the ground-source heat pump system costs about twice as much as a standard air-source heat pump to be installed. However, the up-front costs can be more than offset by the decrease in energy costs. The reduction in energy costs is especially apparent in areas with typically hot summers and cold winters.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

Other types of heat pumps are water-source and air-earth. If the building is located near a body of water, the pond or lake could be used as a heat source or sink. Air-earth heat pumps circulate the building's air through underground ducts. With higher fan power requirements and inefficient heat transfer, Air-earth heat pumps are generally not practical for major construction.

==Sustainable building materials==
{{See also|Green building}}
Some examples of sustainable building materials include recycled [[denim]] or blown-in fiber glass insulation, sustainably harvested wood, [[Trass]], [[Linoleum]],&lt;ref&gt;Duurzaam en Gezond Bouwen en Wonen by Hugo Vanderstadt,&lt;/ref&gt; sheep wool, [[concrete]] (high and ultra high performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1864315,00.html|title=Building Materials: Cementing the Future|first=PETER|last=GUMBEL|date=4 December 2008|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; roman self-healing concrete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6250-6_9|title=Self Healing Materials|first=Henk M.|last=Jonkers|date=23 March 2018|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|pages=195–204|via=link.springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), panels made from paper flakes, baked earth, rammed earth, clay, vermiculite, flax linnen, sisal, seegrass, expanded clay grains, coconut, wood fiber plates, calcium sand stone, locally obtained stone and rock, and [[bamboo]], which is one of the strongest and fastest growing [[woody plant]]s, and non-toxic low-[[Volatile Organic Compound|VOC]] glues and paints. Vegetative cover or shield over building envelopes also helps in the same. Paper which is fabricated or manufactured out of forest wood is supposedly hundred percent recyclable .thus it regenerates and saves almost all the forest wood that it takes during its manufacturing process.

===Recycled materials===

[[File:Discarded dreams 2 of 3.jpg|thumb|Recycling items for building]]
Sustainable architecture often incorporates the use of recycled or second hand materials, such as [[reclaimed lumber]] and [[Copper in architecture|recycled copper]]. The reduction in use of new materials creates a corresponding reduction in [[embodied energy]] (energy used in the production of materials). Often sustainable architects attempt to retrofit old structures to serve new needs in order to avoid unnecessary development.  Architectural salvage and reclaimed materials are used when appropriate. When older buildings are demolished, frequently any good wood is reclaimed, renewed, and sold as flooring. Any good [[dimension stone]] is similarly reclaimed.  Many other parts are reused as well, such as doors, windows, mantels, and hardware, thus reducing the consumption of new goods.  When new materials are employed, green designers look for materials that are rapidly replenished, such as [[bamboo]], which can be harvested for commercial use after only 6 years of growth, [[sorghum]] or wheat straw, both of which are waste material that can be pressed into panels, or [[cork oak]], in which only the outer bark is removed for use, thus preserving the tree.  When possible, building materials may be gleaned from the site itself; for example, if a new structure is being constructed in a wooded area, wood from the trees which were cut to make room for the building would be re-used as part of the building itself.

===Lower volatile organic compounds===

Low-impact building materials are used wherever feasible: for example, insulation may be made from low VOC ([[volatile organic compound]])-emitting materials such as [[Building insulation materials#Cotton batts (Blue Jean)|recycled denim]] or [[cellulose insulation]], rather than the [[building insulation materials]] that may contain carcinogenic or toxic materials such as formaldehyde. To discourage insect damage, these alternate insulation materials may be treated with [[boric acid]]. Organic or milk-based paints may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Information on low-emitting materials may be found at www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php [http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php IAQ links] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611163251/http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php |date=2008-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a common fallacy is that "green" materials are always better for the health of occupants or the environment. Many harmful substances (including formaldehyde, arsenic, and asbestos) are naturally occurring and are not without their histories of use with the best of intentions. A study of emissions from materials by the State of California has shown that there are some green materials that have substantial emissions whereas some more "traditional" materials actually were lower emitters. Thus, the subject of emissions must be carefully investigated before concluding that natural materials are always the healthiest alternatives for occupants and for the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Building Emissions Study accessed at [http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/GreenBuilding/Specs/Section01350/METStudy.htm California Integrated Waste Management web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) can be found in any indoor environment coming from a variety of different sources. VOCs have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility, and are suspected of causing [[sick building syndrome]] type symptoms. This is because many VOCs have been known to cause sensory irritation and central nervous system symptoms characteristic to sick building syndrome, indoor concentrations of VOCs are higher than in the outdoor atmosphere, and when there are many VOCs present, they can cause additive and multiplicative effects.

Green products are usually considered to contain fewer VOCs and be better for human and environmental health.   A case study conducted by the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Miami that compared three green products and their non-green counterparts found that even though both the green products and the non-green counterparts both emitted levels of VOCs, the amount and intensity of the VOCs emitted from the green products were much safer and comfortable for human exposure.&lt;ref&gt;James, J.P., Yang, X. Indoor and Built Environment, Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds from Several Green and Non-Green Building Materials: A Comparison, January 2004.[http://ibe.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/14/1/69] Retrieved: 2008-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials sustainability standards===
Despite the importance of materials to overall building sustainability, quantifying and evaluating the sustainability of building materials has proven difficult. There is little coherence in the measurement and assessment of materials sustainability attributes, resulting in a landscape today that is littered with hundreds of competing, inconsistent and often imprecise eco-labels, [[Technical standard|standards]] and [[certifications]].  This discord has led both to confusion among consumers and commercial purchasers and to the incorporation of inconsistent sustainability criteria in larger building certification programs such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]].  Various proposals have been made regarding rationalization of the standardization landscape for sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1944523|title=Toward a Rational Framework for Sustainable Building Materials Standards|first1=Jorge L.|last1=Contreras|first2=Hannah|last2=Roth|first3=Meghan|last3=Lewis|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste management==
Waste takes the form of spent or useless materials generated from households and businesses, construction and demolition processes, and manufacturing and agricultural industries. These materials are loosely categorized as municipal solid waste, construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris, and industrial or agricultural by-products.&lt;ref&gt;John Ringel., University of Michigan, Sustainable Architecture, Waste Prevention [http://www.umich.edu/~nppcpub/resources/compendia/ARCHpdfs/ARCHr&amp;rA.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainable architecture focuses on the on-site use of [[waste management]], incorporating things such as [[grey water]] systems for use on garden beds, and [[composting toilet]]s to reduce sewage. These methods, when combined with on-site food waste composting and off-site recycling, can reduce a house's waste to a small amount of packaging waste. 

==Building placement==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
One central and often ignored aspect of sustainable architecture is building placement. Although the ideal environmental home or office structure is often envisioned as an isolated place, this kind of placement is usually detrimental to the environment. First, such structures often serve as the unknowing frontlines of [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Second, they usually increase the [[energy consumption]] required for transportation and lead to unnecessary auto emissions. Ideally, most building should avoid suburban sprawl in favor of the kind of light [[Urban planning|urban development]] articulated by the [[New Urbanist]] movement. Careful mixed use zoning can make commercial, residential, and light industrial areas more accessible for those traveling by foot, bicycle, or public transit, as proposed in the [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]]. The study of [[Permaculture]], in its holistic application, can also greatly help in proper building placement that minimizes energy consumption and works with the surroundings rather than against them, especially in rural and forested zones.

==Sustainable building consulting==
A sustainable building consultant may be engaged early in the design process, to forecast the sustainability implications of [[building materials]], orientation, glazing and other physical factors, so as to identify a sustainable approach that meets the specific requirements of a project.

Norms and standards have been formalized by performance-based rating systems e.g. [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/?CategoryID=19|title=U.S. Green Building Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Energy Star]] for homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/|title=ENERGY STAR - The Simple Choice for Energy Efficiency|website=www.energystar.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; They define [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] to be met and provide [[Performance metric|metrics]] and testing to meet those benchmarks. It is up to the parties involved in the project to determine the best approach to meet those standards.

==Changing pedagogues==

Critics of the reductionism of modernism often noted the abandonment of the teaching of architectural history as a causal factor. The fact that a number of the major players in the shift away from modernism were trained at Princeton University's School of Architecture, where recourse to history continued to be a part of design training in the 1940s and 1950s, was significant. The increasing rise of interest in history had a profound impact on architectural education. History courses became more typical and regularized. With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture, several PhD programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs, where architectural historians had previously trained. In the US, [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] were the first, created in the mid-1970s, followed by [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Among the founders of new architectural history programs were [[Bruno Zevi]] at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice, Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT, Alexander Tzonis at the [[Architectural Association]], Anthony Vidler at Princeton, [[Manfredo Tafuri]] at the University of Venice, [[Kenneth Frampton]] at [[Columbia University]], and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at [[ETH Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]], “The Disciplinary Dislocations of Architectural History,” ''Journal of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]]'' 58/3 (September 1999), p. 489. See also other articles in that issue by Eve Blau, Stanford Anderson, Alina Payne, Daniel Bluestone, Jeon-Louis Cohen and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “sustainability” in relation to architecture has so far been mostly considered through the lens of building technology and its transformations. Going beyond the technical sphere of “green” design, invention and expertise, some scholars are starting to position architecture within a much broader cultural framework of the [[Nature#Human interrelationship|human interrelationship with nature]]. Adopting this framework allows tracing a rich history of cultural debates about our relationship to nature and the environment, from the point of view of different historical and geographical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Brian|title=Urban Design Ecologies: AD Reader|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-97405-6|pages=220–237|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470974052.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable urbanism and architecture==
Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=The Charter of the New Urbanism|first=|last=taotiadmin|date=20 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There are conflicting ethical, engineering, and political orientations depending on the viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Sustainability - Architecture: between Fuzzy Systems and Wicked Problems |author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Blueprints  | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/blueprints21_1.pdf | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt Green Technology has made its headway into the architectural community, the implementation of given technologies have changed the ways we see and perceive modern day architecture. While green architecture has been proven to show great improvements of ways of living both environmentally and technologically the question remains, is all this sustainable? Many building codes have been demeaned to international standards. "LEED" (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design) has been criticized for exercising flexible codes for building to follow. Contractors do this to save as much money as they possibly can. For example, a building may have solar paneling but if the infrastructure of the building's core doesn't support that over a long period of time improvements would have to be made on a constant basis and the building itself would be vulnerable to disasters or enhancements. With companies cutting paths to make shortcuts with sustainable architecture when building their structures it fuels to the irony that the "sustainable" architecture isn't sustainable at all. Sustainability comes in reference to longevity and effectiveness. 

Ethics and Politics also play into sustainable architecture and its ability to grow in urban environment. Conflicting viewpoints between engineering techniques and environmental impacts still are popular issues that resonate in the architectural community. With every revolutionary technology or innovation there comes criticisms of legitimacy and effectiveness when and how it is being utilized. Many of the criticisms of sustainable architecture do not reflect every aspect of it but rather a broader spectrum across the international community.

The '''Swiss Code of Obligations''' ({{lang-de|Obligationenrecht}}; {{lang-fr|Code des obligations}}; {{lang-it|Diritto delle obbligazioni}}; {{lang-rm|Dretg d'obligaziuns}}) is a portion of the [[Swiss Civil Code]] that regulates [[contract law]] and corporations ([[Aktiengesellschaft]]). It was first adopted in 1911 (effective since 1 January 1912).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/22.html#22 |title=SR 22 Zivilgesetzbuch |type=official website |date=10 September 1916 |language=de, fr, it |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917211747/https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/22.html#22 |archivedate=17 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SR220&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19070042/index.html |title=SR 220 Federal Act on the Amendment of the Swiss Civil Code (Part Five: The Code of Obligations) of 30 March 1911 (Status as of 1 July 2016) |publisher=Swiss Federal Council |type=official website |date=10 September 1916 |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918033026/https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19070042/index.html |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss law is often used to regulate international contracts, as it is deemed neutral with respect to the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Michael E.|last2=Mathias|first2=Scherer|title=Switzerland|url=http://www.lalive.ch/data/publications/mes_msc_analysis_of_construction.pdf|publisher=FIDIC: An Analysis of International Construction Contracts|accessdate=7 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324144832/http://www.lalive.ch/data/publications/mes_msc_analysis_of_construction.pdf|archivedate=24 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no. 220 in the Swiss [[Official Compilation of Federal Legislation]].&lt;ref name="uzhintro"/&gt;

==History==
In Switzerland, [[private law]] was originally left to the individual Swiss cantons, which enacted codifications such as the Zurich Law of Obligations of 1855.&lt;ref name="schwenzer12"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwenzer|first1=Ingeborg|last2=Hachem|first2=Pascal|last3=Kee|first3=Christopher|title=Global Sales and Contract Law|date=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191631054|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1IC24j1IjoC&amp;pg=PA19|page=19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407013757/https://books.google.com/books?id=S1IC24j1IjoC&amp;pg=PA19|archivedate=7 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, the Bernese jurist [[Walther Munzinger]] was assigned a task to draft a unified code of obligations. This early project came to nothing, as it was not yet considered to fall under federal jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="padoa-schippa17"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Padoa-Schioppa|first1=Antonio|title=A History of Law in Europe: From the Early Middle Ages to the Twentieth Century|date=2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316851760|page=557|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRkuDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA557|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407013757/https://books.google.com/books?id=RRkuDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA557|archivedate=7 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the [[Federal Council (Switzerland)|Federal Council]] agreed to the unification of the law of obligations, and Munzinger was put in charge of thee effort.&lt;ref name="padoa-schippa17"/&gt; After Munzinger's death in 1873, the project fell to [[Heinrich Fick]].&lt;ref name="padoa-schippa17"/&gt;

The earliest version of the Code of Obligations was adopted in 1881, and came into force on 1 January 1883.&lt;ref name="bucherch"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bucher|first1=Eugen|title=General remarks on the Swiss law of obligations|url=http://www.eugenbucher.ch/pdf_files/86.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712180250/http://www.eugenbucher.ch/pdf_files/86.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munzinger, the main drafter of the 1881 Code, was influenced by the Dresdner Draft and the work of [[Johann Caspar Bluntschli]].&lt;ref name="smits12"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smits|first1=J. M.|title=Elgar Encyclopedia of Comparative Law, Second Edition|date=2012|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=9781781006108|page=852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_otpAA1EIoC&amp;pg=PA852|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407013757/https://books.google.com/books?id=y_otpAA1EIoC&amp;pg=PA852|archivedate=7 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Code of Obligations was adopted on 30 March 1911,&lt;ref name="bucherch"/&gt; becoming the fifth book of the Swiss Civil Code.&lt;ref name="lawlsu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Overbeck|first1=Alfred E.|title=Some Observations on the Role of the Judge Under the Swiss Civil Code|journal=Louisiana Law Review|date=1977|volume=37|issue=3|accessdate=7 April 2018|url=https://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4302&amp;context=lalrev|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910113129/http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4302&amp;context=lalrev|archivedate=10 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes enacted in 1911 are relatively minor, mostly reflecting the influence of the [[German Civil Code]].&lt;ref name="bucherch"/&gt; The Code of Obligations was drafted in a strikingly understandable style, without many instances of abstract legal terminology, so that it could be readily understood by the common population.&lt;ref name=uof&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebrating 100 Years Swiss Code of Obligations – a brief history of a remarkable codification |url=http://www.unifr.ch/webnews/content/4/attach/4769.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=University of Fribourg |location=Fribourg, Switzerland |accessdate=7 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304212403/http://www.unifr.ch/webnews/content/4/attach/4769.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Company law was subsequently revised in 1938, and the law regulating contracts of employment in 1972.&lt;ref name="lawlsu"/&gt; The Code was revised in 2011, so that in the future requirements for book-keeping and accounting will not depend on a company's legal form, but on its financial size.&lt;ref name=pwc&gt;{{cite web|title=All changes to the Swiss Code of Obligations at a glance|url=http://www.pwc.ch/user_content/editor/files/publ_ass/pwc_changes_swiss_code_of_obligations_1112_e.pdf|publisher=PwC|accessdate=7 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033052/http://www.pwc.ch/user_content/editor/files/publ_ass/pwc_changes_swiss_code_of_obligations_1112_e.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles and influences==
The [[contract law]] of the Code of Obligations is based on [[Roman Law]] traditions, and it was particularly influenced by the [[Pandectist]] school. It was also heavily influenced by the [[Code Napoleon]] of 1804.&lt;ref name="bucherch"/&gt;

Swiss contract law discriminates between general and special contract rules. The general rules are based on legal theory developed in the 17th and 18th centuries, while special rules are based on Roman law traditions.&lt;ref name="bucherch"/&gt; It is divided into a general part, which applies to all contracts, and a special part, which applies to specific types of contracts, such as sales of goods or loans.&lt;ref name=SR220/&gt;

The Code is governed by the principle of the [[freedom to contract]],&lt;ref name="bucherch"/&gt; which includes freedom as to the content and type of the contract, and the freedom of the parties to enter into agreements which are not governed by the special part of the Code.&lt;ref name="uzhintro"/&gt;

One major difference compared to contract law in Common Law jurisdictions is the lack of a requirement of [[consideration]]. The concept of [[frustration of purpose]] is also not part of the Swiss legal tradition.&lt;ref name="bucherch"/&gt;

The first version of the Swiss Code of Obligations influenced parts of the German Civil Code, the [[Law of Taiwan#Civil Code|Chinese Code of Taiwan]] (Book II), the [[Civil Code of the Republic of Korea|Code of South Korea]] (Part III) and the [[Law of Thailand#Private law|Code of Thailand]] (Book II).&lt;ref name="bucherch"/&gt; The [[Turkish civil code (1926)|Turkish Civil Code]], adopted in 1926, is based on the Swiss Civil Code, which also includes the Code of Obligations.&lt;ref name="bucherch"/&gt;

'''The Challenge of Peace: God’s Promise and Our Response''' is a 1983 pastoral letter of the American Catholic bishops addressing the issue of war and peace in a nuclear age.  It reviewed the [[Catholic Church|Catholic Church’s]] teachings about peace and war, reaffirmed the [[Just war theory|“just war” theory]] as the main principles for evaluating the use of military force, acknowledged the legitimacy of nonviolence as an alternative moral framework for individuals, evaluated the current issues in US defense policy, and proposed a series of actions that individuals could undertake.

== Background ==

The bishops decided to take a fresh look at the problems of war and peace at their November 1980 meeting.  This decision was motivated by their concern over a number of developments in [[US-Soviet relations]] and US nuclear weapons policy in recent years.	

The US-USSR détente was under increasing strain from the mid-1970s and ceased altogether after the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979.  Large increases in the Soviet missile force led conservative critics of the policies of the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon]], [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|Ford]] and [[Carter administration|Carter Administrations]] to charge that strategic stability based on nuclear parity and the strategy of [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutual Assured Destruction]] had failed and needed to be replaced by a major increase in American nuclear forces such that the US would have the capacity to fight an extended nuclear war.  Carter’s Secretary of Defense [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]] announced a shift in US strategy to denial of the Soviet Union of having any capacity to initiate a nuclear war and win.  New weapon systems were advanced to achieve such nuclear war fighting capability, in particular, the [[Trident (missile)|Trident submarine launched ballistic missile]], the MX ICBM and the ground-launched cruise missile.  The [[SALT II]] arms control treaty was signed in 1979 but the US Senate failed to ratify it.  During the 1980 presidential election campaign, [[Ronald Reagan]] promised that his administration would undertake an acceleration of the build-up of US nuclear forces.  Upon taking office, his administration followed through on that promise.  Upper-level defense officials spoke of attaining the capability to prevail in a nuclear war and advocated an increase in civil defense capabilities to protect much of the public in case of such a war.

The acceleration of the strategic arms race, the hardening of US-Soviet conflict and the rhetoric of nuclear war fighting produced a substantial public reaction.  Huge demonstrations in Europe and the US opposed the increase in nuclear weapons expenditures and deployments.  A movement for a “freeze” in the nuclear arms race quickly gained support in the Western nations.  Several studies carefully and exhaustively detailed the catastrophic consequences of any large scale use of nuclear weapons in order to refute the idea that nuclear war could be survived, much less won.

In response, at their 1980 annual meeting [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]] decided to undertake a review of Catholic teaching on war and peace as it would pertain to contemporary issues of nuclear deterrence, nuclear strategy and the deployment of various weapons systems.

Archbishop John Roach, President of the NCCB, appointed an ad hoc committee to undertake such a study.  The five members were [[Joseph Bernardin]], who chaired the committee, [[John O'Connor (cardinal)|John O’Connor]], [[Thomas Gumbleton]], [[Daniel Patrick Reilly|Daniel Reilly]] and [[George Avis Fulcher|George Fulcher]].  O’Connor was Auxiliary Bishop of the Military Ordinate (that is, the chaplains serving the armed forces) and would be sympathetic to arguments supportive of the military.  Gumbleton was a prominent member of Pax Christi USA, a Catholic peace organization; he would bring to the committee a perspective critical of military programs.  Reilly and Fulcher were chosen because they had not previously committed themselves to positions on the issues before the committee.  In addition, two leaders of ordained religious orders were appointed to participate in the work and discussions of the committee, but without a vote.  They were Father Richard Warner and Sister Juliana Casey.

The committee was assisted by two staff members and a consultant.  One staff member was Fr. J. Bryan Hehir. He had earned a doctorate in Applied Theology at Harvard University in 1977. At Harvard he had studied under Professor [[Stanley Hoffmann]], a prominent international relations scholar. Hehir previously had been appointed to the Vatican delegations to the UN General Assembly in 1973 and to the UN Special Session on Disarmament in 1978.  At the time of his appointment to the committee’s staff, he had been Director of the Office of International Affairs of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops since 1973. The second staff member was Ed Doherty, a former Foreign Service Officer who had been a staff member of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. The consultant was Bruce M. Russett, a Professor of Political Science at Yale University and a prominent international relations scholar.

The committee prepared the pastoral letter in three drafts spread out over 2.5 years.  In preparing the first draft, they interviewed many experts in nuclear strategy, including former Secretaries of Defense [[James R. Schlesinger|Schlesinger]] and Brown, former arms control negotiator [[Gerard C. Smith|Gerard Smith]], and Reagan Administration officials [[Lawrence Eagleburger]] (Undersecretary of State), [[Alexander Haig]] (Secretary of State), [[Caspar Weinberger]] (Secretary of Defense) and Eugene Rostow (Director of the Policy Planning Staff, Department of State).  Each of the first two drafts was extensively discussed at the bishops’ annual meetings in 1981 and 1982 respectively.  Additional feedback arose because of the public nature of the process.  Each draft got much press coverage and its contents were vigorously critiqued in the mass media.  Also, prominent Catholic members of the Reagan Administration wrote letters to the committee seeking to adjust its thinking on policy matters. 
 
	The third draft was considered at an ad hoc meeting of the bishops in Chicago, May 1–3, 1983.  After adopting many amendments, the bishops approved the letter by a vote of 238 in favor and 9 opposed.

== Content==

The pastoral letter contains an introduction, four main sections and a summary.

=== First Section ===
The first section summarizes foundational ideas about the authority of Catholic bishops to teach about matters of war and peace and about the morality of war and peace.  It reaffirms traditional Catholic teachings of a strong presumption against war while allowing it when necessary and effectual for preserving a just peace that preserves fundamental human rights and dignity.  In particular, it defends a nation’s legitimate to self-defense against attack while asserting the right of individuals to choose non-violent means of resisting aggression.  The legitimate right of self-defense is elaborated by the enunciation of the criteria for war to be considered just.

=== Second Section ===
The second section evaluates nuclear weapons in light of just war principles.   Its main points hold that attacks directed at an enemy’s population always is morally repugnant; that nuclear war may never be initiated; that limited use of nuclear weapons is likely to become unlimited; and that nuclear deterrence is morally acceptable as an interim position provided that effective steps are taken to disarm nuclear arsenals, but targeting populations centers as part of a deterrent posture violates moral principles; that nuclear arsenals may not exceed what is sufficient for deterrence; and that there should be an immediate “freeze” of nuclear arsenals and programs followed by a comprehensive nuclear test ban.

=== Third Section ===
The third section looks at the broader problem of war in the contemporary world.  It asserts that the only just cause for use of force in the modern world is self-defense or defense of those who are under attack and it cautions against any use of force could well escalate to the point that its destruction was disproportionate to the just cause that motivated it.  It calls for increased commitment to diplomatic solutions to the problems among nations, in particular those in the areas of arms control and disarmament, and for a strengthening of the United Nations so that it can protect the security of its members.  It reaffirms the legitimacy of developing non-violent means for conflict resolution.

=== Fourth Section ===
The fourth section provides guidance to the members of the Catholic Church in America about how to implement the guidance in the letter.

{{Toryism}}

A '''Tory''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔː|r|i}}) is a person who holds a [[political philosophy]], known as '''Toryism''', based on a British version of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism and conservatism]], which upholds the supremacy of social order as it has evolved throughout history. The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase "God, King, and Country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Ball|title=Portrait of a Party: The Conservative Party in Britain 1918–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZQeAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|year=2013|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tories generally advocate [[monarchism]], are usually of a [[high church]] [[Church of England|Anglican]] religious heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L. Sachs|title=The Transformation of Anglicanism: From State Church to Global Communion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ARx1B_pbhcC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Charmley|title=A history of conservative politics since 1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MUUAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are opposed to the [[liberalism]] of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig faction]]. 

The philosophy originates from the [[Cavalier]] faction, a [[royalist]] group during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|English Civil War]]. The [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] political faction that emerged in 1681 was a reaction to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]]-controlled Parliaments that succeeded the [[Cavalier Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/whigstories/|title=Whigs and Tories|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|website=parliament.uk|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has exponents in other parts of the former [[British Empire]], such as the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] of [[British America]], who opposed American secession during the [[American War of Independence]]. The loyalists that fled to [[the Canadas]] at the end of the American Revolution, the [[United Empire Loyalists]], formed the support base for political cliques in [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]]. Toryism remains prominent in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, particularly in [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], and the [[politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. Several [[Conservatism|Conservative]] parties in the Commonwealth realms, along with their party members, continue to be referred to as Tories.

The term Tory is used regardless of whether they are traditionalists or not. Adherents to traditional Toryism in contemporary times are referred to as [[High Tory|High Tories]]. In Canada, the terms [[Blue Tory]] and [[Red Tory]] have been used to describe the two different factions of the federal and provincial Conservative/Progressive Conservative parties in Canada. In addition, [[Pink Tory]] is used in Canadian politics as a pejorative term to describe a member of the Conservative/Progressive Conservative party who is perceived as liberal.

== History ==
[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 058.jpg|upright|thumb|Royalist supporters, such as the [[Cavaliers]], were referred to as tories during the [[Interregnum (1649–1660)|Interregnum]] and [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period in Great Britain.]]
The word "Tory" derives from the [[Middle Irish]] word ''tóraidhe''; modern [[Irish language|Irish]] ''tóraí''; modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Tòraidh'': [[outlaw]], robber or brigand, from the Irish word ''tóir'', meaning "pursuit", since outlaws were "pursued men".&lt;ref&gt;Entry for "Tory" from Websters New World Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus, version 2.0 for PC, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=Tory&amp;gwp=16 Tory: Definition] Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt; The term was initially applied in Ireland to the isolated bands of guerrillas resisting [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s nine-month [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|1649–1650 campaign in Ireland]], who were allied with [[Cavalier|Royalists]] through treaty with the Parliament of Confederate Ireland, signed at [[Kilkenny]] in January 1649;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecnj.com/review/2009/062509/books062509_01.html?headline=Evil_Oliver%E2%80%99s_legacy_of_enduring_hate|title=Evil Oliver’s legacy of enduring hate|work=Camden New Journal|publisher=New Journal Enterprises|date=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later to dispossessed Catholics in [[Ulster]] following the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean J. Connolly ''Oxford Companion to Irish History'', entry on Tory p498&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used to refer to a [[Rapparee]] and later applied to [[Confederate Ireland|Confederates]] or [[Cavalier]]s in arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Second Edition 1989) "1. a. In the 17th c., one of the dispossessed Irish, who became outlaws, subsisting by plundering and killing the English settlers and soldiers; a bog-trotter, a rapparee; later, often applied to any Irish Papist or Royalist in arms. Obs. exc. Hist."&lt;/ref&gt; The term was thus originally a term of abuse, "an Irish rebel", before being adopted as a political label in the same way as "[[Whigs (British political party)#Name etymology|Whig]]".

Towards the end of Charles II's reign (1660–1685) there was some debate about whether or not his brother, James, Duke of York, should be allowed to succeed to the throne. "Whigs", originally a reference to Scottish cattle-drovers (stereotypically radical anti-Catholic [[Covenanter]]s), was the abusive term directed at those who wanted to exclude James on the grounds that he was a Roman Catholic. Those who were not prepared to exclude James were labelled "[[Abhorrers]]" and later "Tories". [[Titus Oates]] applied the term "Tory", which then signified an Irish robber, to those who would not believe in his [[Popish Plot]] and the name gradually became extended to all who were supposed to have sympathy with the Catholic Duke of York.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCarthy, ''A History of the Four Georges'', Volume I (of 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

The suffix -ism was quickly added to both "Whig" and "Tory" to make [[Whiggism]] and Toryism, meaning the principles and methods of each faction. 

===Canada===
{{Main article|Conservatism in Canada}}
{{See also|Upper Canada Tories|Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942)}}
The term Tory was first used to designate the pre-[[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] British ruling classes of [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], known as the [[Family Compact]] and the [[Château Clique]], an elite within the governing classes and often members within a section of society known as the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s. The United Empire Loyalists were [[Loyalists (American Revolution)|American loyalists]] who resettled in British North America during or after the [[American Revolutionary War]].
[[File:Tory Refugees by Howard Pyle.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalist]] refugees on their way to [[the Canadas]] during the [[American Revolution]]. The loyalists helped establish the base of support for political cliques in the Canadas, locally referred to as Tories.]]
In post-Confederation Canada, the terms "[[Red Tory]]" and "[[Blue Tory]]" have long been used to describe the two wings of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] and previously the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] (PC) parties. The dyadic tensions originally arose out of the 1854 political union of British-Canadian Tories, French-Canadian traditionalists and the [[Monarchism|monarchist]] and loyalist leaning sections of the emerging commercial classes at the time—many of whom were uncomfortable with the pro-American and [[Annexation movements of Canada|annexationist tendencies]] within the liberal [[Clear Grits]]. Tory strength and prominence in the political culture was a feature of life in [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Ontario]] and [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;James Farney, and David Rayside, eds. ''Conservatism in Canada'' (University of Toronto Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, the factions within Canadian Toryism were associated with either the urban business elites, or with rural traditionalists from the country's hinterland. A "Red Tory" is a member of the more moderate wing of the party (in the manner of [[John Farthing]] and [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]]). They are generally unified by their adherence to British traditions in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Heath Macquarrie, ''Red Tory blues: a political memoir'' (University of Toronto Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the course of Canadian history, the Conservative Party was generally controlled by MacDonaldian Tory elements, which in Canada meant an adherence to the English-Canadian traditions of Monarchy, Empire-Commonwealth, parliamentary government, nationalism, protectionism, social reform and eventually acceptance of the necessity of the welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Smith, ''Rogue Tory: The Life and Legend of John G. Diefenbaker'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the Progressive Conservative Party was a Keynesian-consensus party. With the onset of [[stagflation]] in the 1970s, some Canadian Tories came under the influence of neo-liberal developments in Great Britain and the United States, which highlighted the policies for privatization and supply-side interventions. In Canada, these tories have been labeled [[neoconservatism|neoconservatives]]—which has a somewhat different connotation in the United States. By the early 1980s, there was no clear neoconservative in the Tory leadership cadre, but [[Brian Mulroney]] (who became leader in 1983) eventually came to adopt many policies from the [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] governments.&lt;ref&gt;Tomos Dafydd Davies, "'A tale of two Tories?': the British and Canadian Conservative Parties and the'National Question'. The cases of Wales and Quebec." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Mulroney took the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] further in this direction, with policy initiatives in the areas of deregulation, privatization, free-trade and a consumption tax called the [[Goods and services tax (Canada)|Goods and services tax]] (GST), many traditionally-minded Tories became concerned that a political and cultural schism was occurring within the party.

The 1986 creation of the [[Reform Party of Canada]] attracted some of the neo-liberals and social conservatives away from the Tory party and as some of the neoconservative policies of the Mulroney government proved unpopular, some of the provincial-rights elements moved towards Reform as well. In 1993, Mulroney resigned rather than fight an election based on his record after almost nine years in power. This left the Progressive Conservatives in disarray and scrambling to understand how to make Toryism relevant in provinces such as [[Quebec]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]] that had never had a strong tory tradition and political culture.
[[File:Stephen Harper G8 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stephen Harper]], 22nd [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and former leader of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. The Party is colloquially called the Tories in Canada.]]
Thereafter in the 1990s, the Progressive Conservatives were a small party in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and could only exert legislative pressure on the government through their power in the [[Senate of Canada]]. Eventually, through death and retirements, this power waned. [[Joe Clark]] returned as leader, but the schism with the Reformers effectively watered down the combined Blue and Red Tory vote in Canada.

By the late 1990s, there was talk of the necessity of uniting the right in Canada, to deter further Liberal majorities. Many tories—both red and blue—opposed such moves, while others took the view that all would have to be pragmatic if there was any hope of reviving a strong party system. The [[Canadian Alliance]] party (as the Reform Party had become) and some leading tories came together on an informal basis to see if they could find common ground. While Progressive Conservative Leader Joe Clark rebuffed the notion, the talks moved ahead and eventually in December 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative parties voted to rejoin into a new party called the Conservative Party of Canada.

After the merger of the Progressive Conservatives with the Canadian Alliance in 2003, there was debate as to whether the "Tory" appellation should survive at the federal level. Although it was widely believed that some Alliance members would take offence to the term, it was officially accepted by the newly merged party during the [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004|2004 leadership convention]]. [[Stephen Harper]], former leader of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] and Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015, regularly refers to himself as a Tory and has suggested that the new party is a natural evolution of the conservative political movement in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Marland, and Tom Flanagan. "Brand New Party: Political Branding and the Conservative Party of Canada." ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' (2013) 46#4 pp: 951–972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura Devaney,  "The Unite the Right Movement and the Brokerage of Social Conservative Voices Within the New Conservative Party of Canada." ''The Agora''  3.2 (2013): 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Dissident Red Tories who were against the merger went on to form the [[Progressive Canadian Party]].

===New Zealand===
The [[New Zealand National Party]] has been labelled Tories for many years, Some believe the name was brought to New Zealand by British immigrants who have likened the National party to the British Conservative party.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In New Zealand using the term Tory to describe the National party has taken a derogatory meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/national-party|title=National Party – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018|reason=Can't find statement in source}}

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
{{See also|Tories (British political party)}}
[[File:John Belasyse (Bellasis), 1st Baron Belasyse of Worlaby by Gilbert Jackson.jpg|upright|thumb|[[John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse|Lord Belasyse]] was the second Tory to lead a Ministry in Great Britain.]]
The [[Tories (British political party)|Tory political faction]] originally emerged within the [[Parliament of England]] to uphold the legitimist rights of [[James II]] to succeed his brother [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the thrones of the three kingdoms. James became a Roman Catholic at a time when the state institutions were fiercely independent from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]—this was an issue for the [[Exclusion Crisis]] supporting Patricians, the political heirs to the nonconformist [[Roundhead]]s and [[Covenanter]]s. During the Exclusion Crisis, the word Tory was applied in [[Kingdom of England]] as a nickname to the opponents of the bill, called the [[Abhorrers]]. The word "Tory" had connotations of [[Papist]] and [[outlaw]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/humanrights/documents/glossary.htm Human Rights - Glossary] The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt; derived from its previous use in Ireland. 

There were two Tory ministries after James II came to the throne: the first led by the [[Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], the second by [[John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse|Lord Belasyse]]. A significant faction took part in the [[Glorious Revolution|ousting of James II]] with the Whigs to defend the [[Church of England]] and definitive [[protestantism]]. A large but dwindling faction of Tories continued to support James in exile and his Stuart heirs to the throne, especially in 1714 after the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], the first Hanoverian monarch. Although only a minority of Tories gave their adhesion to the Jacobite risings, this was used by the Whigs to discredit the Tories and paint them as traitors. After the advent of the Prime Ministerial system under the Whig [[Robert Walpole]], [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]]'s premiership in the reign of [[George III]] marked a revival. Under the [[Corn Laws]] (1815–1846) a majority of Tories supported [[protectionism|protectionist]] [[agrarianism]] with tariffs being imposed at the time for higher food prices, self-sufficiency and enhanced wages in rural employment. 

English Tories from the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]] up until the [[Reform Act 1832]] were characterised by strong [[Monarchism|monarchist]] tendencies, support for the [[Church of England]] and hostility to radical reform, while the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory party]] was an actual organisation which held power intermittently throughout the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Feiling, ''The second Tory party, 1714–1832'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservatism]] began to emerge in the late 18th century&amp;mdash;it synthesised [[moderate|moderate Whig]] economic positions and many Tory social values to create a new political philosophy and faction in opposition to the [[French Revolution]]. [[Edmund Burke]] and [[William Pitt the Younger]] led the way in this. [[Interventionism (politics)|Interventionism]] and strong armed forces were to prove a hallmark of Toryism under subsequent Prime Ministers. As a predecessor party of the United Kingdom's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative and Unionist Party]], its members, and the organization continue to be referred to as Tories.

===United States===
{{See also|Loyalist (American Revolution)}}
[[File:KingsMountain DeathOfFerguson Chappel.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the death of British Major [[Patrick Ferguson]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He was shot while commanding Loyalist regulars and [[militia (British Dominions and Crown Colonies)|militia]] at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]].]] 
The term Tory or "Loyalist" was used in the [[American Revolution]] for those who remained loyal to the British Crown. Since early in the 18th century, Tory had described those upholding the right of the King over Parliament. During the war of independence, particularly after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, this use was extended to cover anyone who remained loyal to the British Crown. About 80% of the Loyalists remained in the United States after the war. The 60,000 or so Loyalists who settled in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]], [[the Bahamas]], or returned to Great Britain after the American War of Independence are known as [[United Empire Loyalist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;William Stewart Wallace, ''The United Empire Loyalists: A Chronicle of the Great Migration'' (1920) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9YKAQAAIAAJ online].&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 12, 1798, [[Thomas Jefferson]] described the [[Federalist Party]] as "[a] political Sect [...] believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support, [who] are called federalists, sometimes aristocrats or monocrats, and sometimes Tories, after the corresponding sect in the English Government of exactly the same definition".&lt;ref&gt;letter to John Wise in Francis N. Thorpe, ed "A Letter from Jefferson on the Political Parties, 1798," ''American Historical Review v.3#3 (April 1898) pp 488–89&lt;/ref&gt; However, that was clearly a hostile description by the Federalists' foes of whom Jefferson was one and not a name used by the Federalists themselves.

====Texas Revolution====
In Texas in 1832–1836, support for the [[Texas Revolution]] was not unanimous. The "Tories" were men who supported the Mexican government. The Tories generally were long-term property holders whose roots were outside of the lower south. They typically had little interest in politics and sought conciliation rather than war or they withheld judgment from both sides. The Tories preferred to preserve the economic, political and social gains that they enjoyed as citizens of Mexico and the revolution threatened to jeopardize the security of their world.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Swett Henson, "Tory Sentiment in Anglo-Texan Public Opinion, 1832-1836," ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly,'' July 1986, Vol. 90 Issue 1, pp 1-34&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Civil War====
During the [[American Civil War]], the term "Tory" was used to refer to [[Southern Unionists]] ([[White Southerners]] who stayed loyal to the Union) by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] as a reference to the Loyalists of the American Revolution.

==Current usage==
Tory has become shorthand for a member of the Conservative Party or for the party in general in several [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Some Conservatives call themselves a Tory. The term is common in the media, but deprecated by some media channels. 

"Tory" in Canada typically refers to either a member of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], or the party as a whole. In addition to federal parties, the term Tory has been used in Canada to refer to members of provincial Conservative/Progressive Conservative parties, or the provincial organization as a whole. It is also used to refer to the Conservative Party's predecessor parties, including the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]]. A rump Progressive Conservative caucus continued to sit in the [[Parliament of Canada]] until 2013, when its last sitting member, [[Elaine McCoy]], changed her designations to "Independent". The term is used in contrast to "Grit", a shorthand for the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. [[LGBTory]] is an advocacy group for LGBT supporters of the Conservative Party of Canada and provincial conservative parties.
[[File:Pride London Parade, July 2011 (5963245767).jpg|thumb|Members of [[LGBT+ Conservatives]] with a banner reading LGBTory. The group is the [[LGBT]] wing of the United Kingdom's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].]] 

In the United Kingdom, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative and Unionist Party]], along with its members, are often referred to as "Tory" in the public, with the party frequently getting called the "Tories" by many media outlets. In Scotland, the term "Tory" is used predominantly in a derogatory way to describe members and supporters of the Conservative Party, or to accuse other parties of being insufficiently opposed to that party. For example, members and supporters of the [[Scottish Labour Party]] (especially those from the "[[Blairism|Blairite]]" faction) may be referred to as "Red Tories" by traditional Labour members and advocates of an [[independent Scotland]]. Similarly, Labour supporters have referred to [[Scottish National Party]] members and supporters as being "Tartan Tories".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Australia, "Tory" is occasionally used as a pejorative term by members of the [[Australian Labor Party]] to refer to conservative members of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] and [[National Party of Australia]] parties (who are in [[Coalition (Australia)|a long-standing coalition]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Sparkes|first=A. W.|title=Talking Politics: A Wordbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TvFvphrjMAC&amp;pg=PA203|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-02211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is not used anywhere near as often as in the UK and Canada, and it is rare – though not unheard of – for members of those parties to self-describe as "Tories". Chief Justice [[Garfield Barwick]] titled his memoir ''A Radical Tory''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21087548?q&amp;versionId=45140417 A Radical Tory], Trove&lt;/ref&gt; A moderate faction of the [[Australian Greens]] has been pejoratively dubbed the "Tree Tories" by the hard left faction.&lt;ref&gt;''Still, the pair have aligned themselves with the "eastern bloc" or "watermelon" faction (green on the outside, red in the middle) that dismisses environmentally-minded, middle class Greens like Di Natale as "tree tories".''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17109">The '''Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi''' (once commonly spelled '''Unkiar Skelessi''', and translating to The Treaty of "the Royal Pier" or "the Sultan's Pier") was a [[treaty]] signed between the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] on July 8, 1833, following the military aid of Russia against [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mehmed Ali]] that same year. The treaty brought about an alliance between the two powers, as well as a guarantee that the Ottomans would close the [[Dardanelles]] to any foreign warships if the Russians requested such action. The treaty would have significant consequences regarding the Ottoman Empire's foreign relations, especially with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]], as the terms of the treaty worried the other great powers of Europe.

==Background==
Mehmed Ali, ostensibly only a [[vassal]] of the Ottoman Empire, was seeking to increase his personal power and gain control over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], and [[Arabia]]. In order to justify the assault on his liege, he used the pretext of a personal dispute with the pasha of Acre.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire'', (New York: William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1977), 467.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Egyptian advance===
In late 1831, he sent his newly reformed army towards Syria, under the command of his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], resulting in the [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833)]] against the [[Ottoman sultan]], [[Mahmud II]]. Ibrahim's forces quickly captured Gaza and Jerusalem, and successfully laid siege to Acre before marching on to Aleppo and Damascus, “winning successive battles against Mahmud’s new troops, which were not yet a match for so practiced an enemy”; by June 18, 1832, Ibrahim had managed to seize control of all of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, 467.&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, the Egyptian army halted while Mehmed Ali attempted to negotiate with the Sultan. However, once it became clear that diplomacy had failed, Ibrahim led his forces into Anatolia itself where he rallied opponents of the Sultan and captured the city of [[Konya]] on November 21.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford J. Shaw and Ezel Kural Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Volume II: Reform, Revolution, and Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975'', (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1977), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmud II dispatched a large army to try to halt the Egyptian advance, but it was crushed in the [[Battle of Konya]] on December 21 and “in a single blow [opened] the way for a complete conquest of Anatolia.”&lt;ref&gt;Shaw and Shaw, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim continued his advance until he was within striking distance of [[Istanbul]], the Ottoman capital.

===Response===
Panic spread through the imperial city as the Egyptian army pushed closer to the seat of Ottoman authority. Mahmud II urgently dispatched pleas for assistance to both Britain and France, but was turned down due to domestic concerns as well as the involvement of both nations in managing the state of affairs after the recently ended [[Belgian Revolution]]. Lord Kinross argues that this left the Sultan no choice but to call upon his former enemy, Russia, for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, 468.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bailey, the response from the Tsar was so positive and swift, that Mahmud II hesitated in accepting, believing it might be a trap.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Edgar Bailey, ''British Policy and the Turkish Reform Movement: A Study in Anglo-Turkish Relations, 1826-1853'', (Cambridge, MA: The Harvard University Printing Office, 1942), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Sultan was willing to welcome any help he could receive, and accepted the Russian offer. The Tsar immediately dispatched a sizeable force of troops to block the potential Egyptian advance on Istanbul. It is unclear exactly how many troops the Tsar sent; Lord Kinross claims it was an army of approximately 18,000 men in total while Bailey suggests it may have been a force more than twice that size of nearly 40,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, 468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the exact size of the Russian host, it was formidable enough to cause Ibrahim to decide to begin negotiating with the Sultan rather than risk a battle with the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the mere presence of Russian troops was enough to halt the Egyptian onslaught.

===European reaction===
The presence of Russian troops so close to the Ottoman capital also worried Britain and France considerably. Seeing this potential threat forced the two nations into action. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British Foreign Secretary, led the effort and brought strong diplomatic pressure “to bear upon the Sultan to insist on the Russian withdrawal, in return for concessions to Mehmed Ali and an Anglo-French guarantee against his further invasion.”&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, 468.&lt;/ref&gt;  Diplomacy was not the only tool they employed however, as both the British and the French dispatched fleets to the Dardanelles.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia H. Aksan, ''Ottoman Wars 1700-1870: An Empire Besieged'', (London: Pearson Education Limited, 2007), 375.&lt;/ref&gt; This action served the dual purpose of coercing the Sultan to accept their demanding proposal, while also threatening the Russians and checking any further military action they might take.

===Consequences of the conflict and intervention===
The Sultan finally submitted, which led to the [[Convention of Kütahya]] in May 1833, which officially granted Mehmed Ali control of Syria, Adana, Tripoli, Crete, and Egypt, though these titles were not guaranteed to be hereditary upon his death.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, 468.&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as this peace was established, the Russians began the process of removing their troops from Ottoman territory. It seemed as though things had come to a reasonable end, but soon after the withdrawal of all Russian troops, the British government learned that two days prior to the completion of this evacuation, the Sultan Mahmud II had signed the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi with [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization alarmed British leaders, as it seemed to indicate that Russia now held an enormous amount of influence over the Ottoman Empire and its affairs.

==Treaty==
The quickly negotiated treaty, signed on July 8, 1833, consisted primarily of a defensive alliance between Russia and the Ottoman Empire which was to initially last for eight years, and included pledges to discuss matters of security with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Aksan, 375.&lt;/ref&gt; This bound the two empires together in a significant way and seemed to give the Russians the opportunity for future military interventions in the Ottoman Empire, effectively making it a protectorate of the Russian state. While this portion of the treaty was itself important, the most significant feature was its secret article.

===Secret Article===
[[File:Turkish Strait disambig.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Bosporus]] (red), the [[Dardanelles]] (yellow), and the [[Sea of Marmara]] in between, are known collectively as the "[[Turkish Straits]]". Modern borders are shown.]]
This article called for an alternative to Ottoman military support per the terms of the treaty; rather than sending troops and arms in support of their Russian allies, the Ottomans would close the Dardanelles to all foreign warships at Russia's command.  Below is the full text of the secret article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“In virtue of one of the clauses of Article I of the Patent Treaty of Defensive Alliance concluded 	between the Imperial Court of Russia and the Sublime Porte, the two High Contracting Parties, 	are bound to afford to each other, mutually substantial aid, and the most efficacious assistance, for the safety of their respective dominions.  Nevertheless, His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, wishing to spare the Sublime Ottoman Porte the expense and inconvenience which might be occasioned to it by affording such substantial aid, will not ask for that aid, if circumstances should place the Sublime Porte under the obligation of furnishing it.  The Sublime Porte, in place of aid which it is bound to furnish in case of need according to the principal of reciprocity of the Patent Treaty, shall confine its action in favour of the Imperial Court of Russia to closing the Strait of the Dardanelles, that is to say, to not allowing any foreign vessel of war to enter therein, under any pretext whatsoever.”&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interpretations of the Secret Article===
This article was highly controversial and its true meaning is still a matter of debate. There is disagreement over what exactly the terms of the closing of the Dardanelles would be. Some interpret the lack of any specific mention of Russian warships to mean that their ships were not included with those to be barred passage through the Dardanelles. Others point out that this same lack of any specific provision for Russian warships indicates that the treaty did not grant them any special rights. There is also debate over what is meant by the phrase “in case of need.” Some believe this meant only while Russia was at war, while others interpreted it to mean that the Dardanelles would be closed to foreign warships at all times. These speculations began when the British discovered the full scope of the treaty. The secret article was not officially communicated to the British government until January 16, 1834, but they were aware of it several months before that point.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The British interpreted the treaty and its secret clause to have a potentially great impact on their relations with Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and the established balance of power. Hale argues that Lord Palmerston was stung into action “since he mistakenly believed that [the treaty’s] secret clause had given Russian warships free passage through the straits.”&lt;ref&gt;William Hale, ''Turkish Foreign Policy 1774-2000'', (London: Frank Cass Publishers, 2000), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Palmerston and the rest of the British government saw that “while the immediate advantages of the treaty were slight, the ‘potential advantage to Russia’ was very great, in that ‘in accustoming the Porte to the position of vassal’ Russia had ‘prepared the way for a repetition of the 1833 expedition.’”&lt;ref&gt;Bailey 53.&lt;/ref&gt; They feared that this potential for future Russian intervention in the Ottoman Empire would threaten British connections with India and trade in the Near East as a whole, though as Bailey puts it, “The Foreign Secretary’s immediate concern, however, was the problem of the Straits.”&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of the treaty was to shape British foreign policy towards the Ottoman Empire for decades to come.

==Consequences of the Treaty==
According to Bailey, the signing of the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi was what fully awakened Britain to “the importance of the Ottoman Empire’s geographical, political, and economic position in Europe.”&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term, the British protested the treaty, claiming that it violated the [[Treaty of the Dardanelles|Anglo-Ottoman Treaty of 1809]], which set forth terms that no foreign warship would be allowed to enter the straits. Their formal protest concluded “if the stipulations of that treaty (Unkiar Skelessi) should hereafter lead to the armed interference of Russia in the internal affairs of Turkey, the British government will hold itself at liberty to act upon such an occasion, in any manner which the circumstances of the moment may appear to require.”&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The French also issued a similar statement regarding their concerns about possible Russian military interference. These two statements were indicative of how seriously the terms of the treaty were taken by the Western powers.

In the longer term, the British became convinced that a different approach was needed, and committed to a policy that “the Ottoman Empire was to be preserved, supported, reformed, and strengthened.”&lt;ref&gt;Aksan, 375.&lt;/ref&gt; From that point forward, the British, under Palmerston's leadership, took a number of actions to enact this new policy towards the Ottoman Empire. These ranged from increased trade with the Ottomans to a strengthening of the British fleet in the Levant and offers of both military and naval missions to Mahmud II both to aid the Sultan should Mehmed Ali threaten further military action, and “as a gesture to redress Britain’s former neglect.”&lt;ref&gt;Aksan, 375.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While Britain certainly took the most active role, it was not the only European power which took an interest in the Ottoman Empire as a result of this treaty. Not long after the signing of the treaty, Austria and Prussia joined Russia in the [[Münchengrätz Convention]] of September 18, 1833,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3446900565/mnchengrtz-treaty.html http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3446900565/mnchengrtz-treaty.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which committed the powers to opposing further expansion by Mehmed Ali and to “maintain[ing] Ottoman integrity.”&lt;ref&gt;Aksan, 375.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1840, a broader coalition was formed including Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, which agreed to protect the Sultan's government against Mehmed Ali; this agreement, known as the [[Convention of London (1840)]] also required that the Ottomans declare that the straits would be closed to all non-Ottoman warships in peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; European support, specifically that of the British, also aided in the ultimate submission of Mehmet Ali; in an agreement signed in June 1841, he accepted the limitation of his army in exchange for guarantees of hereditary governorship of Egypt for his family.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This marked “the emergence of Britain as a more active player in the Near Eastern power game, and the Ottoman Empire’s main ally for the next 37 years.”&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi had long-lasting effects on the future of the Ottoman Empire, and especially on European outlooks towards that same future.

==End of the Treaty==
It is difficult to say exactly when the treaty ceased to be valid. Other treaties and agreements certainly began to chip away at its terms not long after its signing. The Convention of London (1840) took the first big step by compelling the Ottomans to keep the straits closed to all non-Ottoman warships in peacetime. This helped assuage the British fear that the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi had effectively granted the Russian fleet free passage through the straits and into the Mediterranean. Another step towards nullifying the treaty came in the form of the [[London Straits Convention]] the following year. This agreement barred all warships from entering the straits, save those of allies of the Sultan in wartime. While it may seem that this agreement does not change much, it is important to remember that at this point, Britain was one of the Sultan's allies. Thus, this would allow the British fleet to enter the straits in times of war, eliminating the perceived exclusive right of the Russians to do so. By this point, the most important aspect of the treaty had effectively been negated. Russo-Ottoman relations continued to deteriorate in the following decade, and while it is unclear when the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi was entirely invalidated, it can be said with certainty that the coming of the [[Crimean War]] meant the end of any potential for the continuation of the Russo-Ottoman alliance set out in the treaty.

'''''United States v. Jones''''', 565 U.S. 400 (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Jones|volume=565|page=400|year=2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case which held that installing a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) tracking device on a vehicle and using the device to monitor the vehicle's movements constitutes a search under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].

In 2004 defendant Jones was suspected of [[drug trafficking]]. Police investigators asked for and received a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] to attach a GPS tracking device to the underside of the defendant's car but then exceeded the warrant's scope in both geography and length of time. The Supreme Court justices voted unanimously that this was a "search" under the Fourth Amendment, although they were split 5-4 as to the fundamental reasons behind that conclusion. The majority held that by physically installing the GPS device on the defendant's car, the police had committed a [[trespass]] against Jones' "[[personal effects]]" – this trespass, in an attempt to obtain information, constituted a search ''[[Per se (terminology)#per se|per se]]''.

==Background==

===Police investigation and criminal trial===
Antoine Jones owned a [[nightclub]] in the [[District of Columbia]]; Lawrence Maynard managed the club. In 2004, a joint [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|Metropolitan Police Department]] task force began investigating Jones and Maynard for narcotics violations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#coa|''United States v. Maynard'', Opinion p. 16]] "Jones owned and Maynard managed the "Levels" nightclub in the District of Columbia.  In 2004 an FBI Metropolitan Police Department Safe Streets Task Force began investigating the two for narcotics violations."&lt;/ref&gt;  During the course of the investigation, a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) device was installed on Jones's Jeep Grand Cherokee&lt;ref name=WSJ01/&gt; without a valid warrant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#coa|''United States v. Maynard'', Opinion p. 38]], "The police had obtained a warrant to install the GPS device in D.C. only, but it had expired before they installed it — which they did in Maryland."&lt;/ref&gt; This device tracked the vehicle's movements 24 hours a day for four weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#coa|''United States v. Maynard'', Opinion p. 3]], "...tracking [Jones's] movements 24 hours a day for four weeks (sic) with a GPS device [the police] had installed on his Jeep..."&lt;/ref&gt;  The FBI arrested Jones in late 2005, at which time Jones was represented by criminal defense attorney A. Eduardo Balarezo of Washington, D.C.  Balarezo filed multiple motions on Jones' behalf, including the motion to suppress the GPS data.  This motion formed the basis for Jones' appeals.  The government tried Jones for the first time in late 2006, and after a trial lasting over a month, a federal jury deadlocked on the conspiracy charge and acquitted him of multiple other counts.  The government retried Jones in late 2007, and in January 2008 the jury returned a guilty verdict on one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine and 50 or more grams of [[cocaine]] base.&lt;ref&gt;[[#coa|''United States v. Maynard'', Opinion p. 4]], " the Government filed another superseding indictment charging Jones, Maynard, and a few co-defendants with a single count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine and 50 or more grams of cocaine base.  A joint trial of Jones and Maynard began in November 2007 and ended in January 2008, when the jury found them both guilty. "&lt;/ref&gt;  He was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[[#pet|''United States v. Jones'', Petition for a Writ of Certiorari p. 2]], "respondent was convicted of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841 and 846. The district court sentenced respondent to  ."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal===
Jones argued that his conviction should be overturned because the use of the GPS tracker violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#coa|''United States v. Maynard'', Opinion p. 15-16]] "Jones argues his conviction should be overturned because the police violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches by tracking his movements 24 hours a day for four weeks with a GPS device they had installed on his Jeep without a valid warrant."&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] overturned Jones's conviction, holding that the police action was a search because it violated Jones's "[[expectation of privacy|reasonable expectation of privacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#coa|''United States v. Maynard'', Opinion p. 16]] "As explained below, we hold ''Knotts'' does not govern this case and the police action was a search because it defeated Jones‘s reasonable expectation of privacy."&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Douglas H. Ginsburg]] was joined by Judges [[David S. Tatel]] and [[Thomas B. Griffith]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/vol124_united_states_v%20_maynard.pdf ''Recent Case: D.C. Circuit Deems Warrantless Use of GPS Device an Unreasonable Search''], 124 Harv. L. Rev. 827 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  The D.C. Circuit then denied prosecutors' petition for rehearing ''[[en banc]]'', over the dissent of Chief Judge [[David B. Sentelle]], joined by Judges [[Karen L. Henderson]], [[Janice Rogers Brown]], and [[Brett Kavanaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/vol126_united_states_v_jones.pdf The Supreme Court, 2011 Term — Leading Cases''], 126 Harv. L. Rev. 226 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The court's decision was the subject of significant legal debate.&lt;ref name="Cybercrime Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cybercrimereview.com/2012/11/highlighted-paper-orin-kerr-mosaic.html|title=Highlighted Paper: Orin Kerr, The Mosaic Theory of the Fourth Amendment|date=November 29, 2012|author=Justin P. Webb, Cybercrime Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marquette University Law Review"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/mulr/vol95/iss2/9/|title=Carving Out Notions of Privacy: The Impact of GPS Tracking and Why Maynard is a Move in the Right Direction|journal=Marquette Law Review|volume=95|issue=2|pages=751|date=December 1, 2011|author=Justin P. Webb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Judge [[Richard Posner]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] had reached the opposite conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/united_states_v_garcia.pdf ''Recent Case: Seventh Circuit Holds That GPS Tracking is Not a Search''], 120 Harv. L. Rev. 2230 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2011, the Supreme Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to resolve two questions. The first question, briefed by the parties in their initial petition for certiorari was "Whether the warrantless use of a tracking device on respondent's vehicle to monitor its movements on public streets violated the Fourth Amendment." The second question, which the Court directed the parties to brief in addition to the initial question, was "Whether the government violated respondent's Fourth Amendment rights by installing the GPS tracking device on his vehicle without a valid warrant and without his consent."&lt;ref&gt;[[#dock|''United States v. Jones'', Docket]], Certiorari granted (June 27, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral argument==
{{SCOTUS oral arguments}}
[[United States Solicitor General#Composition of the Office of the Solicitor General|Deputy Solicitor General]] [[Michael Dreeben]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#arg|''United States v. Jones'' (Oral Argument Transcript)]] p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; began his argument for the United States by noting that information revealed to the world (i.e. movement on a public road) is not protected by the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name="United States v p. 3"&gt;[[#arg|''United States v. Jones'' (Oral Argument Transcript)]] p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Dreeben cited ''[[United States v. Knotts]]'' as an example where police were allowed to use a device known as a "beeper" that allows the tracking of a car from a short distance away.&lt;ref name="United States v p. 3"/&gt; Chief Justice Roberts distinguished the current case from ''Knotts'', saying that using a beeper still took "a lot of work" whereas a GPS device allows the police to "sit back in the station ... and push a button whenever they want to find out where the car is."&lt;ref&gt;[[#arg|''United States v. Jones'' (Oral Argument Transcript)]] p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Scalia then directed the discussion to whether installing the device was an unreasonable search. Scalia argued that "when that device is installed against the will of the owner of the car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his effects... against an unreasonable search and seizure."&lt;ref&gt;[[#arg|''United States v. Jones'' (Oral Argument Transcript)]] p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Dreeben argued that it was a trespass, but in ''[[United States v. Karo]]'' there was also a trespass and, according to Dreeben, ''Karo'' held that it "made no difference because the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful interference [with possessions], not to cover all technical trespasses."&lt;ref&gt;[[#arg|''United States v. Jones'' (Oral Argument Transcript)]] p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

During oral argument, Justice Alito stated that people's use of technology is changing what the expectation of privacy is for the courts. "You know, I don't know what society expects and I think it's changing. Technology is changing people's expectations of privacy. Suppose we look forward 10 years, and maybe 10 years from now 90 percent of the population will be using [[social networking]] sites and they will have on average 500 friends and they will have allowed their friends to monitor their location 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through the use of their [[cell phone]]s. Then — what would the expectation of privacy be then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#arg|''United States v. Jones'' (Oral Argument Transcript)]] p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] reminded the government, "What motivated the Fourth Amendment historically was the disapproval, the outrage, that our Founding Fathers experienced with general warrants that permitted police indiscriminately to investigate just on the basis of suspicion, not [[probable cause]], and to invade every possession that the individual had in search of a crime." She then asked, "How is this different?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#arg|''United States v. Jones'' (Oral Argument Transcript)]] p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
[[Image:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority.]]
On January 23, 2012, the Supreme Court held that "the Government's installation of a GPS device on a target's vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle's movements, constitutes a '[[search and seizure|search]]'" under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Majority p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romm|first=Tony|title=Supreme Court: GPS location tracking qualifies as search|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71822.html|publisher=POLITICO.com|accessdate=14 July 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Justices Say GPS Tracker Violated Privacy Rights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/us/police-use-of-gps-is-ruled-unconstitutional.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some news sources have misinterpreted the Court as holding that all GPS data surveillance requires a search warrant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/23/justice/scotus-gps-tracking/index.html|title=Justices rule against police, say GPS surveillance requires search warrant|author=Bill Mears|date=January 23, 2012|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this ruling was much more narrow.

On the one hand, it can be said that all nine justices unanimously considered the police's actions in ''Jones'' to be unconstitutional. Importantly, however, although they reached the same result in the end, they were split 5-4, with the two groups in disagreement as to the fundamental reasons for their conclusion.  Further, the justices were of three different opinions with respect to the breadth of the judgment.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Tom|title=Why Jones is still less of a pro-privacy decision than most thought|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/01/why-jones-is-still-less-of-a-pro-privacy-decision-than-most-thought/|publisher=SCOTUSblog|accessdate= 21 September 2012|date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority opinion===
Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] authored the [[majority opinion]]. He cited a line of cases dating back as far as 1886 to argue that a physical intrusion, or [[trespass]], into a constitutionally-protected area – in an attempt to find something or to obtain information – was the basis, historically, for determining whether a "search" had occurred under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Majority pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scalia conceded that in the years following ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' (1967) – in which electronic eavesdropping on a public telephone booth was held to be a search – the vast majority of search and seizure case law has shifted away from that approach founded on property rights, and towards an approach based on a person's "[[expectation of privacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Majority p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he cited a number of post-''Katz'' cases including ''[[Alderman v. United States]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Alderman v. United States]]'', {{ussc|394|165|1969|pin=180}}. "[W]e [do not] believe that ''Katz'', by holding that the Fourth Amendment protects persons and their private conversations, was intended to withdraw any of the protection which the Amendment extends to the home . . . ."&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Soldal v. Cook County]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Soldal v. Cook County]]'', {{ussc|506|56|1992|pin=64}}. "[''Katz'' established that] property rights are not the sole measure of Fourth Amendment violations. . . . [it did not] snuf[f] out the previously recognized protection for property."&lt;/ref&gt; to argue that the trespassory approach had not been abandoned by the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Majority pp. 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticisms within Alito's concurrence, Scalia emphasized that the Fourth Amendment must provide, at a minimum, the level of protection as it did when it was adopted.  Furthermore, a trespassory test need not exclude a test of the expectation of privacy, which may be appropriate to consider in situations where there was no governmental trespass.&lt;ref&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Majority pp. 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the instant case, the Court concluded, since the Government's installation of a [[GPS]] device onto the defendant's car (his "[[personal effects]]") was a trespass that was purposed to obtain information, then it was a search under the Fourth Amendment.

Having reached the conclusion that this was a search under the Fourth Amendment, the Court declined to examine whether any exception exists that would render the search "reasonable", because the Government had failed to advance that alternate theory in the lower courts.&lt;ref name="Wired20120123"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kravets|first=David|title=Supreme Court Court Rejects Willy-Nilly GPS Tracking|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/scotus-gps-ruling/|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=14 July 2012|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr|first=Orin|title=What Jones Does Not Hold|url=http://www.volokh.com/2012/01/23/what-jones-does-not-hold/|publisher=The Volokh Conspiracy|accessdate=14 July 2012|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also left unanswered was the broader question surrounding the privacy implications of a warrantless use of GPS data ''absent'' a physical intrusion – as might occur, for example, with the electronic collection of GPS data from [[wireless service provider]]s or factory-installed [[vehicle tracking systems|vehicle tracking and navigation services]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein" /&gt;  The Court left this to be decided in some future case, saying,  "It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that question."&lt;ref&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Majority p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurring opinions===

====Justice Sotomayor====
[[Image:Sonia Sotomayor in SCOTUS robe.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Justice Sotomayor was the sole voice against warrantless [[Global Positioning System|GPS surveillance]], whether long- or short-term, both on the basis of property ''and'' privacy rights.]]
Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] was alone in her [[concurring opinion]]. She was the fifth justice to concur with Scalia's opinion, making hers the decisive vote.&lt;ref name="Soto1"&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Sotomayor concurrence, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  "As the majority's opinion makes clear", she noted, "''Katz{{'}}s'' reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test augmented, but did not displace or diminish, the [[Common law|common-law]] trespassory test that preceded it".&lt;ref name="Soto2"&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Sotomayor concurrence, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  She agreed with Alito's [[expectation of privacy]] reasoning with respect to long-term surveillance,&lt;ref name="Soto3" /&gt; but she went a step further, by also disputing the constitutionality of warrantless short-term GPS surveillance as well. Even during short-term monitoring, she reasoned, GPS surveillance can precisely record an individual's every movement, and hence can reveal completely private destinations, like "trips to the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS treatment center, the strip club, the criminal defense attorney, the by-the-hour motel, the union meeting, the mosque, synagogue or church, the gay bar and on and on."&lt;ref name="Soto3"&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Sotomayor concurrence, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Sotomayor added:

{{quote|People disclose the phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellular providers, the URLS that they visit and the e-mail addresses with which they correspond to their Internet service providers, and the books, groceries and medications they purchase to online retailers . . . I would not assume that all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the public for a limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to Fourth Amendment protection.&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 945, 957 (2012) (Sotomayor, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She distinguished ''Knotts'', reminding that ''Knotts'' suggested that a different principle might apply to situations in which every movement was completely monitored for 24 hours.&lt;ref name="Soto4"&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Sotomayor concurrence, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Justice Alito====
[[Image:Samuel Alito official photo.jpg|175x|thumb|Justice Alito and three others concurred, but only on the basis of privacy rights, and only against long-term [[Global Positioning System|GPS surveillance]].]]
In his [[concurring opinion]], Justice Alito wrote with respect to privacy: "Short-term monitoring of a person’s movements on public streets accords with expectations of privacy" but "the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy."&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Jones, 565 U.S., 132 S. Ct. 945, 964 (2012) (Alito, J. concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Alito argued against the majority's reliance on trespass under modern circumstances. Specifically, he argued that the [[common-law]] property-based analysis of a "search" under the Fourth Amendment did not apply to such electronic situations as the one that occurred in this case.&lt;ref&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Alito concurrence, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; He further argued that following the doctrinal changes in ''[[Katz v. United States|Katz]]'', a technical trespass leading to the gathering of evidence was "neither necessary ''nor sufficient'' to establish a constitutional violation".&lt;ref&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Alito concurrence, p. 6, quoting from ''[[United States v. Karo]]'', {{ussc|468|705|1984|pin=713}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice Scalia countered this quote from ''Karo'' (that "[trespass is] neither necessary nor sufficient...") by calling it "irrelevant" – ''Karo'' contemplated a ''seizure'', not a ''search'', and trespass has no bearing on the constitutionality of a seizure. [[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Majority p. 7, note 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In his concurring opinion Alito outlined that long-term surveillance can reveal everything about a person:

{{quote|Prolonged surveillance reveals types of information not revealed by short-term surveillance, such as what a person does repeatedly, what he does not do, and what he does ensemble. These types of information can each reveal more about a person than does any individual trip viewed in isolation. Repeated visits to a church, a gym, a bar, or a bookie tell a story not told by any single visit, as does one's not visiting any of these places over the course of a month. The sequence of a person's movements can reveal still more; a single trip to a gynecologist's office tells little about a woman, but that trip followed a few weeks later by a visit to a baby supply store tells a different story.* A person who knows all of another's travels can deduce whether he is a weekly church goer, a heavy drinker, a regular at the gym, an unfaithful husband, an outpatient receiving medical treatment, an associate of particular individuals or political groups – and not just one such fact about a person, but all such facts.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v. Maynard, 615 F.3d 544 (U.S., D.C. Circ., C.A.)p. 562; U.S. v. Jones, 565 U.S. __, (2012), Alito, J., concurring.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the privacy-based approach most commonly used post-''Katz'', the four-justice minority are instead of the opinion that the continuous monitoring of every single movement of an individual's car for 28 days violated a "[[expectation of privacy|reasonable expectation of privacy]]", and thus constituted a search. Alito explained that before GPS and similar electronic technology, month-long surveillance of an individual's every move would have been exceptionally demanding and costly, requiring a tremendous amount of resources and people.  As a result, society's expectations were, and still are, that such complete and long-term surveillance would not be undertaken, and that an individual would not think it could occur to him or her.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;[[#op|''United States v Jones'' (Opinion)]] Alito's concurrence, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to continuous monitoring for a short period, the minority would rely on ''[[United States v. Knotts]]'' (1983) and decline to find a violation of the expectation of privacy.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;  In ''Knotts'', a short-distance signal beeper in the defendant's car was tracked during a single trip for less than a day. The ''Knotts'' Court held that a person traveling on public roads has no expectation of privacy in his movements, because the vehicle's starting point, direction, stops, or final destination could be seen by anyone else on the road.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Knotts'', {{ussc|460|276|1983|pin=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Walter E. Dellinger III]], the former U.S. [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] and the attorney who represented the defendant, said the decision was "a signal event in Fourth Amendment history."&lt;ref name=WSJ01&gt;Bravin, Jess, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577178811800873358?mod=WSJ_hp_mostpop_read "Justices Rein In Police on GPS Trackers"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', January 24, 2012. Retrieved 2012-01-24.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said the decision made it more risky for law enforcement to use a GPS tracking device without a warrant.&lt;ref name=biskupic&gt;{{cite news|last=Biskupic|first=Joan|title=Supreme Court rules warrant needed for GPS tracking|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/story/2012-01-23/supreme-court-GPS/52754354/1|accessdate=November 21, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBI director [[Robert Mueller]] testified in March 2013 that the ''Jones'' decision had limited the Bureau's surveillance capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Carrie|title=FBI Still Struggling With Supreme Court's GPS Ruling|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/21/149011887/fbi-still-struggling-with-supreme-courts-gps-ruling|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=NPR|date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal defense attorneys and civil libertarians such as Virginia Sloan of the [[Constitution Project]] praised the ruling for protecting Fourth Amendment rights against government intrusion through modern technology.&lt;ref name=biskupic/&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], which filed an [[amicus brief]] arguing that warrantless GPS tracking violates reasonable expectations of privacy, praised Sotomayor's concurrence for raising concerns that Fourth Amendment caselaw does not reflect the realities of modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US v.

The Supreme Court [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] the case to the district court.

The '''Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA)''' was a bill passed by the [[United States Congress]] in 1988 as {{USPL|100|618}} and signed into law by President [[Ronald Reagan]]. It was created to prevent what it refers to as "wrongful disclosure of video tape rental or sale records [or similar audio visual materials, to cover items such as [[video games]] and the future [[DVD]] format]."  Congress passed the VPPA after [[Robert Bork]]'s video rental history was published during [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|his Supreme Court nomination]]. It makes any "video tape service provider" that discloses rental information outside the [[ordinary course of business]] liable for up to $2500 in actual damages.

==Origin of Computer-based VPPA Litigation==
In 2008, Attorney Joseph H. Malley,(Law Offices of Joseph H. Malley, PC, Dallas Texas), filed a Federal Class Action against Facebook, and thirty-three companies, including Blockbuster, Zappos, and Overstock, due to privacy violations caused by the [[Facebook Beacon]] program. This program resulted in users' private information, obtained from third-party affiliate marketing websites, being posted on Facebook without consent. This act was referenced in the ''[[Lane v. Facebook, Inc.]]'' class action. Based on this act it is generalized to other forms of rental records such as DVDs and Video games etc.

With the emergence of new-age computing technology and devices in the early 2000s came websites, 3rd party advertising and tracking firms began using mechanisms that violated a user's privacy. While computer technology was progressing rapidly, federal and state laws had failed to be proactive, a risk to society of ungoverned technology.
As such, litigation for violations was relatively non-existent. A new method to litigate Federal privacy cases was needed to protect the hundreds of millions of people violated by unauthorized tracking user's activities online.This was a formidable task since no law firms had litigated cases involving the computer technology inherent within the exchange of user data between third-party affiliated entities, thus there was no case precedent, no "blueprint" to follow. Earlier cases, such as the double-click "cookie" case in 2001, had relied on using a wiretap statute, the Electronic Communication Privacy Act ("ECPA"). While a plausible allegation, it was a weak allegation since the website user had granted such permissible use within the website's term of service ("TOS").

Attorney Malley, who had developed a litigation strategy in the early 2000s involving another federal privacy law, the Driver Privacy Protection Act ("DPPA"), a law related to the unauthorized access to DMV records and permitted statutory damages for privacy violations, IE., $2500.00 damage award "per person-per violation, (per company)", successfully filing numerous federal class actions against 300–400+ companies, sought a similar strategy, but needed to develop a new theory of liability for added assurance to survive a motion to dismiss. The problem, no case law involving this new-age type of technology. Substantial research was thus required, eventually revealing an "archaic" statute created in 1988: Video Privacy Protection Act ("VPPA"). Arguably unrelated to present technology, VPPA concerned obtaining information from a physical location and involved VHS and Betamax recordings. As such, lawsuits involving online entities that used audio-video would need to plead comparisons between the "old-new" technologies for advertising.    

The online advertising industry, in association with analytic companies, had begun using video ads to conduct its ubiquitous tracking, consumer's attention shown to be drawn to such as opposed to written content, In later years, these tracking methods would expand to photos and audio, IE., In 2008, cell phones were re-designed to include a new method of tracking, the use of social apps to collect photos, a process which now permitted a one step "click" process to uploading a photo as opposed to the previous six steps, thus consumers were now more inclined to upload photos in mass. This allowed content to be provided for free and which formed the basis for the tracking, IE., EXIF data. Such acts were captured when Attorney Malley used software applications to log HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a computer's web browser and the Internet, analytic tests using two computers interfaced, producing indisputable evidence of such activities: moreover, detailed reports of any and all parties involved in such nefarious activities, IE., "tracking the trackers". In the continuing research of the Industry's business practises in order to determine its monetization interests, such revealed the incorporation of complex graphics within online ads, and the exchange of data derived from video ads not confined to an internal network, used via a TCP/IP protocol. This unauthorized activity would become the core allegation.

Extensive research and case analysis of Federal and State laws, regulations, and Court Opinions, yielded limited assistance. An adaptation of the law was needed to litigate this new computer technology involving the unauthorized access to online consumer's data. Attorney Malley seized on an archaic law written concerning the technology of the 1980s involving video cassettes, VHS, and Betamax, the Video Privacy Protection Act ("VPPA"), 18 U.S. Code § 2710 - Wrongful disclosure of video tape rental or sale records, (1988),  envisioning that the websites, and any affiliated third-parties, which used the audio and/or video within its marketing ads were "video-providers"; moreover, this content, ads and online games, merely a video; moreover, the essential functionality of the illegal transfer, a "wrongful disclosure", (core elements needed to prove-up a VPPA violation). The use of the VPPA law in regard to this new-age computer technology would set precedent, and become the new "blueprint" used in Federal privacy litigation.

The lawsuit alleged the release of the records was a violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act.&lt;ref name="VPPAFace"&gt;Vijayan, Jaikumar (2008-04-18), "[http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=standards_and_legal_issues&amp;articleId=9078938&amp;taxonomyId=146 Blockbuster sued over Facebook Beacon information sharing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116033037/http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=standards_and_legal_issues&amp;articleId=9078938&amp;taxonomyId=146 |date=January 16, 2009 }}". ''Computerworld''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, once again, Attorney Joseph H. Malley, (Law Offices of Joseph H. Malley, PC., Dallas Texas), representing an anonymous plaintiff, filed a lawsuit against the online DVD rental company [[Netflix]] over its release of data sets for the [[Netflix Prize]], alleging that the company's release of the information constituted a violation of the VPPA.&lt;ref&gt;Singel, Ryan. [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/netflix-privacy-lawsuit "Netflix Spilled Your Brokeback Mountain Secret, Lawsuit Claims"], ''Wired Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

Netflix cited the act in 2011 following the announcement of its global integration with Facebook. The company noted that the VPPA was the sole reason why the new feature was not immediately available in the United States, and it encouraged its customers to contact their representatives in support of legislation that would clarify the language of the law.&lt;ref name="NetflixFacebook"&gt;{{cite web | title=Help Us Bring Facebook Sharing to Netflix USA | work=Netflix Blog | url=http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/help-us-bring-facebook-sharing-to.html | accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Netflix changed its privacy rules so that it no longer retains records for people who have left the site. This change was due directly to a lawsuit indicating violation of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/class-action-lawsuit-settlement-forces-netflix-privacy-changes/ |title=Class-action lawsuit settlement forces Netflix privacy changes|work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, President Obama signed into law H.R. 6671 which amended the Video Privacy Protection Act to allow video rental companies to share rental information on social networking sites after obtaining customer permission. Netflix had lobbied for the change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-signs-netflix-backed-amendment-to-video-privacy-law/ Obama signs Netflix-backed amendment to video privacy law], Steven Musil, Cnet, January 10, 2013, accessed June 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney Joseph H. Malley was contacted by the Chief Counsel, Democrats|Subcommittee on IP at U.S. House of Representatives to provide assistance related to 2012 VPPA Amendment proposal.

A San Francisco federal trial court found the VPPA's subscriber protections apply to users with [[Hulu]] accounts, a class action also involving Attorney Joseph H. Malley.&lt;ref name=harv&gt;[http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2011-2020-Online.pdf ''Recent Cases: Eleventh Circuit Limits the Scope of "Subscriber" for VPPA Protections''], 129 Harv. L. Rev. 2011 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, a federal appeals court in Atlanta found that those protections do not reach the users of a free Android app, even when the app assigns each user a unique identification number and shares user behavior with a third-party data analytics company.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Video advertising''' encompasses online [[Display advertising|display advertisements]] that have [[video]] within them, but it is generally accepted that it refers to [[advertising]] that occurs  before, during and/or after a [[Video streaming|video stream]] on the [[internet]].
 
The advertising units used in this instance are pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll and all of these ad units are like the traditional [[Television advertisement|spot advertising]] you see on [[television]], although often they are "cut-down" to be a shorter version than their [[Television advertisement|TV counterparts]] if they are run online.

Broadcast websites such as [[Sky.com]] and [[itv.com]] have such advertising on their sites, as do [[newspaper]] websites such as ''[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. In 2010, video ads accounted for 12.8% of all videos viewed and 1.2% of all minutes spent viewing video online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/11/15/84-1-of-us-internet-audience-viewed-online-video/ "84.1% of US internet users view web video"], ''Broadband TV News'', 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 Facebook paid an estimated $400 million to acquire LiveRail, a video advertising distributor which uses [[Real-time bidding]] to place more than 7 billion video ads a month.&lt;ref name="LiveRailGoogle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook hopes to boost video ad revenue with LiveRail|url=http://www.sanjosesun.com/index.php/sid/223558103/scat/3a8a80d6f705f8cc/ht/Facebook-hopes-to-boost-video-ad-revenue-with-LiveRail|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=''San Jose Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video ad formats==
According to [[Interactive Advertising Bureau]] (IAB) guidelines, there are three types of video ad formats:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB-Video-Ad-Format-Standards.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Linear video ads - the ads are presented before, in the middle of, or after the video content is consumed by the user, in very much the same way a TV commercial can play before, during or after the chosen program. 
* Non-linear video ads -  the ads run concurrently with the video content so the users see the ad while viewing the content. 
* Companion ads - commonly text, display ads, [[rich media]], or skins that wrap around the video experience.

The '''War Precautions Act 1914''' was an [[Statute|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Australia]] which gave the [[Government of Australia]] special powers for the duration of World War I and for six months afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= War Precautions Act 1914|type= Act|number= 10|date= 1914|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1914A00010}},  later amended by the {{cite act |title= War Precautions Act 1915|type= Act|number= 2|date= 1915|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1915A00002}}, {{cite act |title= War Precautions Act (No. 2) 1915|type= Act|number= 39|date= 1915|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1915A00039}} and {{cite act |title= War Precautions Act 1916|type= Act|number= 3|date= 1916 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1916A00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was held by the [[High Court of Australia]] in ''[[Farey v Burvett]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII |litigants=Farey v Burvett|link= Farey v Burvett|year=1916 |court=HCA |num=36  |parallelcite=(1916) 21 CLR 433 |date=8 June 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; that during wartime, the scope of the federal Government's power under [[Section 51(vi) of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51(vi)]] of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] (under which the Act was passed) expands to meet the exigencies of wartime. As a result, the responsibility for defence policy lies solely with the Parliament and the Executive.{{sfn|Scott|1941|pp=642-643}} There were 3,442 prosecutions under the Act, almost all of which were successful.

==Provisions==
Under the Act, which was to be read as one with the ''Defence Act 1903-1912'',&lt;ref&gt;1914 Act, s. 1&lt;/ref&gt; the Commonwealth could make regulations "for securing the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth",&lt;ref&gt;1914 Act, ss. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; including:

:* preventing [[espionage]] and other activity that could "jeopardize the success of the operations of any of His Majesty's forces," securing "the safety of any means of communication", and preventing "the spread of reports likely to cause disaffection or alarm" (the breach of which was subject to trial by [[court-martial]])&lt;ref&gt;1914 Act, s. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
:* prohibiting aliens from entering the Commonwealth, or requiring their deportation therefrom
:* prohibiting aliens from residing or remaining in a specified place, or requiring them to reside and remain in a specified place{{efn|such as the [[Torrens Island Concentration Camp]]}}
:* regulating the registration and change of abode of aliens, and any travelling and trading done by them
:* imposing similar restriction on naturalize citizens as can be imposed on aliens
:* requiring "any person to disclose any information in his possession as to any matter"
:* preventing "money or goods being sent out of Australia" except under certain conditions

Later amendments expanded the scope of regulations to cover:

:* the restriction the transmission abroad of all written communication other than through the post&lt;ref name="1915Act"&gt;1915 Act&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the ownership of property held by enemy aliens, and the regulation or restriction of any trade or business operated by them&lt;ref name="1916Act"&gt;1916 Act&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the conditions (ie, times, place and prices) of the disposal or use of any thing&lt;ref name="1916Act"/&gt;
:* the requisitioning of any thing&lt;ref name="1916Act"/&gt;

From 1915,&lt;ref name="1915Act"/&gt; the scale of punishments for offences under the Act was:

:* on [[summary conviction]]: a fine of up to ₤100 or imprisonment up to six months, or both
:* on [[indictment]]: a fine of any amount or imprisonment for any term, or both
:* on court-martial: the same punishment as if the offender had been subject to [[military]]
:* where, on indictment or court-martial, an offence was committed with the intention of assisting the enemy: the person was liable to suffer death

Regulations issued under the Act required all persons over 16 years of age, on leaving Australia, to possess a passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= War Precautions (Passports) Regulations 1916|type= SR|number= 126|date= 1916|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1916L00126}}, later replaced by {{cite act |title= War Precautions (Passports) Regulations 1916|type= SR|number= 206|date= 1916|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1916L00206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.passports.gov.au/Web/passport_history.aspx|title= The History of the Australian Passport|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= passports.gov.au|publisher= [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614171552/http://www.passports.gov.au/Web/passport_history.aspx |archive-date= June 14, 2006|dead-url= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other wartime legislation===
Although the Act possessed very broad scope, it was not omnipotent. Other Acts were passed by the Parliament during the war relating to:

:* criminal and civil sanctions for [[trading with the enemy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Trading with the Enemy Act 1914|type= Act|number= 9|date= 1914|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1914A00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* cancellation of commercial contracts with firms in enemy countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Enemy Contracts Annulment Act 1915|type= Act|number= 11|date= 1915|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1915A00011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
:* levying of an income tax&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Income Tax Act 1915|type= Act|number= 41|date= 1915|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1915A00041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
During the conscription referendums of [[Australian conscription referendum, 1916|1916]] and [[Australian conscription referendum, 1917|1917]], a regulation that banned statements likely to prejudice recruiting was used to hamper the anti-conscription campaign. Almost any anti-conscriptionist speech could be construed as offending, and a number of prominent anti-conscriptionists were charged, including [[John Curtin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AuDB |first= Geoffrey|last= Serle|author-link= |title= Curtin, John (1885–1945)|volume= 13|edition= |year= 1993|id2= curtin-john-9885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When coal-miners in [[New South Wales]] went on strike in 1916, the Act was used to empower the [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] to order the men back to work.  The following year, a nationwide strike of Waterfront workers was defeated by the passing of a regulation that deprived the [[Maritime Union of Australia|Waterside Workers Federation]] of preferences in seven of the busiest ports in Australia.  Although in many cases the use of the Act in settling labour disputes could be seen as necessary for the war effort, some other uses appeared calculated to suppress the [[Australian labour movement|labour movement]]. For example, in September 1918 the Act was used to ban the use of the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]], a traditional labour emblem.

Following the end of the war, the Act's continued operation lead to a series of violent demonstrations known as the [[Red Flag Riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Raymond|title=Russia and the Fifth Continent|editor=McNair, John |editor2=Poole, Thomas|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Brisbane|year=1992|chapter=Agitation, ceaseless agitation: Russian radicals in Australia and the Red flag riots|isbn=978-0-7022-2420-1|pages=126–171|url=http://www.argo.net.au/andre/redflagriotsENFIN.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Coulthard-Clark, Christopher|year=1998|title=Where Australians Fought: The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|edition=1st|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Sydney|isbn=1-86448-611-2 |page=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
The Act was later repealed by the ''War Precautions Act Repeal Act 1920''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= War Precautions Repeal Act 1920|type= Act|number= 54|date= 1920|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1920A00054}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|of which one provision still remains, currently cited as the {{cite act |title= Protection of Word "Anzac" Act 1920|type= Act|number= 54|date= 1920|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00072}}}}
