In [[ethics]] and [[governance]], '''accountability''' is answerability, [[blameworthiness]], [[legal liability|liability]], and the expectation of account-giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dykstra|first=Clarence A.|date=February 1938|title=The Quest for Responsibility|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.2307/1949761|publisher=The American Political Science Review, Vol. 33, No. 1|jstor=1949761}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an aspect of [[governance]], it has been central to discussions related to problems in the [[public sector]], [[nonprofit]] and private ([[corporate]]) and individual contexts. In leadership roles,&lt;ref&gt;Williams,  Reyes(2006) Leadership accountability in a globalizing world. London: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, [[Product (business)|products]], decisions, and policies including the [[Administration (business)|administration]], governance, and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences.

In governance, accountability has expanded beyond the basic definition of "being called to account for one's actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulgan|first=Richard |year=2000|title='Accountability': An Ever-Expanding Concept?|url=|journal=[[Public Administration (journal)|Public Administration]]|volume=78|issue=3|pages=555–573|doi=10.1111/1467-9299.00218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Amanda |year=1995|title=The Chameleon of Accountability: Forms and Discourses|url=|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society |volume=20|issue=2/3|pages=219–237|doi=10.1016/0361-3682(93)E0003-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently described as an account-giving relationship between individuals, e.g. "A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about A's (past or future) actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schedler|first=Andreas|editor=Andreas Schedler |editor2=Larry Diamond |editor3=Marc F.

Accountability is an element of a [[Responsibility assignment matrix|RACI]] to indicate who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one who delegates the work to those responsible.

There are various reasons (legitimate or excuses) why accountability fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountable Partner – Why You Fail - Katy Christian Magazine|url = http://katychristianmagazine.com/2015/12/accountable-partner-why-you-fail/|website = Katy Christian Magazine|access-date = 2016-02-13|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and etymology==
"Accountability" stems from late Latin ''accomptare'' (to account), a prefixed form of ''computare'' (to calculate), which in turn derived from ''putare'' (to reckon).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the word itself does not appear in English until its use in 13th century Norman England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubnick|first=Melvin|editor=Charles Sampford |editor2=Noel Preston |editor3=C.

==Types==
Bruce Stone, O.P. Dwivedi, and Joseph G. Jabbra list 8 types of accountability, namely: moral, administrative, political, managerial, market, legal/judicial, constituency relation, and professional.&lt;ref&gt;Jabbra, J. G. and Dwivedi, 0. P. (eds.), ''Public Service Accountability: A Comparative Perspective'', Kumarian Press, Hartford, CT, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7837-7581-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leadership accountability]] cross cuts many of these distinctions.

===Political===
{{Anchor|Political accountability}}
Political accountability is the accountability of the [[government]], [[civil servants]] and [[politicians]] to the public and to legislative bodies such as a [[congress]] or a [[parliament]].

Hirschman makes substantial contributions to accountability theory, positing exit or voice as pivotal accountability mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States.|last=Hirschman|first=Albert O.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1970|isbn=9780674276505|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the governor and governed (i.e., [autonomous (auto) - dependent (dep)], [auto-auto], [dep-dep], [dep-auto] ) functions such that the prospect of citizen exit can, not only disciplines ex ante, but also ex post if the state is dependent on the citizens. The literature connects this disposition of autonomy or dependence to its [[fiscal capacity]]. States that are most responsive adjust to exit or voice. Clark &amp; Golder model the dynamics of Hirschman's theory and elaborate important aspects like those that operationalize loyalty as an active choice.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013. “Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.” Unpublished manuscript, University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Exit, voice, and loyalty will be expressed in different ways under differing regimes and given the relevant assumptions. All three of these sufficiently broad categories present ways and means of holding the state accountable.

[[Recall election]]s can be used to revoke the office of an elected official. Generally, however, voters do not have any direct way of holding elected representatives to account during the [[term of office|term]] for which they have been elected. Additionally, some officials and legislators may be appointed rather than elected. [[Constitution]], or [[statute]], can empower a [[legislative body]] to hold their own members, the government, and government bodies to account. This can be through holding an internal or independent [[inquiry]]. Inquiries are usually held in response to an allegation of misconduct or corruption. The powers, procedures and sanctions vary from country to country. The legislature may have the power to [[impeach]] the individual, remove them, or suspend them from office for a period of time. The accused person might also decide to [[resign]] before trial. [[Impeachment in the United States]] has been used both for elected representatives and other civil offices, such as [[United States district court|district court]] [[judge]]s.

In parliamentary systems, the government relies on the support or parliament, which gives parliament power to hold the government to account. For example, some parliaments can pass a [[vote of no confidence]] in the government.

Belsky et al. point out, whereas, under more democratic governance accountability is built into the institution of the state by a habit of regular elections, accountability in autocratic regimes &lt;ref&gt;Besley, Timothy and Masayuki Kudamatsu. 2007. “[http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3764/1/Making_Autocracy_Work.pdf Making Autocracy Work].” Working paper.&lt;/ref&gt; relies on a selectorate; a group that legitimizes or delegitimizes the autocrats powers according to [[selectorate theory]]. The primary mechanism at a selectorate's disposal is deposition, which is a form of exit. Beyond that institutions can act as credible restraints on autocracy as well.

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] found that empowering citizens in developing countries to be able to hold their domestic governments to account was incredibly complex in practice. However, by developing explicit processes that generate change from individuals, groups or communities ([[Theories of Change]]), and by fusing political economy analysis and [[outcome mapping]] tools, the complex state-citizen dynamics can be better understood. As such, more effective ways to achieve outcomes can hence be generated.&lt;ref&gt;Tembo, F., March 2012, [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=6318&amp;title=state-accountability-citizen-voice-mwananchi Citizen voice and state accountability: towards theories of change that embrace contextual dynamics] ''Overseas Development Institute'', retrieved 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the International Budget Partnership (IBP) found that civil society organizations play an important role in achieving accountability outcomes. The IBP case studies showed that CSOs can have an impact in a broad array of political and economic contexts. The researchers concluded that CSOs are most effective when they draw in a broad web of actors from across the accountability system, including the media, auditors, donors, the legislature, executive insiders, and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;van Zyl, Albert, October 2013, [http://internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/CSO-transparency-and-accountability-Governance-HEC-conference.pdf Greasing the Wheels of the Accountability System: How Civil Society Organizations Close the Gap between Transparency and Accountability], ''International Budget Partnership'', retrieved 1 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical===
{{See also|Social accounting|Environmental accounting}}

Within an organization, the principles and practices of ethical accountability aim to improve both the internal standard of individual and group conduct as well as external factors, such as sustainable economic and ecologic strategies. Also, ethical accountability plays a progressively important role in academic fields, such as laboratory experiments and field research. Debates around the practice of ethical accountability on the part of researchers in the social field – whether professional or others – have been thoroughly explored by Norma R.A. Romm in her work on Accountability in Social Research,&lt;ref name=romm&gt;{{cite book|last=Romm|first=Norma R.A.|title=Accountability in Social Research|year=2001|publisher=Klower Academic|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-46564-2|url=https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/book/978-0-306-46564-2?detailsPage=reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; including her book on New Racism: Revisiting Researcher Accountabilities, reviewed by Carole Truman in the journal Sociological Research Online.&lt;ref name=truman&gt;{{cite web|last=Truman|first=Carole|title=Review of New Racism: Revisiting Researcher Accountabilities|url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/16/2/reviews/3.html|publisher=Sociological Research Online|accessdate=27 August 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here it is suggested that researcher accountability implies that researchers are cognizant of, and take some responsibility for, the potential impact of their ways of doing research – and of writing it up – on the social fields of which the research is part. That is, accountability is linked to considering carefully, and being open to challenge in relation to, one's choices concerning how research agendas are framed and the styles in which write-ups of research "results" are created.

===Administrative===
Internal rules and norms as well as some independent commission are mechanisms to hold civil servants within the administration of government accountable. Within department or ministry, firstly, behavior is bound by rules and regulations; secondly, civil servants are subordinates in a hierarchy and accountable to superiors. Nonetheless, there are independent "watchdog" units to scrutinize and hold departments accountable; legitimacy of these commissions is built upon their independence, as it avoids any conflicts of interests.
The accountability is defined as "an element which is part of a unique responsibility and which represents an obligation of an actor to achieve the goal, or to perform the procedure of a task, and the justification that it is done to someone else, under threat of sanction".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference|author=Feltus C. |title=Aligning Access Rights to Governance Needs with the Responsibility MetaModel (ReMMo) in the Frame of Enterprise Architecture |date=2011 |url=http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal:144013 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724221935/http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal%3A144013 |archivedate=24 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
{{Anchor|Security accountability}}
The traceability of actions performed on a system to a specific system entity (user, process, device). For example, the use of unique user identification and authentication supports accountability; the use of shared [[user ID]]s and [[password]]s destroys accountability.

===Individuals within organizations===
Because many different individuals in large organizations contribute in many ways to the decisions and policies, it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results. This is what is known, following Thompson, as the problem of many hands.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis (2005). “The Problem of Many Hands” in ''Restoring Responsibility: Ethics in Government, Business and Healthcare''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 33-49. {{ISBN|978-0521547222}}&lt;/ref&gt; It creates a dilemma for accountability. If individuals are held accountable or responsible, individuals who could not have prevented the results are either unfairly punished, or they "take responsibility" in a symbolic ritual without suffering any consequences.  If only organizations are held accountable, then all individuals in the organization are equally blameworthy or all are excused. Various solutions have been proposed.  One is to broaden the criteria for individual responsibility so that individuals are held accountable for not anticipating failures in the organization. Another solution, recently proposed by Thompson, is to hold individuals accountable for the design of the organization, both retrospectively and prospectively.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F. (2014). "Responsibility for Failures of Government: The Problem of Many Hands," ''American Review of Public Administration'' '''44''' (3): 259–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constituency relations ===
Within this perspective, a particular agency of the government is accountable if voices are heard from agencies, groups or institutions outside the public sector representing citizens' interests from a particular constituency or field. Moreover, the government is obliged to empower members of agencies with political rights to run for elections and be elected; or, appoint them into the public sector as a way to make the government representative and to ensure that voices from all constituencies are included in policy-making.

===Public/private overlap===
With the increase over the last several decades in public service provided by private entities, especially in Britain and the United States, some have called for increased political accountability mechanisms for otherwise non-political entities.    Legal scholar Anne Davies, for instance, argues that the line between public institutions and private entities like corporations is becoming blurred in certain areas of public service in the United Kingdom, and that this can compromise political accountability in those areas.  She and others argue that some administrative law reform is necessary to address this accountability gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competition-law.ox.ac.uk/members/profile.phtml?lecturer_code=daviesa |title=oxford law - the faculty and its members : anne davies |publisher=Competition-law.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the public/private overlap in the United States, public concern over the contracting of government services (including military) and the resulting accountability gap has been highlighted recently following the shooting incident involving the Blackwater security firm in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/ed_harriman/2007/09/blackwater_poisons_the_well.html |title=Blackwater poisons the well |publisher=Commentisfree.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2009-08-26 | location=London | first=Ed | last=Harriman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary studies==
Accountability involves either the expectation or assumption of account-giving behavior. The study of account giving as a sociological act was articulated in a 1968 article on "Accounts" by Marvin Scott and Stanford Lyman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Marvin B.|author2=Lyman, Stanford M.|date=February 1968|title=Accounts|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=46–62|doi=10.2307/2092239|pmid=5644339|publisher=American Sociological Review, Vol. 33, No. 1|jstor=2092239}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be traced as well to [[J. L. Austin]]'s 1956 essay "A Plea for Excuses",&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J.L. 1956-7. A plea for excuses. Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society.
Reprinted in [[J. O. Urmson]] &amp; [[G. J. Warnock]], eds., 1979, J. L. Austin: Philosophical Papers, 3rd edition. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 175-204.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he used excuse-making as an example of [[speech act]]s.

Communications scholars have extended this work through the examination of strategic uses of excuses, justifications, rationalizations, apologies and other forms of account giving behavior by individuals and corporations, and [[Philip Tetlock]] and his colleagues have applied experimental design techniques to explore how individuals behave under various scenarios and situations that demand accountability.

Recently, accountability has become an important topic in the discussion about the legitimacy of international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Ruth W.|author2=Keohane, Robert O.|year=2005|title=Accountability and Abuses of Power in World Politics|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=99|issue=1|pages=29–43|doi=10.1017/S0003055405051476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is no global democratically elected body to which organizations must account, global organizations from all sectors  bodies are often criticized as having large accountability gaps. The Charter 99 for Global Democracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=14&amp;Itemid=55 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516034551/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=14&amp;Itemid=55 |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; spearheaded by the [[One World Trust]], first proposed that cross-sector principles of accountability be researched and observed by institutions that affect people, independent of their legal status. One paradigmatic problem arising in the global context is that of institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] who are founded and supported by wealthy nations or individuals and provide grants and loans, to developing nations. Should those institutions be accountable to their founders and investors or to the persons and nations they lend money to? In the debate over [[global justice]] and its distributional consequences, Cosmopolitans tend to advocate greater accountability to the disregarded interests of traditionally marginalized populations and developing nations. On the other hand, those in the [[Nationalism]] and Society of States traditions deny the tenets of [[moral universalism]] and argue that beneficiaries of global development initiatives have no substantive entitlement to call international institutions to account. The [[One World Trust]] Global Accountability Report, published in a first full cycle 2006 to 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=60|title=Global Accountability Report (GAR)|author=Administrator|work=oneworldtrust.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124021950/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=60|archivedate=24 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one attempt to measure the capability of global organizations to be accountable to their stakeholders.

===Accountability in education===
Student accountability is traditionally based on hang school and classroom rules, combined with sanctions for infringement. As defined by National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), accountability is "A program, often legislated, that attributes the responsibility for student learning to teachers, school administrators, and/or students. Test results typically are used to judge accountability, and often consequences are imposed for shortcomings."&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA |date=22 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, some educational establishments such as [[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury schools]] believe that students are personally responsible for their acts, and that traditional schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action are considered the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Sudbury schools claim that {{"'}}[[Value (ethics)|Ethics]]' is a course taught by life experience". They adduce that the essential ingredient for acquiring values—and for moral action is personal responsibility, that schools will become involved in the teaching of morals when they become communities of people who fully respect each other's right to make choices, and that the only way the schools can become meaningful purveyors of ethical values is if they provide students and adults with real-life experiences that are bearers of moral import. Students are given complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a [[direct democracy]] in which students and staff are equals.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

Data were drawn from an extensive set of field notes made in an ethnographic study at Sudbury Valley School (an ungraded, democratically structured school in Framingham, MA), where students, ranging in age from 4 to 19, are free to choose their own activities and companions. Vignettes were analyzed using grounded theory approach to qualitative analysis, and themes were developed from an analysis of observations of meetings. Each theme describes a participation level that students assume in the process and that provide opportunities for them to develop and deepen understanding of the balance of personal rights and responsibilities within a community. The study adds to the understanding of education and child development by describing a school that differs significantly in its practice from the wider educational community and by validating Kohlberg's thesis about developing moral reasoning.

==Standards==
Accountability standards have been set up, and organizations can voluntarily commit to them. Standards apply in particular to the non-profit world and to [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR) initiatives. Accountability standards include:
* [[INGO Accountability Charter]], signed by a large number of [[NGOs]] to "demonstrate their commitment to accountability and transparency"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517195312/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/ |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AccountAbility's AA1000 series]]. "principles-based standards to help organisations become more accountable, responsible and sustainable. They address issues affecting governance, business models and organizational strategy, as well as providing operational guidance on sustainability assurance and stakeholder engagement"&lt;ref&gt;Website: {{cite web |url=http://www.accountability.org/standards/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908225546/http://www.accountability.org/standards/index.html |archivedate=8 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP)]] 2010 standards. A standard for humanitarian organizations to help them "design, implement, assess, improve and recognize accountable programmes"&lt;ref&gt;Webpage: {{cite web|url=http://www.hapinternational.org/projects/standard/hap-2010-standard.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703175310/http://www.hapinternational.org/projects/standard/hap-2010-standard.aspx |archivedate=3 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, some non-profit organizations set up their own commitments to accountability:
* Accountability, Learning and Planning System (ALPS) by [[ActionAid]],  a framework that sets out the key accountability requirements, guidelines, and processes.&lt;ref&gt;ActionAid (2005). [[ALPS - Accountability, Learning, and Planning System]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed symbolism==
[[Viktor Frankl]], neurologist, psychiatrist, author, and founder of [[logotherapy]] and one of the key figures in [[existential therapy]], in his book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' recommended "that the [[Statue of Liberty]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] (that has become a symbol of [[Liberty]] and [[Political freedom|Freedom]]) should be supplemented by a [[Statue of Responsibility]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast."]] Frankl stated: "Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness."&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Frankl|Frankl, Viktor Emil]] (1956) ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', p. 209-210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warnock, C. (2005) [http://www.heraldextra.com/news/article_21e93a1f-94db-5533-9e5c-0560fff08972.html "Statue of Responsibility,"] DAILY HERALD. Retrieved 24 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Amphiaraos krater''' is a [[Corinthian vase painting|Late Corinthian]] [[red-ground vase painting|red-ground]] [[column krater]]. It is considered the masterpiece of the [[Amphiaraos Painter]] (whose [[name vase]] it is) and one of the major specimens of the red-ground vase painting of [[Corinth]].

Dated to ''circa'' 560 BC, the Amphiaraos [[Krater]] depicts on the front a frieze of horsemen and above it the departure of [[Amphiaraos]]. The back was decorated with a battle frieze, above it again Amphiaraos, this time as a participant in the funeral games of [[Pelias]]. Below one of the handles, a wrestling match is depicted. The paintings on the vessel are considered especially colourful and detailed. Thus, the anger in Amphiaraos eye, looking at [[Eriphyle]], his only family member not to wish for his safe return, is visible. A sorrowful seer indicates the imminent death of the hero. The same scene was depicted on the Kypselos chest in Olympia, as described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 5, 17, 5ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The krater used to be on display in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], but disappeared at the end of the [[Second World War]].

'''''L'Angelo Nocchiero''''' ('''''The Angel-Helmsman''''') is a marble sculpture in the '[[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]' style by the Genovese sculptor [[:it:Giovanni Scanzi|Giovanni Scanzi]] (1840-1915), completed in 1886. It was commissioned by [[Commons:Category:Tomba Giacomo Carpaneto (Cimitero di Staglieno)|Giacomo Carpaneto]], Cav. Mauriziano (1811-1878) as a monument for his family tomb in the [[:it:Cimitero monumentale di Staglieno|Cimitero monumentale di Staglieno]] ([[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]]), in [[Genoa|Genova, Italy]].
Along with the sculpture for the [[Monteverde Angel|Oneto Family]] sculpted by Giulio Monteverde in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;Berenco Gardin, Gianni, and Nesso Parlato, Gabriella (1993). 
''Il Giardino del Tempo''. [Roma:] Peliti Associati, dust-jacket cover and pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt; the Carpaneto monument has become one of the most recognisable icons of Staglieno,
appearing on an official cemetery brochure in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Staglieno Cimitero Monumentale (2014). "Settimana dei Cimiteri Storici Europei", 23 maggio-1 giugno 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angelo nocchiero staglieno 11 vintage.jpg|thumb|''Angelo Nocchiero'' (1886), Giovanni Scanzi, sculptor (early photograph, ca.1895)]]

==The artist, his patron, and his model==

Giovanni Scanzi was 38 years old when his patron Cav. Giacomo Carpaneto died and he began
work on the Carpaneto family tomb at Staglieno. Scanzi's early work was in the Realist style,
&lt;ref name=Sborgi&gt;Sborgi, Franco (1997). ''Staglieno e la Scultura Funeraria Ligure tra Ottocento e Novecento''.
Torino: Artema, p.147, ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
and by this time he had also incorporated Symbolism
(or, perhaps more accurately, "l'iperdecorativismo eclettico"&lt;ref name=Sborgi /&gt;),
as seen in his sculptures of the
''Angelo della Resurrezione'' (Angel of Resurrection) on the  [[Commons:Category:Tomba_Carlo_di_G.B._Casella_(Cimitero_di_Staglieno)|Carlo di G.B. Casella family tomb]] (1877);
the later relief for the [[Commons:Category:Tomba_Elisa_Falcone_(Cimitero_di_Staglieno)|tomb of Elisa Falcone]] (1893); and other works at Staglieno.

Giacomo Carpaneto, Cav. Mauriziano (1811-1878) was a respected merchant,
part of a family originally from
Sampierdarena (S. Petri ad Arenaria) where the Palazzo Centurione-Carpaneto still
stands.&lt;ref name=Marchetti&gt;Marchetti, Rita Nello (2014). ''Caterina e l'Angelo: Il volto popolare e l'anima nobile del Cimitero di Staglieno''. Genova: Erga edizioni, pp.74-76,91-93&lt;/ref&gt;
Signora Carpaneto also is interred in the family tomb.

The model for the ''Angelo Nocchiero'' sculpture was Antonio Dellapiane (1868-1942).
After school, he worked as a shop-boy in a joiner's workshop in Sampierdarena, where Scanzi met him. Later, he started his own workshop, becoming a successful carpenter and wood carver.
&lt;ref name=Marchetti /&gt;

==Symbolism==
The sculpture depicts an angel, standing astride a small boat, beginning to secure the sails at the end of a journey. His garments are streaming behind him, suggesting a strong wind. The prow of the boat is the stoic face of a woman, and under the prow the water swirls. Ropes are coiled in minute detail inside the boat (even though the average cemetery visitor would not be able to see them), and at the back of the boat is an embroidered cushion, slightly dented from a head resting there until a moment earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dearmissfletcher.wordpress.com/2017/01/16/langelo-nocchiero-e-il-mare-della-vita/ |title=L'Angelo Nocchiero e il mare della vita |author=Miss Fletcher |date=16 January 2017}} dearmissfletcher.wordpress.com/, retrieved 25 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat would be a familiar symbol to anyone in 19th century Genova, a seaport town,
and the ''Angelo Nocchiero'' - ''Angel Helmsman'' - reminds the viewer of the spiritual
boatmen of ancient mythology, whose job it was to transport the departed into the afterlife.
The clear imagery of the Guiding Angel is underscored by the epigraph in bronze lettering
on the pedestal: "AVVENTURATO CHI NEL MARE DELLA VITA EBBE NOCCHIERO SÌ FIDO" - "Blessed
is he who on the sea of life had so sure a guide".&lt;ref&gt;(anonymous)(n.d.).

==History==
Many famous people of the 19th century visited Staglieno, including Friedrich Nietzsche,
Guy de Maupassant, and Mark Twain, who wrote about it in glowing terms in his ''Innocents Abroad'' (1868).
&lt;ref&gt;Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe (ASCE). [http://www.significantcemeteries.org/2012/01/staglieno-cemetery-genova-italy.html "Staglieno Cemetery (Genoa, Italy)"] www.significantcemeteries.org/, retrieved 5 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
The visit in March 1893 of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, fondly known as 'Sissi', is legendary. Periodicals of the time reported that she arrived incognito as 'Lady Parker', and walked from the Principe to Staglieno, visiting a number of significant places along the way. When she came before Scanzi's ''Nocchiero'', she paused,&lt;ref&gt;Resasco, Ferdinando (1904). ''Staglieno Camposanto''. Milano: Menotti Bassanti &amp; C., pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt; apparently moved, and after a period of contemplation, had the epigraph copied into her personal notebook.&lt;ref&gt;''Il Secolo XIX''
(12 March 1893) "L'Imperatrice visita
Genova: da Principe a Staglieno a piedi"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==

[[File:Angelo nocchiero staglieno 00 during restoration angel with foam 1.jpg|thumb|''Angelo Nocchiero'' (1886), during the 2016 restoration process]]

Mark Twain &lt;ref&gt;Twain, Mark [Samuel Langhorne Clemens](1869). ''The Innocents Abroad, or The New Pilgrims' Progress''. Hartford, Connecticut: American Publishing Company, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; described the monuments at Staglieno as "exquisitely wrought . . . full of grace and beauty. They are new, and snowy; every outline is perfect." After a century and a half Twain's description would not be quite the same, as the dust, mildew and pollution of an industrial city have settled on the marble surfaces, thieves have removed valuable bronze and other materials, and vandals have broken or otherwise defaced some of the monuments. &lt;ref&gt;American Friends of Italian Monumental Sculpture [A.F.I.M.S.] (2017), "Carpaneto Memorial, 1886", https://staglieno.com/carpaneto-memorial-1886/, retrieved 30 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the work of local restoration experts and societies and individuals dedicated to

[[File:Ballet Teresa Carreño.jpg|right|thumb|''Arabesque penchée'']]

'''Arabesque''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁabɛsk|lang}}; literally, "in Arabic fashion") in dance, particularly [[ballet]], is a body position in which a dancer stands on one leg &amp;ndash; the ''supporting'' leg &amp;ndash; with the other leg &amp;ndash; the ''working'' leg &amp;ndash; [[turnout (ballet)|turned out]] and extended behind the body, with both legs held straight. In [[classical ballet]], an arabesque can be executed with the supporting leg ''[[en pointe]]'' or ''[[demi pointe]]'' or with foot flat on the floor.

The working leg may touch the floor in ''tendu'' back &amp;ndash; an ''arabesque par terre'' &amp;ndash; or be elevated. Common elevation angles of the raised leg are 45° &amp;ndash; ''à demi hauteur'' &amp;ndash; and 90° &amp;ndash; ''à la hauteur''. When the angle is much greater than 90° and the body trunk leans forward to counterbalance the working leg, the position is called ''arabesque penchée''. The arms may be held in various positions.

Arabesques are described from the perspective of the dancer, in terms of the [[Stage reference points in ballet training systems|stage reference points]] used by the training system.

==Vaganova==
[[Galina Kekisheva]], a former soloist of the [[Kirov Ballet]] who studied with [[Agrippina Vaganova]] at the [[Leningrad School of Dance]] has described the changes in [[Russian ballet]] technique over time:&lt;ref name=vaganova&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University Press of Florida| isbn = 978-0-8130-3697-7| last = Pawlick| first = Catherine E.| title = Vaganova Today: The Preservation of Pedagogical Tradition| date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now it seems unimportant in the school if the dancer stands on his or her leg properly pulled up, or sits back into the hip socket. What is important to today's dancers is that the ''arabesque'' is higher than the head. There is no low ''arabesque'' that maintains a beautiful line, an ''arabesque'' from which, for example, you can do a turn. When you're sitting back on the [joint of the standing] leg, you can't go anywhere from there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kekisheva, who is now a coach with the [[Mariinsky ballet]], has said that "Vaganova's method is dissipating, and working in the classical repertoire has become more difficult".&lt;ref name=vaganova /&gt;
In the [[Vaganova method]] there are four basic ''arabesque'' positions. They are described here for a dancer facing point 8. In class practice, the arms are always level with the shoulders &amp;ndash; ''arabesque de classe'', whereas in performance the arm in front may be raised above shoulder level &amp;ndash; ''arabesque de scene''. The elbows are always facing downwards.

*In the '''first''' arabesque, the dancer stands in ''effacé'' position &amp;ndash; with the left foot in front &amp;ndash; with the right leg raised in ''arabesque'', the right arm extended to the side, to the audience, and the left arm extended front, towards the corner. The gaze follows the line of the arm extended ''en avant''.

*In the '''second''' arabesque the legs are like in the first ''arabesque'', but the right arm is extended ''en avant'' while the left arm is extended aligned with the dancer's shoulder; the shoulders are in ''épaulement'' in line with the arms and the gaze is turned to the audience. The dancer's face is turned toward point one.

*In the '''third''' arabesque the dancer stands in ''croisé'' position &amp;ndash; with the right foot in front &amp;ndash; with the left leg raised in ''arabesque'', the right arm extended to the side and a little behind the shoulder, and the left arm extended front. The gaze follows the line of the arm extended ''en avant''.

*In the '''fourth''' arabesque position the dancer stands in ''croisé'' as for the third ''arabesque'', but the right arm is extended front and the left arm is extended as far back as possible in line with the right arm. The shoulders are in strong ''épaulement'' and the dancer's focus is turned to the audience.

===Technique===
In ''arabesque tendue'' or ''dégagé'', {{clarify span|the leg comes from the hip|date=July 2016}} and does not affect [[aplomb]] as the back remains straight. Most dancers do not have {{clarify span|absolute rotation through the supporting leg|date=July 2016}}, therefore the working hip may open without lifting into the lower ribs, while the supporting hip lifts forward over the supporting foot, maintaining a {{clarify span|spiral rotation through the legs|date=July 2016}}.
   
When the leg is moved or held above 45° or so, the dancer curves the spine both laterally and vertically. The method is to:
#Anchor the shoulders and scapula downward without tension, keeping both shoulders "square" &amp;ndash; aligned parallel with the direction the dancer is facing. The sternum must lift without hyper-extending the ribcage.
#Keep the supporting hip forward, as mentioned above. The spine curves to the anterior, keeping the head lifted to focus straight forward to diagonally up.  The current standard height and degree for the Vaganova arabesque is 110°.  Vaganova method maintains that, in classical ballet, both the supporting and the working legs must be fully turned out through the legs, not only from the hips, even in full arabesque. If the choreography requires the dancer to open her/his arms, the performer should rotate the shoulders around the spine, so the shoulders do not affect the position of the back and spine and/or shoulders.

Note that allowing for the dancer to open the hips is distinctly different than some older methods, that require the hips to remain down.  Restraining the hips restricts range of motion, restricting the full curvature of the spine, (not allowing the spine to rotate laterally, thus increases compaction of vertebrae);  nor for most dancers, to exhibit an outwardly rotated leg.  Opening the hip  allows dancers with lesser mobile bodies to safely achieve greater range of motion in arabesque.

==Balanchine==
[[Suki Schorer]] has described the Balanchine arabesque as "longer, stronger and bigger". Balanchine would instruct students to "reach for diamonds" in both directions so the dancer's hands are not relaxed—the dancer's line should be elongated, but the arms should not be stiff.&lt;ref name=schorer&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Balanchine Essays: Arabesque |via=Alexander Street| accessdate = 2018-04-04| url = https://search.alexanderstreet.com/view/work/bibliographic_entity%7Cvideo_work%7C2196384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabesque pliée===
Schorer says the arabesque pliée "is good to build strength in your legs to control the rate of descent to hold your body up when you land". The dancer's bent knee is over the toe and the dancer should not [[penchée]] or tilt forward.&lt;ref name=schorer /&gt;

==Royal Academy of Dance==

In the [[Royal Academy of Dance#Style and technique|RAD system]], there are three main arabesques. Here they are described for a dancer facing point 6:

*'''First''' arabesque is taken standing ''en ouvert'' on the right leg with the left leg extended. The right arm is extended forwards at eye height, parallel with the right shoulder. The left arm is at the side, slightly behind and below the left shoulder.

*'''Second''' arabesque has a more 'square' feel to it. The dancer stands on their left leg, with their right leg extended. The right arm is extended forwards at shoulder height, and the left arm is extended directly sideways from the shoulder. This can also be taken ''en ouvert'', standing on the right leg and extending the left arm forwards.

*'''Third''' arabesque is taken ''en ouvert''. The dancer stands on their right leg, with their left leg extended behind. The right arm is extended forwards at eye height, and the left arm is extended parallel to it at shoulder height.

==Classical choregraphy==
The "Shades scene" from [[La Bayadère]], choregraphed by [[Marius Petipa]], is one of the masterpieces of [[Classical ballet|classical style]]. It opens with a [[corps de ballet]] of 28 female dancers, [[Ballet blanc|dressed in white]] performing a simple arabesque as they make their entrance one by one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-53986-9| last = Kant| first = Marion| title = The Cambridge Companion to Ballet| date = 2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media| people = SemperOperBallett| title = La Bayadère - The Kingdom of the Shades| accessdate = 2018-04-04| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1p3bng9V64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beneficence''' is a concept in [[research ethics]] which states that researchers should have the welfare of the research participant as a goal of any [[clinical trial]] or other research study. The [[antonym]] of this term, '''maleficence''', describes a practice which opposes the welfare of any research participant.

The concept that medical professionals and researchers would always practice beneficence seems natural to most patients and research participants, but in fact, every [[health intervention]] or research intervention has potential to harm the recipient. There are many different precedents in medicine and research for conducting a [[cost–benefit analysis]] and judging whether a certain action would be a sufficient practice of beneficence, and the extent to which treatments are acceptable or unacceptable is under debate.

Despite differences in opinion, there are many concepts on which there is wide agreement. One is that there should be community consensus when determining [[best practices]] for dealing with ethical problems.

==Elements==
These four concepts often arise in discussions about beneficence:
#one should not practice evil or do harm, often stated in [[Latin]] as ''[[Primum non nocere]]''
#one should prevent evil or harm
#one should remove evil or harm
#one should practice good

Ordinary moral discourse and most philosophical systems state that a prohibition on doing harm to others as in #1 is more compelling than any duty to benefit others as in #2–4. This makes the concept of "first do no harm" different from the other aspects of beneficence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=W.D.|title=The Right and the Good|year=1988|publisher=Hackett Pub. Co.|location=Indianapolis|isbn=978-0-87220-058-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example illustrating this concept is the [[trolley problem]].

Morality and ethical theory allows for judging relative costs, so in the case when a harm to be inflicted in violating #1 is negligible and the harm prevented or benefit gained in #2–4 is substantial, then it may be acceptable to cause one harm to gain another benefit. Academic literature discusses different variations of such scenarios. There is no objective evidence which dictates the best course of action when health professionals and researchers disagree about the best course of action for participants except that most people agree that the discussions about ethics should happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert J.|title=Ethics and Regulation of Clinical Research|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-04288-7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem==
Some outstanding problems in discussing beneficence occur repeatedly. Researchers often describe these problems in the following categories:

===To what extent should the benefactor suffer harm for the beneficiary?===
Many people share the view that when it is trivial to do so, people should help each other. The situation becomes more complicated when one person can help another by making various degrees of personal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graff|first=James A.|title=Human Acts, an Essay in their Moral Evaluation by Eric D'Arcy, The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1963, 174p. $4.50.|journal=Dialogue|year=1963|volume=3|issue=3|pages=311–2|doi=10.1017/S0012217300035460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===To whom are duties of beneficence owed?===
Researchers should apply the concept of beneficence to individuals within the patient/physician relationship or the research-participant/researcher relationship. However, there is debate about the extent to which the interests of other parties, such as future patients and endangered persons, ought to be considered. When a researcher risks harm to a willing volunteer to do research with the intent to develop knowledge which will better humanity, this may be a practice of beneficence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Ruth R. |last2= Faden |first2= Tom L.

'''''Billy Connolly's World Tour of New Zealand''''' is the fourth, and currently last, of [[Billy Connolly]]'s decade-spanning ‘world tours’ that follow the [[comedian]] on his various travels across the globe. In this tour, filmed in 2004, Connolly visited [[New Zealand]] and travelled 8,500&amp;nbsp;km throughout the country, from [[Stewart Island]] in the south, through [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[North Island, New Zealand|North Island]], to [[Ninety Mile Beach, New Zealand|Ninety Mile Beach]] in the north. As he did on his [[Billy Connolly's World Tour of Australia|1996 tour]] of Australia, Connolly travelled on a custom-made Yamaha XV1700 Warrior [[motorized tricycle|trike]] that had been built by the Trike Shop in the United Kingdom. The trike is now in the hands of a new owner in [[Melbourne]], Australia.

The series was made up of eight episodes in which Connolly gave insights into the history and culture of the country, especially its [[Māori people|Māori]] heritage, while also giving highlights from the New Zealand leg of his ''[[Too Old to Die Young]]'' tour. The [[leather]] jacket he often wore sports a skull with [[glasses]], the [[logo]] of the tour.

Continuing his catalogue of nude endeavours, he [[bungee jumping|bungee jump]]ed from the Nevis High Wire in [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].

The soundtrack, ''[[Billy Connolly's Musical Tour of New Zealand]]'', contained a track by folk singer [[Kate Rusby]].

'''''Boo Boo and the Man''''' is a 2002 short cartoon starring [[Boo-Boo Bear|Boo Boo Bear]], the sidekick of [[Yogi Bear]]. It was made by ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'' creator [[John Kricfalusi]] and his company [[Spümcø]] using [[Macromedia Flash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The much-loved character and friends, created by Hanna-Barbera, are back--but with John Kricfalusi's twist. |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1999-09-23|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/23/entertainment/ca-13166|accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Michael P. | last=Lucas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short was one of the last ''Web Premiere Toons'' shorts produced for [[Cartoon Network]]'s official website.

The cartoon centers around Boo Boo, who encounters with the group of mean teenage bear bullies.

==Plot==
The cartoon starts where Boo Boo is happily skipping along in the forest of Jellystone Park, until he comes across the teenage cub bullies, who asks him about who is a "big brown man" with him. Boo Boo replies that the "big brown man" is his best friend Yogi.

So as the mean bullies are having fun picking on Boo Boo with mean things (such as shaving his fur off of his tail, rubbing his tail into pink, and put a bee in his ear), Ranger Smith stops them, which causes the bullies to flee away, leaving Boo Boo injured. Ranger Smith helps poor Boo Boo up and Boo Boo asks the ranger about those bullies he met, wondering why they have to act mean to little bears. Smith then answers to Boo Boo that it's rough for the fact that the forest is rough on little fellow and tells him that he had to "bear" with a fact about fair life, right until Yogi shows up and asks Boo Boo if he want to tag along with him for a picnic goodies. After the two bears left, Ranger Smith breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about although he still has his likes of Boo Boo since is surely a nice bear, he just didn't know what he sees in that..... man.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">'''Books of secrets''' were compilations of technical and medicinal recipes and magic formulae that began to be printed in the sixteenth century and were published continuously down to the eighteenth century.  They constituted one of the most popular genres in early modern scientific publishing.  The books of secrets contained hundreds of medical recipes, household hints, and technical recipes on metallurgy, alchemy, dyeing, making perfume, oil, incense, and cosmetics.  The books of secrets supplied a great deal of practical information to an emerging new, middle-class readership, leading some historians to link them with the emerging secularistic values of the early modern period and to see them as contributing to the making of an ‘age of how-to.’

Some books of secrets, such as [[Alessio Piemontese]]'s famous ''Secreti'' (1555), contained mainly practical and technological information in the form of useful recipes.  Others, such as [[Giambattista Della Porta]]'s ''[[Magia Naturalis]]'' (''Natural Magic'', 1558) deployed practical recipes in an effort to demonstrate the principles of [[natural magic]].  Other books of secrets, such as [[Isabella Cortese|Isabella Cortese's]] ''Secreti'' (1564), disseminated alchemical information to a wide readership.  Recent research has suggested that the books of secrets may have played an important role in the emergence of experimental science by bringing practical technical information to the attention of experimental scientists.&lt;ref&gt;W. Eamon, ''Science and the Secrets of Nature:  Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interviews==
Bossip has interviewed celebrities such as [[Kanye West]], [[Janet Jackson]], Sanaa Lathan, Russell Simmons and Damon Dash. Another exclusive interview Bossip had done is with [[Kim Kardashian]], talking about her life, career, relationships and the infamous [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] with [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] singer and younger brother of [[Brandy (entertainer)|Brandy]], [[Ray J]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bossip.com/3487/exclusive-kim-kardashian-interview/ Bossip » Archive » Exclusive: Kim Kardashian Interview]; ''Bossip.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In October, 2006, Bossip published its first annual Style Awards with [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] getting the title as best dressed African-American celebrity and [[Serena Williams]] as worst dressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later in December, Bossip published a new "award" for most annoying celebrity of 2006 with [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]]/[[Pop music|Pop]] singer and actress [[Beyoncé Knowles]] as 1st position, [[Actor]] [[Taye Diggs]] at 10th position and [[Rapping|rapper]] [[Kanye West]] with an honorable mention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bossip.com/2006/12/bossips-list-of-10-most-annoying.html Bossip.com Gossip for the Hardcore: Henny Without Any Coke&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127200733/http://www.bossip.com/2006/12/bossips-list-of-10-most-annoying.html |date=January 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of sexism==
In December 2015, rapper [[Nicki Minaj]] accused Bossip of "ignorance" for a series of sexist tweets, including one which stated that she had only become famous because of her physical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bossip.com/1480984/in-rotten-mayo-news-funniest-and-pettiest-kellyanne-conway-memes-so-far/brb-2/ Nicki Minaj Fires Back At Sexist Tweets Spurred By Gossip Site’s ‘Serious Question’ About Women In Rap]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Donald Trump]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], Bossip ran a series of articles mocking the appearance of his campaign manager, [[Kellyanne Conway]], who was the first woman to run a successful presidential campaign. This included referring to her as a "blonde bimbo", "a piece of lying shit",&lt;ref&gt;[https://bossip.com/1471314/alternative-facts-kellyanne-conway-makes-up-bowling-green-massacre-to-justify-muslim-ban/ Kellyanne Conway Lies About Bowling Green Massacre]&lt;/ref&gt; a "bruised fruit",&lt;ref&gt;[https://bossip.com/1475673/kellyanne-conway-denies-retweeting-white-nationalist-but-the-lie-detector-determined/ Kellyanne Conway Denies Retweeting White Nationalist But The Lie Detector Determined…]&lt;/ref&gt; and "potato-salad faced".&lt;ref&gt;[https://bossip.com/1525695/potato-salad-faced-kellyanne-conway-getting-fried-for-saying-president-obama-used-microwaves-to-spy-on-trump/21/ Potato Salad-Faced Kellyanne Conway Getting Fried For Saying President Obama Used Microwaves To Spy On Trump]&lt;/ref&gt; The site also compiled a gallery of women supposedly more attractive than her,&lt;ref&gt;[https://bossip.com/1477921/oh-no-reason-a-gallery-of-black-women-the-same-age-as-kellyanne-conway/ Oh, No Reason: A Gallery Of Black Women The Same Age As Kellyanne Conway]&lt;/ref&gt; and published a photoshopped image implying that she performed sex acts on Trump.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bossip.com/1480984/in-rotten-mayo-news-funniest-and-pettiest-kellyanne-conway-memes-so-far/brb-2/ Bossip.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Bossip's focus on Conway was criticised as sexist by both feminist and conservative sources.

'''Burgos''' ({{IPA-es|ˈbuɾɣos}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|ʊər|g|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|ʊər|g|oʊ|s}}) is a city in northern [[Spain]] and the historic capital of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. It is situated on the confluence of the [[Arlanzón|Arlanzón river]] tributaries, at the edge of the Iberian central plateau. It has about 180,000 inhabitants in the actual city and another 20,000 in the metropolitan area. It is the capital of the [[Burgos (province)|province of Burgos]], in the autonomous community of [[Castile and León]]. Burgos was once the capital of the [[Crown of Castile]], and the Burgos Laws or [[Leyes de Burgos]] which first governed the behaviour of [[Spaniards]] towards the natives of the Americas were promulgated here in 1512.

It has many historic landmarks, of particular importance; the [[Cathedral of Burgos]] (declared [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/316|title=World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; seat of the Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Burgos]], the [[Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas|Las Huelgas Reales Monastery]] and [[Miraflores Charterhouse]]. A large number of churches, palaces and other buildings from the [[medieval age]] remain. The city is surrounded by the Fuentes Blancas and the Paseo de la Isla parks.

Castilian nobleman, military leader and diplomat [[El Cid Campeador]] is a significant historical figure in the city, as he was born a couple of kilometres north of Burgos and was raised and educated here.

The city forms the principal crossroad of northern Spain along the [[Camino de Santiago]], which runs parallel to the [[River Arlanzón]].

It has a well-developed transportation system, forming the main communication node in northern Spain. In 2008, the international [[Burgos Airport]] started to offer commercial flights. Furthermore, [[AVE]] [[high speed train]]s are planned to start service in the near future, stopping at the newly-built Rosa de Lima train station.

The [[Museum of Human Evolution]] was opened in 2010, unique in its kind across the world and projected to become one of the top 10 most-visited museums in Spain. The museum features the first Europeans, which lived in this area 800,000 years ago.

Burgos was selected as the "Spanish Gastronomy Capital" of 2013. In 2015 it was named "City of Gastronomy" by [[UNESCO]] and has been part of the [[Creative Cities Network]] since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://es.unesco.org/creative-cities/burgos|title=Burgos  {{!}} Creative Cities Network|website=es.unesco.org|language=es|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toponymy ==
There are several possible origins for the toponymy. When the city was founded, the inhabitants of the surrounding country moved into the fortified village, whose [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] name of Burgos signified consolidated [[defensive wall|walled]] villages{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} (Gothic ''baurgs'').&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Joseph, 1892, ''A Primer of the Gothic Language'', glossary &amp; section 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The city began to be called ''Caput Castellae'' ("Cabeza de Castilla" or "Head of Castile").

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Burgos}}
[[Homo antecessor|Early humans]] occupied sites around Burgos as early as 800,000 years ago.
When the Romans took possession of what is now the province of Burgos, the site had been a [[Celts|Celtic]] city. In Roman times, it belonged to [[Hispania Citerior]] ("Hither Spain") and then to [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]. In the 5th century, the [[Visigoths]] drove back the [[Suebi]], then the Berbers occupied almost all of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] in the 8th century, though only for a very brief period, and left little if any trace of their occupation. King [[Alfonso III of Leon|Alfonso III the Great]] of [[Kingdom of León|León]] reconquered it about the middle of the 9th century, and built several castles for the defence of Christendom, which was then extended through the reconquest of lost territory. The region came to be known as Castile (Latin ''castella''), i.e. "land of castles".

[[File:Castillo de burgos exteriores.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Ruins of the [[Castle of Burgos]], of a possible Visigothic origin.]]
Burgos was founded in 884 as an outpost of this [[Reconquista|expanding Christian frontier]],&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo F. Ruiz, "The Transformation of the Castilian Municipalities: The Case of Burgos 1248–1350" ''Past and Present'' '''77''' (November 1977, pp. 3–32), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; when Diego Rodríguez "Porcelos", count of [[County of Castile|Castile]], governed this territory with orders to promote the increase of the Christian population; with this end in view he gathered the inhabitants of the surrounding country into one fortified village. The city began to be called ''Caput Castellae'' ("Cabeza de Castilla" or "Head of Castile"). The [[County of Castile|county (''condado'') of Castile]], subject to the [[List of Leonese monarchs|Kings of León]], continued to be governed by counts and was gradually extended; one of these counts, Fernán González, established his independence.&lt;ref&gt;It later became the [[Kingdom of Castile]], being sometimes united with Navarre and sometimes with Leon. In the reign of [[St. Ferdinand III]] (c. 1200–1252), Leon and Castile were united, but they continued to be called respectively the Kingdom of Leon and the Kingdom of Castile until the 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Burgos monasterio huelgas lou.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas]], founded in 1180.]]

In the 11th century, the city became the see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Burgos]] and the capital of the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. Burgos was a major stop for pilgrims on the [[French Way]] the most popular path to [[Santiago de Compostela]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Way of St James|Camino de Santiago]] passed directly through the city, where an urban section of it was called the "French Road" (Ruiz 1977:13).&lt;/ref&gt; and a centre of trade between the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the south, which attracted an unusually large foreign merchant population, who became part of the city oligarchy and excluded other foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz 1977:10.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, Burgos was a favourite seat of the [[Crown of Castile|kings of León and Castile]] and a favoured burial site. The ''[[consejo]]'' or [[Medieval commune|urban commune]] of Burgos was firmly in the hands of an oligarchic class of ''caballeros villanos'', the "peasant knights" of Burgos, who provided the monarchs with a mounted contingent: in 1255 and 1266 royal charters granted relief from taxes to those citizens of Burgos who owned horses and could arm themselves, provided that they continue to live within the city walls.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz 1977:6–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The merchant oligarchy succeeded the cathedral chapter as the major purchasers of land after 1250; they carried on their mercantile business in common with municipal or royal functions and sent their sons to England and Flanders to gain experience in overseas trade. A few families within the ''[[hermandad]]es'' or confraternities like the Sarracín and Bonifaz succeeded in monopolising the post of ''[[alcalde]]'', or mayor; a special court, the ''alcalde del rey'' was first mentioned at Burgos in 1281.&lt;ref&gt;Ruis 1977:23.&lt;/ref&gt; By the reign of [[Alfonso X]], the exemption of the non-noble knights and religious corporations, combined with exorbitant gifts and grants to monasteries and private individuals, placed great stress on the economic well-being of the realm.

In the century following the conquest of [[Seville]] (1248) on the Moors, Burgos became a testing ground for royal policies of increasing power against the ''consejo'', in part by encouraging the right to appeal from the ''consejo'' to the king. In 1285, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] added a new body to the ''consejo'' which came to dominate it: the ''jurado'' in charge of collecting taxes and overseeing public works; the king reserved the right to select its members. The city perceived that danger to its autonomy came rather from an uncontrolled aristocracy during royal minorities: Burgos joined the ''hermandades'' of cities that leagued together for mutual protection in 1295 and 1315. In the 14th century, official royal intrusion in city affairs was perceived as a palliative against outbreaks of violence by the large excluded class of smaller merchants and artisans, on whom the tax burden fell. The ''[[alguacil]]'' was the royal official instituted to judge disagreements.

On 9 June 1345, sweeping aside the city government, [[Alfonso XI]] established direct royal rule of Burgos through the ''Regimiento'' of sixteen appointed men.

In 1574, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] made the bishopric a Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Burgos|archbishopric]], at the request of king [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]].

Burgos has been the scene of many wars: with the [[Moors]], the struggles between León and Navarre, and between Castile and [[Aragon]]. In the [[Peninsular War]] against Napoleonic France, the [[siege of Burgos]] (between 19 September to 21 October) was a scene of a withdrawal for [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. Again in the 19th-century [[Carlist]] civil [[wars of the Spanish succession]] Burgos was the scene of a battle. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], Burgos was the base of General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s rebel Nationalist government.

== Geography and climate ==
At an elevation of {{convert|856|m|0|abbr=out}}, the city of Burgos lies in the transition zone between a [[Warm-summer mediterranean|Warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] (Köppen ''Csb'') and an [[Oceanic climate]] (Köppen ''Cfb''), with some [[continental climate|continental]] influence resulting from its distance from the sea and higher altitude.  Burgos' climate features chilly and windy winters, due to altitude and an inland location, which always include snow and temperatures below freezing. Temperature ranges can be extreme and Burgos is drier than Spain's coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|546|mm|1|abbr=on}} and the average annual relative humidity is 72%. In winter, temperatures very often (almost every day) drop below freezing, often reaching temperatures as low as {{convert|-10|°C|0}}, and snowfalls are common, while the summer months see average high temperatures of {{convert|27.5|C|1}}. The lowest recorded temperature in Burgos was {{convert|-21|C|0}} on 20 January 1885. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|39|C|0}} on 13 August 1987.

== Main sights ==
Burgos is rich in ancient churches and convents. The three most notable are the cathedral, with its chapel of the Condestables de Castilla (Lords Constable of Castile), the monastery of Las Huelgas and the [[Carthusian]] monastery of Miraflores. Minor notable churches are San Esteban, San Gil (Sancti Aegidii), San Pedro, San Cosme y San Damián, Santiago (Sancti Jacobi), San Lorenzo and San Lesmes (Adelelmi). The Convento de la Merced, occupied by the [[Jesuits]], and the Hospital del Rey are also of historic and architectural interest.

Among the other interesting architectural structures, in the walls of the city are the famous gateway of Santa María, erected for the first entrance of the [[Emperor Charles V]], and the arch of Fernán González.

===Gothic Cathedral===
{{Main article|Burgos Cathedral}}
Construction on Burgos' [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Cathedral began in 1221 and spanned mainly from the 13th to 15th centuries. It has been declared a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The west front is flanked by towers terminating in octagonal spires covered with open stonework traceries. The middle section, which serves as an entrance, has three alabaster pilasters, the intercolumnar spaces bearing panel-pictures representing the martyrdom of saints. The façade possessed&lt;!--When?--&gt; ornate and fantastic surface decoration.

The octagonal chapel of the Condestable, in florid, thus highly sculpted, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] design, has a roof finished with balustraded turrets, needle-pointed pinnacles and statues. In the lower portion, coats of arms, shields and crouching lions have been worked into the ensemble. The exterior of the sacristy is decorated with carved traceries, figures of angels and armoured knights. The elaborate [[tabernacle]] is composed of two octagonal sections in [[Corinthian style]].

===Monasterio de las Huelgas===
{{Main article|Las Huelgas}}
The ''Monasterio de las Huelgas Reales'' (Monastery of the Royal Retreats) on the outskirts of the city, was founded in 1180 by king [[Alfonso VIII]], and was begun in a pre-Gothic style, although almost every style has been introduced over many additions. The remarkable cloisters have been described as "unrivalled for beauty both of detail and design, and perhaps unsurpassed by anything in its age and style in any part of Europe" (1911 Encyclopædia Britannica). One cloister has semicircular arches with delicate and varied columns; the other has an ogival style of early Gothic. The interior of the church has enormous columns supporting its magnificent vault; the entrance is modern. This convent historically benefited from extraordinary privileges granted to its abbess by kings and popes.

===Miraflores Charterhouse===
{{Main article|Miraflores Charterhouse}}
The [[Carthusian]] monastery, Miraflores Charterhouse (''Cartuja de Miraflores'') is situated about four kilometres from the historic city center. Among the treasures of the Charterhouse are the wooden statue of [[Bruno of Cologne|St. Bruno]], the wooden choir stalls in the church and the tombs of King [[John II of Castile|Juan II]] and of his spouse, Queen [[Isabella of Portugal, Queen of Castile|Isabella of Portugal]], constructed of marble and with their [[recumbent effigy|recumbent effigies]] sculpted in [[alabaster]]. Around the top frieze are statues of angels in miniature. The French soldiers in the [[Spanish War of Independence]] (1814) mutilated this beautiful work, cutting off some of the heads and carrying them away to France. King Juan II's daughters by his first wife, heiresses Princessses [[Catherine, Princess of Asturias|Catherine]] and [[Eleanor, Princess of Asturias|Eleanor]] of [[Principality of Asturias|Asturias]], are also buried in the monastery.

[[File:Museo Fadrique Basiela 1.JPG|thumb|Book Museum]]

=== Museum of Human Evolution ===
The Museum of Human Evolution was inaugurated on 13 July 2010. Its foundation is based on the archeological site of Atapuerca located {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Burgos. The Atapuerca site has been designated a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. It contains several caves, where fossils and stone tools of the earliest known [[hominid]]s in West Europe have been found, near [[Atapuerca Mountains]].

The museum also allows the visitor to travel to the archaeological site and biological park.

=== Museum of Burgos ===
It summarizes the history of the [[province of Burgos]]. It has important objects and documents from all the ages, starting from Atapuerca, passing to the Romans and Iberians, and finishing in the contemporary period.

The museum is located in the renaissances palaces, the House of Íñigo Angulo and the House of Miranda, which has a main patio that structures the museum.

[[File:Hospital Del Rey UBU.JPG|thumb|300px|center|University of Burgos]]

'''International University Isabel I of Castile'''

Based in Burgos, it is a new-developed private online university which became operational during 2013. It offers distance and some classroom education. This University has been promoted by Education Campus of Castile and Leon.

The photos below are taken from a very popular view point that requires quite a hike up stairs to El Castillo (the castle). There visitors can see all of Burgos. During special events throughout the year, visitors can see a firework display from that same view point.

== Parks and recreation ==
[[File:Parque El Parral.jpg|thumb|right|Parque El Parral]]
[[File:Paseo Isla Lejanía.JPG|thumb|La Isla]]
Most of the parks in the city of Burgos can be found along the river Arlanzón. Indeed, the banks of the river itself constitute a green corridor along the city. In total, there are nearly 3 square miles (1,878 acres) of parks in Burgos and one tree for every 3 inhabitants.

* '''Parque del Castillo''' (or the Castle Park) is one of the lungs of the city. The city grew from the southern foot of the hill of the castle. Gradually, some of the upper neighborhoods began disappearing. After the destruction of the castle, military installations were established there. In the 1950s, the engineer Jaquotot Mariano, who later became mayor of the city, decided to leave the hill completely bare. Besides the ruins of the castle, this park contains the ''Bird Conservation Center''. It also has play areas for children and exercise. Also, there is a terraced area with gardens and an ornamental fountain. The highlight of the park is the viewpoint from which you get a great view of the city, especially the cathedral. A metal plaque on the rail at the vista point helps to identify the most characteristic places of the city. The park contains the unique view of the city of Burgos from the viewpoint of the Castle.
[[File:Panorámica de Burgos desde el Mirador del Castillo.jpg|thumb|650px|center|Panoramic of Burgos from the vista point of the ''Parque del Castillo'']]

* '''Fuentes Blancas''' is Burgos' most visited large park extending east from the city along the river Arlanzón. It contains a network of walking and biking paths and includes camping and various outdoor recreational activities.
* '''Paseo del Espolón''' is the tree-lined promenade that is the most emblematic of Burgos. It's situated along the banks of the river Arlanzón, and consists of a landscaped walk that goes from the theater square to the Arc de Santa Maria, passing shops and cafes. It's a popular social spot for residents during the warm summer months.
[[File:Summer on the "Paseo del Espolón".jpg|thumb|300px|center|Summer on the "Paseo del Espolón"]]
* '''Paseo de la Isla''' is another one of Burgos' beautiful tree-lined garden walks. It passes by the Palacio de la Isla which served as one of Franco's headquarters during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is currently the Language Institute of Castilian and Leonese.
* '''Parque de El Parral''' is located at the old "Hospital del Rey", a former hospital for pilgrims of the "[[Way of St. James|Way of Saint James]]", now part of the [[University of Burgos]] campus

== Economy ==
Burgos is a rich city, with a GDP above the Spain average. It is an important trade and tourist center with some manufacturing.

[[File:Wheat fields in Burgos.jpg|thumb|Wheat fields in the outskirts of Burgos]]

=== Agriculture ===
Wheat is a major crop. The city is surrounded by wheat fields.

=== Secondary sector ===
Burgos is a very industrial city, with a secondary sector widely developed. The city has the biggest industrial park of north Spain, called ''[[Villalonquéjar]]''.

The city is the headquarters of [[Grupo Antolin]], designer and manufacturer of interior automotive components.

It is also the headquarters for south [[Europe]] [[Benteler International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tertiary sector ===
It employs the bigger percentage in the city and is represented by the public sector (production, delivery and allocation of goods and services), due to the capital status.

== Culture ==
The city has a complete culture infrastructure, remarked by the [[Auditorio y Palacio de Congresos de Burgos]], which opened in mid-2012.

=== Language ===
[[Spanish language|Spanish]], also called Castilian, originated in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and spread throughout the Crown of Castile's possessions following the [[reconquista]]. It was eventually dispersed throughout the Spanish empire following the conquest and colonization of the Americas, and Spain after the union of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]'s kingdoms being co-spoken with other languages. Of the many different variations and dialects found throughout the world, it's argued that the purest Spanish can be found in the region of Burgos due to the fact that the language first developed here in the 10th-century.

The Spanish language can be traced back to the monastery of Valpuesta located {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city of Burgos. The [[Cartularies of Valpuesta|Valpuesta cartularies]] are significant in the history of the Spanish language, and their status as manuscripts containing the earliest words written in Spanish has been officially recognised.
The first utterings of Spanish continued in the "Silos Glosses", recorded in the Burgos monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spain.info/en/conoce/grandes-rutas/rutas/camino_de_la_lengua_castellana/ |title=Travel routes in Spain: The Route of the Spanish language in Spain &amp;#124; Spain.info in english |publisher=Spain.info |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326163556/http://www.spain.info/en/conoce/grandes-rutas/rutas/camino_de_la_lengua_castellana |archivedate=26 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Queso De Burgos 002.JPG|thumb|left|Queso de Burgos]]
[[File:Morcilla-burgos 2.jpg|thumb|left|Fried slices of Morcilla de Burgos]]

=== Cuisine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Burgos province is famous in gastronomy for:

'''Queso de Burgos''', a white cheese which is soft and unctuous (because it is made with whey). Although originally made with sheep's milk, now cow's milk or mixtures are more common. Each ''[[comarca]]'' (rural district) produces a minor variation, and the major dairies produce an industrial product that is acceptable for people with sensitive digestion.

Burgos is blessed with a moderate climate and this fresh cheese was able to be conserved there without the need for curing of more than 10 days. With the improvement of aseptic industrial production processes this can be extended to about 30 days at a cool 6&amp;nbsp;°C. Its production reaches 35,000 tons annually.

'''Morcilla de Burgos''', a pig's-blood sausage ([[black pudding]]), is a staple country food famous across the Iberian peninsula. Spiced with onions and herbs its most noticeable content is rice (often mistaken for fat) which makes it one of the lightest and healthiest products of its kind. Oral tradition says that it must be "salty, smooth and piquant" (see Spanish pages {{ill|Burgos (desambiguación)|es}} for details). As with the Queso de Burgos, several comarcas or towns in the province ([[Cardeñadijo]], [[Sotopalacios]], Aranda de Duero, [[Briviesca]], [[Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias|Covarrubias]], [[Villarcayo]], [[Trespaderne]], [[Miranda de Ebro]]...) made their own morcillas, with minor variations between them.

Even though Burgos is not on a D.O.  wine is a fundamental piece in local gastronomy thanks to nearby wine cellars from Ribera de Duero, Rioja and [[Arlanza (comarca)|Arlanza]] D.O.

== Transportation ==

=== Burgos Airport ===
[[Burgos Airport]] is located only {{convert|5|km|2|abbr=on}} from the city centre, with daily flights to [[Barcelona]] International Airport, and during spring and summer to [[Palma de Mallorca]] and [[Paris Orly]].

[[File:Burgos Rosa de Lima train station.jpg|thumb|Burgos Rosa de Lima train station]]

=== Railway ===
[[File:HighSpeedSpain.svg|thumb|right|Map of the Spanish high-speed railway network.]]
The city is considered a first-class rail route through which one rail lines circulate, operated by [[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]]: Madrid-Irun. The faster trains use the AVE line between Madrid and Valladolid.

2010 marked 150 years since the arrival of the first railway to the city; the first train was present on 25 October 1860. Madrid was joined with the French border and this was considered the main route of railway communication between Spain and Europe. Located at the halfway point, Burgos soon become an important hub of communications between the centre and the north.

Since December 2007, the city has been connected to the main provincial capitals by high-speed service [[Alvia]]. It also provides other services, middle and long distance, which connect with the main population centres of the country. 18 long distance trains and 12 middle distance trains circulate through the station each day, which results in around 330,000 yearly users.

The new railway station was opened on 12 December 2008 under the name Burgos-Rosa de Lima, belonging to ADIF. It is located in the neighbourhood of Villímar, northeast of the city, and has been adapted for the future arrival of the [[AVE]]. Bus 25 will take you direct to the city centre.

In 2017, [[AVE]] high speed trains will serve the city, connecting it to cities such as [[Madrid]] in only 84 minutes, or [[Bilbao]] in 70 minutes.

=== Trams ===
A project to implement a tram for the city has been planned, which would run the length of the Boulevard, officially called the Avenida de Valencia. It would consist of a line of about {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} long and will originate from the Burgos-Rosa de Lima railway station and end at the [[University of Burgos]]. Its cost is estimated between 80 and 120 million euros.

Due to the economic crisis and real estate, the project has been postponed temporarily until further funding becomes available. In February 2010 work began on the development of the Boulevard, which reserves a lane for public transport: first buses, and eventually the tram.

=== Bus ===
Burgos has an international bus station located in the city centre, just one hundred meters from the [[Cathedral of Burgos|Cathedral]]. It connects the city with nearly every region of Spain, as well as with a wide number of European ([[Amsterdam]], [[Basel]], [[Bern]], [[Bratislava]], [[Brussels]], [[Cologne]], [[Hamburg]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Geneva]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Kiev]], [[Lisbon]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Lviv]], [[Łódź]], [[London]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Moscow]], [[Munich]], [[Nice]], [[Paris]], [[Porto]], [[Prague]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Sofia]], [[The Hague]], [[Warsaw]], [[Zürich]]) and even [[North African]] ([[Casablanca]], [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]]) cities.

[[File:Bicibur.jpg|thumb|Bicibur]]
[[File:Caril Bici Burgos.jpg|thumb|Burgos' city bike network]]

=== Bicycle ===
The city has its own public bicycle rental system, called ''Bicibur''. It has been designed by a local company and has more than 20 points of distribution throughout the city. A network of over {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} of bicycle lanes net the city making it the 6th largest bicycle lane network in Spain and the first in kilometres per resident.

=== Sustainable mobility ===
Burgos has undertaken many efforts concerning sustainable mobility, and it won the CiViTAs City of the Year in 2007, the most important Award at the European level and the Energy Globe Award in 2008 (the sustainability Nobel awards) in the Air Category for the same reason. The city is the leader among Spanish cities in terms of sustainable mobility with big efforts for a city centre free of cars, a free bicycle loan system and 100% clean public transport. Burgos now leads the CiViNET Network of cities concerned with sustainable mobility in Spain and Portugal.

The mayors of Bruges in [[Belgium]]'s [[Flemish Region]] and Burgos signed a treaty on 29 January 2007 in Bruges's city hall for future cooperation. This engagement could be seen as a prologue on the opening of the exhibition Comeliness and Madness. This exhibition on king [[Philip the Handsome]] -who also ruled the Burgundian countries- took place in the Casa del Cordón in Burgos where the monarch died. On 30 January 2007, the exhibition opened in Bruges, the city where Philip the Handsome was born and where the urn with his heart is kept in [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges|Onthaalkerk O.L.V. (the Church of Our Lady)]].

Burgos and San Juan de los Lagos sponsor and coordinate activities between both populations.

[[Segundo de Chomón]] filmed a short documentary about this city in 1911.

Burgos is the setting for one of the scenes in the 2010 film "[[The Way (2010 film)|The Way]]" by Emilio Estevez starring his father Martin Sheen.

The '''casebook method''', similar to but not exactly the same as the [[case method]], is the primary method of teaching [[law]] in [[Law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]].  It was pioneered at [[Harvard Law School]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]].  It is based on the principle that rather than studying highly abstract summaries of legal rules (the technique used in most countries), the best way to learn [[Law of the United States|American law]] is to read the actual judicial [[opinion]]s which become the law under the rule of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (due to its Anglo-American [[common law]] origin).

==History and technique==
To set up the case method of law study, American law [[professor]]s traditionally collect the most illustrative cases concerning a particular area of the law in special textbooks called [[casebook]]s.  Some professors heavily edit cases down to the most important paragraphs, while deleting nearly all citations and paraphrasing everything else; a few present all cases in full, and most others are in between.  One common technique is to provide almost all of the entire text of a landmark case which created an important legal rule, followed by brief notes summarizing the holdings of other cases which further refined the rule.  
  
Traditionally, the casebook method is coupled with the [[Socratic method]] in American law schools.  For a given class, a professor will assign several cases from the casebook to read, and may also require students to be familiar with any notes following those cases.  In class, the professor will ask students questions about the assigned cases to determine whether they identified and understood the correct rule from the case, if there is one—in certain heavily contested areas of the law, there will ''not'' be any ''one'' correct rule.

A typical example in the law of contracts is ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' (1854), a case that is still routinely tested on bar examinations today.  Treatises designed for practicing lawyers as well as textbooks for students earning non-legal degrees (i.e., business law courses for business administration students) concisely state the famous rules announced in that case that (1) consequential damages are limited to those foreseen by the parties at the time of contracting, thus implying that (2) a party must notify the other up front of its specific needs in order to expand what is mutually foreseeable and thereby recover consequential damages if the other breaches.  Thus stated, ''Hadley'' seems simple enough, but a casebook for a law school course will ''never'' say that.  Rather, the law student must deduce those principles from the somewhat archaic text of the Court of Exchequer's mid-19th-century decision.

This teaching method differs in two ways from the teaching methods used in most other academic programs: (1) it requires students to work almost exclusively with primary source material, which can be written in obscure or obsolete language for older cases; and (2) a typical American law school class is supposed to be a dialogue about the meaning of a case, not a straightforward lecture.

In some law schools, the casebook method is used in conjunction with lectures or other more structured forms of instruction.  This is especially true in classes which are more heavily geared toward [[statutory law]], such as [[tax law]] (which in the USA is governed by the [[Internal Revenue Code]]) and certain areas of [[commercial law]] (particularly courses dealing with the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]).

This method is also used in other [[common law]] countries, including [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

===Law school outlines===
To facilitate the case method of study, "law school outlines" are used as legal topic [[study aid]]s. Typically, the outlines are created by [[law school]] students; however, there are professional outlines also available.  An outline typically provides a concise and direct statement of legal issues in a particular area of [[law]], organized according to the typical law school [[curriculum]]. In some cases, outlines are organized according to specific professors or courses. Outlines often remove many legal nuances and fact specific distinctions in [[case law]] to establish more generalized legal principles.  Students must remember to be cautious before relying on outlines written by others found on online databases.  They frequently come with copyright notices and may often be outdated.  Many such sites also warn their users that relying on these outlines alone will not be sufficient to prepare for an exam and they should only be used as a supplement to the studying process.

A '''century''' (from the [[Latin]] ''centum'', meaning ''one hundred''; abbreviated '''c.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/how-to-use-the-oed/abbreviations/|title = Oxford English Dictionary – List of Abbreviations.|date = |accessdate
 = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a period of [[100 (number)|100]] [[year]]s. Centuries are numbered [[names of numbers in English#Ordinal numbers|ordinally]] in [[English language|English]] and many other languages.

A '''centenary''' is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier.

== Start and end in the Gregorian calendar ==
Although a century can mean any arbitrary period of 100 years, there are two viewpoints on the nature of standard centuries. One is based on strict construction, while the other is based on popular perspective (general usage). 

According to the strict construction of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the 1st century AD began with 1 AD and ended with 100 AD, with the same pattern continuing onward. In this model, the ''n''-th century started/will start on the year ''(100 × n) − 99'' and ends in ''100 × n''. Because of this, a century will only include one year, the centennial year, that starts with the century's number (e.g. '''19'''00 was the last year of the 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/millennium.php | title=The 21st Century and the 3rd Millennium | publisher=U.S. Naval Observatory | work=aa.usno.navy.mil/ | date=14 June 2011 | accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general usage, centuries are aligned with [[decades]] by grouping years based on their shared digits. In this model, the 'n' -th century started/will start on the year ''(100 x n) - 100'' and ends in ''(100 x n) - 1''. For example, the 20th century is generally regarded as from 1900 to 1999, inclusive. This is sometimes known as the [[odometer]] effect. The [[astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] systems both contain a year zero, so the first century begins with the year zero, rather than the year one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = century | work = Oxford Dictionaries| accessdate = 10 May 2018| url = https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative naming systems ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Informally, years may be referred to in groups based on the hundreds part of the year. In this system, the years 1900–1999 are referred to as the ''nineteen hundreds'' (''1900s''). Aside from English usage, this system is used in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. The Swedish ''nittonhundratalet'' (or ''1900-talet''), Danish ''nittenhundredetallet'' (or ''1900-tallet''), Norwegian ''nittenhundretallet'' (or '' 1900-tallet'') and Finnish ''tuhatyhdeksänsataaluku'' (or ''1900-luku'') refer unambiguously to the years 1900–1999.

== Similar dating units in other calendar systems ==
While the century has been commonly used in the West, other cultures and calendars have utilized differently sized groups of years in a similar manner. The [[Hindu calendar]], in particular, summarizes its years into groups of 60,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.vedavidyalaya.com|url=http://www.vedavidyalaya.com/varsham.htm|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Aztec calendar]] considers groups of 52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.aztec-history.com|url=http://www.aztec-history.com/aztec-calendar.html|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}

'''Cognitive anthropology''' is an approach within [[cultural anthropology]] in which scholars seek to explain patterns of shared knowledge, [[cultural]] [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge, in the sense of what they think subconsciously, changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Cognitive anthropology has strong ties to [[ethnoscience]] and [[linguistics]].

==Scope==
Cognitive anthropology studies a range of domains including folk taxonomies, the interaction of language and thought, and cultural models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From a linguistics stand-point, cognitive anthropology uses language as the doorway to study cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Quinn|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its general goal is to break language down to find commonalities in different cultures and the ways people perceive the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Colby|Fernandez|Kronenfeld|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linguistic study of cognitive anthropology may be broken down into three subfields: [[semantics]], [[syntactics]], and [[pragmatics]].

==Methods==
In contrast to traditional ethnographic methods in cultural anthropology, cognitive anthropology primarily uses quantitative methodologies in order to study culture. Because of the field's interest in determining shared knowledge, [[consensus analysis]] has been used as its most widely used statistical measure.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the techniques used is [[Cultural Network Analysis]], the drawing of networks of interrelated ideas that are widely shared among members of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sieck|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently there has been some interchange between cognitive anthropologists and those working in artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gomm|2009|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with cognitive science==
Anthropology is one of six fields which contributed to the founding of [[cognitive science]]. However, anthropology has been criticised for being detached from cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bender|first1=Andrea|last2=Hutchins|first2=Edwin|last3=Medin|first3=Douglas|title=Anthropology in Cognitive Science|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|date=8 March 2010|volume=2|issue=3|pages=374–385|doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01082.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01082.x/abstract|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creative limitation''' is the concept of how purposely limiting oneself can actually drive creativity. At a 2013 [[TED (conference) |TED conference]], artist [[Phil Hansen (artist)|Phil Hansen]] made several remarks concerning the value of limitations, among them that "We need to first be limited in order to become limitless,” and “If you treat the problems as possibilities, life will start to dance with you in the most amazing ways.”&lt;ref name=TED.com group=TED.com&gt;{{cite web|last=May|first=Kate Torgovnick|url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/05/can-limitations-make-you-more-creative-a-qa-with-artist-phil-hansen/|title=Can limitations make you more creative? A Q&amp;A with artist Phil Hansen|work=Writer|publisher=TED Blog|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative limitation can also be thought of as a way to achieve a novel effect or goal that is not otherwise possible using [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], readily accessible, methods. [[Igor Stravinsky]] used what he called creative limitation with [[time signature]]s, by restricting himself from using any, in his [[musical composition|composition]] '[[The Rite of Spring]]' as well as in alternate aspects of his other musical works.

The '''Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex''', also known as '''CCP Complex''', is an {{convert|88|ha|adj=on}} owned by The [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] (CCP) located along [[Roxas Boulevard]] in [[Metro Manila]], Philippines, most of which fall under the jurisdiction of the city of [[Pasay]].&lt;ref group="note" name="Manila Note II"/&gt; 

Development of the complex was stalled until 2000, when the Philippine Supreme Court ruled with finality the CCP's ownership of some {{convert|35|ha}} of prime real estate in the complex. The property is {{convert|62.4|ha}} of land, with the rest being occupied by the [[Government Service Insurance System]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], and the Privatization and Management Office. It is part of [[Bay City, Metro Manila|Bay City]] (formerly Boulevard 2000) that spans {{convert|1500|ha}} of reclaimed land along [[Manila Bay]] which is occupied by the [[SM Prime Holdings|SM]] Central Business Park, [[Philippine National Bank]]'s Financial Center Area, and [[PAGCOR]]'s [[Entertainment City]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pea.gov.ph/programs-and-projects/reclamation |title=Reclamation |publisher=Philippine Reclamation Authority |accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The complex is bounded by the Manila Bay to the north and west, the [[Philippine Navy]] headquarters to the northeast, Roxas Boulevard to the east, and [[Jose Diokno Boulevard]] to the south. It is divided into two zones: the Art Zone, and the Commercial and Entertainment Zone.&lt;ref name="ccp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pea.gov.ph/13-bay-city/24-cultural-center-of-the-philippines |title=Cultural Center of the Philippines |publisher=Philippine Reclamation Authority |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features several [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] structures designed in the 1960s and 1970s by [[Leandro Locsin]], such as the [[Tanghalang Pambansa]], the [[Philippine International Convention Center]], and the [[Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila]]. Other locators in the complex include the [[Coconut Palace]], the [[Manila Film Center]] and [[Star City (amusement park)|Star City]] amusement park.&lt;ref name="ccp"/&gt;

==Buildings==

===Tanghalang Pambansa===
{{Main|Tanghalang Pambansa}}
[[File:Ccp ext 1.jpg|thumb|Façade of the [[Tanghalang Pambansa]]]]
The [[Tanghalang Pambansa]] ({{lang-en|National Theater}}) is the flagship venue and principal offices of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]. Formally called the Theater of Performing Arts, it houses three major performing arts venues, one theater for film screenings, galleries, a museum and the center's library and archives. 

* '''Tanghalang [[Nicanor Abelardo]] (Main Theater)'''
* '''Tanghalang [[Aurelio Tolentino]] (Little Theater)'''
* '''Tanghalang Huseng Batute (Studio Theater)'''

Designed by National Artist for Architecture [[Leandro Locsin]], its design was based and expanded upon the unconstructed Philippine-American Friendship Center. The ''Tangahalan'' is a primary example of the architect's signature style known as the floating volume, a trait can be seen in structures indigenous to the Philippines such as the [[nipa hut]]. Being a work of a National Artist, the [[brutalist]] structure is qualified to be an important cultural landmark as stipulated in Republic Act No. 10066.&lt;ref name="CCPRA10066"&gt;Republic Act No. 10066 "Providing for the protection and conservation of the national cultural heritage, strengthening the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and its affiliated cultural agencies, and for other purposes". Full Text available [http://www.unesconatcom.ph/docs/culture/NatlCulturalHeritage%20Act2009.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanghalang Fransisco Balagtas===
[[File:MetroManilajf9625 23.JPG|thumb|[[Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas]]]]
{{main|Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas}}
The [[Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas]], more commonly known by its original name of Folk Arts Theater, is a covered [[proscenium]] [[amphitheater]] is where popular concerts are usually staged. It has a seating capacity of 8,458 in ten sections. The building was originally built to seat an audience of 10,000 and was commissioned by then [[First Lady of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]] in 1974 for the [[Miss Universe]] Pageant, which was to be held in Manila. The theater was built in record time of seventy-seven days in time for the pageant and was designed by [[Leandro V. Locsin]].

It was host to many popular musical acts of the 1980s onwards, including [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] group [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], British pop group [[5ive]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Gary Valenciano]] and [[Jay R Sillona|Jay R]]. The Folk Arts Theater is also used as a site by different religious groups. [[Day by Day Christian Ministries]], a large international religious organization, has leased the area since 2005. They have dedicated the Theatre as ''Bulwagan ng Panginoón'' ({{lang-en|Hall of the [[Tetragrammaton|Lord]]}}). The building is expected to be torn down in the future, subject to the development of the Complex.

===Other buildings===
[[File:MFCjf0093 35.JPG|thumb|[[Philippine International Convention Center]]]]
The CCP Complex is also home to the following:
* [[Philippine International Convention Center]] (Owned by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas|BSP]])
* [[Manila Film Center]] (CCP)
* [[Coconut Palace]] ([[Government Service Insurance System|GSIS]])
* [[Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila]] ([[Government Service Insurance System|GSIS]])

==History==
The Cultural Center of the Philippines was conceived in 1966 when Ferdinand Marcos issued Executive Order No. 60, establishing its board and arranging for his wife Imelda to become chair of its Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=CCPLicoEdifice&gt;{{cite book |last=Lico |first=Gerald |title=Edifice Complex: Power, Myth and Marcos State Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |location=Quezon City, Philippines |isbn=978-971-550-435-5 |pages=178 p}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CCPSanctuary&gt;{{cite news |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |title=Sanctuary for the Filipino Soul |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/10643/sanctuary-of-the-filipino-soul |accessdate=10 October 2011 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine-American Culture Foundation provided a Ninety Thousand Peso Grant for its construction and additional funds were taken from the Cultural Development Fund and the Special Fund for Education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edifice complex : power, myth, and Marcos state architecture|last=Gerard.|first=Lico|date=2003|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-9715504355|location=Quezon City|oclc=53371189}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became the premier symbol of what would be called Imelda's [[edifice complex]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Expansion==
A comprehensive master plan for the development of the complex was unveiled in 2003. The plan would divide the CCP Complex into six clusters, each of which will be anchored by a major building. First, the Promenade, which will tentatively be named after Lucresia Reyes-Urtula, will include retail and other mixed-use facilities, as well as dock facilities. The second cluster will be the Arts Sanctuary, which will serve as the complex's cultural core. To be anchored by the Tanghalang Pambansa, it will contain a new performing arts theater, the artists' center, a [[bandstand]], the CCP's Production Design Center, as well as other open areas.

The third cluster, the Green Zone will contain a mix of museums, parks with commercial and office spaces. Fourth, the Creative Hub cluster, containing spaces for creative industries. Fifth, The Arts Living Room, envisioned to be a high-density, high-rise area that will house condominiums and similar residential projects. The final cluster, the Breezeway, will be located by low-rise, low-density commercial structures with seafront entertainment facilities. Covered walkways, plazas, and bicycle lanes are planned to connect the various buildings and clusters to ensure a pedestrian-centered design. The master plan is envisioned to be completed in four phases, from 2004 to 2014; ₱5 billion will be needed for the plan's first five years, and another ₱8 billion for the plan's latter half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=5398 ‘Commercialized’ CCP embraces the poor]. ''ABS-CBN News Online''. Retrieved 3 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A design contest was held in 2005 to design the first two clusters. Three firms won for their concepts; Syndicated Architects, Manalang-Tayag-Ilano Architects, and JPA Buensalido Design. The concepts of each winner will then be presented to prospective investors and stakeholders for approval.&lt;ref&gt;3 architect groups win CCP design contest. ''ABS-CBN News Online''.

&lt;/center&gt;

In 2011, Leandro V. Locsin Partners, Architects won the design contest for the Artists' Center and Performing Arts Theater, the two buildings that will anchor the Promenade and Arts Sanctuary Clusters respectively.&lt;ref name="CCPDesignContest2011-1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Architectural Design Competition Exhibit Opens at CCP |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/231474/cbb/architectural-design-competition-exhibit-opens-at-ccp |accessdate=3 March 2012 |newspaper=GMA News Online |date=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed Artists' Center will house offices and rehearsal spaces for the CCP's resident companies, a black box theater and rooms for educational programs.&lt;ref name=CCPDesign1&gt;CCP Architectural Design Competition Background Information.

Retrieved 9 October 2011 Full Text available [http://culturalcenter.gov.ph/UserFiles/ccp//forms/Background%20Information%20-%20CCP%20Design%20Competition.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt; The winning design is akin to a traditional [[Badjao]] village or a mangrove forest, with rooms and pavilions supported by slim pilotis. The proposed Performing Arts Theater will contain a 1,000 seat conventional proscenium theater and a black box that will seat 300-500 people.&lt;ref name=CCPDesign1/&gt; In contrast with the ''Tanghalang Pambansa's'' massive travertine block, the façade of the new theater will be dominated by its main seating bowl clad in reflective material, evoking a wave rising out of the sea. On January 19, 2016, construction of a new black box theater started with the aim of eventually integrating the new structure into the proposed Performing Arts Theater. Estimated to cost ₱50 million, the new theater will be three to four times bigger than the Tanghalang Huseng Batute, the current black box facility of the CCP.&lt;ref name="CCPNewBlackbox"&gt;{{cite news |title=After 3 decades–and ‘against all odds’–CCP breaks ground on a new theater |url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/221508/after-3-decades-and-against-all-odds-ccp-breaks-ground-on-a-new-theater |accessdate=14 December 2016 |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=note|refs=
&lt;ref name="Manila Note II"&gt;The Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex lies between [[Pasay]] and the [[City of Manila]]. The boundary between the cities is Vicente Sotto Street. Landmarks in CCP Complex that lies within the City of Manila include the Tanghalang Pambansa (National Theater), the Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas (Folks Art Theater), and the [[Coconut Palace]] which is owned by the [[Government Service Insurance System]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Double-talk''' is a form of speech in which inappropriate, invented, or [[nonsense]] words are used to give the appearance of knowledge and so confuse or amuse the audience.

'''The End Poverty in California movement''' ('''EPIC''') was a political campaign started in 1934 by socialist writer [[Upton Sinclair]] (best known as author of ''[[The Jungle]]'').  The movement formed the basis for Sinclair’s campaign for [[Governor of California]] in 1934. The plan called for a massive [[public works]] program, sweeping tax reform, and guaranteed pensions. It gained major popular support, with thousands joining End Poverty Leagues across the state. EPIC never came to fruition due to Sinclair’s defeat in the 1934 election, but is seen as an influence on [[New Deal]] programs enacted by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

==Plan==
Sinclair laid out his vision for EPIC in his 1933 book ''I, Governor of California, and How I ended Poverty: A True Story of the Future''.&lt;ref name=iGovernor&gt;{{cite book |first=Upton |last=Sinclair |author-link=Upton Sinclair |title=I, Governor of California, and How I Ended Poverty: A True Story of the Future |year=1933 |publisher=Farrar &amp; Rinehart |location=New York |ol=23128567M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the plan called for state seizure of idle factories and farm land where the owner had failed to pay property taxes.The government would then hire the unemployed to work on the farms and at the factories. The farms would then operate as self-sufficient, worker-run co-ops. EPIC also called for the implementation of California’s first state income tax.The tax was to be [[progressive tax|progressive]], with the wealthiest being taxed at 30%.  The plan would also have increased inheritance taxes and instituted a 4% tax on stock transfers.  EPIC also included government provided pensions for the old, disabled, and widowed.  To implement EPIC, Sinclair called for the creation of three new government agencies: the California Authority for Land (CAL), the California Authority for Production (CAP), and the California Authority for Money (CAM).  CAL was to implement the plan for seizure and cultivation of unused farm lands.  CAP was to do the same for idle factories.  CAM meanwhile was to be used to finance CAL and CAP by issuing scrip to workers and issues bonds for the purchase of lands, factories, and machinery.

==Campaign==
After two previous unsuccessful runs for Governor as a member of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], Sinclair was encouraged by the election of President Roosevelt in 1932 to switch his affiliation to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in September 1933. A grassroots movement soon formed in support of EPIC, with thousands joining End Poverty Leagues across the state. A weekly newspaper, the ''EPIC News'', appeared in support of the plan, and reached a circulation of nearly a million by the time of the [[California gubernatorial election, 1934|gubernatorial primary election in August 1934]].  Several EPIC-supporting candidates won their primaries for [[California State Assembly]] and [[California State Senate|Senate]] seats. Sinclair did not receive full support from the party establishment, however, and Roosevelt refused to endorse him, seeing the EPIC plan as too radical.

The Socialist party in California and nationwide refused to allow its members to be active in any other party including the Democratic Party and expelled him, along with socialists who supported his California campaign.  The expulsions destroyed the Socialist party in California.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Gregory, "Upton Sinclair's 1934 EPIC Campaign: Anatomy of a Political Movement." ''Labor'' 12#4 (2015): 51-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

EPIC faced major opposition by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and major media figures. Opponents of EPIC “organized the most lavish and creative dirty-tricks campaign ever seen—one that was to become a landmark in American politics”  involving “turning over a major campaign to outside advertising, publicity, media and fundraising consultants for the first time.”&lt;ref name=Nation /&gt; Notable among these opponents were the heads of the major movie studios in Hollywood.  This was largely due to Sinclair’s proposal to hand over idle movie studio lots to unemployed film workers to make movies of their own.  In reaction, the studio heads threatened to move film operations to Florida, and deducted money from employee’s paychecks to give directly to the campaign of Sinclair’s Republican opponent for governor, [[Frank Merriam]].  In addition, two of the state’s most influential media moguls, [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Harry Chandler]] used their papers to solely cover Merriam’s campaign and to attack Sinclair.  

In the face of this coordinated opposition, and without the backing of Roosevelt, Sinclair began trailing Merriam in the polls. On November 6, 1934, Merriam defeated Sinclair with 1,138,629 (48.9%) to Sinclair’s 879,537 (37.8%). Despite his defeat, Sinclair’s vote total was the twice as large as the vote total of any Democratic candidate in California history to that point. In addition, two dozen candidates running on the EPIC platform were elected to the state legislature, including [[Culbert Olson]], who became Governor four years later.&lt;ref name=Nation /&gt;

==Movement==
The EPIC movement continued after Sinclair's defeat.  It "recalled a mayor, kicked out a district attorney, replaced the governor with one of our choice" between 1934 and 1938, according to [[Robert A. Heinlein]], who by then was deputy publisher of the ''EPIC News''.  Heinlein also ran for State Assembly in Hollywood and Beverly Hills in 1938.  He lost, causing him to take up science fiction writing to pay off his campaign debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Off the Main Sequence | author=[[Robert A. Heinlein]] |date=2005 |publisher=Science Fiction Book Club |isbn=1-58288-184-7 |page=xiii |section=Foreword by Michael Cassutt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Despite Sinclair’s defeat, EPIC is recognized as having been very influential in shaping Roosevelt’s [[New Deal]] programs. In late 1934, [[Harry Hopkins]], a senior adviser to Roosevelt who went on to oversee many New Deal programs, proposed an "End Poverty in America" campaign that ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote “differs from Sinclair’s plan in detail, but not in principle.”&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Greg|title=Upton Sinclair's EPIC Campaign |date=November 13, 2011 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/155381/upton-sinclairs-epic-campaign |work=The Nation |accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, California State Supreme Court Justice [[Stanley Mosk]] declared that EPIC was “the acorn from which evolved the tree of whatever liberalism we have in California.”{{Cite quote|date=April 2016}}

'''Febold Feboldson''' is an American [[folk hero]] who was a [[Swedish American]] [[Great Plains|plainsman]] and [[Rainmaking|cloudbuster]] from [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_EkdfqaEvqQC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=%22happy+auger%22&amp;as_brr=3#PPP1,M1 Robert, Paul and Trank, Beath Lynn. Febold Feboldson. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1948.)]&lt;/ref&gt;  His exploits were originally published in 1923 in the ''Gothenburg Independent'' newspaper and the character is now largely considered a part of [[fakelore]] as opposed to a genuine [[folk hero]].

== Origin ==
The first stories of Febold Feboldson were published in newspapers in [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], in 1923.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62179139|title=Nebraska folklore|last=1872-1958.|first=Pound, Louise,|date=2006|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803287887|edition= New |location=Lincoln|oclc=62179139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original creator of Febold Feboldson appears to be Wayne Caroll, a lumber salesman in Gothenburg who used Febold in advertising, essentially as a local variant of [[Paul Bunyan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, due to the lack of trees in the Great Plains region, Feboldson eventually became a strongman rather than a lumberjack, and his prodigious strength was demonstrated through other means in the stories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Caroll and another man, Don Holmes, wrote numerous Febold Feboldson stories between 1928 and 1933, which featured Feboldson taking on Native Americans, politicians, disease outbreaks, [[drought]]s, [[tornado]]es, and even excessive heat and cold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1932, Paul Robert Beath published the first widely-circulated story about Febold Feboldson, "Paul Bunyan and Febold" in the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska - Lincoln's]] literary magazine, ''Prairie Schooner'' (vol. VI, p.&amp;nbsp;59-61).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BEATH|first=PAUL ROBERT|date=1932|title=Paul Bunyan and Febold|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40622289|journal=Prairie Schooner|volume=6|issue=1|pages=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beath's account claims to be based on interviews with Bergstrom Stromberg, an elderly descendant of Feboldson, who was well-acquainted with both Bunyan and Feboldson.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The association with Bunyan gave Febold Feboldson authenticity as a folk hero, despite being a recent creation by Nebraska authors. Beath went on to write about Feboldson in the ''Nebraska Folklore'' pamphlets published by the [[Works Progress Administration|Nebraska Writers' Project]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Status as a folk hero ===
Beath firmly denied the idea that Febold Feboldson was a [[folk hero]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instead, according to Beath, Feboldson was, like all stories, created "by individuals for the entertainment of individuals."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Beath argued that each telling of a Febold Feboldson story was based entirely on the narrative which the individual author wished to tell, rather than being formed from existing folklore or a "[[geist]]" of the culture from which they are born.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to folklorist Louise Pound, Feboldson is an integral part of [[:Category:Nebraska folklore|Nebraska folklore]], due to his rapid rise in popularity in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Pound argues that Febold is part of the "lore of the literary class, the lore of the educated lovers of lore" rather than the general public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This, according to Pound, takes the "folk" element out of Feboldson's status as a figure in folklore, as he is not widely-known by the average Nebraskan who does not seek out folklore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pound further argues that Feboldson could have a trajectory similar to the folklore figure which inspired him, Paul Bunyan, which began as a similarly "literary lore" but has since evolved into folklore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Stories ==
Beath's original story, "Paul Bunyan and Febold," is as much a story about Paul Bunyan as it is about Febold Feboldson. In the story, which attempts to account for the death of [[Babe, the Blue Ox|Babe the Blue Ox]], Feboldson and Bunyan are both portrayed as giants who helped settle the American West. According to the tale, Feboldson and Bunyan met when they were both tasked with reestablishing the Kansas-Nebraska border after Bunyan had turned the allegedly formerly mountainous land of Kansas upside down to reveal its current, flat plains. Bunyan hitched a plough to Babe, but could not plough a straight line, and instead of carving out the border, carved the channel of the [[Republican River]]. In response, Feboldson hybridized bees with eagles to create gigantic bees. Feboldson hitched his plough to the giant bee, which flew off in a perfectly straight "[[wiktionary:bee-line|bee-line]]."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Due to their success, the two giants were sent to fight off the "Dirtylegs tribe" of Native Americans, who were the worst foes on the plains. However, because of the excessive heat of the year, which never fell below 150 degrees, both the giants and the tribe agreed on a truce until cooler weather. As part of their truce, both parties retired to Colorado, to cool off in the shade of the mountains. The Dirtylegs, still too hot, dug caves into the mountains, which accounts for the existence of cave dwellings today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On the journey to the mountains, Babe the Blue Ox became exhausted and fell asleep in the shade of [[Pikes Peak]]. Knowing that the ox would die of hyperthermia when the sun rose the next morning and unable to move the gigantic ox, Febold and Paul pile up rocks around the creature to shade it from the sun. Unfortunately, the rocks only served to help cook the ox whole. Around Christmas, the Dirtylegs left their cave dwellings and, starving from their months of fasting, devoured the ox. They left the rocks which had been piled up around him strewn about the area, which created the [[Garden of the Gods]]. However, the meat of Babe was too much for the stomachs of the Dirtylegs and the entire tribe died after consuming him, which is why no one has ever heard of the Dirtylegs since.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This story is, as is to be expected, entirely fabricated. There is no evidence that any tribe known as the "Dirtylegs" ever existed, nor do they appear to be modeled on a particular tribe. The portrayal of Native Americans as villains, enemies of progress, or obstacles of settlement is consistent with other American folklore and is rooted in ideas of [[Manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]] and the history of the [[American Indian Wars#West_of_the_Mississippi_(1811–1924)#Great Plains|colonization of the American West]].

'''''Grönköpings Veckoblad''''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[satire|satirical]] monthly magazine. The name translates as "''The Grönköping Weekly''", or "''The Greenville Weekly''", Grönköping being a fictional Swedish town.&lt;ref name="sala"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Attardo|title=Encyclopedia of Humor Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjRzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA473|accessdate=12 August 2015|date=18 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-4617-5|page=473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Grönköping predates the magazine; it was first used by [[Albert Engström]] as a headline for some of his drawings in 1895.&lt;ref name="DKG"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Kylhammar|author2= Göran B. Nilsson|year=1997|title=Det klassiska Grönköping: Idyller och paniker|edition=1st|publisher=Fischer &amp; Co|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-7054-835-8|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
Founded in 1902&lt;ref name=sala/&gt; by [[Hasse Zetterström]] as a supplement to ''[[Söndags-Nisse]]'', it became an independent magazine in 1916. The current [[editor in chief]]  of the magazine is Ulf Schöldström.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TTSpektra|url=http://archive.corren.se/archive/2008/9/8/jvptaduw21ry8r6.xml |title=Ny chef för Grönköpings Veckoblad|work=Östgöta Correspondenten|accessdate=22 February 2009|date=8 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parody language [[Transpiranto]], a caricature of [[Esperanto]], was introduced in a 1929 article by [[Nils Hasselskog]],  "World language in Grönköping's school" ("Världsspråk i Grönköpings skola").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gunilla Byrman|url=https://open.lnu.se/index.php/hn/article/view/43/38|title=Europanto eller svenska?|work=HumaNetten|accessdate=27 October 2016|date=20 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grönköping'' has been characterized as a Sweden in miniature. Using bombastic and anachronistic language while purporting to describe and analyse current events in a serious manner, ''Grönköpings Veckoblad'' has become a Swedish institution and a standard for what is considered good satire.&lt;ref name="PIS"&gt;{{cite book

'''Hypernasal speech''' (also '''hyperrhinolalia''' or '''open nasality'''; medically known as '''Rhinolalia aperta''' from greek ''rhinolalia'': "nasal speech" and ''aperta'': "open") is a disorder that causes abnormal [[resonance]] in a human's voice due to increased [[airflow]] through the nose during speech. It is caused by an open [[nasal cavity]] resulting from an incomplete closure of the [[soft palate]] and/or velopharyngeal sphincter.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In normal speech, '''nasality''' is referred to as [[nasalization]] and is a linguistic category that can apply to vowels or consonants in a specific language. The primary underlying physical variable determining the degree of nasality in normal speech is the opening and closing of a [[velopharyngeal passage]]way between the oral [[vocal tract]] and the nasal vocal tract.  In the normal vocal tract anatomy, this opening is controlled by lowering and raising the velum or soft palate, to open or close, respectively, the velopharyngeal passageway.

== Anatomy ==
[[File:Head neck vsphincter.png|thumb|Nasal and oral cavities with the velopharyngeal sphincter highlighted in blue]]
The [[palate]] comprises two parts, the [[hard palate|hard palate (palatum durum)]] and the [[Soft palate|soft palate (palatum molle)]], which is connected to the [[uvula]]. The movements of the soft palate and the uvula are made possible by the velopharyngeal sphincter.{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Does the v.sphincter ENABLE or CONTROL the movements?}} During speech or swallowing, the soft palate lifts against the back throat wall to close the nasal cavity. When producing [[nasal consonants]] (such as "m", "n", and "ng"), the soft palate remains relaxed, thereby enabling the air to go through the nose.

The [[Eustachian tube]], which opens near the velopharyngeal sphincter, connects the [[middle ear]] and [[Human pharynx#Nasopharynx|nasal pharynx]]. Normally, the tube ensures [[aeration]] and drainage (of secretions) of the middle ear. Narrow and closed at rest, it opens during swallowing and yawning, controlled by the [[tensor veli palatini]] and the [[levator veli palatini]] (muscles of the soft palate). Children with a [[cleft palate]] have difficulties controlling these muscles and thus are unable to open the Eustachian tube. Secretions accumulate in the middle ear when the tube remains dysfunctional over a long period of time, which cause hearing loss and [[ear infection|middle ear infections]]. Ultimately, hearing loss can lead to impaired speech and language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Specifieke informatie over schisis per type schisis|url=http://www.schisis.nl/nvsca/pag.php?id=paK&amp;item=pal#palsluit01|publisher=Nederlandse Vereniging voor Schisis en Craniofaciale Afwijkingen|accessdate=20 May 2012|trans-title=Specific information on each type of cleft lip and palate cleft|language=Dutch|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stegenga|first1=B.|last2=Vissink|first2=A.|last3=Bont|first3=L.G.M. de|title=Mondziekten en kaakchirurgie|year=2000|publisher=Van Gorcum|location=Assen|isbn=9789023235002|page=388|trans-title=Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:Cleftpalate3.png|thumb|Incomplete cleft palate]]
The general term for disorders of the velopharyngeal valve is '''velopharyngeal dysfunction''' (VPD). It includes three subterms: velopharyngeal insufficiency, [[velopharyngeal inadequacy]], and velopharyngeal mislearning.
*'''Velopharyngeal insufficiency''' can be caused by an anatomical abnormality of the throat. It occurs in children with a history of cleft palate or submucous cleft, who have short or otherwise abnormal [[Soft palate|vela]]. Velopharyngeal insufficiency can also occur after [[adenoidectomy]].
*'''Velopharyngeal incompetence''' is a defective closure of the velopharyngeal valve due to its lack of speed and precision. It is caused by a neurologic disorder or injury (e.g. [[cerebral palsy]] or traumatic brain injury).
*Sometimes children present no abnormalities yet still have hypernasal speech: this can be due to '''velopharyngeal mislearning''', indicating that the child has been imitating{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Imitating whom?}} or has never learned how to use the valve correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/assets/0/78/759/781/65e90133-9243-4926-a065-8a97951944fb.pdf |last=Kummer |first=Ann W. |title=Speech Therapy for Cleft Palate or Velopharyngeal Dysfunction (VPD) |publisher=Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405093506/http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/assets/0/78/759/781/65e90133-9243-4926-a065-8a97951944fb.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emedicine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/873018-overview#a0101|title=Velopharyngeal Insufficiency|last=Biavati|first=Michael J.|last2=Sie|first2=Kathleen|last3=Wiet|first3=Gregory J.|date=2 September 2011|publisher=WebMD LLC|work=Medscape Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
There are several methods for diagnosing hypernasality.
*A speech therapist listens to and records the child while analysing perceptual speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childrensnyp.org/mschony/otolaryngology-hypernasality.html|title=Otolaryngology (Ear, Nose and Throat)|author=Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital|publisher=Columbia University Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hypernasality, the child cannot produce [[oral consonant|oral sounds]] (vowels and consonants) correctly. Only the nasal sounds can be correctly produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gelder|first=van J.|title=De open neusspraak, pathogenese en diagnostiek|language=Dutch|journal=Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde [Netherlands Journal of Medicine]|year=1957|volume=101|pages=1005–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hearing test is also desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entcolumbia.org/hypernas.html |title=Hypernasality – Velopharyngeal Insufficiency |author=Department of Otolarynology/Head and Neck Surgery |publisher=Columbia University Medical Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403185338/http://www.entcolumbia.org/hypernas.html |archivedate=2012-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A mirror is held beneath the nose while the child pronounces the vowels. Nasal air escape, and thus hypernasality, is indicated if the mirror fogs up.
*A pressure-flow technique is used to measure velopharyngeal orifice area during the speech. The patient must be at least three to four years old.
*A video nasopharyngeal [[endoscopy]] observes velopharyngeal function, movements of the soft palate, and pharyngeal walls. It utilises a very small scope placed in the back of the nasal cavity. The doctor will then ask the child to say a few words. The patient must be at least three to four years old to ensure cooperation.
*A [[Fluoroscopy|cinefluoroscopy]] gives dynamic visualisation and can easier be applied to younger children, though it has the disadvantage of [[Ionizing radiation#Medical, biological and sterilization applications|exposing the patient to radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rudolf |last1=Probst |first2=Gerhard |last2=Grevers |first3=Heinrich |last3=Iro |author4=Telger, Terry (translator) |author5=Baum, Karin (illustrator) |title=Basic Otorhinolaryngology a step-by-step learning guide |year=2006 |publisher=Thieme |location=Stuttgart |isbn=9783131324412 |edition=revised|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A nasometer calculates the ratio of nasality. The patient wears a headset, where the oral and nasal cavities are separated by a plate.{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Are the cavities separated by the headset? Or is separation a separate procedure?}} On both sides of the plate are microphones. The ratio calculated by the nasometer indicates the amount of nasality, with a higher ratio indicating more nasality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kayelemetrics.com/index.php?option=com_product&amp;Itemid=3&amp;controller=product&amp;task=learn_more&amp;cid%5B%5D=78 |title=Nasometer II, Model 6450 |author=KayPENTAX |publisher=PENTAX Medical Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on language===
Hypernasality is generally segmented into so-called '[[resonance]]' effects in vowels and some voiced or sonorant consonants and the effects of excess nasal airflow during those consonants requiring a buildup of oral air pressure, such as stop consonants (as /p/) or [[Sibilant consonant|sibilants]] (as /s/).  The latter nasal airflow problem is termed 'nasal emission',&lt;ref name="Baken"&gt;R.J. Baken, Robert F. Orlikoff. ''Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice'' San Diego: Singular, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and acts to prevent the buildup of air pressure and thus prevent the normal production of the consonant.  In testing for resonance effects without the aid of technology, speech pathologists are asked to rate the speech by listening to a recorded sentence or paragraph, though there is much variability in such subjective ratings, for at least two reasons. First, the acoustic effect of a given velopharyngeal opening varies greatly depending on the degree of occlusion of the nasal passageways.  (This is the reason why a stuffy nose from an allergy or cold will sound more nasal than when the nose is clear.)  Secondly, for many persons with hypernasal speech, especially hearing impaired, there are also mispronunciations of the articulation of the vowels.  It is extremely difficult to separate the acoustic effects of hypernasality from the acoustic effects of mispronounced vowels ([http://www.ntid.rit.edu/speechlang/slpros/characteristics/training9.php examples]).  Of course, in speech training of the hearing impaired, there is little possibility of making nasality judgments aurally, and holding a finger to the side of the nose, to feel voice frequency vibration, is sometimes recommended.&lt;ref name="multiple1" /&gt;

== Treatment ==

=== Speech therapy ===
In cases of muscle weakness or cleft palate, special exercises can help to strengthen the soft palate muscles with the ultimate aim of decreasing airflow through the nose and thereby increasing intelligibility. Intelligibility requires the ability to close the nasal cavity, as all English sounds, except "m", "n", and "ng", have airflow only through the mouth. Normally, by age three, a child can raise the muscles of the soft palate to close to nasal cavity.

Without the use of a technological aid, nasal emission is sometimes judged by listening for any turbulence that may be produced by the nasal airflow, as when there is a small velopharyngeal opening and there is some degree of mucous in the opening.  More directly, methods recommended include looking for the fogging of a mirror held near the nares or listening through a tube, the other end of which is held in or near a nares opening.&lt;ref name="multiple1"&gt;Kummer, A. W. [http://www.asha.org/about/publications/leader-online/archives/2006/060207/060207c.htm Resonance disorders and nasal emission: Evaluation and treatment using "low tech" and "no tech" procedures.] The ASHA Leader (2006 Feb 7) 11(2), pp. 4, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many attempts to use technological augmentation more than a mirror or tube to aid the speech pathologist or provide meaningful feedback to the person attempting to correct their hypernasality.  Among the more successful of these attempts, the incompleteness of velopharyngeal closure during vowels and sonorants that causes nasal resonance can be estimated and displayed for evaluation or biofeedback in speech training through the nasalance of the voice, with nasalance defined as a ratio of acoustic energy at the nostrils to that at the mouth, with some form of acoustic separation present between the mouth and nose.  In the [http://www.wevosys.com/products/lingwaves/lingwaves_nasality.html nasalance measurement system] sold by WEVOSYS, the acoustic separation is provided by a mask-tube system, [http://www.kayelemetrics.com/Product%20Info/6450/6450.htm nasalance measurement system] sold by [[Pentax|Kay-Pentax]], the acoustic separation is provided by a solid flat partition held against the upper lip, while in the system sold by [http://www.glottal.com/Products/NVS.htm Glottal Enterprises] the acoustic separation can be by either a solid flat partition or a two-chamber mask.&lt;ref name="Baken" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watterson T, Lewis K, Brancamp T. "Comparison of Nasalance scores obtained with the Nasometer 6200 and the Nasometer II 6400." Cleft Palate Craniofac J. 2005 Sep;42(5):574-9 {{PMID|16149843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, devices for measuring nasalance do not measure nasal emission during pressure consonants.  Because of this, a means for measuring the degree of velopharyngeal closure in consonants is also needed.  A commercially available device for making such measurements is the [http://www.microtronics-nc.com/Perci-sar.htm Perci-Sar] system from Microtronics. The Nasality Visualization System from Glottal Enterprises allows both the measurement of Nasal Emission and Nasalance. In the presence of a [[Cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], either of these systems can be helpful in evaluating the need for an appliance or surgical intervention to close the cleft or the success of an appliance or a surgical attempt to close the cleft.

==== Exercises ====
If a child finds it difficult to blow, pinching the nose can help regulate airflow. The child should then practice speech sounds without pinching the nose.
These exercises only work as treatments if hypernasality is small. Severe deviations should be treated surgically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schisis.nl/nvsca/pag.php?id=paK&amp;item=spraak|title=Spraak en taal|language=Dutch|trans-title=Speech and Language|publisher=Nederlandse Vereniging voor Schisis en Craniofaciale Afwijkingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Using [[Continuous Positive Airway Pressure]] to treat hypernasality ====
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of traditional non-speech oral motor exercises can reduce hypernasality. Velopharyngeal closure patterns and their underlying neuromotor control may differ for speech and nonspeech activities. Therefore, the increase in velar movement through blowing, sucking, and swallowing may not transfer to speech tasks. Thus, hypernasality remains while individual speak. Kuehn proposed a new way of treatment by using a CPAP machine during speech tasks. The positive pressure provided by a CPAP machine provides resistance to stregthen velopharyngeal muscles. With nasal mask in place, an individual is asked to produce VNCV syllables and short sentences. It is believed that CPAP therapy can increase both muscle endurance as well as strength because it overloads the levator veli palatini muscle and involves a regimen with a large number of repetitions of velar elevation. Research findings proved that patients with hypernasality due to flaccid dysarthria, TBI or cleft palate do eliminate hypernasality after receiving this training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.asel.udel.edu/icslp/cdrom/vol2/422/a422.pdf |last=Kuehn D.

=== Surgery ===
The two main surgical techniques for correcting the aberrations the soft palate present in hypernasality are the posterior pharyngeal flap and the sphincter pharyngoplasty. After surgical interventions, speech therapy is necessary to learn how to control the newly constructed flaps.&lt;ref name=lianne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Serres|first1=Lianne M.|last2=Deleyiannis|first2=Frederic W.-B.|last3=Eblen|first3=Linda E.|last4=Gruss|first4=Joseph S.|last5=Richardson|first5=Mark A.|last6=Sie|first6=Kathleen C.Y.|title=Results with sphincter pharyngoplasty and pharyngeal flap|journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology|date=April 1999|volume=48|issue=1|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/S0165-5876(99)00006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Posterior pharyngeal flap====
{{see also|Pharyngeal flap surgery}}
Posterior pharyngeal flap surgery is mostly used for vertical clefts of the soft palate. The surgeon cuts through the upper layers of the back of the throat, creating a small square of tissue. This flap remains attached on one side (usually at the top). The other side is attached to (parts of) the soft palate. This ensures that the nasal cavity is partially separated from the oral cavity. When the child speaks, the remaining openings close from the side due to the narrowing of the throat caused by the muscle movements necessary for speech. In a relaxed state, the openings allow breathing through the nose.&lt;ref name=lianne /&gt;

====Sphincter pharyngoplasty====
Sphincter pharyngoplasty is mostly used for horizontal clefts of the soft palate. Two small flaps are made on the left and right side of the entrance to the nasal cavity, attached to the back of the throat. For good results, the patient must have good palatal motion, as the [[occlusive|occlusion]] of the nasal cavity is mainly carried out by muscles already existing and functioning.&lt;ref name=lianne /&gt;

}}

==== Complications ====
The most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap are [[hyponasality]], nasal obstruction, [[snoring]], and [[sleep apnea]]. Rarer complications include flap separation, [[sinusitis]], postoperative bleeding, and aspiration [[pneumonia]]. Possible complications of the sphincter pharyngoplasty are snoring, nasal obstruction, difficulty blowing the nose.

Some researches suggest that sphincter pharyngoplasty introduces less hyponasality and obstructive sleep symptoms than the posterior pharyngeal wall flap. Both surgeries have a favourable effect on the function of the Eustachian tube.&lt;ref name=emedicine /&gt;

'''Ismail Halit Kadare''' ({{IPA-sq|ismaˈil kadaˈɾe|lang}}, also spelled '''Ismaïl Kadaré''' in [[French language|French]]; born 28 January 1936) is an [[Albanians|Albanian]] novelist, poet, essayist and playwright. He has been a leading literary figure in Albania since the 1960s. He focused on poetry until the publication of his first novel{{Citation needed lead|date=February 2018}}, ''[[The General of the Dead Army (novel)|The General of the Dead Army]]'', which made him famous outside of Albania. In 1996, he became a lifetime member of the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]] of France.

In 1992, he was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]]; in 1998, the [[Herder Prize]]; in 2005, he won the inaugural [[Man Booker International Prize]]; in 2009, the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] of Arts; in 2015, the [[Jerusalem Prize]], and in 2016, he was a ''[[Legion of Honour|Commandeur de la Légion d'Honneur]]'' recipient. 

Kadare is regarded by some as one of the greatest European writers and intellectuals of the 20th century and, in addition, as a universal voice against totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fundacion Princessa de Asturias |url=http://www.fpa.es/en/cargarAplicacionNoticia.do?identificador=163|title=Ismaíl Kadare, Prince of Asturias Award Laureate for Literature |publisher=Fundacion Princessa de Asturias |date=24 June 2009 | accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ismail Kadare was born on 28 January 1936 in [[Gjirokastër]] in [[Albania]], to Halit Kadare, a post office employee&lt;ref name= "Brit"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ismail-Kadare ''Ismail Kadare, Albanian writer'', Brittanica.com. Retrieved 24 January 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;, and Hatixhe [[Dobi]], a homemaker.{{cn|date=January 2018}}
He attended primary and secondary schools in Gjirokastër and studied Languages and Literature at the Faculty of History and Philology of the [[University of Tirana]]. In 1956 Kadare received a teacher's diploma. He later studied at the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]] in [[Moscow]] from 1958 to 1960.&lt;ref name=kirjasto /&gt; 

While studying literature in Moscow he managed to get a collection of his poems published in Russian, and there he also wrote his first novel ''The City with no Signs'' in 1959, intentionally defying the rules of [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Ndue Ukaj |url= http://www.gazetaexpress.com/arte/ismail-kadare-letersia-identiteti-dhe-historia-205610/?archive=1 |title= Ismail Kadare: Letërsia, identiteti dhe historia |work= Gazeta Ekspress |date= 27 May 2016 |access-date= 12 March 2017 |language=al}} Except from the book ''Kadare, leximi dhe interpretimet''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning home in 1960 because of the Soviet-Albanian split, he worked as a journalist and then embarked on a literary career&lt;ref name= "Brit"/&gt;. He tried to publish a fragment of his first novel camouflaged as a short story titled "Coffeehouse Days". Upon being published in the literary magazine ''[[Zëri i Rinisë]]'' in 1962, it was immediately banned by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtepiaelibrit.com/store/sq/tregime-novela/745-dite-kafenesh-ismail-kadare.html shtepiaelibrit.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kadare|2011|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was advised by his close friends not to tell anybody about the actual novel, so it stayed in his drawers for decades until the communist regime fell in 1990.

In 1963, he published his first novel titled ''[[The General of the Dead Army (novel)|The General of the Dead Army]]'' whose French translation by the persecuted [[Isuf Vrioni]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanianhistory.net/1998_Vrioni/index.html Robert Elsie's comment, ''1998 - Jusuf Vrioni: Back to Tirana, 1943-1947'']&lt;/ref&gt;, published by Albin Michel in 1970 led to Kadare's international breakthrough. The novel was not received well by the critics in Albania at the time.{{sfn|Morgan|2011|p=89}}His next novel, ''The Monster'', published in the magazine ''Nëntori'' in 1965, was banned immediately. After offending the authorities with a political poem in 1975, he was forbidden to publish for three years

In March 1982 ''[[The Palace of Dreams]]'' was harshly condemned in a Writer's Plenum. The writer was accused of making allusions to Communist Albania in it, citing several ambiguous passages. As a result, the work was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kadare|2011|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadare was also accused by the president of the League of Albanian Writers and Artists of deliberately evading politics by cloaking much of his fiction in history and folklore. Around the time of Hoxha's death in 1985, his novel ''[[A Moonlit Night (novel)|A Moonlit Night]]'' was banned by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elsie.de/pdf/reviews/R1994KadareClaire.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he wrote ''[[Agamemnon's Daughter]]''— a direct critique of the oppressive regime in Albania, which was smuggled out of the country with the help of Kadare's French editor [[Claude Durand]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/chronicles-and-fragments&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Kadare claimed political asylum in France, issuing statements in favor of democratization. At that time, he stated that "dictatorship and authentic literature are incompatible. The writer is the natural enemy of dictatorship".{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} During the 1990s and 2000s he was offered multiple times to become [[President of Albania]], but declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kadare|2011|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has divided his time between [[Albania]] and France since 1990{{cn|date=January 2018}}.

Critical opinion is divided as to whether Kadare should be considered to have been a dissident or a [[conformist]] during the Communist period.&lt;ref name="kirjasto" /&gt; For his part, Kadare has stated that he had never claimed to be an "Albanian [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]]" or a dissident, and that "dissidence was a position no one could occupy [in [[Enver Hoxha]]'s Albania], even for a few days, without facing the firing squad. On the other hand, my books themselves constitute a very obvious form of resistance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/vls/0545,ehrenreich,69803,21.html |title=Fates of State: Booker winner Ismail Kadare's art of enigma |access-date=11 August 2011 |last=Ehrenreich |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Ehrenreich |date=8 November 2005 |work=The Village Voice |publisher=Villagevoice.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126095408/http://www.villagevoice.com/vls/0545%2Cehrenreich%2C69803%2C21.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=26 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Amouroux]], a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques of France, pointed out that Soviet dissidents including Solzhenitsyn had published their works during the era of [[de-Stalinization]], whereas Kadare lived and published his works in a country which remained [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Henri Amouroux |url=https://www.asmp.fr/fiches_academiciens/textacad/kadare/installation.pdf|title= Installation de M.Islmail Kadare - Associé étranger |publisher= Académie des Sciences morales et politiques|page=7 |date=28 October 1996 | access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Robert Elsie]], an expert of Albanian Literature also stressed the fact that, the conditions in which Kadare lived and published his works were not comparable to other European communist countries where at least some level of public dissent was tolerated, rather, the situation in Albania was comparable to [[North Korea]] or the Soviet Union in the 1930s under Stalin. Despite all of this, Kadare used any opportunity to attack the regime in his works, by means of political allegories, which were picked up by educated Albanian readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Elsie|authorlink1=Robert Elsie|title=Albanian Literature: A Short History|date=2005|publisher=I.B.Taurus|location=London|isbn=1-84511-031-5|pages=182–183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=albanian+literature&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif6oeQqozYAhXIaFAKHTfYAi0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=conformist&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

In 1996 Kadare became a lifetime member of the [[Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]] of France, where he replaced the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. In 1992, he was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]], and in 2005 he received the inaugural [[Man Booker International Prize]]. In 2009, Kadare was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award for Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717004647/http://fundacionprincipedeasturias.org/en/awards/2009/ Price of Asturias awards laureates 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he was awarded an Honorary Degree of Science in Social and Institutional Communication by the [[University of Palermo]] in Sicily. In 2015, he was awarded the bi-annual [[Jerusalem Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Times of Israel|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/albanian-writer-to-receive-jerusalem-prize/|title=Albanian writer to receive Jerusalem Prize|author=Rebecca Wojno|date=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' said of Kadare: "He has been compared to [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] and [[George Orwell|Orwell]]. But Kadare's is an original voice, universal yet deeply rooted in his own soil".&lt;ref&gt;Shusha Guppy, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-books-interview-ismail-kadare--envers-nevernever-land-1073473.html The Books Interview: Ismail Kadare – Enver's never-never land]" ''The Independent'', 27 February 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary themes==

The central theme of his works is totalitarianism and its mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fundacion Princessa de Asturias |url=http://www.fpa.es/en/cargarAplicacionNoticia.do?identificador=163|title=Ismaíl Kadare, Prince of Asturias Award Laureate for Literature |publisher=Fundacion Princessa de Asturias |date=24 June 2009 | accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadare's novels draw on legends surrounding the historical experiences of Albanian people, the representation of classical myths in modern contexts, and the totalitarian regime in Albania. They are obliquely ironic as a result of trying to withstand political scrutiny. Among his best-known books are ''[[The General of the Dead Army (novel)|The General of the Dead Army]]'' (1963), ''The Siege'' (1970), ''The Ghost Rider'' (1980), ''[[Broken April]]'' (1980),&lt;ref name="kirjasto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broken April - Ismail Kadare"/&gt; ''[[The Palace of Dreams]]'' (1981), ''The Pyramid'',''The Successor'' (2003).

''[[The Pyramid (Kadare novel)|The Pyramid]]'' (1992) was set in Egypt in the [[26th century BC]] and after. In it, Kadare mocked Hoxha's fondness for elaborate statues, the pyramid form also reflecting any dictator's love for hierarchy and useless monuments. In some of Kadare's novels, comprising the so-called "Ottoman Cycle", the [[Ottoman Empire]] is used as the archetype of a totalitarian state. ''[[The Fall of the Stone City]]'' (2008) was awarded the Rexhai Surroi Prize in Kosovo, and was shortlisted for [[Independent Foreign Fiction Prize]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Flood |first=Alison |date= 11 April 2013 |title= Independent foreign fiction prize 2013 shortlist announced |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/11/independent-foreign-fiction-prize-2013-shortlist |website= [[The Guardian]] |publisher=  |access-date= 26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadare has been mentioned as a possible recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] several times. His works have been published in about 45 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapo.al/2015/01/kadare-feston-ditelindjen-60-vjet-krijimtari-e-perkthyer-ne-45-gjuhe-te-botes/1 ''Kadare feston ditëlindjen, 60 vjet krijimtari e përkthyer në 45 gjuhë të botës'', mapo.al, 29 January 2016.

'''John Delury''' is an American East Asia scholar, with special interests in the history of China, U.S.-China relations and Korean peninsula affairs.

==Background and education==
Delury trained at [[Yale University]], receiving a B.S. (1997), M.A. (2003) and a PH.D. in 2007, with all degrees in history. He is currently Associate Professor of Chinese Studies at [[Yonsei University]], [[Seoul, Korea]]. He had previously taught at [[Brown University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Peking University]]. He is the associate director of the [[Asia Society]] Center on U.S.-Chinese relations.  He is the co-author, with [[Orville Schell]], of ''Wealth and Power: China's Long March to the Twenty-first Century'' (Random House, 2013).He is a frequent contributor to multiple journals and newspapers, including [[Foreign Affairs]], [[Foreign Policy]], [[Global Asia]], [[38 North]]. and [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gsis.yonsei.ac.kr/main/faculty.asp?mid=n01_04&amp;act=view&amp;idx=121|title=Welcome to Yonsei GSIS|website=gsis.yonsei.ac.kr|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His career as a historian took a self-described detour when he visited [[South Korea]] for the first time in 2006 to meet his wife's family.  His area of interest had been limited to [[modern Chinese history]]. After further visits to [[Korea]], he joined the Yonsei faculty in 2010 and made Seoul his home base. His academic interests have since broadenend to include [[Korean peninsula]] studies, [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea|South]]; he has visited North Korea four times.  He feels that his new interest in Korean affairs has broadened his views on [[China]] as well as [[U.S.-China relations]].&lt;ref name=:"2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/korea-and-china/1/steps/25907|title=Portrait of the historian as a young man - Lips and Teeth|last=FutureLearn|website=FutureLearn|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on China==
Delury states that knowledge of China's history is critical; without looking backward to grasp the forces at work for hundreds of years, it is not possible to know China today or its possible future trends. He posits that through China's recent history  there is one constant: "the search for something, anything," that will restore China's greatness (fuqiang 富強, signifying “wealth and power”). China's challenge now is to reconcile its current success to its past sufferings, and relieve their historical sense of inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/wealth-and-power-chinas-long-march-twenty-first-century|title=Wealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-First Century {{!}} YaleGlobal Online|website=yaleglobal.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/books/review/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury.html|title=‘Wealth and Power,’ by Orville Schell and John Delury|last=Kahn|first=Joseph|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delury looks for historical parallels, such as the 1895 [[Gongche Shangshu movement]], the 1919 [[May Fourth Movement]], the [[Tiananmen Square protest]] of 1989, and the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|2014 Umbrella Movement]], threads which can be strung together, to chart alternate trajectories for the competing visions of China's future [[chinese political system|political]] and [[Chinese social structure|social order]]; he opines there are no right or wrong tides of history to take comfort in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delury|first=John|date=2014-10-06|title=Out of Tiananmen's Shadow|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2014-10-06/out-tiananmens-shadow|journal=Foreign Affairs|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

While Mao had contempt for [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient Chinese]] customs, in the 1980's the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) began to use traditional themes and prominent [[Classical Chinese|classical]] vocabulary. A prominent example is "[[harmonious society]]" ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 和谐社会; [[pinyin]]: ''héxié shèhuì''), used as a [[socioeconomic]] vision in [[China]] and to deflect the problems of [[social inequality]]. Delury traces the history and usage of the Chinese word "harmonious" and is critical of the CCP, calling this usage "the pseudo-[[Confucianism]] of the CCP."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoover.org/research/harmonious-china|title=“Harmonious” In China|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that [[Xi Jinping|Xi]]'s political program of [[austerity]] is a reflection of a traditional political precept, dating from [[Confucius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delury|first=John|date=2013-08-07|title=Austerity with Chinese Characteristics|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2013-08-07/austerity-chinese-characteristics|journal=Foreign Affairs|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on North Korea==

Traveling in North Korea evoked for Delury the sensation of [[time travel]]; [[Kim Jong-un|Kim]]'s [[charismatic]] [[dictatorship]] and the [[socialist]] [[ethos]] of [[Mao]] on the one side, with the [[grassroots]] [[marketization]] and [[consumer revolution]] of  [[Chinese economic reform|Deng's China]] on the other.&lt;ref name=:"2" /&gt; As with the history of China, it is important to know the [[North Korean history]], and he is critical of American officials who know little about this subject. Without this knowledge it is unlikely for American officials to understand and realistically deal with [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|North Korea's nuclear weapons program]], a highly complex problem with a lot of variation over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/790231.html|title=[Interview] Can candlelight energy spark new era of inter-Korean relations?|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It takes years to  understand that history and you can't read in a book even if you had time, you have to meet the people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Delury has several significant disagreements with President Trump's North Korea policy. [[President Trump]] has relied on [[China–North Korea relations|China's influence on North Korea]] to exert pressure on the regime to give up its nuclear weapons, using trade with China as an inducement.  Delury notes that since 1958 China has not had any meaningful impact on [[Foreign relations of North Korea|North Korea's foreign policy]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://supchina.com/podcast/china-north-korea-not-close-think-ma-zhao-john-delury-talk-history/|title=Why China and North Korea are not as close as you think: Ma Zhao and John Delury talk history - SupChina|website=supchina.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Delury has described the [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] as futile and counterproductive. He has argued that they are unenforceable and unlikely to stop North Korea's [[nuclear weapons]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/01/opinions/north-korea-sanctions-delury/index.html|title=North Korea sanctions: Futile, counterproductive and dangerous|first=John|last=Delury|publisher=CNN|date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a more conciliatory approach, suggesting that the best chance for them to give up its nuclear weapons is by helping [[North Korean economy|North Korean economic]] [[economic development|development]]. He recommends a gradual elimination of the sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/opinion/kim-jong-un-moon-economic-development-north-korea-denuclearization.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Kim Jong-un Has a Dream.

Some of it is probably true – but a great deal of it is probably not...the normal standards of [[journalism]] are thrown out of the window because the attitude is: 'it's North Korea – no one knows what's going on in there.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''John Whitmer Historical Association''' (JWHA) is an independent, nonprofit&lt;ref name=RussellBrief/&gt;&lt;ref name=MooreUnearth/&gt; organization promoting study, research, and publishing about the history and culture of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].  It is especially focused on the [[History of the Community of Christ|Community of Christ]] (formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or RLDS Church), [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement#Other lineages|other midwestern Restoration traditions]], and [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement|early Mormonism]].&lt;ref name=Brisendine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waterman/&gt;&lt;ref name=DialogContrib/&gt;&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=EncycLDS/&gt;&lt;ref name=AtoZ/&gt;  The Community of Christ's approach to its own history was influenced, in part, by historical problems raised and explored through JWHA publications and conferences, and those of its sister organization, the [[Mormon History Association]].  JWHA membership numbers around 400&lt;ref name=RussellBrief/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waterman/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardRevisionist/&gt; and is open to all, fostering cooperation with LDS and non-Mormon scholars.&lt;ref name=AtoZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt;

== History ==

=== Background ===

Before the founding of the JWHA, scholarship in the field of Mormon history had been developing.  In the 1950s, scholars like [[Fawn Brodie]], [[Juanita Brooks]], [[Thomas O'Dea]], and [[Leonard Arrington]] began applying academic methods to their religious history, giving rise to the [[New Mormon History]].&lt;ref name=FlemingBecoming/&gt;&lt;ref name=QuinnNew/&gt;  In this spirit, Robert Flanders, a professor at the RLDS-affiliated Graceland College, published ''Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi'' in 1965.  The book presented controversies, like Joseph Smith's polygamy, that were in contrast to faith-promoting teachings of the RLDS Church, and brought a backlash from some RLDS members.  Then Richard P. Howard, another proponent of the New Mormon History, was appointed Church Historian in 1966, further upsetting some traditional believers.&lt;ref name=BoltonHistory/&gt;  Howard opened the church archives&lt;ref name=JSTresearch/&gt; and was optimistic about historical challenges.&lt;ref name=HowardRevisionist/&gt;

This progressive approach to Mormon studies inspired ''Courage: A Journal of History, Thought and Action'', founded in 1970 by several faculty from [[Graceland College]].  Contrasting with conservative RLDS publishing, ''Courage'' ventured a fresh look at RLDS issues and historical problems, often diverging from traditional interpretations.  The independent journal closed in 1973, by which time several of its team had started the JWHA.&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardRevisionist/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt;

Throughout this time, Mormon historical scholarship was developing within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Utah.  In 1965 the Mormon History Association was founded, which included RLDS historians amongst its officers.  The periodicals ''BYU Studies'' (started 1959) and ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'' (started 1966) published articles from MHA members.  MHA founder Leonard Arrington was appointed LDS Church Historian in 1972, forming a new Church Historical Department which was active in the historical community.&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt;&lt;ref name=QuinnHistorian/&gt;

=== Founding ===

[[Image:DickHoward 2011.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Richard P. Howard]] was RLDS Church Historian when the JWHA was founded at a gathering in his home, and served as JWHA president in 1985.]]

Despite positive experiences, RLDS historians in the midwest found MHA participation difficult due to the distance to Utah.&lt;ref name=HowardRevisionist/&gt;&lt;ref name=RussellDraft/&gt;  So on September 18, 1972,&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=LegacyOfFaith/&gt; fifteen&lt;ref name=RussellBrief/&gt; like-minded RLDS historians&lt;ref name=AtoZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=MaussSociology/&gt; met together in Independence, Missouri,&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt; in the living room of Richard P. Howard, the official historian of the RLDS Church, and organized the John Whitmer Historical Association.&lt;ref name=McMurrayIntroduction/&gt;  Some had organizational expertise from their service as MHA officers.&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt;&lt;ref name=RussellDraft/&gt;

Most of these were already members of the MHA,&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt; and the JWHA was founded with the intent to continue the collaboration and warm relations with the MHA.&lt;ref name=RussellDraft/&gt;  Richard Howard won an MHA award in 1970 and was interested in exchanging ideas between LDS and RLDS scholars.&lt;ref name=McMurrayIntroduction/&gt;  From its beginning the JWHA board of directors included LDS members,&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt; and Utah historians were invited to join.&lt;ref name=UHQ/&gt;  The first JWHA meeting was held in September 1973 in Nauvoo, Illinois.&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt;

=== Impact on the church ===

Founded as an independent group, not under the direction of any church, the JWHA would be free to explore historical controversies.&lt;ref name=Waterman/&gt;&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Excavating/&gt;  Participants supported the [[New Mormon History]],&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=BoltonHistory/&gt; cultivating a lively tradition of exploring controversy in Mormonism.&lt;ref name=Excavating/&gt;&lt;ref name=Neo-Orthodoxy/&gt;  Some traditionalists and religious leaders warned that this approach could damage faith,&lt;ref name=MormonPast/&gt; while questioning and liberal Latter Day Saints found community and intellectual freedom.&lt;ref name=PollHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=AndersonDilemma/&gt;  As John Whitmer, the first Church Historian in 1831, was remembered for his controversial history of early Mormonism and falling out with church leaders, the name evoked taking the side of the historian when in conflict with the institution.&lt;ref name=BoltonHistory/&gt;

Through the JWHA, RLDS members confronted Joseph Smith's historical link with Mormon polygamy, a defining issue for the RLDS Church.  Church leaders worried that publications in the 1960s and 1970s, including Flanders's book, might trouble church members after more than a century of official RLDS insistence that Smith was never involved.  On direction from President Wallace B. Smith, Howard undertook a five-year study which was then edited and softened by RLDS leaders and historians in 1982.  The First Presidency recommended it be presented at the JWHA, and later in the ''John Whitmer Historical Association Journal''.  But after some blowback the First Presidency denied involvement, saying the ''JWHA Journal'' did not speak for the church.&lt;ref name=BoltonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=BringhurstReaction/&gt;  Jan Shipps commented that "faith seemed endangered and help and comfort were needed".&lt;ref name=Sojourner/&gt;

This became one of the "Church-shaking changes" that transformed the RLDS Church in the 1980s and 1990s, alongside the ordination of women, the new temple in Independence, and the break with father-son succession of the presidency.&lt;ref name=RussellSuccession/&gt;  The church moved from its Mormon heritage toward liberal Protestantism, adopting the name Community of Christ in 2001.&lt;ref name=MaussSociology/&gt;

W. Grant McMurray, church president from 1996-2004, demonstrates the influence of the JWHA on the Community of Christ.  Working for the church as a researcher and later as the archivist, McMurray advanced into church leadership.&lt;ref name=McMurrayGoodly/&gt;  During this time McMurray joined other RLDS supporters of the New Mormon History to found the JWHA, serving as its president in 1981.  He continued to present and publish influential articles, while also serving in high church offices.&lt;ref name=BoltonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=RussellSuccession/&gt;&lt;ref name=JWHA_leadership/&gt;  As church president, he presented a paper to the JWHA in 1999, as a response to an earlier critique of the RLDS Church, where he stated that his past historical research had influenced the positions he took as church president.&lt;ref name=RussellSuccession/&gt;  In 2006, after resigning the presidency, McMurray was able to speak frankly about Joseph Smith's polygamy at the JWHA, which had so troubled the church in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=BringhurstReaction/&gt;

== Academic community ==

[[Image:JanShipps.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Jan Shipps]], a non-Mormon, delivered the first paper to a JWHA conference and served as JWHA president in 2004-05.]]

The JWHA is considered an important professional venue within the Latter Day Saint historical community.&lt;ref name=McMurrayIntroduction/&gt;  Historians from different backgrounds connect and share research, and develop scholarship.  JWHA is often a venue for research which is later published in book form by a scholarly press.&lt;ref name=PollHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=TaysomShakers/&gt;&lt;ref name=SmithFaithful/&gt;&lt;ref name=VogelWord/&gt;&lt;ref name=UnderwoodEarly/&gt;&lt;ref name=DaynesBelief/&gt;&lt;ref name=SmithScoundrel/&gt;  For example, Jan Shipps, a non-Mormon scholar, opened the first JWHA conference in 1973 with a paper entitled "The Prophet Puzzle,"&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt; which was then picked up the next year by the Mormon History Association as the head article in the inaugural issue of the ''Journal of Mormon History''.&lt;ref name=ShippsPuzzle/&gt;  Years later the paper was again highlighted in the Essays on Mormonism Series published by [[Signature Books]].&lt;ref name=WatermanPuzzle/&gt;  In another example from the 1973 JWHA conference, Lawrence Foster, another non-Mormon, shared his research on polygamy with LDS [[Assistant Church Historian]] Davis Bitton.  Bitton invited Foster to the LDS archives in Salt Lake City, Utah, leading to Foster's first published book.&lt;ref name=FosterOdyssey/&gt;

Since its founding, the JWHA has worked closely with its "sister organization", the Utah-based Mormon History Association.&lt;ref name=RussellDraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=BaughPresident/&gt;  The two organizations have held a joint conference and have long offered joint memberships.&lt;ref name=Waterman/&gt;&lt;ref name=SmithScoundrel/&gt;  Many MHA members are also JWHA members, or also members of the [[Utah State Historical Society]],&lt;ref name=MHAmembership/&gt; all three of which Jan Shipps called "Mormon to the core".&lt;ref name=Sojourner/&gt;  Several presidents of the MHA have also been presidents of the JWHA, as well as one BYU religion professor.&lt;ref name=DN_Baugh/&gt;  In addition to the MHA, the JWHA has also co-sponsored conferences with the [[Sunstone Educational Foundation]]&lt;ref name=SunstoneRestorationStudies/&gt;&lt;ref name=SunstoneKirtland2012/&gt; and collaborated with the Mormon Missouri Frontier Foundation,&lt;ref name=BaughPresident/&gt; including an archaeological dig at [[Haun's Mill]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=MooreUnearth/&gt;

The JWHA and MHA fostered an interfaith dialogue that helped thaw relations between the LDS and RLDS.&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt;&lt;ref name=McMurrayIntroduction/&gt;  Each organization published research and reviewed books by members of both faiths.&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;  This complimented the trust developed in the 1960s between Richard Howard, the RLDS Church Historian, and Robert Matthews, an LDS researcher of Joseph Smith's Bible translation manuscript, held in the RLDS collections.  From this goodwill, the RLDS Church approved Matthews' research for publication in the official LDS Edition of the Bible in 1979.&lt;ref name=JSTresearch/&gt;&lt;ref name=LDSedition/&gt;

While it is most often compared to the MHA, the role of the JWHA has also been compared to other organizations within the historical community.&lt;ref name=Ostling/&gt;&lt;ref name=ShippsMormonism/&gt;  This includes the Sunstone Education Foundation, the Dialogue Foundation, Signature Books,&lt;ref name=AndersonDilemma/&gt; the Utah State Historical Society (and other Utah history groups),&lt;ref name=MormonPast/&gt; the LDS Church History Department, and Brigham Young University institutions like the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute, the Charles Redd Center, the Religious Studies Center, and the BYU history department.&lt;ref name=Waterman/&gt;&lt;ref name=MormonAmericana/&gt;  Also compared are societies beyond Mormon studies, such as the American Historical Association,&lt;ref name=MormonPast/&gt; the American Academy of Religion, the Western History Association, and the Communal Studies Association.&lt;ref name=TaysomShakers/&gt;

== ''JWHA Journal'' ==

The JWHA began publishing the '''''John Whitmer Historical Association Journal''''' (''JWHA Journal'') in 1981.&lt;ref name=Excavating/&gt;&lt;ref name=EncycLDS-periodicals/&gt;  It followed several Mormon studies journals founded in the 1960s and 1970s, including ''Courage'' and ''Restoration Studies'' by RLDS scholars.&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt;  The ''Journal of Mormon History'' already provided a venue for historians, but there was room for another history journal in the wake of the New Mormon History and a proliferation of scholarly writing in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=QuinnHistorian/&gt;

For many years the ''JWHA Journal'' was published annually in October&lt;ref name=AtoZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=MaussSociology/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; (but is now semiannual)&lt;ref name=JWHApublications/&gt; with scholarly papers, book reviews, and other features.&lt;ref name=EncycLDS/&gt;  It often contains papers from the JWHA conferences, and sometimes articles are later reprinted in ''Restoration Studies'' for a more general audience.&lt;ref name=HowardRevisionist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Excavating/&gt;  Subscriptions are included with all JWHA memberships.&lt;ref name=Waterman/&gt;

While maintaining a special focus on Community of Christ history,&lt;ref name=MaussSociology/&gt;&lt;ref name=EncycLDS-periodicals/&gt; the ''Journal'' publishes on all areas of Mormon history, drawing interest from LDS historians.  Although founded by Community of Christ scholars, a significant proportion of the articles and reviews are written by LDS or non-Mormon contributors.&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt;&lt;ref name=BushmanContemporary/&gt;

The ''JWHA Journal'' is peer-reviewed with a reputation for strong scholarship&lt;ref name=MaussSociology/&gt; and as a major publication in its field.&lt;ref name=Excavating/&gt;&lt;ref name=LauniusPragmatic/&gt;  It is compared to Mormon studies journals, like ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', the ''Journal of Mormon History'', ''Sunstone'', ''BYU Studies'', the ''Utah Historical Quarterly'', ''Exponent II''&lt;ref name=Neo-Orthodoxy/&gt;&lt;ref name=PollHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ostling/&gt;&lt;ref name=ShippsMormonism/&gt;&lt;ref name=EncycLDS-periodicals/&gt; and the RLDS journals ''Courage: A Journal of History, Thought and Action'' and ''Restoration Studies''.&lt;ref name=MormonHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardBoundary/&gt;&lt;ref name=MaussSociology/&gt;&lt;ref name=LauniusPragmatic/&gt;  Also compared are non-Mormon journals, like the ''Journal of the Early Republic'', the ''Illinois Historical Journal'', and ''Church History''.&lt;ref name=LauniusKingdom/&gt;

== Conferences ==

[[Image:JWHA Springfield.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Richard Bushman]] speaks to the JWHA meeting in [[Springfield, Illinois]] in 2011.]]
The JWHA holds its annual meeting at a different historic site within Mormon history, on the last full weekend in September.&lt;ref name=EncycLDS/&gt;&lt;ref name=DN_Baugh/&gt;  Professional and independent historians from the Community of Christ, and elsewhere, present their research to an attendance of around 100.&lt;ref name=RussellBrief/&gt;&lt;ref name=Excavating/&gt;&lt;ref name=BaughPresident/&gt;  Scholars are introduced to each other and to new research.  As many attendees are believers at different levels of faith, Jan Shipps observed that JWHA and MHA conferences can sometimes serve as quasi-religious support groups when faith is challenged by history, with non-LDS providing a neutral space.&lt;ref name=Sojourner/&gt;

== Activities ==

Aside from the annual meeting and ''Journal'', the JWHA is involved in several other activities.  Scholarships are offered to students working on Mormon history, allowing them to attend and present to the conference.&lt;ref name=EncycLDS/&gt;&lt;ref name=BaughPresident/&gt;  Awards are also presented by the JWHA for best books and articles in Mormon history.&lt;ref name=BaughPresident/&gt;  These are found alongside other awards in Mormon studies, such as those from the MHA&lt;ref name=African/&gt; and the Utah State Historical Society,&lt;ref name=TurnerProphet/&gt; the Dialogue Foundation,&lt;ref name=QuinnSame/&gt; and the Evans Biography Award.&lt;ref name=LauniusPragmatic/&gt;&lt;ref name=LauniusAward/&gt;

The JWHA hosts a scholarly lecture at its Spring Banquet,&lt;ref name=AtoZ/&gt; held in Independence, Missouri,&lt;ref name=BaughPresident/&gt; before each triennial World Conference of the Community of Christ, during a time when church members and leaders are gathered to the city.&lt;ref name=RussellSuccession/&gt;&lt;ref name=TroehDivisions/&gt;

In 2005, the JWHA founded John Whitmer Books, a publishing imprint for scholarly titles in Mormon Studies.&lt;ref name=BaughPresident/&gt;  The JWHA also publishes a newsletter irregularly&lt;ref name=EncycLDS/&gt;&lt;ref name=AtoZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; (intended to be quarterly&lt;ref name=HamerNewsletter/&gt;), which started in 1979,&lt;ref name=RussellNewsletter/&gt; and has been joint publisher of ''Restoration Studies'' since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Publications | publisher=John Whitmer Historical Association | url=http://www.jwha.info/publications | accessdate=2014-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
A '''lanterne''' is a [[cinquain]] form of [[poetry]], in which the first [[line (poetry)|line]] has one [[syllable]] and each subsequent line increases in length by one syllable, except for the final line that concludes the poem with one syllable. Its name derives from the [[lantern]] shape that appears when the poem is aligned to the center of the page.

Each line of the lanterne is able to stand on its own, and while the poem may or may not be given a title, the title of a lanterne sometimes functions as an integral part of the poem, working as a 'sixth' line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.pe.ca/Donagh/grassroots_homepage/poetry/secrets/patterns.htm Poetry Festival&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]] and [[discourse analysis]], ''semantic macrostructures'' are the overall, global meanings of discourse, usually also described in terms of ''topic'', ''gist'', or ''upshot''. These semantic macrostructures (global meanings or topics) are typically expressed in for instance the headlines and lead of a news report, or the title and the abstract of a scholarly article. Macrostructures of discourse are distinguished from its microstructures, that is, the local structures of words, clauses, sentences or turns in conversation. Macrostructures may be derived from microstructures by operations such as abstracting, that is, leaving out or summarizing specific details. Semantic macrostructures or topics define what is called the global [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] of discourse.

This concept was first proposed by [[Teun A. van Dijk]] in 1977.

'''Mediacracy''' is a situation in government where the [[mass media]] effectively has control over the [[voter|voting public]]. Mediacracy is closely related to a theory on the role of media in the [[Politics of the United States|United States political system]], that argues that media and news outlets have a large level of influence over voting citizens' evaluations of [[candidate]]s and political issues, thereby possessing effective control over politics in the United States.

==Background==
The term "mediacracy" was first coined in 1974 by writer and political commentator [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]], who used the term in the title of his book ''Mediacracy: American Parties and Politics in the Communications Age''.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Kevin|date=1974|title=Mediacracy: American Parties and Politics in the Communications Age|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0385049455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the concept has gained popularity and is used by political scientists and researchers alike to discuss the impact of media on both voting behavior and cultural trends. Most recently, the term has seen a resurgence due to the works of economist and author [[Fabian Tassano]]. In his book ''Mediocracy: Inversions and Deceptions in an Egalitarian Culture'' Tassano argues that the '[[dumbing down]]' of popular media when coupled with increasing obscurity in scholarly discourse leads to a society which has the appearance of egalitarianism, but ultimately is a society ruled by elites.&lt;ref name="Tassano"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tassano|first=Fabian|date=2006|title=Mediocracy: Inversions and Deceptions in an Egalitarian Culture|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0953677265}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reflection of this, the term mediacracy is usually accompanied by negative assumptions about the true nature of media in the United States, along with the aims and desires of mass media as a whole.

==Potential causes==
There are three main potential causes for the rise in the media's influence on elections, being a combination of different theories on the cultural [[influence of mass media]] and recent [[populist]] democratic reforms in the American political system. Supporters of the mediacracy theory argue that when taken together, these causes greatly show that the media have a large level of influence over politics in the United States, drawing a link between media's leverage on public opinion, and the increased power that public opinion has on who is elected to office. These potential causes include, but are not limited to:

===Agenda setting===
{{main|Agenda-setting theory}}
Agenda-setting refers to the ability of the media to affect the salience of issues on the public agenda. In short, the amount of attention paid to a certain issue will lead to audiences viewing that issue as more important. The theory of agenda-setting was formally developed by Dr. Max McCombs and Dr. Donald Shaw in their study on the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]] conducted at Chapel Hill, North Carolina.&lt;ref name="McCombs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|author2=Shaw, D|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1972|volume=36|issue=2|doi=10.1086/267990|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCombs and Shaw polled 100 residents of the Chapel Hill community and found a strong correlation between what those residents believed to be the most important election issue, and what local and national media outlets reported as the most important election issue.&lt;ref name="McCombs" /&gt; This was a landmark study that displayed a link between an issue's salience in media content and the corresponding salience of that issue in voter's minds.&lt;ref name="McCombs" /&gt;

As of 2005, over 400 studies have discussed the presence of agenda-setting, and the issue remains relevant to the study of the American political system.&lt;ref name="McCombs 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|title=A look at agenda-setting: Past, present and future.|journal=Journalism Studies|year=2005|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1080/14616700500250438|pages=543–557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priming===
{{main|Priming (media)}}
Priming, in a political context is a theory stating that the media draws attention to some issues as opposed to others, thereby altering the standards by which we judge candidates in elections. Priming is often used in concert with agenda setting in the media, and the two concepts taken together contribute to a full understanding of the level of influence that the mass media holds over the voting public. This theory on media originated from researchers Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder in their work ''Experimental Demonstrations of the "Not-So-Minimal" Consequences of Television News Programs'' published in the 1982 edition of The American Political Science Review.&lt;ref name="Iyengar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder|title=Experimental Demonstrations of the "Not-So-Minimal" Consequences of Television News Programs|journal=The American Political Science Review|year=1982|volume=76|issue=4|pages=848–858|doi=10.2307/1962976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder argue that due to media making certain issues more salient than others, they set the parameters of the political decisions made by the voting public.&lt;ref name="Iyengar" /&gt;

While priming is often unintentional, Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder's 1982 study examines how intentional priming can shape the public's evaluations of candidates and elected officials.&lt;ref name="Iyengar" /&gt; The researchers looked at how the salience of certain topics affected voters' evaluations of President [[Jimmy Carter]], and found evidence to support the presence of both agenda setting and priming. Iyengar et al. first proved the effects of agenda setting by finding a correlation between the attention paid to certain political topics and those topics' importance with the voting public when evaluating the President.&lt;ref name="Iyengar" /&gt; The researchers then found evidence of priming by finding a link between those established standards, and voters' resulting evaluations of President Carter.&lt;ref name="Iyengar" /&gt;

Supporters of the mediacracy theory largely point to this joint phenomenon as evidence that the mass media holds a large amount of control over the voting population.

===Populist reforms in American democracy===
Over the course of the last half century, there have been a number of reforms that have led to a shift in control over candidate selection from party elites to the voting public. Thomas Patterson examines this shift, and its resulting correlation with rising political influence of the mass media, in his book ''Out of Order''.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Thomas|date=1994|title=Out of Order: An incisive and boldly original critique of the news media's domination of America's political process|publisher=Vintage|isbn=0679755101}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1960 to 1980, the number of bound or committed delegates in both parties more than doubled, going from 20% on the Democratic side and 35% on the Republican side to 71% and 69% for each respectively in 1980.&lt;ref name="Patterson" /&gt; Also, from 1960 to 2004, the number of states holding primary contests (which favor public opinion) instead of caucuses (which favor party elites) has more than doubled.&lt;ref name="Patterson" /&gt; Patterson argues that this shift has indirectly strengthened the power of media outlets that have been shown to have much influence over citizens' evaluations of candidates, and as such the media holds much sway in the American political system, despite relatively low levels of political accountability.&lt;ref name="Patterson" /&gt;

==Potential effects==
Most researchers who discuss the theory of mediacracy agree that media control of the American political system would lead to a decline in objective, rational information sharing in politics at best, and a society that is controlled by the owners of large media conglomerates at worst. However, it is important to remember that the theory of mediacracy as it is popularly discussed is accompanied by very negative assumptions about the true nature of media in the United States, which affects the predilections that researchers make about the future.

Paul Kurtz argues that current media trends emphasizing sensationalization tend to appeal to the lowest common denominator, which would contribute to a decline in the level of education and reflective cognitive thought of media consumers.&lt;ref name="Kurtz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurtz|first=Paul|date=1998|title=Secular humanists vs. the global mediacracy|journal=Free Inquiry|volume=18|issue=3|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurtz also argues that growing media consolidation harms diversity of opinion in society, and that the focus of media conglomerates on maximizing profits will lead to advertiser control over information obtained through media outlets.&lt;ref name="Kurtz" /&gt; This sentiment is greatly echoed by Fabian Tassano, who goes on to speculate that eventually a privileged elite of informed citizens will have control over society.&lt;ref name="Tassano" /&gt;

==Controversies==
The primary complaint against the theory of mediacracy is that researchers who support the theory are vastly overstating the effects of [[media influence]]. Sharon Meraz argues in her study ''The fight for 'how to think': Traditional media, [[social networks]], and issue interpretation'' that due to rising fragmentation in [[information control]] during the age of the [[internet]], there is "weakening influence of elite, traditional media as a singular power in influencing issue interpretation within networked political environments.".&lt;ref name="Meraz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meraz|first=Sharon|date=2011|title=The fight for 'how to think': Traditional media, social networks, and issue interpretation|journal=Journalism|volume=12|issue=1|pages=107–127|doi=10.1177/1464884910385193}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her study Meraz effectively shows that emerging technologies have reduced the power of media elites, leading to a decline in the [[hegemonic]] level of control central to the theories of most supporters of the mediacracy theory.&lt;ref name="Meraz" /&gt; Whether this is a permanent change, or a temporary result of new technology that will be eventually co-opted by media elites, is yet to be determined.

As different parts of China have very different [[standard of living|standards of living]], China does not set one [[minimum wage]] for the entire nation. Instead, the task of setting minimum wages is delegated to the local governments. Each [[Provinces of China|province, municipality, or region]] sets its own minimum wage in accordance with its own local conditions. According to the country's Employment Promotion Plan, minimum wages are supposed to increase in accordance with local living standards by at least 13 percent through 2015 and be no less than 40 percent of the average local wages. Minimum wages under such policies increased by an average 12.6 percent rate between 2008-2012. However, the growth rate of minimum wage levels decreased in 2016,  reflecting the Chinese government’s effort to reduce pressure on enterprises resulting from the uneven growth between labor costs and production rates.&lt;ref name=Zito/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2015/05/26/complete-guide-2015-minimum-wage-levels-across-china.html|title=A Complete Guide to 2015 Minimum Wage Levels Across China|last=Rainy Yao and Edoardo Rosettani|first=|date=|website=May 26, 2015|publisher=China Briefing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=China promises rise in minimum wage to close income gap|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-21347819|accessdate=11 August 2014|publisher=BBC|date=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall trends for the change of minimum wage levels diverge across provinces, with much smaller increases in developed regions and more rapid growth in less developed regions. From June 2015 and June 2016, 22 regions made changes to their minimum wage levels. In 2016, the average growth rate dropped to 14.5 percent from 17 percent in 2015. It is noteworthy that the Guangdong provincial government announced that it would maintain 2015 minimum wage levels in 2016 and 2017, and the minimum wage growth rate in Shanghai has decreased from 12.3 in 2015 to 8.4 percent in 2016. Guizhou province stands out as the region carrying the most significant hike of minimum wage levels in 2016, 55 percent.

== Minimum wage levels by jurisdiction ==

The table below lists monthly and hourly minimum wages by province and wage districts. Provinces are divided into different wage districts: [[Guizhou]], for instance, is divided up into Class A, B, and C, which each have their own minimum monthly and hourly wage. Note: these figures do not take into account deductions, such as pensions or social insurance.&lt;ref name=Zito/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Snowshill nychthemeron clock.jpg|thumb|The Nychthemeron Clock in [[Snowshill Manor]], Gloucestershire, UK]]
'''Nychthemeron''' {{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|k|ˈ|θ|ɛ|m|ər|ɒ|n}}, occasionally '''nycthemeron''' or ''nuchthemeron''  (Greek {{lang|el|νυχθήμερον}} from the words ''nykt-'' "night", and ''hemera'' "day, daytime"), is a period of 24 consecutive [[hour]]s. It is sometimes used, especially in technical literature, to avoid the ambiguity inherent in the term ''[[day]]''.

It is the period of time that a [[calendar]] normally labels with a [[calendar date|date]], although a nychthemeron simply designates a time-span that can start at any time, not just midnight.

==In other languages==
Some languages have a word for 24 hours, or more loosely a day plus a night in no particular order. Unlike a calendar date, only the length is defined, with no particular start or end. Furthermore, these words are considered basic and native to these languages, so unlike "nychthemeron", they are not associated with [[jargon]].

Words for 24 hours are listed in the middle column. For comparison, the word for ''day'', in the meaning of [[daytime]], the ''sunlit state'', the opposite of night, is also listed in the rightmost column:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54592">'''Organizational Information Theory (OIT)''' is a [[communication theory]], developed by [[Karl Weick]], offering systemic insight into the processing and exchange of information within [[organizations]] and among its members. Unlike the past structure-centered theory, OIT focuses on the process of organizing in dynamic, information-rich environments. Given that, It contents that the main activity of organizations is the process of making sense of equivocal information. Organizational members are instrumental to reduce equivocality and achieve sensemaking through some strategies — enactment, selection, and retention of information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With a framework that is [[interdisciplinary]] in nature, organizational information theory's desire to eliminate both ambiguity and complexity from workplace messaging builds upon earlier findings from [[general systems theory]] and [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]].

==Assumptions==
'''1. Human organizations exist in an information environment'''

Unlike senders and receivers models, OIT stands on the situational perspective.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putman|first=L. L.|last2=Sorenson|first2=R. L.|date=1982|title=Equivocal messages in organizations|url=|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=8|issue=2|pages=114–132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Karl Weick views a human organization as an open [[social system]]. People in that system develop a mechanism to establish goals, obtain and process information, or perceive the environment.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karl E.|first=Weick|last2=Daft|first2=Richard L.|date=April 1, 1984|title=Toward a Model of Organizations as Interpretation Systems|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=9|issue=2|pages=284–295|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, people and the environment come to conclusions on "what's going on here?". Colville believes that this attributional process is retrospective.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Take an education institutions as an example. A university can obtain information regarding students' needs in numerous ways. It might create feedback section in its website. It could organize alumni panels or academic affairs to attract prospective students and collect concrete questions they are interested in. It may also conduct the survey or host focus group to get the information. After that, the stuff of the university have to decide how to deal with these information, based on which, it has to set and accomplish its goals for current and prospective students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''2. The information an organization receives differs in terms of equivocality'''

Weick's posits that numerous feasible interpretations of reality exist when organizations process information.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Their varying levels of understandability lead to different outcomes of information inputs. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other academic works, scholars tend to say that messages are uncertain or ambiguous. While according to OIT, messages are described to be equivocal. believes that people proactively exclude a number of possibilities to perceive what is going on in the environment. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colville|first=Ian|date=July 1994|title=Searching for Karl Weick and Reviewing the Future|url=|journal=Organization|volume=1|issue=1|pages=218–224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to OIT's situational perspective, the meanings of messages consist of the messages, the interpretations of receivers, and the interactional context. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, ambiguity and uncertainty can mean that a standard answer - the only one true objective interpretation - exists.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

Also, Weick emphasizes that "the equivocality is the engine that motivates people to organize".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic ambiguities: Essays on communication, organization, and identity|last=Eisenberg|first=E. M.|publisher=Sage|year=2007|isbn=|location=CA|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maitlis and Christianson states that the equivocality trigger sensemaking for three reasons: environment jolts and organizational crises, threats to identity, and planned change interventions. &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maitlis|first=Sally|last2=Christianson|first2=Marlys|date=2014|title=Sensemaking in Organizations: Taking Stock and Moving Forward|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Annals|volume=Vol. 8, Iss. 1|pages=57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

'''3. Human organizations engage in information processing to reduce equivocality of information'''

Based upon the first two assumption, OIT proposes that information processing within organizations is a social activity. Sharing is the key feature of organizational information processing.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In that particular context, members jointly make sense the reality by reducing equivocality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication: the Process of Organizing|last=Johnson|first=B.M.|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|year=1977|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It other words, the sensemaking is a joint responsibility which includes numerous interdependent people to accomplish. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this process, organizations and its members combine actions and attributions together in order to find the balance between the complexity of thoughts and the simplicity of actions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Key Concepts ==

=== The organization ===
In order to place Weick's vision regarding Organizational Information Theory into proper working context, exploring his view regarding what constitutes the [[organization]] and how its individuals embody that construct might yield significant insights.

From a fundamental standpoint, he shared a belief that organizational validation is derived---not through bricks and mortar, or locale—but from a series of events which enable entities to "collect, manage and use the information they receive."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last=Richard|first=West|last2=Lynn H. Turner|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York City|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; In elaborating further on what constitutes an organization during early writings outlining OIT, Weick said, "The word organization is a noun and it is also a myth. if one looks for an organization, one will not find it. What will be found is that there are events linked together, that transpire within concrete walls and these sequences, their pathways, their timing, are the forms we erroneously make into substances when we talk about an organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/encyclop/weick.html|title=Weick's Model of Organizing|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2014|website=Weick's Model of Organizing|publisher=Babson University|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When viewed in this modular fashion, the organization meets Weick's theoretical vision by encompassing parameters that are less bound by concrete, wood, and structural restraints and more by an ability to serve as a repository where information can be consistently and effectively channeled.  Taking these defining characteristics into account, proper channel execution relies on maximization of messaging clarity, context, delivery and evolution through any system.

One example as to how these interactions might unfold on a more granular level within these confines can be gleaned through Weick's double interact loop, which he considers the "building blocks of every organization". Simply put, double interacts describe interpersonal exchanges that, inherently, occur across the organizational chain of command and in life, itself.

Thus:

"An '''''act''''' occurs when you say something (Can I have a [[Popsicle (brand)|Popsicle]]?).

An '''''interact''''' occurs when you say something ''and I respond'' ("No, it will spoil your dinner).

A '''''double interact''''' occurs when you say something, I respond to that, then ''you respond to that, adjusting the first statement'' ("Well, how about half a Popsicle?)

Weick envisions the organization as a system taking in equivocal information from its environment, trying to make sense of that information, and using what was learned for the future. As such, organizations evolve as they make sense out of themselves and the environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/theory/organize.html|title=Organizing|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=Oregon State. edu|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"These communication cycles are the reason Weick focuses more on relationships within an organization than he does on an individual's talent or performance. He believes that many outside consultants gloss over the importance of the double interact because they depart the scene before the effects of their recommended action bounce back to affect the actor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Look At Communication Theory|last=Green|first=Em|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York City|pages=|chapter=19 (Archived)|chapterurl=http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/infosystems.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing us to consider the organization in this alternative framework, Organizational Information Theory provides us with a robust platform from which to explore the communication process, literally, as it unfolds.

=== Loose coupling and the information environment ===
In developing Organizational Information Theory, Weick took a "social psychological stance that notes that individual behavior is more a function of the situation than of personal traits or role definitions. Therefore, people are 'loosely connected' in most organizations and have a large latitude for action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/encyclop/weick.html|title=Weick's Model of Organizing|last=|first=|date=November 15, 2014|website=Weick's Model of Organizing|publisher=Babson University|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a way of formalizing this phenomenon, he "invites us to use the metaphor "[[loose coupling]]" in order to better understand organizations and aspects of organizations --particularly the variant kinds of connections that exist within organizations--that are either marginalized, ignored, or suppressed by normative [[bureaucracy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/barlosky/karl-weicks-loosely-coupled-systems|title=Educational Organizations As Loosely Coupled Systems: An Exercise In Metaphorical Thinking|last=Barlosky|first=Dr. Martin|date=October 20, 2010|website=slideshare.com|publisher=University of Ottawa, Faculty of Education|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, in much the same way he suggested that organizations be viewed through a non-traditional lens in structure, he acknowledges that, by doing so, one may have to consider circumstances where "several means can produce the same result, while offering the appearance that lack of coordination, absence of regulations, and very slow feedback times are the norm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/org_theory/Scott_articles/weick_lcs.html|title=Karl Weick: Educational Organizations Loosely Coupled Systems|last=|first=|date=1976|website=Karl Weick, "Educational organizations as loosely coupled systems|series=Part 1-9|publisher=Babson University; Administrative Science Quarterly|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many might view these nuances as roadblocks or impediments to progress, Organizational Information Theory views each one as a catalyst for improved performance and positive change through: "increased sensitivity to a shifting environment, room for adaptation and creative solutions to develop, sub-system breakdown without damaging the entire organization, persistence through rapid environmental fluctuations and fostering an attitude where self-determination by the actors is key".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/org_theory/Scott_articles/weick_lcs.html|title=Karl Weick: Educational Organizations As Loosely Coupled Systems|last=|first=|date=1976|website=Karl Weick: Educational Organizations As Loosely Coupled Systems|series=Part 1-9|publisher=Babson University; Administrative Science Quarterly|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another overriding component of Weick's approach is that information afforded by the organization's environment---including the [[culture]] within the organizational environment itself---can impact the behaviors and interpretation of behaviors of those within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider et all|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, creation of organizational knowledge is impacted by each person’s personal [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] as well as the backdrop of the organization’s objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nonaka|first=Ikujiro|date=1994|title=A Dynamic Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation|journal=Organization Science|volume=5|pages=14–37|doi=10.1287/orsc.5.1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization must sift through the available information to filter out the valuable from the extraneous. Additionally, the organization must both interpret the information and coordinate that information to "make it meaningful for the members of the organization and its goals."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Communication Theory|last=West and Turner|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=|location=|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to construct meaning from these messages in their environment, the organization must reduce equivocality, while committing to an interpretation of the message which matches its culture and overall mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Emergent Organization: Communication as Its Site and Surface|last=Taylor|first=James R.|author2=Elizabeth Van Every|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Accociates|year=2000|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the "flashlight analogy" is used to explain the inseparability of action and knowledge present in this theory. One should imagine he is in a dark field at night with only a flashlight. He can vaguely pick out objects around him, but can't really tell what they are. Is that lump in the distance a bush or a dangerous animal? When he turns on his flashlight, however, he creates a circle of light that allows him to see clearly and act with relative clarity. The act of turning on the flashlight effectively created a new environment that allowed him to interpret the world around him. There is still only a single circle of light, though, and what remains outside that circle is still just as mysterious, unless the flashlight is redirected. With organizational information theory, the flashlight is mental. The environment is located in the mind of the actor and is imposed on him by his experiences, which makes them more meaningful.

=== Equivocality ===
Based on the number of rapidly moving parts within any organization (i.e., information flows, individuals, etc....) the foundation upon which messaging is received constantly shifts, thus leaving room for unintended consequences relative to true intent and meaning. Equivocality arises when communication outreach "can be given different interpretations because their substance is ambiguous, conflicted, obscure, or introduces uncertainty into a situation".&lt;ref name="fisherhouse1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fisherhouse.com/bsu/comm361/biology/tsld013.htm|title = Equivocality Reduction Theory|date = n.d.|accessdate = November 15, 2014|website = fisherhouse.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational Information Theory provides a knowledge base and framework which can help mitigate these risks through by decreasing the level of ambiguity present during relevant communication activities. Simultaneously, it serves as a construct whose potential for growth stems from active use "communicating and organizing" and "reducing the amount of equivocality" within a specified domain.&lt;ref name="fisherhouse1"/&gt;

In looking at how equivocality evolves more closely, it can also manifest itself as a signature for highly interpretive events, along with those where the parameters (and uncertainty levels) are, traditionally, much more concrete. For instance, "equivocality also describes situations where there is agreement on a set of descriptive criteria (say, desirable market/undesirable market) but disagreement on either their boundaries (i.e., the point at which markets go from being desirable to undesirable) or on their application to a particular situation (whether a particular market is desirable or undesirable). Managing equivocality requires coordinating meaning among members of an organization, and is an essential part of organizing. Equivocality arises because everyone's experiences are unique; individuals and communities develop their own sets of values and beliefs and tend to interpret events differently. Equivocality also may result from unreliable or conflicting information sources, noisy communication channels, differing or ambiguous goals and preferences, vague roles and responsibilities, or disparate political interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.cba.neu.edu/~mzack/articles/orgig/orgig.htm|title = Managing Organizational Ignorance|date = 1999|accessdate = November 15, 2014|website = cba.neu.edu|publisher = College of Business Administration, Northeastern University|last = Zack|first = Michael H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensemaking===
Karl Weick's Organizational Information Theory views organizations as " '[[sensemaking]] systems' which incessantly create and re-create conceptions of themselves and of all around them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://commorgiland.wordpress.com/tag/organisations|title = Karl Weick's Theory of Organizing|date = September 16, 2012|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = commorgiland.com|publisher = Penguin Books|last = Hickson|first = D.|last2 = Pugh|first2 = D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a less clinical (and more intuitive) perspective, Weick and his collaborator, [[Kathleen M. Sutcliffe]], jointly describe sensemaking as an action which "involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words or speech and that serves as a springboard to action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.slideshare.net/FlorianMaderebner/karl-e-weick-organizing-and-the-prozess-of-sensemaking?related=1|title = Karl E. Weick--Organizing and the Process of Sensemaking|date = October 13, 2011|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = slideshare.net|publisher = Florian Maderebner|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its more defined organizational context, sensemaking can be looked at as a process "that is applied to both individuals and groups who are faced with new information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs".&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=978-0803971776|title = The Story of Sensemaking|date = September 29, 2013|publisher = |last = Reed|first = William A.|url = http://amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In factoring the uneasiness (or [[cognitive dissonance]]) that results from this experience, they will create narratives to fit the story which serve both as a buffer and a guiding light for further renditions of the story. "This explains how, for example, religious groups can have such stringent beliefs, how political parties can be confident in their diametrically-opposed positions, how organizations can develop very different cultures, and how individuals can develop very different interpretations for the same event".&lt;ref name="amazon1"/&gt;

The process of sensemaking usually starts with a circumstance or problem which requires a certain level of interpretation by others (i.e., something did or did not happen). Whether it is consciously or unconsciously driven, those involved then make a commitment to a perceived viewpoint surrounding those facts. "Commitment forms around the interpretation to bind the interpretation to future action. When publicly communicated, commitment is especially strong. Individuals are motivated to justify their commitments, so they initiate future actions and continually refine their interpretation of the original event so that their commitment to a course of action is deemed appropriate. These new actions produce "evidence" that validates the interpretation and are used to increase decision confidence".&lt;ref name="amazon1"/&gt;

These are critical facets which surround the sensemaking process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.slideshare.net/FlorianMaderebner/karl-e-weick-organizing-and-the-prozess-of-sensemaking?related=1|title = Karl E. Weick---Organizing And The Process of Sensemaking|date = October 13, 2011|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = slideshare.com|publisher = Florian Maderebner|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

a) sensemaking starts with noticing and bracketing

b) sensemaking is about labeling

c) sensemaking is retrospective

d) sensemaking is about presumption

e) sensemaking is social and systemic

f) sensemaking is about action

g) sensemaking is about organizing through communication

The idea of sensemaking is also a theme within Organizational Information Theory. Organizational sensemaking contrasts with organizational interpretation. When an organization interprets information, there is already a frame of reference in place and this is enough information for an organization to change course. Sensemaking occurs, however, when no initial frame of reference exists and no obvious connection presents itself. According to Weick, sensemaking can be driven by beliefs or actions. Beliefs shape what people experience and give form for the actions they take. For example, disagreement about beliefs in an organization can lead to arguments. This is a form of sensemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Czarniawska|first=Barbara|title=Contemporary Organization Theory|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|pages=271–272|authorlink=Karl Weick: Concepts, style and reflection|editor=Campbell Jones and Rolland Munro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, sensemaking make impact on organizations in three aspects: strategic change, organizational learning, and innovation and creativity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Regarding strategic change, individuals are triggered to alter their own roles and behaviors and also help others to coordinate with their new changes. Then a new organizational order about strategies will be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corley|first=K.G.|date=2004|title=Identity ambiguity and change in the wake of a corporate spin-off|url=|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=49|issue=2|pages=173–208|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for learning, on the one hand, people will learn from error. Organizational understandings and routines will be revised, updated and strengthened in response to the errors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=L.T.|date=2011|title=Bridging corporate and organizational communication: Review, development and a look to the future|url=|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|volume=25|issue=3|pages=383–414|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, sensemaking about material gathered and available options make a great contribution to learn in more conventional contexts, especially in knowledge-intensive work settings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haas|first=M.R.|date=2006|title=Knowledge gathering, team capabilities, and project performance in challenging work environments|url=|journal=Management Science|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1170–1184|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The details about its impact on innovation can be seen in "extension" section.

=== Choice Points, Behavior Cycles and Assembly Rules ===
When information messaging remains an unclear variable, organizations will usually revert to a number of Organizational Information Theory-based methodologies which are designed to encourage ambiguity reduction:

1. '''''Choice Points'''''--Describes an organization's decision to ask: "should we attend to some aspect of our environment that was rejected before?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/4575320|title=Process of Organizing: Karl E. Weicks|date=n.d.|website=academia.edu|publisher=|accessdate=November 16, 2014|last1=Felicia|first1=Ratyh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-tracing one's steps can provide both management and individuals with a comfort zone in addressing frequency and volume regarding messaging, lest anything have been missed.

2. '''''Behavior Cycles'''''--Represents "deliberate communication activities on the part of an organization to decrease levels of ambiguity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last=West|first=Richard|last2=Lynn H. Turner|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2014|isbn=|edition=Fifth|location=New York City|pages=304+}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, degrees of messaging equivocality have a direct impact on how many cycles are required to alleviate its effects. Within this realm, three distinct steps emerge that are each focused on providing messaging clarity: act, response and adjustment. Each is designed to facilitate the retention and selection process. Examples of behavior cycles include staff meetings, coffee-break rumoring, e-mail conversations, internal reports, etc..

3. '''''Assembly Rules--'''''Signifies a broader construct, "which may include evaluating how standard operating procedures (SOP) are carried out, along with chain-of-command designations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/theory/organize.html|title=Organizing|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=cmm|publisher=oregonstate.edu|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By its nature, this approach explores protocol measures that might be effective in handling ambiguity, as well as, how related processes might unfold.

== Strategies ==

=== The Principles of Equivocality ===
Three critical principles, or relationship, guide the the process of equivocality reduction. They are: the relationship among equivocality, the rules and the cycles must be carefully analyzed; the relationship between the number of rules and amount of cycles; the relationship between the number of cycles and the amount of equivocality. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

To be specific, Weick posits that the amount of perceived equivocality influence the number of rules.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Generally speaking, there is a negative correlation between the level of equivocality and the amount of rules. To be specific, the more equivocal the message is, the few rules are available to process that information. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Meanwhile, an inverse relationship also exists between rules and cycles. In other words, fewer rules lead to more use of cycles. Then, the increasing number of cycles used can reduce the equivocality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Stages of Equivocality Reduction===
According to Weick, organizations experience continuous change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weick and Quinn|year=1999|title=Organizational Change and Development|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=50|pages=361–386|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.361|pmid=15012461}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are ever-adapting, as opposed to a change followed by a period of stagnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizational Change and Development 362|last=Weick and Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Building off of [[Orlikowski]]’s idea that the changes that take place are not necessarily planned, but rather inevitably occur over time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orlikowki|year=1996|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational Information Theory explains how organizations use information found within the environment to interpret and adjust to change. In the event that the information available in the information environment is highly equivocal, the organization engages in a series of cycles that serve as a means to reduce uncertainty about the message.  A highly equivocal message might require several iterations of the behavior cycles.  An inverse relationship exists between the number of rules established by the organization to reduce equivocality and the number of cycles necessary to reduce equivocality. Similarly, the more cycles used, the less equivocality remains.

'''Enactment''' 

Weick emphasizes the role of action, or enactment in change within an organization. Through a combination of individuals with existing data and external knowledge, and through iterative process of trial and error, ideas are refined until they become actualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nonaka|first=Ikujiro|year=1994|title=A Dynamic Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation|journal=Organization Science|volume=5|page=27|doi=10.1287/orsc.5.1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enactment also plays a key role in the idea of [[sensemaking]], the process by which people give meaning to experience. Essentially, the action helps to define the meaning, making those within the organization's environment responsible for the environment itself.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Organizing|last=Weick|first=Karl|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company|year=1979|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selection''' 

Upon analyzing the information the organization possesses, the selection stage includes evaluation of outstanding information necessary to further reduce equivocality.  The organization must decide the best method for obtaining the remaining information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Communication Theory|last=West and Turner|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the decision-makers of the organization play a key role in this stage.

There are three critical processes happening in this stage: 1) members make a choice among interpretations; 2) members choose the type and amount of rules for processing those interpretations; 3) communication cycles start to work on those interpretations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Retention''' 

The final stage occurs when the organization sifts through the information it has compiled in attempts to adapt to change, and determines which information is beneficial and worth utilizing again.  Inefficient, superfluous and otherwise unnecessary information that do not contribute to the completion of the project or reduction of equivocality will most likely not be retained for future application of similar project.

== Applications ==
=== Application in Health Care ===
One of the key real-world applications regarding Weick's concept of Organizational Information Theory can be found in healthcare. There, he went so far as to personally develop a dedicated [[health communication]]s approach which "emphasizes the central role of communication and information processing within social groups and institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samples.jbpub.com/9781449697211/28123_CH03_Pass2.pdf|title=Weick's Health Communication Theory|last=Raingruber|first=Bonnie|date=2014|website=samples.jbpub.com|publisher=Jones and Gartlett Learning|pages=71–72|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Weick's work draws correlations between accuracy of information and the ability of organizations to adapt to change.

Weick's model of organizing plays a powerful role in improving communication of [[health care]] and [[health promotion]]. The OIT enables consumers and providers to reduce equivocality when they face complex health care and health promotion situations. "In health care and health promotion, enactment processes are used to make sense of different health-related challenges, selection processes are used to choose different courses of action in response to these challenges, and retention processes are used to preserve what was learned from enactment and selection processes for guiding future health care/promotion activities".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kreps|first=Gary L.|date=2009-03-01|title=Applying Weick's model of organizing to health care and health promotion: Highlighting the central role of health communication|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399108006423|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|series=Theories in Health Communication Research|volume=74|issue=3|pages=347–355|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2008.12.002|pmid=19150591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the theory can evaluate the problems of excessive nurse turnover in public hospital and develop interventions to address the problems. Hospital administrators used to deal with the problem by making efforts in recruiting nurses. Although the strategy attracted more new nurses, it was expensive to maintain the recruitment efforts. Thus, a retention program was generated under the Weick's model of organizing. The program used questionnaires, in-depth interviews and [[focus group]] discussion to figure out nurses' concerns (enactment). The research's results identified strategies to solve those problems (selection). Then the program gathered further information about nurses' attitude and advice for these strategies and implemented refined strategies (retention).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Application in Education ===
Some scholars advocate that loosely coupled system and [[Garbage Can Model|garbage can model]] guarantee the flexibility of higher education organizations. Proponents of loose coupling system believe that the university's academic freedom and students' individual identity will be destroyed if administrators tighten up the loose coupling. However, Weick argues that the "unpredictability (of an organization) is insufficient evidence for concluding that the elements in a system are loosely coupled".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weick|first=Karl E.|date=1976-01-01|title=Educational Organizations as Loosely Coupled Systems|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.2307/2391875|jstor=2391875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars notice the Weick's warning that loose coupling should not be used as a normative model. Universities will not lose their academic freedom with a tighter coupled system. Frank W. states that "They (universities) are tightly coupled in some aspects and uncoupled in other aspects. Tight coupling occurs when an issue supports the status quo. Uncoupling occurs when an issue challenges the status quo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=Frank W.|date=1982-01-01|title=Tightening up Loose Coupling in Organizations of Higher Education|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=27|issue=4|pages=653–669|doi=10.2307/2392536|jstor=2392536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weick's model of organizing can be applied to reduce equivocality in the large-lecture classroom and to increase students' engagement. Large-lecture classroom can be recognized as an information environment with various degrees of equivocality. Students enact assembly rules to make sense of messages in class with low equivocality. Behavior cycles which focus on act, response and adjustment can be utilized by students to clarify messages with high equivocality. "Students assess how the applied rules and cycles affected their ability to interpret the original input's equivocality and decide if additional rules and cycles are needed to develop an effective response to the input".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledford|first=Christy J. W.|last2=Saperstein|first2=Adam K.|last3=Cafferty|first3=Lauren A.|last4=McClintick|first4=Stacey H.|last5=Bernstein|first5=Ethan M.|year=2015|title=Any Questions? An Application of Weick's Model of Organizing to Increase Student Involvement in the Large-Lecture Classroom|journal=Communication Teacher|volume=29|issue=2|pages=116–128|doi=10.1080/17404622.2014.1003309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students feel intimidated when they raise questions in the large-lecture classroom. Thus, the synchronicity and anonymous nature of [[Microblogging|microblog]] make itself a second channel to facilitate students' question asking as well as decreases their equivocality. Faculty enables to retain organizational intelligence through microblog format.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Application in Conflict Management ===
It is difficult to find two parties share exact same interest. Thus, conflict and cooperation coexist with each other in organizations. Institutionalized [[conflict management]] is frequently used by managers to create sustained organizations. [[Metaphor]]s provides a comprehensive approach to understand and interpret the information environment which includes new knowledge and new practices. "Metaphor created by subsidiary representatives of the conflict management practice reflects the quality and the depth of [[Institutionalisation|institutionalization]]". Metaphors can be recognized as a collective sensemaking and a depict of organizational environment. Individuals are able to make decisions which depends on their metaphors about conflict in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Leigh Anne|last2=Inlow|first2=Lin|last3=Feng|first3=Jing Betty|date=2014-12-01|title=Institutionalizing Sustainable Conflict Management in Organizations: Leaders, Networks, and Sensemaking|journal=Conflict Resolution Quarterly|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=155–176|doi=10.1002/crq.21106|issn=1541-1508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

=== Utility ===
This theory focuses on the process of communication instead of the role of individual actors. It examines the complexities of information processing in lieu of trying to understand people within a group or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last=West and Turner|first=Richard and Lynn|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=2001|location=New York|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, this theory closely examines the act of organizing, rather than organizations themselves. Weick defines organizing as, "the resolving of equivocality in an enacted environment by means of interlocked behaviors embedded in conditionally related process" and that, "human beings organize primarily to help them reduce the information uncertainty in their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Organizations: Rational, Natural, and Open Systems|last=Scott|first=W. Richard|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2003|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logical Consistency ===
Some scholars argue that this theory fails the test of logical consistency and that people are not necessarily guided by rules in an organization. Some organizational members might not have any interest in communication rules and their actions might have more to do with intuition than anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perspectives on Organizational Communication|last=Daniels|first=T.D.|author2=B.D. Spiker|author3=M.J. Papa|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2008|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics posit that organizational information theory views the organization as a static entity, rather than one that changes over time. Dynamic adjustments, such as downsizing, outsourcing and even advancements in technology should be taken into consideration when examining an organization—and organizational information theory does not account for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Emergent Organization: Communication as Its Site and Surface|last=Taylor|first=James R.|author2=Elizabeth Van Every|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Accociates|year=2000|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=144–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this theory assert that it does not deal significantly with [[Command hierarchy|hierarchy]] or [[Social conflict|conflict]], two prominent themes associated with organizational communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Emergent Organization: Communication as Its Site and Surface|last=Taylor|first=James R.|author2=Elizabeth Van Every|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Accociates|year=2000|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the hierarchical context makes difficulties for sensemaking and proposes a flow of downward negative feedback. Sensemaking process can be applied to explain why employees remain silence in the organization. Two sensemaking resources which are expectation and identity preclude employees from giving upward negative feedback. Employees expect that their negative feedback for supervisors will pose threat to their job security or might be neglected by supervisors. Besides, employees make sense of their own understanding and identify themselves as deficient experts who are unable to make best decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bisel|first=Ryan S.|last2=Arterburn|first2=Elissa N.|date=2012-07-20|title=Making Sense of Organizational Members' Silence: A Sensemaking-Resource Model|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=29|issue=3|pages=217–226|doi=10.1080/08824096.2012.684985|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scope ===
The theory also neglects the larger social, historical and [[Institutional theory|institutional context]]. The role of the institutional context and [[Cultural cognition|cultural-cognitive]] institutions in sensemaking should be paid more attention to. According to Taylor and Van Every, "what is missing [in Weick’s 1995 ''Sensemaking in Organizations'' version of enactment] ... is an understanding of the organization as a communicational construction or an awareness of the institutionalizing of human society that accompanies organization with its many internal contradictions and tensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-LmPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=The+emergent+organization:+Communication+as+its+site+and+surface#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20emergent%20organization:%20Communication%20as%20its%20site%20and%20surface&amp;f=false|title=The Emergent Organization: Communication As Its Site and Surface|last=Taylor|first=James R.|last2=Every|first2=Elizabeth J. Van|date=1999-11-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135691134|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors are constrained by cognition through socialization in the job, school system and the media when they do sensemaking in institutions. It causes less variety and more stability in institutions. In order to expand the theory, [[Mechanism (sociology)|social mechanism]] can be applied to consider how institutions prime, edit and trigger sensemaking besides the traditional cognitive constraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weber|first=Klaus|last2=Glynn|first2=Mary Ann|date=2006-11-01|title=Making Sense with Institutions: Context, Thought and Action in Karl Weick's Theory|url=http://oss.sagepub.com/content/27/11/1639|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=27|issue=11|pages=1639–1660|doi=10.1177/0170840606068343|issn=0170-8406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extension of OIT ==
=== Dr. Brenda Dervin: the Sense-Making Approach ===
As an adjunct to Weick's work regarding organizational information, noted academician (and fellow researcher), Dr. [[Brenda Dervin]], followed a similar path in exploring how ambiguity and uncertainty are handled across platforms.

However, in broaching these issues from a more communication-driven perspective Dr. Dervin found that these issues evolve from a different place; one, in fact, that unlike Weick, assumes "discontinuity between entities, times and spaces". Instead of [[modularity]], "each individual is an entity moving through time and space, dealing with other entities which include other people, artifacts, systems, or institutions. The individual's making of sense as a strategy for bridging these gaps is the central metaphor of the [[Sense-Making Approach]]".&lt;ref name="washington2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pim.ischool.washington.edu/pim06/files/spurgin-paper.pdf&gt;.|title = The Sense-Making Approach and the Study of Personal Information Management|date = 2006|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = ISchool, University of Washington.edu|publisher = University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|last = Spurgin|first = Kristina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By utilizing this alternate prism, Dr. Dervin found that "patterns of gap-bridging behavior are better-predicted by the way individuals define the gaps in which they find themselves, than by any attributes that might be typically used to define individuals across space and time, such as demographic categories or personality indicators. Situations and people are constantly changing, but patterns of interaction between people and situations as they are defined by people seem to be somewhat more stable".&lt;ref name="washington2006"/&gt;

=== Organizational Information Theory and Innovation ===
"In 2000, the researchers Doughtery, Borrelli, Munir and O'Sullivan discovered that the level of innovation capability within organizations was connected to the ability of making ''the right'' sense of collective experiences in uncertain or ambiguous situations such as radical changes in the market or technology paradigm shifts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2012/01/17/for-innovation-to-happen-it-makes-sense-to-sensemake|title = For Innovation To Happen It Makes Sense To Sensemake|date = January 17, 2012|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = Innovation Management|publisher = Innovation Psychology|last = Bill|first = Susanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instinctively, it seems, the sensemaking systems of less innovative companies appeared to be inhibited by tendencies to "play within existing rules...filter out unexpected information or unorthodox competency sets, resulting in [[groupthink]] and more of the same". Meanwhile, "innovative organizations ...dared to challenge existing business logic and made use of new insights"...these, in turn, were used to "change existing interpretations and schemes and thus, influence the overall evolvement of the organization so that the interpretation schemes themselves became more apt to deal with outside forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2012/01/17/for-innovation-to-happen-it-makes-sense-to-sensemake|title = For Innovation to Happen It Makes Sense To Sensemake|date = January 17, 2012|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = Innovation Management|publisher = Innovation Psychology|last = Bill|first = Susanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weick proposes three dynamics which are closely relevant to innovation: "that the knowledge is both tacit and articulated, that linking processes cut across several levels of organizational action, and that linking processes embody several tensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nz1RT-xskeoC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=sensemaking+in+organizations+weick#v=onepage&amp;q=sensemaking%20in%20organizations%20weick&amp;f=false|title=Sensemaking in Organizations|last=Weick|first=Karl E.|date=1995-05-31|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780803971776|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study applies these dynamics and organizational sensemaking to analyze how people make sense of market and technology knowledge for product innovation. Innovative organizations have a system of sensemaking that allows actors to "construct, bracket, interpret, and rethink the right kinds of market and technology knowledge in the right way for innovation". However, actors in non-innovative organizations make sense of knowledge in a separate way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=Deborah|last2=Borrelli|first2=Leslie|last3=Munir|first3=Kamal|last4=O’Sullivan|first4=Alan|date=2000-09-01|title=Systems of organizational sensemaking for sustained product innovation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092347480000028X|journal=Journal of Engineering and Technology Management|volume=17|issue=3–4|pages=321–355|doi=10.1016/S0923-4748(00)00028-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer-mediated Communication(CMC) and Sensemaking ===
[[Computer-mediated communication]] have gradually become an essential part of communication in current work context and organizational settings. Weick proposes that sensemaking away from terminals experiences five procedures: effectuate, triangulate, affiliate, deliberate, and consolidate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

According to Garphart, compared with in traditional workplace, sensemaking in electronically enabled work place becomes more complex and ambigous.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gephart|first=R. P.|date=2004|title=Sensemaking and New Media at Work|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=48|issue=4|pages=479–495|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and act differently in the above five procedures. To be specific. four distinct features can be seen. Firstly, the process of reciprocity is much confined. The reciprocity of perspectives might be delayed when communicators are at different "terminals". Also, sensory cues are nearly absent in this process, while textual communication is commonly used. In other words communication modes are limited. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Secondly, the levels of equivocality and the difficulties of sensemaking increase. The problems of understanding computer or new technical terms emerge as a new obstacle to be overcome for achieving sensemaking in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pentland|first=B.|date=1995|title="Read me what it says on your screen": The interpretive problem in technical service work|url=|journal=Technology Studies|volume=2|pages=50–79|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thirdly, less [https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/et+cetera+principle etcetera principles] can be used to in CMC. In other words, CMC tend to build up a rigidly structured communication environment, due to which, people will find it harder to gain additional information from outside the computer system. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Lastly, CMC alters the occupational tasks. Some technical background or computer-related knowledge are required to support general occupational tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the age of the smart machine: The future of work and power|last=Zuboff|first=S.|publisher=Basic Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major models proposed to explain the sensemaking with CMC in organizations: Weick's cognitive model and a social interaction model.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  

Weick believes that people will increasingly encounter with problems to make sense information with new technology. Cognitive Model posits states that new computer technologies have a huge impact on sensemaking in organizations in five aspects. First, actions deficiencies always happen because real objects can not be fully captured and represented by simulated images and symbols. Second, comparisons are often deficient due to limited reciprocity of perspectives and nearly absent feedback based on direct action. Third, works at terminals are always solitary and will decrease affiliation of communication. Fourth, constant inflow of information in computer interrupt or even prevent the deliberation. Lastly, sensemaking at terminals always leads to consolidation deficiencies due to self-contained nature of computer. &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weick|first=K.|date=1985|title=Cosmos vs. Chaos: Sense and Nonsense in Electronic Contexts|url=|journal=Organizational Dynamics|volume=14|issue=2|pages=51–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Social Interactional Model, deriving from [[phenomenological sociology]] and [[ethnomethodology]], emphasizes the intersubjective and objective features of sensemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The phenomenology of the social world|last=Schutz|first=A.|publisher=Heinemann Educational Books|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersubjective feature reveals that people always try to obtain subjective meanings of others. In CMC, communicators are required to actively figure out whether they share meanings with others, including computers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In this process, people are expected to use normal form objects, terms and utterances to portray correctly the contexts and experiences in order to let computer recognize. &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gephart|first=R.P.|date=1993|title=The textual approach: Risk and blame in disaster sensemaking|url=|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=36|pages=1465–1514|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasing number of knowledge are needed to achieve sensemaking than that in traditional workplace. Thus, etcetera principle come into use to deal with vague or implicit meanings.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; People will actively seek additional information to clarify the meanings.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Meanwhile, descriptive vocabularies are used as [[Indexical expression|indexical expressions]] to assist people to resolve equivocal meanings based on contextual, cultural, technical knowledge and information. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

{{Rquote|right|There are these four ways of answering questions. Which four? There are questions that should be answered categorically [straightforwardly yes, no, this, that]. There are questions that should be answered with an analytical (qualified) answer [defining or redefining the terms]. There are questions that should be answered with a counter-question. There are questions that should be put aside. These are the four ways of answering questions.|[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]|''[[Sutta Pitaka]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/anguttara/an04-042.html Source for quotation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210012407/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/anguttara/an04-042.html |date=February 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''question''' is an utterance which typically functions as a request for information. Questions can thus be understood as a kind of [[illocutionary act]] in the field of [[pragmatics]] or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]] such as [[alternative semantics]] or [[inquisitive semantics]]. The information requested is expected to be provided in the form of an [[answer (response)|answer]]. Questions are often conflated with [[Interrogative|interrogatives]], which are the [[grammar|grammatical]] forms typically used to achieve them. [[Rhetorical question]]s, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered. Conversely, non-interrogative grammatical structures may be considered questions as in the case of the [[imperative mood|imperative]] sentence "tell me your name".

== Uses==
[[File:BBC World Questions - Hungary.jpg|thumb|Jonathan Dimbleby questioning - BBC World Service]]
The principal use of questions is to elicit information from the person being addressed by indicating the information which the speaker (or writer) desires &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Searle |first1=J |title=Speech acts |date=1969 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, questions can also be used for a number of other purposes. Questions may be asked for the purpose of testing someone's knowledge, as in a [[quiz]] or [[Test (assessment)|examination]]. These are termed [[Display question|display questions]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Searle |first1=J |title=Speech acts |date=1969 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Raising a question may guide the questioner along an avenue of [[research]] (see [[Socratic method]]).

A [[research question]] is an interrogative statement that manifests the objective or line of scholarly or scientific inquiry designed to address a specific gap in knowledge.  Research questions are expressed in a language that is appropriate for the academic community that has the greatest interest in answers that would address said gap.  These interrogative statements serve as launching points for the academic pursuit of new knowledge by directing and delimiting an investigation of a topic, a set of studies, or an entire program of research.

A [[rhetorical question]] is asked to make a point, and does not expect an answer (often the answer is implied or obvious). As such, it is not a true question. Similarly, requests for things other than information, as with "Would you pass the salt?" are interrogative in form, but are not true questions.

Pre-suppositional or [[loaded question]]s, such as "Have you stopped beating your wife?" may be used as a joke or to embarrass an audience, because any answer a person could give would imply more information than he was willing to affirm.

Questions can also be used as titles of works of literature, art and scholarship. Examples include [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s short story ''[[How Much Land Does a Man Need?]]'', the painting ''[[And When Did You Last See Your Father? (picture)|And When Did You Last See Your Father?]]'', the movie ''[[What About Bob?]]'', and the academic work ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]]''

===By purpose===
Various categorizations of questions have been proposed.{{by whom|date=January 2014}} With regard to research projects, one system distinguishes:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url = http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/resques.php 
| title  =Research Methods Knowledge Base |publisher=Socialresearchmethods.net 
| date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''descriptive questions'', used primarily with the aim of describing the existence of some thing or process
* ''relational questions'', designed to look at the relationships between two or more variables
* ''causal questions'', designed to determine whether certain variables affect one or more outcome variables

For the purpose of surveys, one type of question asked is the [[closed-ended question|closed-ended]] (also ''closed'' or ''dichotomous'') question, usually requiring a yes/no answer or the choice of an option(s) from a list (see also [[multiple choice]]). There are also ''nominal questions'', designed to inquire about a level of quantitative measure, usually making connections between a number and a concept (as in "1 = Moderate; 2 = Severe; 3 = ...").&lt;ref&gt;Research Methods Knowledge Base. Types of Questions. [http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/questype.php Socialresearchmethods.net]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open-ended question|Open-ended]] or ''open'' questions give the respondent greater freedom to provide information or opinions on a topic. (The distinction between closed and open questions is applied in a variety of other contexts too, such as [[job interview]]ing.) Surveys also often contain ''qualifying questions'' (also called ''filter questions'' or ''contingency questions''), which serve to determine whether the respondent needs to continue on to answer subsequent questions.

Some types of questions that may be used in an educational context are listed in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]] of educational objectives. These include questions designed to test and promote:

* Knowledge: [[Five Ws|Who, what, when, where, why, how]]&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? Describe&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;?
* Comprehension: Retell&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;
* Application: How is&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;an example of&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;?; How is&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;related to&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;?; Why is&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;significant?
* Analysis: What are the parts or features of&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? Classify&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;according to&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;;
* Synthesis: What would you infer from&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;?  What ideas can you add to&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? How would you design a new&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? What would happen if you combined&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? What solutions would you suggest for&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;?
* Evaluation: Do you agree that&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? What do you think about&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? What is the most important&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? Place the following in order of priority&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? How would you decide about&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? What criteria would you use to assess&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;? &lt;ref&gt;Types of Questions Based on Bloom's Taxonomy. (Bloom, et al., 1956).{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenzie's "Questioning Toolkit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://questioning.org/Q7/toolkit.html Questioning Toolkit]&lt;/ref&gt; lists 17 types of questions, and suggests that thinkers need to orchestrate and combine these types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://questioning.org/oct07/punchy.html "Punchy Question Combinations"]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these question types include the ''irreverent question'', the ''apparently irrelevant question'', the ''hypothetical question'' and the ''unanswerable question''. Questions can also be [[:wikt:felicitous|infelicitous]], being based on incorrect and illogical premises (e.g. "Why do cats have green wings?").

Strategic studies also took into consideration the questioning process. In Humint (Human Intelligence), a taxonomy of questions includes:
* Direct questions: basic questions normally beginning with an interrogative (who, what, where, when, how, or why) and requiring a narrative answer. They are brief, precise, and simply worded to avoid confusion.
* Initial questions: directed toward obtaining the basic information on the topic. In other words, they are the “who, what, where, when, how, and why” of each topic.
* Follow-up questions: used to expand on and complete the information obtained from the initial questions.
* Nonpertinent questions: questions that do not pertain to the collection objectives. They are used to conceal the collection objectives or to strengthen rapport with the source.
* Repeat questions: ask the source for the same information obtained in response to earlier questions.
* Control questions: developed from recently confirmed information from other sources that is not likely to have changed.
* Prepared questions developed by the HUMINT collector, normally in writing, prior to the questioning. 
* Prepared questions: used primarily when dealing with information of a technical nature or specific topic.
* Negative questions: questions that contain a negative word in the question itself such as, "Didn’t you go to the pick-up point?”
* Compound questions: consist of two questions asked at the same time; for example,  “Where were you going after work and who were you to meet there?”
* Vague questions: do not have enough information for the source to understand exactly what the HUMINT collector is asking. They may be incomplete, general, or otherwise nonspecific.
* Elicitation: is the gaining of information through direct interaction with a human source where the source is not aware of the specific purpose for the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006).

===By grammatical form &lt;span id="wh"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
Questions that ask whether or not some statement is true are called [[yes–no question]]s (or ''polar questions'', or ''general questions''&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;William Chisholm, Louis T. Milic, John A.C. Greppin. Interrogativity. – John Benjamins Publishing, 1982. &lt;/ref&gt;), since they can in principle be answered by a [[yes and no|"yes" or "no"]] (or similar words or expressions in other languages). Examples include "Do you take sugar?", "Should they be believed?" and "Am I the loneliest person in the world?"

A type of question that is similar in form to a yes–no question, but is not intended to be answered with a "yes" or "no", is the ''[[alternative question]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnAlternativeQuestion.htm |title=What is an alternative question?|publisher=SIL International |work=Glossary of linguistic terms |editor1-last=Loos |editor1-first=Eugene E. |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Susan |editor3-last=Day |editor3-first=Dwight H., Jr. |editor4-last=Jordan |editor4-first=Paul C. |editor5-last=Wingate |editor5-first=J. Douglas }}&lt;/ref&gt; (or ''choice question''). This presents two or more alternative answers, as in "Do you want fish or lamb?", or "Are you supporting England, Ireland or Wales?" The expected response is one of the alternatives, or some other indication such as "both" or "neither" (questionnaire forms sometimes contain an option "none of the above" or similar for such questions). Because of their similarity in form to yes–no questions, they may sometimes be answered "yes" or "no", possibly humorously or as a result of misunderstanding.

The other main type of question (other than yes–no questions) is those called '''''wh''-questions''' (or ''non-polar questions'', or ''special questions''&lt;ref name="Chisholm" /&gt;). These use [[interrogative word]]s (''wh''-words) such as ''when'', ''which'', ''who'', ''how'', etc. to specify the information that is desired. (In some languages the formation of such questions may involve [[wh-movement|''wh''-movement]] – see the section below for grammatical description.) The name derives from the fact that most of the English interrogative words (with the exception of ''how'') begin with the letters ''wh''. These are the types of question sometimes referred to in journalism and other investigative contexts as the [[Five Ws]].

[[Tag question]]s are a grammatical structure in which a declarative statement or an imperative is turned into a question by adding an interrogative fragment (the "tag"), such as ''right'' in "You remembered the eggs, right?", or ''isn't it'' in "It's cold today, isn't it?" Tag questions may or may not be answerable with a yes or no.

As well as direct questions (such as ''Where are my keys?''), there also exist [[indirect question]]s (also called ''interrogative content clauses''), such as ''where my keys are''. These are used as [[subordinate clause]]s in sentences such as "I wonder where my keys are" and "Ask him where my keys are." Indirect questions do not necessarily follow the same rules of grammar as direct questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lessons-indirect-questions/|title=Indirect Questions - English Grammar Lesson - ELC|date=2017-11-27|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English and some other languages, indirect questions are formed without inversion of subject and verb (compare the word order in "where are they?" and "(I wonder) where they are"). Indirect questions may also be subject to the changes of [[grammatical tense|tense]] and other changes that apply generally to [[indirect speech]].

== Grammar ==
{{main article|Interrogative}}
Languages may use both [[syntax]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] to distinguish interrogative sentences (which pose questions) from [[declarative sentence]]s (which state propositions). Syntax refers to grammatical changes, such as moving words around or adding question words; prosody refers here to changes in [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] while speaking.

In [[English grammar|English]], [[German grammar|German]], [[French grammar|French]] and various other languages, questions are marked by a distinct [[word order]] featuring [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] – the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] is placed after the [[verb]] rather than before it: "You are cold" becomes "Are you cold?" However, English allows such inversion only with a particular class of verbs (called auxiliary or [[special verb]]s), and thus sometimes requires the addition of an auxiliary ''do'', ''does'' or ''did'' before inversion can take place ("He sings" → "Does he sing?") – for details see [[do-support|''do''-support]].

In some languages, yes–no questions are marked by an [[interrogative particle]], such as the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] {{lang|ja|か}} ''ka'', [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] {{lang|zh|吗}} ''ma'' and [[Polish grammar|Polish]] ''czy''. Also, in languages generally, ''wh''-questions are marked by an [[interrogative word]] (''wh''-word) such as ''what'', ''where'' or ''how''. In languages such as English this word generally moves to the front of the sentence ([[wh-fronting|''wh''-fronting]]), and subject–verb inversion occurs as in yes–no questions, but in some other languages these changes in word order are not necessary (e.g. Mandarin {{lang|zh|你要什么？}} ''nǐ yào shénme'', meaning "what do you want?" is literally "you want what?").

Intonation patterns characteristic of questions often involve a raised pitch near the end of the sentence. In English this occurs especially for yes–no questions; it may also be used for sentences that do not have the grammatical form of questions, but are nonetheless intended to elicit information ([[declarative question]]s), as in "You're not using this?"

In languages written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] or certain other scripts, a [[question mark]] at the end of a sentence identifies questions in writing. (In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] an additional [[¿|inverted mark]] is placed at the beginning: ''¿Cómo está usted?'' "How are you?") As with intonation, this feature is not restricted to sentences having the grammatical form of questions – it may also indicate a sentence's [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] function.

==Responses==
The most typical response to a question is an answer that provides the information indicated as being sought by the questioner. This may range from a simple [[yes and no|''yes'' or ''no'']] (in the case of yes–no questions) to a more complex or detailed answer. (An answer may be ''correct'' or ''incorrect'', depending on whether the information it presents is true or [[False (logic)|false]].) An indication of inability or unwillingness to provide an answer is the other response to a question.

"Negative questions" are interrogative sentences which contain negation in their phrasing, such as "Shouldn't you be working?" These can have different ways of expressing affirmation and denial from the standard form of question, and they can be confusing, since it is sometimes unclear whether the answer should be the opposite of the answer to the non-negated question. For example, if one does not have a passport, both "Do you have a passport?" and "Don't you have a passport?" are properly answered with "No", despite apparently asking opposite questions. The Japanese and Korean languages avoid this ambiguity. Answering "No" to the second of these in Japanese or Korean would mean, "I ''do'' have a passport".

A similar ambiguous question in English is "Do you mind if...?" The responder may reply unambiguously "Yes, I do mind," if they do mind, or "No, I don't mind," if they don't, but a simple "No" or "Yes" answer can lead to confusion, as a single "No" can seem like a "Yes, I do mind" (as in "No, please don't do that"), and a "Yes" can seem like a "No, I don't mind" (as in "Yes, go ahead"). An easy way to bypass this confusion would be to ask a non-negative question, such as "Is it all right with you if...?"

Some languages have different particles (for example the [[French language|French]] "''si''", the [[German language|German]] "''doch''" or the [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] "''jo''") to answer negative questions (or negative statements) in an affirmative way; they provide a means to express contradiction.

More information on these issues can be found in the articles [[yes–no question]], [[yes and no]], and [[answer ellipsis]].

== Learning  ==
Questions are used from the most elementary stage of learning to original research.  In the [[scientific method]], a question often forms the basis of the investigation and can be considered a transition between the observation and hypothesis stages.  Students of all ages use questions in their learning of topics, and the skill of having learners creating "investigatable" questions is a central part of [[inquiry education]].  The [[Socratic method]] of questioning student responses may be used by a teacher to lead the student towards the truth without direct instruction, and also helps students to form logical conclusions.

A widespread and accepted use of questions in an educational context is the assessment of students' knowledge through [[exam]]s.

== Philosophy  ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
The [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions are [[concept]]ual, not factual questions. There are questions that are not fully answered by any other. Philosophy deals with questions that arise when people reflect on their lives and their world. Some philosophical questions are practical: for example, "Is [[euthanasia]] justifiable?", "Does the state have the right to censor pornography or restrict tobacco advertising?", "To what extent are [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pākehā]] today responsible for decisions made by their ancestors?"

Other philosophical questions are more [[theory|theoretical]], although they often arise through thinking about practical issues. The questions just listed, for example, may prompt more general philosophical questions about the circumstances under which it may be morally justifiable to take a life, or about the extent to which the state may restrict the liberty of the individual. Some "classic" questions of philosophy are speculative and theoretical and concern the nature of knowledge, reality and human existence: for example, "What, if anything, can be known with certainty?", "Is the mind essentially non-physical?", "Are values absolute or relative?", "Does the universe need explanation in terms of a Supreme Intelligence?", "What, if anything, is the meaning or purpose of human existence?" Finally, the philosophical questions are typically about conceptual issues; they are often questions about our concepts and the relation between our concepts and the world they represent. Every question implies a statement and every statement implies a question.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Richard and Elder, Linda. (2005) Critical Thinking Tools for Taking Charge of Your Learning and Your Life, New Jersey: Prentice Hall Publishing. {{ISBN|0-13-114962-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Enculturated apes [[Kanzi]], [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]], [[Sarah (chimpanzee)|Sarah]] and a few others who underwent extensive language training programs (with the use of gestures and other visual forms of communications) successfully learned to ''answer'' quite complex questions and requests (including question words "who" what", "where"), although so far they failed to learn how to ''ask questions themselves''. For example, [[David Premack|David and Anne Premack]] wrote: "Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions — unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =  The mind of an ape | first1= David | last1=Premack |first2=Ann J. |last2= Premack |year = 1983 | publisher =  [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | location = New York, London |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to ask questions is often assessed in relation to comprehension of [[syntactic structure]]s. It is widely accepted, that the first questions are asked by humans during their early infancy, at the pre-syntactic, one word stage of [[language development]], with the use of question [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =  The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language | last1 = Crystal | first1=David | year = 1987 | publisher = Cambridge University | location = Cambridge. Pg. 241, 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''René de Nebesky-Wojkowitz'''&lt;ref name="von"&gt;Alternatively, he is listed as René '''von''' Nebesky-Wojkowitz in some of his publications (see Bibliography, nos. 2, 7, 20)&lt;/ref&gt; (29 June 1923 – 9 July 1959) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[ethnologist]] and [[Tibetologist]].  He is mostly known for his 1956 publication ''Oracles and Demons of Tibet'', which was the first detailed study of Tibetan deity cults.

== Biography ==
René Mario de Nebesky-Wojkowitz was born in [[Velké Hoštice|Groß Hoschütz]] in Moravia on 29 June 1923. After completing his secondary education in Leitmeritz and Prague, he devoted himself to the study of Central Asian ethnology, Tibetan, and Mongolian at the universities of Berlin and Vienna.  It was especially the teachings of the late [[Robert Bleichsteiner]] at the [[University of Vienna]] that encouraged him to specialize in Tibetan studies. Before the defense of his doctoral thesis (see Bibliography, no. 3) on November 3, 1949 he published two articles on the Bön religion and the state oracle.&lt;ref&gt;“Die tibetische Bön-Religion,” ''Archiv für Völkerkunde'' 2 (1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;26–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Das tibetische Staatsorakel,” ''Archiv für Völkerkunde'' 3 (1948), pp.&amp;nbsp;136–155.&lt;/ref&gt; From November 1949 to July 1950 he continued his studies in Italy under the direction of [[Giuseppe Tucci]] and [[Joseph Rock]], as well as in London at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] and the [[London School of Economics]].

In August 1950, Nebesky-Wojkowitz set off for Kalimpong and did not return to Europe until February 1953 (nos. 16, 18).  His long stay there gave him access to many texts on protector deities and allowed him to benefit from the council of Tibetan scholars who sought refuge during the Chinese incursion.  One can find a vivid description of events at that time in a book he intended for non-specialists (no. 20).  Nebesky-Wojkowitz published the results of his research in several articles, and especially in his most important work, ''Oracles and Demons of Tibet: The Cult and Iconography of the Tibetan Protective Deities'' (no. 22).  This voluminous 666-page book is widely considered a foundational study of Tibetan popular religion and deity cults, making it an indispensable compendium for all those who deal with protector deities.  Nebesky-Wojkowitz also made several excursions among the [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] of [[Sikkim]] (nos. 7, 10, 14, 15).  In 1954 he spent five months in [[Leiden]] identifying the collection of Lepcha manuscripts at the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|National Museum of Ethnology]], where he had already made a list of the titles of Tibetan xylographs and manuscripts during a seven-month stay in 1953.

René de Nebesky-Wojkowitz visited Kalimpong and Sikkim a second time in the last months of 1956 before going to Nepal to look for a new site of exploration (no. 23).  In 1958-1959 he visited Nepal again and stayed there for three months.  He collected a considerable amount of material as well as 400 objects for the [[Museum of Ethnology, Vienna|Museum of Ethnology]] in Vienna, where they remain today.  In 1958 he became a "wissenschaftlicher Beamter" at the Museum of Ethnology.  At the start of 1958 he was diagnosed with pneumonia, the effects of which were felt during his third expedition to the Himalayas in 1958-1959.  The travels that he undertook in Nepal became too demanding on his health and, upon his return to Vienna, he died at the age of 36 on July 9, 1959 after a brief illness.&lt;ref name="dejong"&gt;The majority of this information was drawn from de Jong, "René Mario von Nebesky-Wojkowitz †"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause(s) of Death ==
According to de Jong,&lt;ref name="dejong2"&gt;de Jong, "René Mario von Nebesky-Wojkowitz †"&lt;/ref&gt; René de Nebesky-Wojkowitz died of pneumonia.  However, his cause of death has been almost completely eclipsed by how tragically young he was when he succumbed.  Because of this, an urban legend of sorts has come to surround Nebesky-Wojkowitz's death, with many members of the Tibetan Buddhist community believing that his death was actually brought on by the wrath of the very protector deities he studied so assiduously.  In his critique of Tibetan shamanism, scholar Zeff Bjerken describes his own personal experience with this widespread belief:

:[Nebesky-Wojkowitz’s] sudden untimely death, shortly after the...completion [of ''Oracles and Demons of Tibet''], was thought to have been brought about by Tibet’s protective deities, who were avenging his efforts to reveal their secrets and magic power.  At the [[Library of Tibetan Works and Archives]] in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]], when I tried to check out Nebesky-Wojkowitz’s text for my research, I discovered that it was not on the shelf with most other books but kept separate under lock and key.  Only after offering the Tibetan librarian my American passport as collateral was I permitted access to the work, although not before being warned of its dangerous content.&lt;ref name="bjerken"&gt;Bjerken, “Exorcising the Illusion of Bon ‘Shamans’," p.38&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Among scholars of Tibetan religions, as well as outside observers, opinions vary, with some taking this belief seriously and others not.  Two decades prior to Bjerken’s account, John Blofeld, a popular British writer on Eastern religions, made the following morbidly droll statement: “Tibetans were not surprised when the distinguished author of ''Oracles and Demons of Tibet'' came to an untimely end soon after completing that monumental but dullish book.  The subject of Guardians is one on which nothing detailed should be said; to write at length about demons is always held to be unwise; but his ultimate crime was to make them seem ''boring''!”&lt;ref name="blofeld"&gt;Blofeld, ''The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet'', p.73&lt;/ref&gt;  This latter contention is, at times, still spoken of in jest among Tibetan specialists today.

Located 5&amp;nbsp;km (3 miles) northeast of the Olmec ceremonial center of [[La Venta]] in the Grijalva river delta section of the Tabasco Coastal Plain, San Andrés is considered one of its elite satellite communities, with evidence of elite residences and other elite activities.  Several important archaeological finds have been made at San Andrés, including the oldest evidence of the domesticated [[sunflower]],&lt;ref&gt;Pope 2001&lt;/ref&gt; insight into Olmec feasting rituals,&lt;ref&gt;Seinfeld 2007&lt;/ref&gt; didactic miniatures,&lt;ref&gt;Pohl 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and possible evidence of an Olmec [[writing system]].&lt;ref&gt;Pohl et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Pohl, funded by The Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. (FAMSI), has been a crucial part of conducting ceramic analysis and collecting evidence of feasting vessels and early Olmec writing on greenstone plaques and ceramic roller stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The earliest evidence of human activity at San Andrés – [[maize]] (''Zea'' species) pollen and extensive [[charcoal]] deposits from [[swidden]] (slash-and-burn) agriculture – has been dated to 5300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ranere, Anthony J., Dolores R. Piperno, Irene Holst, Ruth Dickau, José Iriarte |title=The cultural and chronological context of early Holocene maize and squash domestication in the Central Balsas River Valley, Mexico |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/13/5014.full.pdf |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2009 |volume=106 |pmid=19307573 |issue=13 |pages=5014–5018 |pmc=2664064 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812590106}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the [[Gulf of Mexico]] was further inland and San Andrés was the site of beach ridges and barrier lagoons, features that are today some 15&amp;nbsp;km to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Pope 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Later evidence of human habitation includes pollen dated to 4600 BCE, seeds from 2600 BCE, and evidence of maize cultivation from 2000 BCE.

[[Image:Olmec Heartland Overview 4.svg|thumb|right|375px|San Andrés and La Venta in the context of the Olmec heartland]]

The first evidence of Olmec occupation has been dated to 1350 BCE, an occupation that lasted some 150 years (until 1200 BCE), with an ensuing hiatus lasting until roughly 900 BCE. Continuously occupied over the following 550 years, San Andrés was finally abandoned some time before 350 BCE. This date roughly coincides with the abandonment of the La Venta and the dissolution of the Olmec culture.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl et al. 2004, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early traces of domesticated plants==
San Andrés is notable for the ancient pollen and seeds recovered there. Although the humid rainy tropical lowlands have made quick work of organic substances, including Olmec skeletal remains, the multi-disciplinary research team delved below the [[water table]], hoping that the preservative nature of water-logged soil would enable them to retrieve ancient samples.

Their findings include:
*Early maize (''Zea'' species) pollen from as early as 5100 BCE.
*A single [[cassava|manioc]] pollen grain dated to roughly 4600 BCE. Since manioc pollen is rare in sediments, its discovery was either "fortuitous, or abundant stands of manioc were growing close to the site".
*A domesticated sunflower seed and fruit dated to roughly 2650 BCE and 2550 BCE respectively.  This is the earliest record yet of the domesticated sunflower.
*Cotton (''[[Gossypium]]'') pollen from roughly 2500 BCE. The researchers suggest that this cotton was domesticated, although wild cotton does occur naturally along the Gulf Coast to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Pope 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence of Elite Feasting==
“In Formative period Mesoamerica, high-status goods were significant components of cultural practice and a source of social, political, and ideological power.” &lt;ref&gt;Pohl 2005, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Seinfeld (2007) asserts that “early complex societies often used feasting as a way for individuals to gain followers and to assert their status” and that this occurred at San Andres.&lt;ref&gt;Seinfeld 2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; This study is particularly interesting because the researchers used sound and updated methods to determine social facts concerning feasting at a site where little is conclusively known about social structures. Maize and cacao were detected due to their distinctive biomarkers including C4 signature plant carbon for maize and nitrogen containing organic compounds for cacao.&lt;ref&gt;Seinfeld 2007, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; “Discoveries include patterns of maize use suggestive of its use as an elite feasting food and beverage rather than as a dietary staple. Further results suggest possible evidence of Olmec cacao use.” &lt;ref&gt;Seinfeld 2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Formative period [[Mesoamerican Feasts|feasting]] allowed the elite to demonstrate their power and enhance their status and identity, as the consumption of alcohol had ritualistic and spiritual meaning among the elites. Cocoa, maize-alcohol, and “elite-foods” gave these gatherings special significance and provides definite proof that there was an elite class in San Andres, and, by extension, La Venta.

==Didactic Miniatures== 
Pohl (2005) and her colleagues found plenty of evidence to suggest that miniature representations of everyday objects were used ritualistically. “These miniatures may have been crafted with the express purpose of composing didactic or ritual reenactments of crucial mythic or conventionalized historic events much in the same fashion as La Venta Offering 4.” &lt;ref&gt;Pohl 2005, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Other elite-religious-status denoting objects (greenstone artifacts, jewelry, maskettes, iron-ore mirrors, etc.) were found at San Andres. “A contextual comparison suggests that, like the La Venta prestige artifacts, the San Andrés sumptuary items were significant components of ceremonial activity.” &lt;ref&gt;Pohl 2005, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indications of an Olmec writing system==
[[Image:Proposed Olmec glyphs (San Andres).svg|thumb|right|150px|thumb|San Andrés [[Glyph (archaeology)|glyph]]s. The top set of glyphs have been interpreted as "3 Ajaw". The bottom two glyphs were found incised into semi-precious [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] artifacts.]] Excavations at San Andrés in 1997 and 1998 produced three artifacts that many archaeologists contend demonstrate that the Olmec civilization used a true writing system. These artifacts, dated roughly to 650 BCE (the middle of the Olmec concentration at La Venta and San Andres), were found in a refuse dump, the remains from a festival or feast. “The fact that the artifacts with glyphs were found in the context of feasting refuse suggest that writing among the Olmec was sacred and was closely tied to ritual activities.” &lt;ref&gt;Pohl 2005, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important find was a fist-sized ceramic cylinder seal, likely used to print cloth. When rolled out, the seal shows two [[speech scroll]]s emanating from a bird, followed directly by a number of design elements enframing what has been interpreted as logograms for “king (sideways U shape),” "3 (three dots, according to the Mesoamerican bar and dots numbering system),” and “Ajaw (from the sacred 260-day calendar)", a designation used for both a calendar date and, in keeping with Mesoamerican custom, the name of an Olmec ruler.
In addition to the ceramic cylinder seal, two fingernail-sized fragments from a greenstone plaque have been recovered, each containing an incised glyph. Both these glyphs have been linked to well-documented glyphs in other Mesoamerican writing systems, including the Isthmian and Maya scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl, et al. p. 1984-1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known archaeologist and writer Michael D. Coe interprets these glyphs as "an early kind of writing" &lt;ref&gt;Bower 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while Richard A. Diehl, who excavated at the Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan with Coe, finds that this discovery "establishes the existence of Olmec writing and calendrics by 650 B.C.E" &lt;ref&gt;Diehl 2004, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Mayanist epigrapher David Stuart stated that it would be hard to discern evidence of a writing system in a handful of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Bower 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether the Olmecs possessed a [[writing system]] was complicated in 2006 by the discovery of the [[Cascajal Block]]. This artifact, a slab of [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] with 62 incised characters, has been dated to 900 BCE, although it was discovered without [[archaeological context]]. Instead of being precursors to the San Andrés glyphs, however, the 28 unique Cascajal block characters bear no obvious resemblance to them and are, indeed, unlike those of any other Mesoamerican writing system.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, who says "[The Cascajal block script] apparently left no descendants, with no certain link to [[Isthmian script|Isthmian]] or other Formative [period] writing.", p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Questions concerning the interpretation of the San Andrés glyphs (and the Cascajal block) will need to await further research.

A '''snake nut can''' is a [[practical joke device]] that closely resembles a can of nuts, but contains a long wire [[Spring (device)|spring]] covered by a cloth or vinyl sheath, printed like [[snake]] skin, which leaps out of the can and startles the unsuspecting victim.

The item was invented by [[Samuel Sorensen Adams]] of the [[S.S. Adams Co.]] circa 1915. Adams' wife Emily had been complaining about the jam jar, saying that it wasn't properly closed or that it was sticky. Adams, inspired by her nagging, then invented a ''spring snake'' - a coil of wire wrapped in a cloth skin, and compressed the two-foot snake into a little jam jar so that it would jump out when the lid was removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://csadams.com/ittakes.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''snake jam jar'' then evolved into a whole array of products, including the ''snake peanut brittle can'', the ''snake mint can'', and the best-selling '''snake nut can'''. In the 1990s Adams' grandson produced ''snake potato chips''.

'''Statue of Hercules''' is located in [[Mount Behistun]] and was discovered around 1957. It was built in 153 BC during the time of the [[Seleucid Empire]] or the [[Parthian Empire]]. [[Hercules]] is lying on a 2 m long platform and holds a bowl in his left hand. He has put his right hand on his foot. The statue is 1.47 m long and is attached to the mountain. The head of the statue was stolen twice, but discovered again. However, the current head is a double and the actual head is in [[Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization]]. At the time it was discovered, he had a penis, but after the [[Iranian Revolution]] it was broken down by locals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5860">The '''Swifterbant culture''' was a [[Subneolithic]] archaeological culture in the [[Netherlands]], dated between 5300 BC and 3400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Dutch "Het Archeologisch Basisregister (ABR), versie 1.0 november 1992"[http://www.racm.nl/content/documenten%5Cabr%20website.pdf], Swifterbant pottery is dated NEOVB (early Neolithic) to NEOMA (Early Middle Neolithic), standardized by "De Rijksdienst voor Archeologie, Cultuurlandschap en Monumenten (RACM)" as a period dated from 5300 BC to 3400 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Ertebølle culture]], the settlements were concentrated near water, in this case creeks, riverdunes and bogs along post-glacial banks of rivers like the [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Overijsselse Vecht]].

In the 1960s and 1970s, artifacts classified as "Swifterbant culture" were found in the (now dry) [[Noordoostpolder]] in the Netherlands, near the village of [[Swifterbant]] and the former island of [[Urk]]. Other well-known sites were uncovered in [[Zuid Holland]] ([[Bergschenhoek]]) and the [[Betuwe]] ([[Hardinxveld-Giessendam]]).

The oldest finds related to this culture, dated to circa 5600 BC, cannot be distinguished from the [[Ertebølle culture]],&lt;ref name=Kooijmans&gt;L. P. Louwe Kooijmans - ''Trijntje van de Betuweroute, Jachtkampen uit de Steentijd te Hardinxveld-Giessendam'', 1998, ''Spiegel Historiael'' 33, blz. 423-428,[https://www.openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/1887/1108/1/171_060.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; normally associated with Northern Germany and Southern Scandinavia. The culture is ancestral to the Western group of the agricultural [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (4000&amp;ndash;2700 BC), which extended through Northern Netherlands and Northern Germany to the [[Elbe River|Elbe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Trechterbekercultuur'', in ''Encyclopedie Drenthe Online'', [http://www.encyclopediedrenthe.nl/Trechterbekercultuur]
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest dated sites are season settlements. A transition from [[hunter-gatherer]] culture to cattle farming, primarily cows and pigs, occurred around 4800&amp;ndash;4500 BC. [[Pottery]] has been attested from this period. In the region indications to the existence of pottery are present from before the arrival of the [[Linear Pottery culture]] in the neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;Lüning, et al., 1989; Lüning, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 
The material culture reflects a local evolution from Mesolithic communities, with a pottery in a Nordic ([[Ertebølle]]) style and trade relationships with southern late [[Rössen culture]] communities, as testified by the presence of true Breitkeile pottery sherds.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology and Coastal Change in the Netherlands - Dr L. P. Louwe Kooijmans, 1980 [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/dspace/bitstream/1887/1091/1/171_017.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rössen culture, being an offshoot of Linear Pottery, is older than the finds in Swifterbant, and contemporary to older stages of this culture as found in Hoge Vaart (Almere) and Hardinxveld. Contact between Swifterbant and Rössen expressed itself by some hybrid early Swifterbant pots in Anvers (Doel) and hybrid Rössen pottery Hamburg-Boberg. In general, Swifterbant pottery does not show the same variety as Rössen pottery and Swifterbant pottery with Rössen influences are rare. Possibly the idea of cooking could be derived from agricultural neighbours. However, the technical style for making pottery are too different to consider such external influences.&lt;ref&gt;Swifterbant-aardewerk : een analyse van de neolithische nederzettingen bij Swifterbant, 5e millennium voor Christus, J.P. de Roever. Groningen, 2004 [http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/faculties/arts/2004/j.p.de.roever/]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Wetland settlement, unlike previous opinions, was a deliberate choice by prehistoric communities, as this offered attractive ecological conditions and a high natural productivity or agricultural potential.&lt;ref&gt;Wetland Exploitation and Upland,Relations of Prehistoric Communities in the Netherlands - L. P. Louwe Kooijmans {{cite web |url=https://www.openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/1887/1103/1/171_047.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726044501/https://www.openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/1887/1103/1/171_047.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The economy covered a broad spectrum of resources to gather food, ruled by a strategy to diversify rather than increasing volume. As such, the wetlands offered, next to hunting and fishing, optimized conditions for cattle and small scale cultivation of different crops, each having conditions for growing of their own.&lt;ref name=Raemakers&gt;De spiegel van Swifterbant - Daan Raemakers, 2006, University of Groningen {{cite web |url=http://redes.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2006/d.raemaekers/Raemaekers.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410084410/http://redes.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2006/d.raemaekers/Raemaekers.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agrarian transformation of the prehistoric community was an exclusively indigenous process, that ultimately realized itself only at the end of the Neolithic.&lt;ref name=Kooijmans/&gt; This view has been supported by the discovery of an agricultural field in Swifterbant dated 4300&amp;ndash;4000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistoric agricultural field found in Swifterbant, 4300&amp;ndash;4000 BC'' [http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/article455140.ece/Prehistorische_akker_gevonden_bij_Swifterbant]&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal sacrifices found in the bogs of [[Drenthe]] are attributed to Swifterbant and suggest a religious role for both wild and domesticated bovines.&lt;ref name=Raemakers/&gt;

'''''The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries''''' is an 1812 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]]. It shows French Emperor [[Napoleon I]] in uniform in his study at the [[Tuileries Palace]]. Despite the detail, it is unlikely that Napoleon posed for the portrait.&lt;ref name=NGA1&gt;"[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46114&amp;detail=note The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries - Notes]". National Gallery of Art. Accessed 21 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a private commission from the Scottish nobleman and admirer of Napoleon, [[Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton]] in 1811 and completed in 1812. Originally shown at [[Hamilton Palace]], it was sold to [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]] in 1882, from whom it was bought by the [[Samuel Henry Kress#The Kress Foundation|Samuel H. Kress Foundation]] in 1954, which deposited it in Washington D.C.'s [[National Gallery of Art]], where it now hangs.&lt;ref name=NGA2&gt;"[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46114&amp;detail=prov The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries - Provenance]". National Gallery of Art. Accessed 8 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
Vertical in format, it shows Napoleon standing, three-quarters life size, wearing the uniform of a colonel of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] Foot Grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs). He also wears his [[Légion d'honneur]] and [[Order of the Iron Crown]] decorations, along with gold epaulettes, white French-style [[culotte]]s and white stockings. His face is turned towards the viewer and his right hand is in his jacket.

Piled on the desk are a pen, several books, dossiers and rolled papers. More rolled papers and a map are on the green carpet to the left of the desk - on these papers is the painter's signature ''LVD&lt;sup&gt;ci&lt;/sup&gt; DAVID OPVS 1812''. All this, along with Napoleon's unbuttoned cuffs, wrinkled stockings, disheveled hair, the flickering candles and the time on the clock (4.13am) are all meant to imply he has been up all night, writing laws such as the ''[[Code Napoléon]]'' - the word "Code" is prominent on the rolled papers on the desk. This maintains his new civil rather than heroic (as in Canova's ''[[Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker]]'') or military (as in David's own ''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]'') image, though the sword on the chair's armrest still refers back to his military successes. The fleurs-de-lys and heraldic bees also imply the stability of the imperial dynasty.&lt;ref name=NGA1/&gt;

==Second version==
[[File:Napoleon-aux-tuileries.jpg|thumb|The second version]]
A second version painted by David, showing exactly the same scene but with Napoleon in his more everyday green [[chasseurs à cheval|mounted chasseurs]] uniform, was formerly in [[Prince Napoleon]]'s{{who|date=June 2013}} collection and has since 1979 been in that of the [[Château de Versailles]].

== Development ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=May 2017}}
An analysis of the original painting reveals that the artist reedited the composition and details several times to balance the image, add allusions, and capture a complete story.

Brush strokes and texture indicate that an earlier version had
Napoleon's upper body flanked by two fluted columns about the width
of the figure's torso.  These strong vertical elements would have created a
distraction from the central figure.

These columns were revised to a carved panel in shadow (on the viewer's
left) and a clock with a large face (viewer's right) on level with and
somewhat larger than the figure's face.  The clock was later repainted
with a smaller face moved up and to the right, with the clock body still
covering the underlying column brush strokes.

These revisions greatly improved the compositional balance of the
painting's upper section, reducing the impression of three vertical
columns.  They successfully moved the viewer's focus to Napoleon's face and
expression and away from the presumably accurate stature and
middle-heavy build.

The change also allowed incorporating additional symbology, most notably
the time (4:13).

Other revisions were added symbols on the table items and lower section,
many painted over [[fleurs-de-lis]] which are conspicuously rare in the final image.

'''Thomas W. Noe''' (born July 1954) is an [[Ohio]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] fundraiser and activist, guilty of [[money laundering]] for the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|2004 Bush-Cheney campaign]] and of theft and corruption in the "[[Coingate scandal]]". A longtime resident of [[Toledo, Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050403/NEWS24/504030399]&lt;/ref&gt; Noeand his wife held several party positions and minor offices within the government of Ohio. He was also a prominent Republican fundraiser and served as chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio and chairman of the [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] Republican party. Noe was also an avid coin dealer and owned various coin dealing companies, such as ''Capital Coin'' and ''Vintage Coins &amp; Collectibles'', as well as their subsidiaries.

== Organizations and offices ==
=== The Republican Party ===
Both Noe and his wife Bernadette Restivo-Noe have been chairperson of the Lucas County Republican party. Noe was also chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio. Noe was convicted of making illegal contributions to George W. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign.[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14805486/=]

=== Board of Elections ===
During the 2004 election, Noe's wife Bernadette was chairman of the Lucas County Board of Elections. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], the county experienced extreme voting difficulties, including criminal investigations and manipulation of the recount,[https://web.archive.org/web/20050409051126/http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/lucas.htm][https://web.archive.org/web/20050930112758/http://rawstory.com/other/pdfs/lucasinquiryrawstory.pdf] and many officials resigned or were suspended. The Ohio Secretary of State told Bernadette to resign or be fired. She resigned from both the Lucas County Republican Party and the Lucas County Board of Elections in December 2004.

=== Board of Regents ===
Noe was appointed to the Ohio Board of Regents, which oversees Ohio's public colleges and universities, by former Ohio Governor [[George Voinovich]] in 1995 to complete a vacated term. Noe was reinstated for a full 9-year term in 1999 by Governor [[Bob Taft]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In late 2004, Noe wrote to the Ohio Ethics Commission to seek an opinion on his involvement with ''Hi-Genomics LLC'' which licenses a patent on plant genetic engineering from the [[University of Toledo]]. Noe was vice-president of ''Hi-Genomics LLC'' and owned a 23% stake in the company. Noe's position on the Board of Regents was deemed to be a conflict of interest by the Ohio Ethics Commission. Noe was told to either resign from the Board, divest his interest in the company, or step down as vice-president of the company. Noe eventually sold back his units in Hi-Genomics to one of the other unitholders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

=== Turnpike Commission ===
In 2003 Governor Taft appointed Noe chairman of the [[Ohio Turnpike]] Commission for an 8-year term. On May 10, 2005, Noe resigned from the Turnpike Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/assets/pdf/TO103991114.PDF|title=The Rise and Dramatic Fall of Tom Noe|format=PDF|accessdate=December 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coin politics and business ==
Apart from being President of his company, Thomas Noe Inc. (Noe owns 60%), Noe owns and/or manages many different companies that deal rare coins. His store, Vintage Coins &amp; Collectibles (or Vintage Coins &amp; Cards), is the parent company. Noe was also a statutory agent for the Professional Numismatists Guild, a nonprofit organization of top [[numismatics|numismatists]] whose members follow a strict code of ethics, for more than 25 years. He resigned in May 2005.

Noe served as chairman of the Ohio Commemorative Quarter Program Committee during its operation in the 2000s. Noe was appointed chairman of the U.S. Mint's [[Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee]] (CCAC) by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury [[John W. Snow]] in October 2004. The CCAC advises the secretary on issues relating to commemorative coin design and circulation. He was recommended by U.S. House Representative [[Dennis Hastert]]. He resigned in May 2005.

== Legal troubles ==
Noe has been convicted in two separate, but overlapping investigations for a variety of corrupt activities in Ohio and in national politics.

=== Campaign contributions ===
On October 27, 2005, Noe was indicted in a federal investigation on counts of conspiracy, conduit contribution violations, and false statements.

Noe was accused of illegally funneling $45,400 to President Bush's re-election campaign, using "two dozen people as "conduits" to make illegal campaign contributions at a $2,000-a-seat fund-raiser in Columbus. Conduits named in a federal affidavit include Lucas County Commissioner Maggie Thurber, Toledo City Councilwoman Betty Shultz, former Toledo Mayor Donna Owens and former State Representative Sally Perz. In doing so, Noe skirted federal campaign finance funding limits while meeting a pledge to raise $50,000 for the October 30, 2003, fund-raiser. The Bush campaign later named Noe a "[[Bush Pioneer|Pioneer]]" for raising at least $100,000 overall ... In addition to "conduits" who received between $1,750 and $4,000 from Noe to make either one or two contributions, prosecutors claim that the former rare-coin dealer used two people as "super-conduits," giving them $6,000 and $14,300 that they then split with others who attended the fund-raiser." Noe is now is serving a jail term of at least 10 years.[http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051028/NEWS24/51028001/-1/NEWS]

On October 31, 2005, Noe pled not-guilty to all three charges. On May 31, 2006, Noe reversed his earlier plea and pled guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/14708901.htm Coin dealer admits illegal donations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614100224/http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/14708901.htm |date=2006-06-14 }}, Associated Press, May 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2006, Noe was sentenced to 27 months in a federal prison for funneling money into the re-election campaign of President Bush illegally.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Coingate ===
{{main|Coingate scandal}}
Noe is also at the center of the Ohio [[Coingate scandal]]. On November 13, 2006, Noe was found guilty of theft, money laundering, forgery and corrupt activity, and the central charge: that he engaged in a pattern of corruption in his management of Ohio's $50 million rare-coin fund investment with the bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Noe guilty of 29 felony counts: Convictions include racketeering, theft, forgery | date=November 13, 2006 | url=http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061113/BREAKINGNEWS/311130003 | author=Mike Wilkinson and Steve Eder | publisher=Toledo Blade}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/2006/02/13/noeindict.pdf Noe Indictment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522221041/http://www.dispatch.com/2006/02/13/noeindict.pdf |date=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 13, 2006, the [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] District Court of Ohio indicted Noe [https://web.archive.org/web/20060223012851/http://www.columbusdispatch.com/news-story.php?story=dispatch%2F2006%2F02%2F14%2F20060214-A1-00.html], along with his business partner, Timothy LaPointe.[http://www.dispatch.com/news-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/02/14/20060214-A4-06.html]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}

The prosecution presented their case in three weeks that Noe stole $2 million for personal use; the defense argued that Noe's government contract allowed him the freedom to use the state's money however he wanted, but called no witnesses. The jury deliberated for three days before delivering their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 2006, Thomas Noe was given an 18-year sentence, to be served after the 27-month federal sentence imposed in September, fined $213,000, "ordered to pay the cost of the prosecution, estimated at nearly $3 million, and ordered to pay restitution to the [[Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation]] for the money missing from the rare-coin fund, estimated at $13.7 million."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

Earlier, on August 17, 2005, Ohio Governor [[Bob Taft]] was charged with four criminal [[misdemeanors]] stemming from his failure to disclose [[golf]] outings paid for by [[lobbyists]], as well as some undisclosed gifts. The gifts were varied, but included gifts from Noe. It was the first time an Ohio governor was ever been charged with a crime while in office.[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050817/NEWS01/308170017]

'''Translation''' as a [[rhetorical device]] is a form of [[parody]], where a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] [[paraphrase]] of a source quotation is given to mock its author; to enhance the [[irony]], it is furthermore stated that the version being given is merely a translation into the speaker's language, implying that the original speaker was unduly obscure or [[Monologue|ranting]]. Given the nature of [[Usenet]] forums, parodic translation is prevalent in [[flame wars]], where remarks such as "Translation: 'I do not have a clue and am throwing mud'" are used to imply &amp;mdash; on very little ground &amp;mdash; that another poster is not making any appreciable contribution to the subject.

Unlike other forms of parody, translation has a relatively recent history; early usages of the device can be seen in the work of the Viennese literary critic and journalist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]],  who claimed to translate from other journalists' &amp;mdash; famously former friend [[Maximilian Harden|Harden]] &amp;mdash; and from ''Moskauderwelch'' &amp;mdash; a derisive term for the highly elaborate [[Marxist]] [[jargon]] of the time, a pun on ''Moskau'', Moscow, and ''Kauderwelch'', gibberish. Kraus' influence is notable in [[Karl Popper]]; while translation of scientific theories into [[principle of verification|verificationist]] terms had been a standard procedure in [[logical positivism]] for some time, Popper's criticism of several philosophers and scientists that failed to comply with his notion of the [[scientific method]] took a mocking quality reminiscent of the former.

'''Voice foley''' is the non-talking "[[Foley artist|foley]]", or [[sound effect]]s, that a [[voice actor]] makes to enhance a performance. Such sounds include grunts, groans, breaths, wheezing, humming and many more. The term is most used in reference to [[anime]], but can refer to any type of production.

'''Whispering''' is an [[unvoiced]] mode of [[phonation]] in which the [[vocal folds]] (vocal cords) are [[Abduction (anatomy)|abducted]] so that they do not vibrate; air passes between the [[arytenoid cartilages]] to create audible turbulence during speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Phonetics.'' John Laver, 1994, Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Supralaryngeal [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] remains the same as in normal speech.

In normal speech, the [[vocal fold]]s alternate between states of voice and voicelessness. In whispering, only the voicing segments change, so that the vocal folds alternate between whisper and voicelessness (though the acoustic difference between the two states is minimal).&lt;ref&gt;''Language History: An Introduction.'' [[Andrew L. Sihler]], 1999, John Benjamins, {{ISBN|1556199686}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, implementing [[speech recognition]] for whispered speech is more difficult, as the characteristic spectral range needed to detect [[syllables]] and [[words]] is not given through the total absence of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/Speech-Recognition/Why-doesnt-speech-recognition-work-with-whispered-speech |title=Speech Recognition: Why doesn't speech recognition work with whispered speech? |publisher=Quora |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/project_larynx_summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced techniques such as [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] may be used, however, as is done by [[Amazon Alexa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/c0e7798d-32bc-4549-9c24-97d204a7bf3a/whisper-to-alexa-and-she-ll-whisper-back|title=Whisper to Alexa, and She’ll Whisper Back|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There is no symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] for whispered phonation, since it is not used [[phonemic]]ally in any language. However, a sub-dot under phonemically voiced segments is sometimes seen in the literature, as {{IPA|[ʃʊ̣ḍ]}} for whispered ''should.''

== Social role ==
[[File:Let me tell you a secret.jpg|thumb|upright|A girl whispers.]]
Whispering is generally used quietly, to limit the hearing of speech to listeners who are nearby; for example, to convey [[secret]] information without being overheard or to avoid disturbing others in a quiet place such as a library or place of worship. Whispering is also used to speak to someone quietly in a school especially when a [[teaching assistant]] or a [[support worker]] in an alternative room is reading questions to someone during an [[exam]].  Loud whispering, known as a '''stage whisper''', is generally used only for dramatic or emphatic purposes. Whispering also takes less effort to vocalize than a normal speech pattern. This is because less air needs to be used to vocalize the sound. However, while it takes less effort to produce a whisper, it tires out the vocal folds more quickly.

==In animals==
A number of species of animals have been observed to whisper, including the [[cotton-top tamarin]]&lt;ref name="Audubon"&gt;Simone M. Scully, "[Monkeys Can Whisper http://mag.audubon.org/articles/blog/monkeys-can-whisper]" ''[[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]]'' (October 2, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[barbastelle]] bat.&lt;ref name="Dell'Amore"&gt;Christine Dell'Amore, "[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/08/100831-bats-whisper-moths-environment-animals-science/ "Whispering" Bat Evolved to Trick Prey]", ''National Geographic Magazine'' (September 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for animal whispering vary, and are not fully understood, but whispering among the tamarins appears to serve a social purpose,&lt;ref name="Audubon"/&gt; while the species of bats appears to whisper in order to evade detection by its particular prey, eared [[moths]].&lt;ref name="Dell'Amore"/&gt;
