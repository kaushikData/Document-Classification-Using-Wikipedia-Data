'''ADS Group Limited''', informally known as '''ADS''', is the trade organisation representing the aerospace, defence, security and space industries in the United Kingdom. It has more than 1000 member companies across its sectors, including some of the UK's largest manufacturers, like [[Airbus]], [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls Royce]], [[BAE Systems]], and [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]].

Its subsidiary Farnborough International Limited runs the biennial [[Farnborough Air Show]], one of the world's biggest air shows, and other events.

==History==
ADS Group Limited was incorporated on 11 September 2009 as a private, limited by guarantee, no share capital company registered in the United Kingdom with company number 01765250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencorporates.com/gb/07016635 |title=ADS GROUP LIMITED |publisher=OpenCorporates |accessdate=10 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed from the merger of the Association of Police and Public Security Suppliers (APPSS), the Defence Manufacturers Association (DMA) and the [[Society of British Aerospace Companies]] (SBAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adsgroup.org.uk/|title=ADS Advancing UK Aerospace Defence and Security Industries|publisher=ADS Group Limited|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3147">[[File:Chandra X-ray space observatory - ACISlabel-150.jpg|thumb|275px|Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer]]
The '''Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer''' ('''ACIS'''), formerly the '''AXAF CCD Imaging Spectrometer''', is an instrument built by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Center for Space Research and the [[Pennsylvania State University]] for the ''[[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]''.

ACIS is a focal plane instrument that uses an array of [[charge-coupled device]]s. It serves as an X-ray [[integral field spectrograph]] for ''Chandra''. The instrument is capable of measuring both the position and energy of incoming [[X-ray]]s.&lt;ref name="instruments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.si.edu/about/science_instruments.html |title=Science Instruments |series=Chandra X-ray Observatory |publisher=NASA{{\}}Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCD sensors of ACIS operate at {{convert|-120|C|F}} and its filters at {{convert|-60|and|-50|C|F}}. It carries a special heater that allows contamination from ''Chandra'' to be baked off; the spacecraft contains lubricants, and the ACIS design took this into account in order to clean its sensors. Contamination buildup can reduce the instrument's sensitivity.&lt;ref name="nasa20031113"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2003/03-198.html |title=Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) update |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Roy |first2=Megan |last2=Watzke |date=13 November 2003 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation in space is another potential danger to the sensor.&lt;ref name="Grant2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fifteen years of the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer |journal=Proceedings of the SPIE 9144, Space Telescopes and Instrumentation 2014: Ultraviolet to Gamma Ray |first1=Catherine E. |last1=Grant |first2=Mark W. |last2=Bautz |first3=Peter G. |last3=Ford |first4=P.

{{As of|2014}}, after 15 years of operation, there was no indication of a limit to the lifetime of ACIS. Another design feature of the instrument was a calibration source that can be used to understand its health. This allows for a measurement of the level of contamination, if present, as well as any degree of charge transfer inefficiency.&lt;ref name="Grant2014" /&gt;

==Early life==
Mosoiu moved to the United States from [[Romania]]&lt;ref name=kalw&gt;{{cite web|last=Florez|first=Irene|title=Independent workers seek communal workspaces|url=http://www.kalw.org/post/independent-workers-seek-communal-workspaces|publisher=KALW|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her family in 1983 when she was 9 years old. Her family had been granted political asylum "before the revolution toppled the Soviet-era autocrat [[Nicolae Ceausescu]]". She grew up in Oakland attending local middle schools.&lt;ref name="inside" /&gt;

Mosoiu attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and earned her bachelor's degree in computer science in 1995.&lt;ref name="inside" /&gt;

==Tech Liminal==
As a technical consultant Mosoiu spent a lot of time traveling and in hotel rooms.&lt;ref name="oakland"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oaklandnorth.net/2012/06/11/at-tech-liminal-digital-workers-find-a-place-to-connect/ | title=At Tech Liminal, digital workers find a place to connect | publisher=Oakland North | date=June 11, 2012 | accessdate=October 16, 2012 | author=Cruz-Rosas, Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because she wanted to work with people and be part of a community, Mosoiu founded Tech Liminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woodall|first=Angela|title=Hometown Hero: Anca Mosoiu, founder of Oakland's Tech Liminal|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_21777977/hometown-hero-anca-mosoiu-founder-oaklands-tech-liminal|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tech Liminal was the first technology [[co-working]] space in Oakland.&lt;ref name="local"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaklandlocal.com/article/529-new-oakland-based-web-design-studio-launches-classes-week-meet-growing-demand |title=Need a greater web presence? |publisher=Oakland local |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=October 16, 2012 |author=Soldana, Laura |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824193846/http://oaklandlocal.com/article/529-new-oakland-based-web-design-studio-launches-classes-week-meet-growing-demand |archivedate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the domain of digital audio, a '''control surface''' is a [[human interface device]] (HID) which allows the user to control a [[digital audio workstation]] or other digital audio application.  Generally, a control surface will contain one or more controls that can be assigned to parameters in the software, allowing tactile control of the software. As digital audio software is complex and can play any number of functions in the audio chain, control surfaces can be used to control many aspects of music production, including virtual instruments, samplers, signal processors, [[Audio mixing|mixers]], [[DJ controller|DJ software]], and [[music sequencer]]s.

Since control surfaces are designed to perform different functions, they vary widely in size, shape and number and type of controls. A basic control surface for mixing resembles a traditional analogue [[mixing console]], featuring faders, knobs (rotary encoders), and buttons that can be assigned to parameters in the software. Other control surfaces are designed to give a musician control over the sequencer while recording, and thus provide transport controls (remote control of record, playback and song position). Control surfaces are often incorporated into [[MIDI controller]]s to give the musician more control over an instrument. Control surfaces with motorized faders can read and write [[mix automation]].

The control surface connects to the host computer via many different interfaces. [[MIDI]] was the first major interface created for this purpose, although many devices now use [[USB]], [[FireWire]], or [[Ethernet]].

==Examples==
* [[Smart AV]] Tango - A hybrid controller with a 22" touch screen, compatible with major DAWs for MAC &amp; PC.
* [[M-Audio]] ProjectMix - Control surface that can control many different applications.
* [[Mackie]] Control - Serves a similar purpose as the ProjectMix.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2018}}
'''Common traffic advisory frequency''' ('''CTAF''') is the name given to the [[VHF]] radio frequency used for air-to-air communication at US, Canadian and Australian [[non-towered airport]]s.

Many towered airports close their towers overnight, keeping the airport itself open for [[air cargo|cargo operations]] and other activity. Pilots use the common frequency to coordinate their arrivals and departures safely, giving position reports and acknowledging other aircraft in the [[airfield traffic pattern]].

In many locations, smaller airports use [[Pilot Controlled Lighting|pilot-controlled lighting systems]] when it is uneconomical or inconvenient to have automated systems or staff to turn on the taxiway and runway lights. In Canada, the lighting system is accessed through an [[pilot controlled lighting|aircraft radio control of aerodrome lighting]] (ARCAL) frequency which is often shared with the CTAF.

Two common CTAF allocations are [[UNICOM]], a licensed non-government base station that provides air-to-ground communications (and vice versa) and may also serve as a CTAF when in operation, and [[MULTICOM]], a frequency allocation (without a physical base station) that is reserved as a CTAF for airports without other facilities.

==Australia==
In Australia, there are many landing strips in remote locations that have CTAF operations 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are also CTAF(R) landing strips which require the aircraft intending to enter the area of operation to be fitted with a radio. The most common CTAF frequency is 126.7&amp;nbsp;MHz at non towered aerodromes except for when two CTAF airports are near each other. Aerodromes using CTAF outside tower hours typically nominate a frequency that is used during tower hours.

==United States==

UNICOM and a CTAF may be mutually exclusive, but this is not always the case. In the United States, many non-towered airports use the same frequency for both Unicom and CTAF purposes. Pilots are advised to check their sectional charts and/or Chart Supplement (formerly Airport/Facilities Directory) guides to determine the appropriate frequency for CTAF prior to operating at any given airport.

==United Kingdom==

Unlicensed aerodromes in the UK often recommend pilots communicate with each other using SAFETYCOM, currently 135.475&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Uncontrolled_Aerodromes_-_Communications Uncontrolled Aerodromes - Communications - SKYbrary Aviation Safety], retrieved 2018-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most gliding clubs use the Glider Ground Station Common Field Frequency, currently 129.975&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.gliding.co.uk/library/laws-rules/radio-guidance/ BGA Laws and Rules, Radio Guidance], retrieved 2018-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''compost heater''' (or '''Biomeiler''') is a structure for the energetic use of [[biomass]] for the heating of [[building]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenbuilt.org/bks-compost-water-heater/ Green Built Alliance - Compost Water Heater]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prepperfortress.com/alternative-heat-compost-heater-permaculture/ Prepper Fortress - Alternative Heat — Compost Heater – Permaculture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://native-power.de/en/native-power/biomeiler Biomeiler]&lt;/ref&gt;

The method was developed by [[Jean Pain]] in the 1970s. Compost heaters are used primarily for demonstration purposes as small systems for heating a house. Local waste can be converted to energy.

==Types==
[[File:BiomeilerDrawing.jpg|thumb|200px|Using the heat of an external compost heap for warming up the inside of a house]]
===Compost heap===
The traditional compost heater exploits the heat of a large compost heap to warm a house. This type requires a big heap, intertwined with a spiral water hose. The circulating water conducts heat to the building, where it can be fed to a heating circuit.

The heap must contain at least 8,000 liters of biomass to maintain a temperature during the winter.

For this purpose, chipped [[wood]] is usually piled up and a water hose is passed through it. A [[microbiological]] degradation process generates heat for up to 24 months. The heat produces hot water, which is then fed to a heating circuit. With sufficient oxygen supply, the biomass is degraded by [[Decomposition|aerobic decomposition]]. The activity of the microorganisms can be regulated by the [[moisture]] content.

===Hot water and biogas===
[[File:JeanPainSystem.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The heat of a compost heap is used, and biogas is produced at the same time.]]
Pain's 'Biomeiler' combines composting with [[biogas]].

The raw materials of Pain's compost heap were saplings, branches and underbrush. He  developed the machines that grind these materials to the proper size. One of his machines, a tractor-driven model, earned fourth prize in the 1978 [[Grenoble]] Agricultural Fair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.permacultureactivist.net/PeterBane/Jean_Pain.html Another Kind of Energy or ComPost-Modernism] - By Peter Bane.&lt;/ref&gt; After Pain had ground the raw materials, Pain would construct a heap three metres high and six metres across (10 × 20 feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|JHRvwNJRNag|The Jean Pain Method (in English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heap weighed approximately  {{convert|50|t}}, and was mounted over a {{convert|4|m3}} steel tank. This tank was 3/4 full of compost, which had first been steeped in water for two months. The hermetically sealed tank was connected by tubing to 24 truck tire inner tubes, gathered nearby to collect the [[methane]] gas. The gas was distilled by washing and compressing it through small stones in water. Pain used the gas for cooking and producing electricity. He also fueled a light van. Pain estimated that {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of brushwood would supply the gas equivalent of {{convert|1|L|spell=in}}. of [[petrol]].

It took about 90 days to produce {{convert|500|m3}} of gas - enough to keep two ovens and three burner stoves going for a year. The methane-fueled combustion engine drove a generator that produced 100 watts of electricity.  This charged a battery, providing the light needed. Skepticism has been leveled at Pain's estimates for methane extraction&lt;ref&gt;[[Appropedia:Talk:Jean Pain system|Talk page on the Appropedia project: Jean Pain System]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not known if anyone has been able to reproduce his results.

Pain's compost heaps generated hot water via {{convert|200|m|0}} of pipe buried inside the compost mound. The pipe was wrapped around the methane generator with an inlet for cold water and an outlet for hot water. The heat from the decomposing mass produced {{convert|4|L/min}} of hot water heated to {{convert|60|C|F|abbr=off}} — enough to meet central heating, bathroom and kitchen requirements. The heap composted for nearly 18 months, after which it was dismantled. The [[humus]] was used to [[mulch]] soils. 

===Heater silo===
[[File:CompostHeaterSiloConcept.jpg|thumb|160px|Using the heat of a compost heater silo for warming up the inside of a house]]
The composting process runs in an airtight container inside a house. The heat can be radiated directly to the interiors of the house or distributed by a heating circuit. An additional water pipe can be vertically built into the silo for warming water.

The silo is the central part of an in-house compost heater. In autumn the silo is filled up with fresh [[biomass]], after which the silo delivers comfortable heat throughout the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appropedia.org/Compost_heater_silo The Compost Heater Silo project]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inlet air and outlet air provide the necessary [[oxygen]]. The outlet air goes out of the house. Silo moisture is higher than in a regular compost heap. The decay process produces additional water, which is drained at the bottom of the silo. A part of this water enters the top of the silo for better distribution in the processing volume. If pumped periodically or continuously to the top to rinse through the silo, the whole system becomes a ''wet composting'' system.

[[Image:NationalTreasureFilming.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crew members on ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]'' using a cookie]]

In lighting for [[film]], [[theatre]] and still [[photography]], a '''cucoloris''' (occasionally also spelled '''cuculoris''', '''kookaloris''', '''cookaloris''' or '''cucalorus''') is a device for casting shadows or silhouettes to produce patterned illumination. It is normally referred to as a ''cookie'' or sometimes as a ''kook'' or a ''coo-koo''. The cucoloris is used to create a more natural look by breaking up the light from a man-made source. It can be used to simulate movement by passing shadows or light coming through a leafy canopy.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word is opaque, bearing a number of plausible origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2013/04/word-of-the-week-cucoloris.html |title= Word of the Week |last= |first= |date= |website= Fritinancy|accessdate= October 21, 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; Grant Barett, a co-host of the radio show "A Way with Words", suggested that the phrase is an eponym of [[George Cukor]]. Moreover, a specious claim cited by "Directing and Producing Television" maintained that the term arose from the Greek 'kukaloris', breaking of light, 'loris' conceivably cognate with 'luo', 'I break'.

==Overview==
Generally, cookies fall into three groups: hard cookies, made from thin [[plywood]] or heavy [[poster board]] with random shapes cut out of the body; soft cookies (often called "celo" cookies), made from [[plastic]] impregnated screen (the same screen one might find in a [[Storm windows|storm window]]), also with random shapes cut or burned out; and ''brancholorises'' or ''dingles'', which are simply tree limbs or other available things that can be placed between the light and the subject.

Many "old-school" [[grip (job)|grip]]s would say that any unnatural pattern used to create a shadow is a cookie.{{fact|date=September 2016}}

Cucolorises are sometimes thought of as a subset of the [[gobo (lighting)|gobo]] category. Cucolorises differ from standard gobos in that they are used farther away from the lighting instrument, and therefore do not need to be as heat resistant. Cuculorises generally produce softer edges than gobos.

A similar technique to using a cookie is simulated in [[3D computer graphics]], where using an [[alpha mapping|alpha map]] as a cookie (sometimes called a ''light texture'') to cast shadows on [[3D modeling|3D objects]] is simulated by applying an [[Alpha compositing|alpha]] [[Texture mapping|texture]] to an emitting light source in the 3D scene, typically a [[Shading#Spotlight_lighting|spot light]] type or a [[Shading#Directional_lighting|directional light]] type, to serve as a virtual cookie that projects shadows onto 3D object(s) by emitting light only through the transparent or translucent parts of the alpha texture, thus simulating the effect of a cucoloris as used in its real-world counterpart. This effect is commonly used in both 3D computer-generated animation and video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Components/class-Light.html | title=Unity reference manual: Light}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Lighting/Lights/Textures |title=Blender Doc:2.6 manual - Lighting/Lights/Textures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cinematographer [[George J. Folsey]], [[American Society of Cinematographers|ASC]] thus recounted the history: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;While shooting a scene with an actor who was wearing a white shirt, he wanted to separate the skin tones on the actor’s face from the hue of the shirt. Folsey told a grip to hold a stepladder in front of a key light to create a shadow on the actor’s shirt. The closer that the ladder was held to the light, the softer and less defined the shadow became. The grip eventually tired of holding the ladder, so he cut a grill with the same pattern in a sheet of light wood. One day, Folsey visited [[Hal Rosson]], ASC, who was shooting on another set. In the scene, an actress was lying on a bed swathed in white sheets. Rosson used Folsey’s wooden grill to create some shadows, which made the scene more dramatic. Later, while shooting a similar situation, Rosson asked Folsey, “Where’s that kookaloris thing?” [http://motion.kodak.com/motion/Education/Publications/Essential_reference_guide/index.htm?CID=go&amp;idhbx=referenceguide Kodak: The Essential Reference Guide for Filmmakers]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15513">[[File:SLA setup.jpg|thumb|A desktop setup for Rapid prototyping by SLA process]]

In [[design for additive manufacturing]] (DFAM), there are both broad themes (which apply to many [[additive manufacturing]] processes) and optimizations specific to a particular AM process. Described here is '''DFM analysis for stereolithography''', in which [[design for manufacturability]] (DFM) considerations are applied in [[design]]ing a part (or assembly) to be manufactured by the [[stereolithography]] (SLA) process. In SLA, parts are built from a photo[[curing (chemistry)|curable]] liquid [[resin]] that cures when exposed to a [[laser]] beam that scans across the surface of the resin ([[polymerization#Photopolymerization|photopolymerization]]). Resins containing [[acrylate]], [[epoxy]], and [[Ethyl carbamate|urethane]] are typically used. Complex parts and assemblies can be directly made in one go, to a greater extent than in earlier forms of manufacturing such as [[casting]], [[forming (metalworking)|forming]], [[metal fabrication]], and [[machining]]. Realization of such a seamless process requires the designer to take in considerations of manufacturability of the part (or assembly) by the process. In any product design process, DFM considerations are important to reduce iterations, time and material wastage.

== Challenges in stereolithography ==

=== Material ===
Excessive setup specific material cost and lack of support for 3rd party resins is a major challenge with SLA process:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.develop3d.com/comment/3d-printing-issues-and-challenges-material-costs-sla 3D printing issues and challenges: Material costs]&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of material (a design process) is restricted by the supported resin. Hence, the mechanical properties are also fixed. When scaling up dimensions selectively to deal with expected stresses, post curing is done by further treatment with UV light and heat.&lt;ref&gt;Bártolo, Paulo. ''[https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387929033 Stereolithography: Materials, Processes and Applications]''. Springer, 2011, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Although advantageous to mechanical properties, the additional polymerization and cross linkage can result in shrinkage, warping and residual thermal stresses.&lt;ref&gt;D Karalekas, A Aggelopoulos, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924013603000281 Study of shrinkage strains in a stereolithography cured acrylic photopolymer resin]," "Journal of Materials Processing Technology", Volume 136, Issues 1–3, 10 May 2003, Pages 146-150&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the part shall be designed in its 'green' stage i.e. pre-treatment stage.

=== Setup and process ===
SLA process is an [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] process. Hence, design considerations such as orientation, process latitude, support structures etc. have to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micromanufacturing.com/content/solving-z-axis-challenges-during-stereolithography-processes Solving Z-axis challenges during stereolithography processes]&lt;/ref&gt;
Orientation affects the support structures, manufacturing time, part quality and part cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448596000498 | doi=10.1016/S0010-4485(96)00049-8 | volume=29 | title=Determining fabrication orientations for rapid prototyping with Stereolithography apparatus | year=1997 | journal=Computer-Aided Design | pages=53–62 | author=Lan Po-Ting, Chou Shuo-Yan, Chen Lin-Lin, Gemmill Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex structures may fail to manufacture properly due to orientation which is not feasible resulting in undesirable stresses. This is when the DFM guidelines can be applied. Design feasibility for stereolithography can be validated by analytical &lt;ref&gt;Shyamasundar, RudrapatnaK. "[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-57529-4_56#page-1 Feasibility of design in stereolithography]," "Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science", Volume 761 Springer, 1993,&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on the basis of simulation and/or guidelines &lt;ref&gt;D Pham, S Dimov, R Gault, "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs001700050118#page-1 Part Orientation in Stereolithography]," "The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology", Volume 15, Issue 9, 1999-08-01, Pages 674-682&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rule-based DFM considerations ==

Rule-based considerations in DFM refer to certain criteria that the part has to meet in order to avoid failures during manufacturing. Given the layer-by-layer manufacturing technique the process follows, there isn't any constraint on the overall complexity that the part may have. But some rules have been developed through experience by the printer developer/academia which must be followed to ensure that the individual features that make up the part are within certain 'limits of feasibility'.

=== Printer constraints ===
Constraints/limitations in SLA manufacturing comes from the printer's accuracy, layer thickness, speed of curing, speed of printing etc. Various printer constraints are to be considered during design such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://formlabs.com/support/guide/prepare/design-specs/ Specs|Formlabs]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Minimum Wall Thickness (Supported and Unsupported)''': Wall thickness in geometries is limited by resin resolution. Supported walls have ends connected to other walls. Below a thickness limit, such walls wall may warp during peeling. Unsupported walls are even more liable to detachment hence higher limit is for such case.
* '''Overhang (Maximum Unsupported Length and Minimum Unsupported Angle)''': Overhangs are geometric features that are not supported inherently in the part. These must be supported by support structures. There is a maximum limit when structures are not provided. This is to reduce bending under self-weight. Too shallow angles result in a longer unsupported (projected) length. Hence, a minimum limit on that. 
* '''Maximum Bridge Span''': To avoid sagging of beam-like structures that are supported only at the ends, the maximum span length of such structures shall be limited. Whenever this is not possible, width should be increased for compensation. 
* '''Minimum Vertical pillar diameter''': This is to ensure the slenderness is above a limit at which the feature becomes wavy.  
* '''Minimum dimensions of grooves and embossed detail''': Grooves are imprinted and emboss are shallow raised features on the part surface. Features printed with dimensions smaller than the limits are unrecognizable.
* '''Minimum Clearance between geometries''': This is to ensure the parts don't fuse.
* '''Minimum hole diameter and radius of curvatures''': Small curvatures that aren't realizable by print dimensions may close up or smooth out/fuse. 
* '''Minimum internal volumes nominal diameters''': Volumes that are too small may fill up.

=== Support structures ===
[[Image:Supports in 3D printing.png|thumb|Graphic showing support structures for a lego block]]
A point needs support if:&lt;ref name="web.iitd.ac.in"&gt;http://web.iitd.ac.in/~pmpandey/RP_html_pdf/protec_orien.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is  end point of support less edges
* If length of the overhang is more than a critical value
* It is at the geometric center of support less plane
While printing, support structures act as a part of design hence, their limitations and advantages are kept in mind while designing. Major considerations include:
* '''Support shallow angle geometry''': Shallow angles may result in improper resin (structural strength issues) curing unless supports are provided uniformly. Generally, beyond a certain angle (usually around 45 degrees), the surface doesn't require support.
* '''Overhang base''': Increase section thickness at base to avoid tearing. Avoid sharp transitions at overhang base.
* '''Air pocket releaf''': Without supports, printing parts with a flat surface and holes in the geometry may create air bubbles. As the part prints, these air pockets can cause voids in the model. The support structures, in this case, create pathways through which the air bubbles could escape.&lt;ref&gt;http://formlabs.com/support/guide/prepare/what-supports-do/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Structure compatibility''': Consider Supports compatibility for internal volume surface.
* '''Feature Orientation''': Orient to ensure overhangs are well supported.

=== Part deposition orientation ===
[[Image:Orientation in SLA.png|thumb|Significance of support structures and orientation in SLA process. The object, in first case, has strength issues and takes more time to manufacture than in the second case.]]
Part orientation is a very crucial decision in DFM analysis for SLA process. The build time, surface quality, volume/number of support structures etc. depend on this. In many cases, it is also possible to address the manufacturability issues just by reorienting the part. For example, an overhanging geometry with shallow angle may be oriented to ensure steep angles. Hence, major considerations include:
* '''Surface finish improvement''': Orient the part in such a way that a feature on critical surface is eliminated. Algorithmic point of view, a free-form surface is decomposed to combination of various plane surfaces and weight is calculated/assigned to each. Total of weights is minimized for best overall surface finish.&lt;ref name="web.iitd.ac.in"/&gt;
* '''Build Time reduction''': Rough estimation of build time is done using slicing. The build time is proportional to the sum of surface areas of each slice. (Can be approximated as height of the part)
* '''Support structure optimization''': Supported area varies as per orientation. In some orientations, it is possible to reduce support area.
* '''Easy peel-off''': Reorienting such that the projected area of layers varies gradually makes it easier to peel off the cured layer during printing. Orientation also helps in removal of the support structures at later stages.

== Plan-based DFM considerations ==

Plan-based considerations in DFM refer to criteria that arise due to process plan. These are to be met in order to avoid failures during manufacturing of a part that may be satisfy the rule-based criteria but may have some manufacturing difficulties due to sequence in which features are produced.

=== Geometric tailoring ===
{{Quote|text=The modification of some non-critical geometric features of a part to lower fabrication cost and time, and to produce functional prototypes that mimic the behavior of the production parts.&lt;ref name="GTDFM"&gt;Sambu, S., Y. Chen, and D.W. Rosen, Gometric Tailoring: A Design for Manufacturing Method for Rapid Prototyping and Rapid Tooling. Journal  of Mechanical Design, 2004. 126: p. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Geometric Tailoring bridges the mismatch of material properties and process differences described above. Both functionality and manufacturability issues are addressed. Functionality issues are addressed through 'tailoring' of dimensions of the part to compensate the stress and deflection behavior anomalies.&lt;ref name="GTDFM" /&gt; Manufacturability issues are tackled through identification of difficult to manufacture geometric attributes (an approach used in most DFM handbooks) or through simulations of manufacturing processes. For RP-produced parts (as in SLA), the problem formulations are called material-process geometric tailoring (MPGT)/RP.
First, the designer specifies information such as: Parametric CAD model of the part; constraints and goals on functional, geometry, cost and time characteristics; analysis models for these constraints and goals; target values of goals; and preferences for the goals.
DFM problem is then formulated as the designer fills in the MPGT template with this information and sends to the manufacturer, who fills in the remaining 'manufacturing relevant' information. With the completed formulation, the manufacturer is now able to solve the DFM problem, performing GT of the part design. Hence, the MPGT serves as the digital interface between the designer and the manufacturer.
Various Process Planning (PP) strategies have been developed for geometric tailoring in SLA process.&lt;ref&gt;West, A.P., Sambu, S. and Rosen, D.W. (2001), "A process planning method for improving build performance in stereolithography",Computer-Aided Design, Vol. 33, No. 1, pp. 65-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn-Charney, C.M. and Rosen, D.W. (2000), "Accuracy models and their use in stereolithography process planning",Rapid Prototyping Journal, Vol. 6 No. 2, pp. 77-86&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DFM frameworks ===
The constraints imposed by the manufacturing process are mapped onto the design. This helps in identification of DFM problems while exploring process plans by acting as a retrieval method. Various DFM frameworks are developed in literature. These frameworks help in various decision making steps such as:
* Product-process fit: Ensuring consideration of manufacturing issues during the design stage gives insight on whether SLA process is the right choice. [[Rapid prototyping]] can be done in various ways. The usual concern are process cost and availability. Through this DFM Framework, the designer can make necessary design changes to ease the component manufacturability in SLA Process.&lt;ref&gt;Susman, G.I.,  Integrating Design and Manufacturing for Competitive Advantage. 1992, New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This framework hence ensures that the product is suitable for the manufacturing plan.
* Feature recognition: This is done through integrated process planning tasks in commercial CAD/CAM software. This may include simulations of the manufacturing process to get an idea of the possible difficulties in a virtual manufacturing environment. Such integrated tools are in developmental stage.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} 
* Functionality considerations: In some cases, assemblies are directly printed instead of printing parts separately and assembling. In such cases, phenomenon such as flow of the resin may affect the functionality drastically which may not be addressed through just rule based analysis. In fact, the rule based analysis is only to ensure the bounds of design but the dimensions of the final part must be checked for manufacturability through Plan-based consideration. Considerable research has been going on in this since the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;A.G.M.

'''Diamond plate''', also known as '''checker plate''', '''tread plate'''&lt;ref name=metalsdepot&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metalsdepot.com/products/stainless2.phtml?page=Floor%20Plate&amp;LimAcc=%20&amp;aident= | title = Stainless Steel Floor Plate | publisher = Metals Depot International | accessdate = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Durbar floor plate''', is a type of [[Fabrication (metal)|metal stock]] with a regular pattern of raised [[Diamond (geometry)|diamonds]] or lines on one side, with the reverse side being featureless. Diamond plate is usually [[steel]], [[stainless steel]] or [[Aluminium|aluminum]]. Steel types are normally made by [[Rolling (metalworking)#Hot rolling|hot rolling]], although modern manufacturers also make a raised and pressed diamond design.

The added texture reduces the risk of slipping, making diamond plate a solution for [[stairway|stairs]], [[Footbridge#Catwalk|catwalks]], walkways, and ramps&lt;ref name=metalsdepot/&gt; in industrial settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sizemetal.com/product/aluminum-diamond-plates/#overview | title=Aluminum Diamond Plates - Overview | publisher=Size Metal | accessdate=19 May 2014 | author=Lee, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its non-skid properties mean that diamond plate is frequently used on the interior of ambulances and on the footplates of firetrucks. Additional applications include truck beds and trailer floors.&lt;ref name=metalsdepot/&gt; 

Diamond plate can also be used decoratively, particularly highly polished aluminum variants. Manufactured in plastic, diamond plate is marketed as an interlocking tile system to be installed on garage floors, trailers, and exercise rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kofflersales.com/p/diamond-plate-plastic-interlocking-tile.asp?cid=864 | title = Diamond Plate Plastic Interlocking Floor Tile - #A463 | publisher = Koffler Sales, LLC | accessdate = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond plate may be used for surface protection against damage from foot traffic or harmful chemicals. Manufactured with polymer variants, inter-locking diamond plate tile is used in areas with high surface-erosive traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.garageflooringllc.com/diamond-garage-floor-tile/ | title = Diamond Plate Floor Tile - #A463 | publisher = Wiki Soldiers, LLC | accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Credit Card Slip DCC.png|thumb|right|alt=Part of a credit card slip, indicating that DCC takes place|Part of a credit card slip, indicating that DCC takes place.]]

'''Dynamic currency conversion''' (DCC) or '''cardholder preferred currency''' (CPC) is a process whereby the amount of a [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] or [[MasterCard]] transaction is converted by a merchant or [[automated teller machine|ATM]] to the currency of the [[payment card]]'s country of issue at the [[point of sale]].

DCC allows the merchant, merchant's bank or [[automated teller machine|ATM]] operator to charge a markup on the exchange rate used, sometimes by as much as 18%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guy|first1=Anker|title=The worst ‘paying in pounds abroad’ rip-off I’ve seen – where £160 of cash costs £190|url=http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/team-blog/2016/07/04/the-worst-paying-in-pounds-abroad-rip-off-ive-seen-where-160-of-cash-costs-190/|accessdate=30 August 2017|publisher=MoneySavingExpert|date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the DCC markup is less than the [[card issuer]]'s currency conversion fee, DCC can benefit card holders by allowing them to see the amount that their card will be charged expressed in the currency of the card's country of issue. However, in most cases, DCC markups are higher than the card issuer's currency conversion fee (which can be zero), thereby negating this benefit.

DCC services are generally provided by third party operators in association with the merchant, and not by a [[card issuer]]. Card issuers do not provide cardholders with a DCC option at the point of sale, but these two card networks permit DCC operators to offer currency conversion in accordance with their card processing rules.&lt;ref name="usa.visa.com"&gt;https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mastercard.com"&gt;http://www.mastercard.com/elearning/dcc/docs/DCC%20Guide%2020.02.17%20EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Without DCC, the [[currency conversion]] is carried out by the card issuer when the transaction is charged to the card holder's statement, usually a day or two later, but for an increasing number of cards in real time. Even though the card issuer will publish the exchange rate used for conversion on the statement, most do not disclose the exchange rate used to convert a transaction at the time of payment. Both Visa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usa.visa.com/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html/|title=ExchangeRateComp - Visa|website=usa.visa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MasterCard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/consumers/get-support/convert-currency.html|title=Currency Converter - Foreign Exchange Rates Calculator - Mastercard|website=www.mastercard.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that the rates they publish in advance of a transaction posting to a cardholder's statement are indicative, since the rates they use for conversion correspond to the date and time ''they'' process the transaction, as opposed to the actual transaction date.

With DCC, the [[currency conversion]] is done by the merchant or their card processor at the point of sale. Unlike a credit card company, a DCC operator must disclose the exchange rate used for conversion at the time of the transaction according to credit card company rules which govern how DCC is offered.&lt;ref name="usa.visa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mastercard.com"/&gt; The DCC exchange rate must be based on a wholesale interbank rate, to which any additional markup is then applied. Visa requires this markup be disclosed to the cardholder.&lt;ref name="usa.visa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mastercard.com"/&gt; The credit card company may still charge an additional fee for charges made outside the card holder's home country, even when the transaction has been processed in their home currency with DCC.

Proponents of this service believe that customers can better understand prices in their home currency, and this makes it easier for business travelers to keep track of their expenses. They also point out that the customer has full transparency inclusive of conversion fees, and can make an informed choice whether or not to use DCC. The financial benefit to the merchant or their card processor may be an incentive for the merchant to offer DCC even when it would be disadvantageous to the customer.

Opponents of the service believe that customers do not understand DCC, and point out that DCC exchange rate markups are mostly higher than the card issuers' currency conversion fees that DCC avoids, and therefore, in almost all cases, opting for DCC will result in a higher charge to the cardholder.

==History==
A dynamic currency conversion service was offered in 1996 and commercialized by a number of companies including [[Monex financial services]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monexfs.com/solutions/dynamic-currency-conversion/ Monex Financial Services - Dynamic currency conversion]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FEXCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fexcoms.com/products/dynamic-currency-conversiondcc/ |title=Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) |publisher=[[FEXCO]] |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the card schemes (Visa and MasterCard) imposing rules relating to DCC, cardholder transactions were converted without the need to disclose that the transaction was being converted into a customer's home currency, in a process known as "back office DCC".  Visa and MasterCard now prohibit this practice and require the customer's consent for DCC, although many travelers have reported that this is not universally followed.&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jul/12/foreigncurrency.consumeraffairs | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Going to Spain? Just say no | first=Patrick | last=Collinson | date=12 July 2008 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dynamic currency exchange|url=http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/milesbuzz/863268-dynamic-currency-exchange.html|publisher=FlyerTalk|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Visa Inc.|Visa]] [[Chargeback]] reason code 76 explicitly covers situations where the "Cardholder was not advised that Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) would occur" or "Cardholder was refused the choice of paying in the merchant’s local currency".  Customers have a strong chance of successfully disputing such transactions, especially in situations where they pay with a credit card and where Verified by Visa or Securecode is not involved.
Mastercard DCC Compliance team investigates the case  
and then notifies the Acquirer of their findings. If appropriate, the Acquirer 
will also be asked to take action to remedy the complaint.

[[MasterCard]] take seriously any complaint from a customer by investigating the case for compliance with DCC rules, and if the customer was not given a choice in a DCC transaction, the bank's customer has the possibility to refund the customer with a chargeback sent to the bank's merchant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mastercard.com/elearning/dcc/docs/DCC%20Guide%2020.02.17%20EN.pdf | title=Dynamic Currency Conversion Compliance Guide, MasterCard, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==How it works==
DCC is only available at merchants that have signed up for the facility with a DCC provider.

When a customer is ready to pay for a transaction and chooses to pay with a payment card, the point-of-sale terminal of a DCC merchant will determine the card's country of issue from the card's [[issuer identification number]] (first 6 digits of the card number). If it detects a foreign card is being used, then the transaction will be routed through the DCC provider, which may offer DCC to the customer. 

If DCC is being offered, the terminal will also display the transaction amount in the customer’s home currency. Visa and MasterCard require the DCC provider to disclose the exchange rate and margin to the cardholder, but not all merchants comply with this obligation, and other card issuers do not have that obligation. The cardholder can then select whether the transaction is to be processed in the local or home currency.

If the cardholder chooses to pay in their home currency, the DCC provider will cause the cardholder’s account to be debited by the transaction amount in the home currency, and the merchant's account to be credited with the amount in the local currency. At regular periods, usually monthly, the merchant would also be credited with the commission for DCC transactions. The [[exchange rate risk]] is borne by the DCC provider, which may carry that risk or set up some [[Hedge (finance)|hedging arrangement]] to minimise or transfer that risk. 

Some card issuers impose an additional foreign transaction fee on DCC transactions, even though they are denominated in the card’s home currency.

===Practical example===
An example of the difference with DCC can be seen in the following image, where the same GBP purchase is made twice just after each other: one with DCC and one without DCC. In both cases, the original amount is GB£6.90 and is paid with a Visa card denominated in EUR. 

[[File:dcc versus non dcc.png]]

The difference in charges can be seen on the customer’s card statement. With DCC (left part of the above image), the amount becomes EUR 8.20, at an exchange rate of 1.1882. The DCC provider, in this example the merchant itself, also disclosed that it is using the [[Reuters]] Wholesale [[Interbank foreign exchange market|Interbank exchange rate]] plus 2.95%. Without DCC, the amount can vary with fluctuations between the GBP and EUR currencies, but on the date of this transaction it was EUR 8.04.

In this example, difference is just over 2%. Though this difference may seem a small amount for the customer, it can result in a big income stream for the DCC provider and merchant. One should also realise that even without DCC the card issuer converts the transaction amount using its own exchange rates and margins, which in this example was 1.16522.

[[File:Statement dcc and non-dcc.png|830px]]

===Limitations===
The merchant’s point-of-sale terminal can only detect the card’s country of issue and not the currency of the account that is to be selected. The DCC makes an assumption that the account home currency is the currency of the card's country of issue. This assumption can result in DCC being offered incorrectly. For example, a DCC-enabled terminal in the [[Eurozone]] will offer DCC to a customer paying with a debit card issued in the [[United Kingdom]] on a [[euro]] bank account. If the customer mistakenly chooses DCC, then the transaction will first be converted from EUR to GBP by the DCC provider, and then from GBP back to EUR by the UK card issuer, often with its markup.

There have reported cases of point-of-sale terminals allowing merchants to change the transaction amount and currency after the cardholder has entered their [[personal identification number|PIN]] and handed the terminal back to the merchant. In this scenario, DCC is carried out without the cardholder's consent, even though the receipt subsequently printed states falsely that the cardholder has given their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Megan|first1=French|title=Avoid holiday rip-offs by ALWAYS keeping hold of the card machine AFTER entering your PIN|url=http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/travel/2017/08/paying-on-card-abroad-heres-why-you-need-to-keep-hold-of-the-payment-terminal|accessdate=30 August 2017|publisher=MoneySavingExpert|date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DCC on the Internet and ATMs==
DCC operates similarly with Internet transactions. When payment card information is entered to finalize payment, the system can detect the home country of the cardholder and offer the cardholder the option of paying in their home currency. 

Many commercial websites can detect the country from which a query has come and quote prices in terms of the enquirer’s country. Often the prices in the local currency of the supplier are not indicated, and the exchange rate used to convert prices is often also not disclosed.

DCC is also sometimes available for cash withdrawals at [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s.

==Impact==
DCC has proved popular with merchants because it enables them to profit from the foreign exchange conversion that occurs during the payment process for a foreign denominated credit card.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Maximilian, '[https://beck-online.beck.de/?vpath=bibdata%2fzeits%2fbkr%2f2015%2fcont%2fbkr.2015.407.1.htm&amp;pos=0&amp;hlwords=on Dynamic Currency Conversion – ein grenzüberschreitendes verbraucherpolitisches Problem]' (''Dynamic Currency Conversion – a cross-border consumer policy problem''), [2015] BKR 407, 408 (in German), with further references.&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit card acquirers and payment gateways will also take a profit on the foreign exchange conversion that occurs during the payment process for foreign denominated credit card when DCC is used.  DCC revenue has been important for them because it offsets increasing international interchange fees.

===Advantages===
The main advantage of DCC is that for a non-DCC transaction the customer does not know exactly the exchange rate that the credit card company will apply (and the final cost) until the transaction is cleared, so the actual rate is not known to the customer until it appears on a monthly statement.

Other advantages to customers, according to proponents, are:
* the ability to view and therefore understand prices in foreign countries in their home currency,
* the ability to enter expenses more efficiently and promptly, especially for business travellers, and
* EU regulation 2560/2001 could make non-eurozone cash withdrawals within the [[European Economic Area]] cheaper for eurozone customers because euro cash withdrawals are regulated. A Swedish law ([[Swedish Code of Statutes|SFS]] 2002:598) combined with the EU resolution does the same thing for Swedish cards if the transaction is in SEK or EUR. Generally, Eurozone banks charge a fixed fee for non-EEA and non-EUR cash withdrawals while EEA withdrawals in EUR are free of charge. For example, if a Eurozone card is used for a withdrawal in the UK, with DCC there are two options - processing the transaction in GBP (card issuer's exchange rate but a fixed cash withdrawal fee) or processing the transaction in EUR (DCC marked-up exchange rate but no fixed cash withdrawal fee). For small amounts, the latter option will often be cheaper.

For the merchant which normally accepts credit cards, DCC offers an opportunity to earn a margin on the transaction with no [[exchange rate risk]], which is borne by the DCC operator.

===Disadvantages===
The main objection to DCC is the unfavorable  exchange rates and fees being applied on the transaction,&lt;ref name="Keck2005"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keck|first=Gayle|title=Charge It . . . but Check the Math|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/29/AR2005072900927.html|accessdate=31 December 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|date=31 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;   resulting in a higher charge on their credit card, and that in many cases the customer is not aware of the additional and often unnecessary cost of the DCC transaction.

The size of the foreign exchange margin added using DCC varies depending on the DCC operator, card acquirer or payment gateway and merchant. This margin is in addition to any charges levied by the customer's bank or credit card company for a foreign purchase. In most cases, customers are charged more using DCC than they would have been if they had simply paid in the foreign currency.&lt;ref name="Keck2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steele|first=Jason|title=The Foreign Conversion Scam|url=http://blogs.courant.com/travel_columnists_leblanc/2008/03/dynamic-currency-conversion-st.html|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dynamic Currency Conversion: Still A Scam|url=http://blogs.courant.com/travel_columnists_leblanc/2008/03/dynamic-currency-conversion-st.html|work=9 March 2008|publisher=courant.com|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In summary===
* Customers should check the spread that their issuer charges for their transaction in a foreign currency and compare it with the base rate and spread declared by the DCC terminal and choose the best option.
* Customers may find DCC to be forced upon them, without a clear choice, as merchants may falsely claim that their machines automatically convert purchases to home currency at the point of sale.
* Some payment terminals, for example in Spain, allow merchants to use DCC to change the transaction currency and amount after the customer has authorised the transaction, for example where a contactless payment above the contactless threshold is authorised using a PIN. In this case, the customer has no choice as to whether DCC is applied.
* Credit card disputes can be lengthy and/or impossible if a customer signs the receipt with/without a clear choice.
* Customers should be advised of the choice open to them to select the local currency, and if not they may report the case to their payment scheme customer service.

'''Egyptian pyramid construction techniques''' are the controversial subject of many hypotheses. These techniques seem to have developed over time; later pyramids were not constructed in the same way as earlier ones. Most of the construction hypotheses are based on the belief that huge stones were carved from quarries with copper chisels, and these blocks were then dragged and lifted into position. Disagreements chiefly concern the methods used to move and place the stones. 

In addition to the many unresolved arguments about the construction techniques, there have been disagreements as to the kind of workforce used. The [[Greeks]], many years after the event, believed that the pyramids must have been built by [[Slavery|slave labor]]. Archaeologists now believe that the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (at least) was built by tens of thousands of skilled workers who camped near the pyramids and worked for a salary or as a form of tax payment (levy) until the construction was completed, pointing to workers' cemeteries discovered in 1990 by archaeologists [[Zahi Hawass]] and [[Mark Lehner]]. For the Middle Kingdom Pyramid of [[Amenemhat II]], there is evidence from the annal stone of the king that foreigners from Canaan were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moussa |first1=Ahmed M. |author-link=Ahmed Moussa (Egyptologist) |editor-last1=Altenmüller |editor-first1=Hartwig |editor-link=Hartwig Altenmüller |title=Die Inschrift Amenemhets II. aus dem Ptah-Tempel von Memphis. Vorbericht |trans-title=The inscription of Amenemhet II. From the temple of Ptah of Memphis |journal=[[Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur]] |date=1991 |volume=18 |page=36 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical hypotheses==

===Third through Fifth Dynasties===
During the earliest period, pyramids were constructed wholly of stone. Locally quarried limestone was the material of choice for the main body of these pyramids, while a higher quality of limestone quarried at [[Tura (Egypt)|Tura]] (near modern [[Cairo]]) was used for the outer casing. Granite, quarried near [[Aswan]], was used to construct some architectural elements, including the [[portcullis]] (a type of gate) and the roofs and walls of the burial chamber. Occasionally, granite was used in the outer casing as well, such as in the [[Pyramid of Menkaure]]. In the early pyramids, the layers of stone (called ''courses'') forming the pyramid body were laid sloping inwards; however, this configuration was found to be less stable than simply stacking the stones horizontally on top of each other. The [[Bent Pyramid]] at [[Dahshur]] seems to indicate acceptance of a new technique at a transition between these two building techniques. Its lower section is built of sloping courses while in its upper section the stones are laid horizontally.

===Middle Kingdom and onward===
During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], pyramid construction techniques changed again. Most pyramids built then were little more than mountains of mud brick encased in a veneer of polished limestone. In several cases, later pyramids were built on top of natural hills to further reduce the volume of material needed in their construction. The materials and methods of construction used in the earliest pyramids have ensured their survival in a generally much better state of preservation than for the pyramid monuments of the later pharaohs.

==Construction method hypotheses==

===Building the pyramids from quarried stone blocks===
One of the major problems faced by the early pyramid builders was the need to move huge quantities of stone. The Twelfth Dynasty tomb of [[Djehutihotep]] has an illustration of 172 men pulling an alabaster statue of him on a sledge. The statue is estimated to weigh 60 tons and Denys Stocks estimated that 45 workers would be required to start moving a {{convert|16300|kg|lb t|abbr=on}} lubricated block, or eight workers to move a {{convert|2750|kg|lb t|abbr=on|adj=on}} block.&lt;ref&gt;Stocks, Denys A. ''Experiments in Egyptian Archaeology'' Routledge 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-415-30664-5}} pp.196-197 [https://books.google.com/books?id=oLDuHvQODoIC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=%22great+pyramid%22++Djehutihotep+sledge+stones&amp;ei=jkbOSNC9I6XayATY8PjiBA&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Vjilg6hb64WcmZ_bitO47LZUMiQ#PPA197,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr R H G Parry&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Dick "Engineering the Pyramids" The History Press 2013 {{ISBN|978-0-750-93415-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested a method for rolling the stones, using a cradle-like machine that had been excavated in various new kingdom temples. Four of those objects could be fitted around a block so it could be rolled easily. Experiments done by the Obayashi Corporation, with concrete blocks {{convert|0.8|metre}} square by {{convert|1.6|metre}} long and weighing {{convert|2.5|t|kg lb}}, showed how 18 men could drag the block over a 1-in-4 incline ramp, at a rate of {{convert|18|m/min|ft/s|0}}. This idea was previously described by John Bush in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bush |first=John D. |title=The Rolling Stones |url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3188/1/stones.pdf |date=1977 |magazine=Engineering and Science |access-date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is mentioned in the ''Closing Remarks'' section of Parry's book. [[Vitruvius]] in ''[[De architectura]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/10*.html|title=LacusCurtius • Vitruvius on Architecture — Book X|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a similar method for moving irregular weights. It is still not known whether the Egyptians used this method but the experiments indicate it could have worked using stones of this size. [[Egyptologist]]s generally accept this for the 2.5 ton blocks mostly used but do not agree over the methods used for the 15+ ton and several 70 to 80 ton blocks.

As the stones forming the core of the pyramids were roughly cut, especially in the [[Great Pyramids of Giza|Great Pyramid]], the material used to fill the gaps was another problem. Huge quantities of gypsum and rubble were needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Romer|first=John|title=The Great Pyramid: ancient Egypt revisited |year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-87166-2|pages=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brier|first=Bob|title=The Secret of the Great Pyramid: How One Man's Obsession Led to the Solution of Ancient Egypt's Greatest Mystery|year=2008|publisher=Smithsonian|isbn=978-0-06-165552-4|author2=Jean-Pierre Houdin|page=72,80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filling has almost no binding properties, but it was necessary to stabilize the construction. To make the gypsum mortar, it had to be dehydrated by heating which requires large quantities of wood. According to Egyptologists, the findings of both the 1984 and 1995 David H. Koch Pyramids Radiocarbon Projects&lt;ref name="Radiocarbon"&gt;{{cite document | title=RADIOCARBON DATES OF OLD AND MIDDLE KINGDOM MONUMENTS IN EGYPT | date=2001 | first1=Georges | last1=Bonani | first2=Herbert | last2=Haas | first3=Zahi | last3=Hawass | first4=Mark | last4=Lehner | first5=Shawki | last5=Nakhla | first6=John | last6=Nolan | first7=Robert | last7=Wenke | first8=Willy | last8=Wölfli | url=http://www.2dcode-r-past.com/1995Radiocarbonproject.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723072108/http://www.2dcode-r-past.com/1995Radiocarbonproject.pdf | archivedate=23 July 2013 | accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/9909/abstracts/pyramids.html|title=Dating the Pyramids - Archaeology Magazine Archive|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; may suggest that Egypt had to strip its forest and scrap every bit of wood it had to build the pyramids of Giza and other even earlier 4th Dynasty pyramids. Carbon dating samples from core blocks and other materials revealed that dates from the 1984 study averaged 374 years earlier than currently accepted and the 1995 dating averaging 100–200 years. As suggested by team members, "We thought that it was unlikely that the pyramid builders consistently used centuries-old wood as fuel in preparing mortar. The 1984 results left us with too little data to conclude that the historical chronology of the Old Kingdom was wrong by nearly 400 years, but we considered this at least a possibility". To explain this discrepancy, Egyptologists proposed the "old wood" theory claiming the earlier dates were possibly derived from recycling large amounts of centuries old wood and other earlier materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeraweb.org/projects/how-old-are-the-pyramids/ |title=How Old Are the Pyramids &amp;#124; Mark Lehner's Team Finds Out &amp;#124; |publisher=Aeraweb.org |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is good information concerning the location of the quarries, some of the tools used to cut stone in the quarries, transportation of the stone to the monument, leveling the foundation, and leveling the subsequent tiers of the developing superstructure. Workmen probably used copper chisels, drills, and saws to cut softer stone, such as most of the limestone.  The harder stones, such as granite, granodiorite, syenite, and basalt, cannot be cut with copper tools alone; instead they were worked with time-consuming methods like pounding with [[dolerite]], drilling, and sawing with the aid of an abrasive, such as quartz sand.&lt;ref&gt;Isler, Martin ''Sticks, stones, and shadows: building the Egyptian pyramids'' University of Oklahoma Press 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3342-3}} p.229 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ip-tqz1xGkoC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=Egyptian+copper+tools+abrasive,+like+quartzite+sand.&amp;ei=G_mQSsyDIo6CyQSknfjABw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stocks, Denys A.

===Writings of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus===
The unknowns of pyramid construction chiefly center on the question of how the blocks were moved up the superstructure. There is no known accurate historical or archaeological evidence that definitively resolves the question. Therefore, most discussion on construction methods involves functional possibilities that are supported by limited historical and archaeological evidence.

Historical accounts for the construction of the Egyptian pyramids do little to point definitively to methods to lift the blocks; yet most Egyptologists refer to these accounts when discussing this portion of pyramid construction. [[Thales]], according to the philosopher [[Hieronymus of Rhodes|Hieronymus]] (3rd century BC)&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], Lives of Eminent Philosophers, book 1, chapter 1, also Plutarch, Moralia, The Dinner of the Seven Wise Men, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Dinner_of_the_Seven*.html#ref5 147A].&lt;/ref&gt; visited the Egyptian pyramids during the 7th century BC and by using the [[intercept theorem#Measuring/Survey|intercept theorem]], also known as Thales's theorem, measured their height and thus their volume. The first historical accounts of the construction of these monuments came centuries after the era of pyramid construction, by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC and [[Diodorus Siculus]] in the 1st century BC.  Herodotus's account states:&lt;ref&gt;Godley, A. D. ed. (1920) ''Herodotus, The Histories''. Harvard University Press. Book 2 Chapter 125.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|This pyramid was made like stairs, which some call steps and others, tiers. When this, its first form, was completed, the workmen used short wooden logs as levers to raise the rest of the stones; they heaved up the blocks from the ground onto the first tier of steps; when the stone had been raised, it was set on another lever that stood on the first tier, and the lever again used to lift it from this tier to the next. It may be that there was a new lever on each tier of steps, or perhaps there was only one lever, quite portable, which they carried up to each tier in turn; I leave this uncertain, as both possibilities were mentioned. But this is certain, that the upper part of the pyramid was finished off first, then the next below it, and last of all the base and the lowest part. }}

Diodorus Siculus's account states:&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Edwin. (1990) ''The Antiquities of Egypt: A Translation with Notes of Book I of the Library of History of Diodorus Siculus''. Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-88738-303-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|And 'tis said the stone was transported a great distance from Arabia, and that the edifices were raised by means of earthen ramps, since machines for lifting had not yet been invented in those days; and most surprising it is, that although such large structures were raised in an area surrounded by sand, no trace remains of either ramps or the dressing of the stones, so that it seems not the result of the patient labor of men, but rather as if the whole complex were set down entire upon the surrounding sand by some god. Now Egyptians try to make a marvel of these things, alleging that the ramps were made of salt and natron and that, when the river was turned against them, it melted them clean away and obliterated their every trace without the use of human labor. But in truth, it most certainly was not done this way! Rather, the same multitude of workmen who raised the mounds returned the entire mass again to its original place; for they say that three hundred and sixty thousand men were constantly employed in the prosecution of their work, yet the entire edifice was hardly finished at the end of twenty years.}}

Diodorus Siculus's description of the shipment of the stone from Arabia is correct since the term "Arabia" those days implied the land between the Nile and the Red Sea&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Strabo]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A3*.html#1.34.4 (17.1.34)].&lt;/ref&gt; where the limestone blocks have been transported from quarries across the river Nile. Both Herodotus's and Diodorus Siculus's writings are known to contain gross errors of fact, and Siculus is routinely accused of borrowing from Herodotus.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Herodotus's description of slave labor is one of the most persistent myths of the construction process.{{cn|date=April 2018}} However, these documents do give credit to both the levering and ramp methods.

===Different kinds of ramps===
[[File:Straight on ramps1a.jpg|thumb|Example of a large straight ramp]]
[[File:Other ramps1b.svg|thumb|From left to right: Zig-zagging ramp ([[:de:Uvo Hölscher (Ägyptologe)|Uvo Hölscher]]), ramp using the incomplete part of the superstructure ([[:de:Dieter Arnold|Dieter Arnold]]), and a spiraling ramp supported by the superstructure ([[Mark Lehner]])]]

Most Egyptologists acknowledge that ramps are the most tenable of the methods to raise the blocks, yet they acknowledge that it is an incomplete method that must be supplemented by another device. Archaeological evidence for the use of ramps has been found at the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]&lt;ref&gt;Hawass, Zahi. "Pyramid Construction. New Evidence Discovered at Giza." In Stationen. Beiträge zur Kulturgeschichte Ägyptens Rainer Stadelmann gewidmet, pp. 53–62. Edited by Heike Guksch and Daniel Polz. Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 1998.[http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf_library/hawass_fs_stadelmann.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and other pyramids. The method most accepted for assisting ramps is levering&lt;ref name="Lehner"&gt;Lehner, Mark 1997. The Complete Pyramids. Thames and Hudson. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (Lehner 1997: 222). The [[archaeological record]] gives evidence of only small ramps and inclined causeways, not something that could have been used to construct even a majority of the monument. To add to the uncertainty, there is considerable evidence demonstrating that non-standardized or ''[[ad hoc]]'' construction methods were used in pyramid construction (Arnold 1991: 98,&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;Arnold, Dieter. 1991. Building in Egypt: Pharonic Stone Masonry. Oxford University Press. New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Lehner 1997: 223).

Therefore, there are many proposed ramps and there is a considerable amount of discrepancy regarding what type of ramp was used to build the pyramids.&lt;ref name="ZahiRamp"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.zahihawass.com/egyptian_hist_dev_building.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214185450/http://www.zahihawass.com/egyptian_hist_dev_building.htm | archivedate=14 February 2009 | title = Building a Pyramid | accessdate = 9 November 2015 | last = Hawass | first = Zahi | authorlink = Zahi Hawass | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the widely discredited ramping methods is the large straight ramp, and it is routinely discredited on functional grounds for its massive size, lack of archaeological evidence, huge labor cost, and other problems (Arnold 1991: 99, Lehner 1997: 215, Isler 2001: 213&lt;ref name="Isler"&gt;Isler, Martin "On Pyramid Building II." in Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt. XXII: 95-112. 2001. Sticks, Stones, and Shadows: Building the Egyptian Pyramids. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman).&lt;/ref&gt;).

Other ramps serve to correct these problems of ramp size, yet either run into critiques of functionality and limited archaeological evidence. There are zig-zagging ramps, straight ramps using the incomplete part of the superstructure (Arnold 1991), spiraling ramps supported by the superstructure and spiraling ramps leaning on the monument as a large accretion are proposed. [[Mark Lehner]] speculated that a spiraling ramp, beginning in the stone [[quarry]] to the southeast and continuing around the exterior of the pyramid, may have been used. The stone blocks may have been drawn on sleds along the ramps lubricated by water or milk.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) ThinkQuest. [http://library.thinkquest.org/3708/pyramid.htm Cheops's Pyramid at Giza]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lever]]ing methods are considered to be the most tenable solution to complement ramping methods, partially due to Herodotus's description; and partially to the [[Shadoof]]; an irrigation device first depicted in Egypt during the New Kingdom, and found concomitantly with the Old Kingdom in Mesopotamia. In Lehner's (1997: 222) point of view, levers should be employed to lift the top 3% of the material of the superstructure. It is important to note that the top 4% of this material comprises {{1/3}} of the total height of the monument. In other words, in Lehner's view, levers should be employed to lift a small amount of material and a great deal of vertical height of the monument.

In the milieu of levering methods, there are those that lift the block incrementally, as in repeatedly prying up alternating sides of the block and inserting a wooden or stone shims to gradually move the stone up one course; and there are other methods that use a larger lever to move the block up one course in one lifting procedure. Since the discussion of construction techniques to lift the blocks attempts to resolve a gap in the archaeological and historical record with a plausible functional explanation, the following examples by Isler, Keable, and Hussey-Pailos&lt;ref name="Hussey"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=M.A. |last=Hussey-Pailos |first=Robert Scott |title=Construction of the Top of the Egyptian Pyramids: An Experimental Test of a Levering Device |url=http://plaza.ufl.edu/pailos/R_Hussey%20MA%20Thesis%202005.pdf |date=2005 |location=Gainesville, FL |publisher=University of Florida |df=dmy |access-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; list experimentally tested methods. Isler's method (1985, 1987) is an incremental method and, in the Nova experiment (1992), used wooden shims or cribbing. Isler&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/1915mpyramid.html|title=NOVA - Transcripts - This Old Pyramid - PBS|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was able to lift a block up one tier in approximately one hour and 30 minutes. Peter Hodges's and Julian Keable's&lt;ref name="Keable"&gt;Hodges, Peter. (Julian Keable ed.) 1989. How the Pyramids Were Built. Dotesios Printers Ltd. Trowbridge, Wiltshire.&lt;/ref&gt; method is similar to Isler's method and instead used small manufactured concrete blocks as shims, wooden pallets, and a pit where their experimental tests were performed. Keable was able to perform his method in approximately 2 minutes. Scott Hussey-Pailos's (2005) method&lt;ref name="Hussey" /&gt; uses a simple levering device to lift a block up a course in one movement. This method was tested with materials of less strength than historical analogs (tested with materials weaker than those available in ancient Egypt), a factor of safety of 2, and lifted a 2500-pound block up one course in under a minute. This method is presented as a levering device to work complementary with Mark Lehner's idea of a combined ramp and levering techniques.

===Jean-Pierre Houdin's "internal ramp" hypothesis===
{{Main|Jean-Pierre Houdin|Great Pyramid of Giza}}
Houdin's father was an architect who, in 1999, thought of a construction method that, it seemed to him, made more sense than any existing method proposed for building pyramids. To develop this hypothesis, Jean-Pierre Houdin, also an architect, gave up his job and set about drawing the first fully functional [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] architectural model of the Great Pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khufu.3ds.com/introduction/ Discover Jean-Pierre Houdin's Theory in Real-Time 3D] download, graphics card recommended. Dassault Systems. c.2002-2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His/their scheme involves using a regular external ramp to build the first 30% of the pyramid, with an "internal ramp" taking stones up beyond that height.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6514155.stm Mystery of Great Pyramid 'solved'] BBC. 31 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The stones of the external ramp are re-cycled into the upper stories, thus explaining the otherwise puzzling lack of evidence for ramps.

After 4 years working alone, Houdin was joined by a team of engineers from the French 3D software company [[Dassault Systemes]], who used the most modern [[computer-aided design]] technology available to further refine and test the hypothesis, making it (according to Houdin) the only one proven to be a viable technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aec.cadalyst.com/aec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=438895&amp;pageID=1&amp;sk=&amp;date= French architect Houdin turns the pyramid theory inside out] 2600 B.C. Lean Manufacturing (Tech Trends Feature) - Cadalyst AEC. 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Houdin announced it in a book: ''Khufu: The Secrets Behind the Building of the Great Pyramid'',&lt;ref&gt;''Khufu: The Secrets Behind the Building of the Great Pyramid'' by Jean-pierre Houdin, {{ISBN|978-977-17-3061-3}}, Farid Atiya Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 he and Egyptologist [[Bob Brier]] wrote a second one: ''The Secret of the Great Pyramid''&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret of the Great Pyramid: How One Man's Obsession Led to the Solution of Ancient Egypt's Greatest Mystery'' by Bob Brier &amp; Jean-pierre Houdin, {{ISBN|978-0-06-165552-4}} Collins 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Houdin's method, each ramp inside the pyramid ended at an open space, a notch temporarily left open in the edge of the construction.(see [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/images/081114-pyramid-room_big.jpg diagram]) This 10-square-meter clear space housed a crane that lifted and rotated each 2.5-ton block, to ready it for eight men to drag up the next internal ramp. There is a notch of sorts in one of the right places, and in 2008 Houdin's co-author Bob Brier, with a National Geographic film crew, entered a previously unremarked chamber that could be the start of one of these internal ramps.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Brier (2009) [http://archive.archaeology.org/0907/etc/khufu_pyramid.html "Update: Return to the Great Pyramid"] ''Archaeology'' 62(4): 27-29&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 a member of the French team (see below) saw a desert fox at this notch, rather as if it had ascended internally.

Houdin's thesis remains unproven and in 2007, UCL Egyptologist David Jeffreys described the internal spiral hypothesis as ''"far-fetched and horribly complicated"'', while Oxford University's [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]], declared he was ''"suspicious of any theory that seeks to explain only how the Great Pyramid was built"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/299582/Secrets+of+a+lost+world.htm Secrets of a lost world] The Engineer, 8 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Houdin has another hypothesis developed from his architectural model, one that could finally explain the internal "Grand Gallery" chamber that otherwise appears to have little purpose. He believes the gallery acted as a trolley chute/guide for counterbalance weights. It enabled the raising of the five 60-ton granite beams that roof the King's Chamber. Houdin and Brier and the Dassault team are already credited with proving for the first time that cracks in beams appeared during construction, were examined and tested at the time and declared relatively harmless.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

===Limestone concrete hypothesis===
[[Materials Science|Materials scientist]] [[Joseph Davidovits]] has [[Joseph Davidovits#Archaeological theories|claimed]] that the blocks of the pyramid are not carved stone, but mostly a form of [[limestone]] [[concrete]] and that they were "cast" as with modern concrete.&lt;ref&gt;M. W. Barsoum, A. Ganguly &amp; G. Hug, (2006), ''Microstructural Evidence of Reconstituted Limestone Blocks in the Great Pyramids of Egypt'', Journal of the American Ceramic Society 89 (12), 3788- 3796&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this hypothesis, soft limestone with a high [[kaolinite]] content was quarried in the [[wadi]] on the south of the Giza Plateau. The limestone was then dissolved in large, Nile-fed pools until it became a watery slurry. Lime (found in the ash of cooking fires) and [[natron]] (also used by the Egyptians in [[Mummy|mummification]]) were mixed in. The pools were then left to evaporate, leaving behind a moist, clay-like mixture. This wet "concrete" would be carried to the construction site where it would be packed into reusable wooden moulds and in a few days would undergo a chemical reaction similar to the curing of concrete. New blocks, he suggests, could be cast in place, on top of and pressed against the old blocks. Proof-of-concept tests using similar compounds were carried out at a [[geopolymer]] institute in northern France and it was found that a crew of five to ten, working with simple hand tools, could agglomerate a structure of five, 1.3 to 4.5 ton blocks in a couple of weeks.&lt;ref name=geopolymer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geopolymer.org/category/archaeology/pyramids/|title=Geopolymer Institute  » Pyramids|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims that the [[Famine Stela|Famine Stele]], along with other [[hieroglyphic]] texts, describe the technology of stone agglomeration.

Davidovits's method is not accepted by the academic mainstream. His method does not explain the granite stones, weighing well over 10 tons, above the King's Chamber, which he agrees were carved. Geologists have carefully scrutinized Davidovits's suggested technique and concluded his concrete came from natural limestone quarried in the Mokattam Formation.&lt;ref name="harrell"&gt;Harrell, James A. and Bret E. Penrod. 1993. "The Great Pyramid Debate -- Evidence from the Lauer Sample." Journal of Geological Education, vol. 41:358-363.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Davidovits alleges that the bulk of the soft limestone came from the same natural Mokkatam Formation quarries found by geologists, and insists that ancient Egyptians used the soft marly layer instead of the hard layer to re-agglomerate stones.

Davidovits's hypothesis gained support from Michel Barsoum, a materials science researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/1554-surprising-truth-great-pyramids-built.html|title=The Surprising Truth About How the Great Pyramids Were Built|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Barsoum and his colleagues at [[Drexel University]] published their findings supporting Davidovits's hypothesis in the ''Journal of the American Ceramic Society'' in 2006.  Using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]], they discovered in samples of the limestone pyramid blocks mineral compounds and air bubbles that do not occur in natural limestone.&lt;ref&gt;M.

===''NOVA'' pyramid building experiment===
In 1997, [[Mark Lehner]] and [[stonemason]] Roger Hopkins conducted a three-week pyramid-building experiment for a ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'' television episode. They built a pyramid {{convert|6|m|ft}} high by {{convert|9|m|ft}} wide, consisting of a total of {{convert|162|m3|ft3}}, or about 405 tons. It was made out of 186 stones weighing an average of 2.2 [[ton]]s each. Twelve quarrymen carved 186 stones in 22 days, and the structure was erected using 44 men. They used [[iron]] hammers, chisels and levers (this is a modern shortcut, as the ancient Egyptians were limited to using [[copper]] and later [[bronze]] and [[wood]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stocks|first=Denys|title=Experiments in Egyptian Archaeology: Stoneworking Technology in Ancient Egypt|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415306645|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Lehner and Hopkins did experiments with copper tools, noting that they were adequate for the job in hand, provided that additional manpower was available to constantly resharpen the ancient tools. They estimated they would have needed around 20 extra men for this maintenance. Another shortcut taken was the use of a [[front end loader|front-end loader]] or [[fork lift]] truck, but modern machinery was not used to finish the construction. They used levers to lift the capstone to a height of {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Four or five men were able to use levers on stones less than one ton to flip them over and transport them by rolling, but larger stones had to be towed. Lehner and Hopkins found that by putting the stones on wooden sledges and sliding the sledges on wooden tracks, they were able to tow a two-ton stone with 12 to 20 men. The wood for these sledges and tracks would have to have been imported from [[Lebanon]] at great cost since there was little, if any, wood in ancient Egypt. While the builders failed to duplicate the precise jointing created by the ancient Egyptians, Hopkins was confident that this could have been achieved with more practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/1915mpyramid.html "This Old Pyramid" (one hour version)] PBS Airdate: 4 February 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Mark.

==Great Pyramid==
{{see|The diary of Merer}}
Some research suggests alternate estimates to the accepted workforce size. For instance, [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[Kurt Mendelssohn]] calculated that the workforce may have been 50,000 men at most, while [[Ludwig Borchardt]] and [[Louis Croon]] placed the number at 36,000. According to [[Miroslav Verner]], a workforce of no more than 30,000 was needed in the Great Pyramid's construction. Evidence suggests that around 5,000 were permanent workers on salaries with the balance working three- or four-month shifts in lieu of taxes while receiving subsistence "wages" of ten loaves of bread and a jug of beer per day. [[Zahi Hawass]] believes that the majority of workers may have been volunteers.  It is estimated that only 4,000 of the total workforce were labourers who quarried the stone, hauled blocks to the pyramid and set the blocks in place. The vast majority of the workforce provided support services such as scribes, toolmakers and other backup services. The tombs of supervisors contain inscriptions regarding the organisation of the workforce. There were two crews of approximately 2,000 workers sub-divided into named gangs of 1,000. The gangs were divided into five phyles of 200 which were in turn split into groups of around 20 workers grouped according to their skills, with each group having their own project leader and a specific task.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joyce Tyldesley]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/pyramid_builders_01.shtml The Private Lives of the Pyramid-builders] [[BBC]] 17 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Great Pyramid tombs unearth 'proof' workers were not slaves |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/11/great-pyramid-tombs-slaves-egypt |date=11 January 2010 |agency=Associate Press |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A construction management study carried out by the firm Daniel, Mann, Johnson, &amp; Mendenhall in association with [[Mark Lehner]], and other Egyptologists, estimates that the total project required an average workforce of 14,567 people and a peak workforce of 40,000. Without the use of pulleys, wheels, or iron tools, they used [[critical path analysis]] to suggest the Great Pyramid was completed from start to finish in approximately 10 years.&lt;ref name="civilengineer"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Program Management B.C. | first=Craig B. | last=Smith | magazine=Civil Engineering| date=June 1999 | url=http://www.pubs.asce.org/ceonline/0699feat.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608101037/http://www.pubs.asce.org/ceonline/0699feat.html | archivedate=8 June 2007 | accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study estimates the number of blocks used in construction was between 2 and 2.8 million (an average of 2.4 million), but settles on a reduced finished total of 2 million after subtracting the estimated volume of the hollow spaces of the chambers and galleries.&lt;ref name="civilengineer"/&gt; Most sources agree on this number of blocks somewhere above 2.3 million.&lt;ref name="Nova Online"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Khufu's Inside Story | work = Nova online | publisher = PBS.org | year=  1997 | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pyramid/explore/khufustory.html | accessdate = 13 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their calculations suggest the workforce could have sustained a rate of 180 blocks per hour (3 blocks/minute) with ten-hour work days for putting each individual block in place. They derived these estimates from modern third-world construction projects that did not use modern machinery, but conclude it is still unknown exactly how the Great Pyramid was built.&lt;ref name="civilengineer"/&gt; As Dr. Craig Smith of the team points out:
{{blockquote|The logistics of construction at the Giza site are staggering when you think that the ancient Egyptians had no pulleys, no wheels, and no iron tools. Yet, the dimensions of the pyramid are extremely accurate and the site was leveled within a fraction of an inch over the entire 13.1-acre base. This is comparable to the accuracy possible with modern construction methods and laser leveling. That's astounding. With their 'rudimentary tools,' the pyramid builders of ancient Egypt were about as accurate as we are today with 20th-century technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DMJM Solves the Riddle of the Sphinx...Okay, Well, Its Neighbor; Global Architecture/Engineering Firm Uses Technology to Solve 4,500-Year-Old Mystery |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DMJM+Solves+the+Riddle+of+the+Sphinx...Okay,+Well,+Its+Neighbor%3B...-a053718895 |date=5 February 1999 |website=[[TheFreeDictionary.com#TheFreeLibrary.com|The Free Library]] |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Great Pyramid of Giza edge.jpg|thumb|Average core blocks of the Great Pyramid weigh about 1.5 tons each, and the granite blocks used to roof the burial chambers are estimated to weigh up to 80 tons each.]]
The entire [[Giza Plateau]] is believed to have been constructed over the reign of five pharaohs in less than a hundred years, which generally includes: the Great Pyramid, Khafre and Menkaure's pyramids, the Great Sphinx, the Sphinx and Valley Temples, 35 boat pits cut out of solid bedrock, and several causeways, as well as paving nearly the entire plateau with large stones. This does not include Khafre's brother Djedefre's northern pyramid, Abu Rawash, which would have also been built during this time frame of 100 years. In the hundred years prior to Giza—beginning with [[Djoser]], who ruled from 2687–2667 BC, and amongst dozens of other temples, smaller pyramids, and general construction projects—four other massive pyramids were built: the [[Pyramid of Djoser|Step pyramid]] of Saqqara (believed to be the first Egyptian pyramid), the pyramid of [[Meidum]], the [[Bent Pyramid]], and the [[Red Pyramid]]. Also during this period (between 2686 and 2498 BC) the [[Sadd el-Kafara]] dam, which used an estimated 100,000 cubic meters of rock and rubble, was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kamil |first=Jill |title=The World's Oldest Dam |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/708/he1.htm |date=16–22 September 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917193154/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/708/he1.htm |archive-date=17 September 2004 |issue=708 |newspaper=[[Al Ahram]] |access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, a team of archaeologists from the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale]] and [[University of Liverpool]] had announced the discovery of the remains of a 4,500-year-old ramp contraption at [[Hatnub]], excavated since 2012. This method which aided in lifting the heavy alabaster stones up from their quarries, may have been used to build Egypt's Great Pyramid as well.&lt;ref name="livescience"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/63978-great-pyramid-ramp-discovered.html|title=This 4,500-Year-Old Ramp Contraption May Have Been Used to Build Egypt's Great Pyramid|work=Live Science|date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yannis Gourdon, co-director of the joint mission at Hatnub, said:&lt;ref name="livescience"/&gt;

{{quote|text=This system is composed of a central ramp flanked by two staircases with numerous post holes, using a sled which carried a stone block and was attached with ropes to these wooden posts, ancient Egyptians were able to pull up the alabaster blocks out of the quarry on very steep slopes of 20 percent or more ... As this system dates back at least to [[Khufu]]'s reign, that means that during the time of Khufu, ancient Egyptians knew how to move huge blocks of stone using very steep slopes. Therefore, they could have used it for the construction [of] his pyramid.}}

[[File:Luckofedenhall.jpg|thumb|The [[Luck of Edenhall]], a 13th century enamelled glass cup made in Syria or Egypt]]

'''Enamelled glass''' is glass which has been decorated with [[vitreous enamel]] (powdered glass, possibly mixed with a binder) and then fired to [[glass fusing|fuse]] the glasses. It can produce brilliant and long-lasting colours, and be transparent, translucent or opaque.  Generally the desired colours only appear when the piece is fired, adding to the artist's difficulties.

It is similar to [[vitreous enamel]] on metal surfaces, but the supporting surface is glass.  It is also close to "enamelled" [[overglaze]] decoration on pottery, especially on [[porcelain]], and it is thought likely that the technique passed from metal to glass (probably in the Islamic world), and then in the Renaissance from glass to pottery (perhaps in [[Bohemia]] or Germany).

==Techniques==
[[File:WLA lacma Central Germany mug with Arms Roman Empire.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Reichsadlerhumpen]]'', a glass with the double-headed eagle of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and the arms of the various territories on its wings, was a popular showpiece of enamelled glas in the German lands from the 16th century on.]]
[[File:Japanese cloisonne type Musen shippo.jpg|thumb|Japanese enamel made using the [[Ando_Cloisonné_Company#Types|musen shippō (無線七宝)]] technique; wire is used to locate the glass, but then removed before firing.]]

Glass may be enamelled by sprinkling a loose powder on a flat surface, painting or printing a slurry, or painting or stamping a binder and then sprinkling it with powder, which will adhere.&lt;ref name="glass-fusing-made-easy.com"/&gt; As with enamel on metal, [[gum tragacanth]] may be used to make sharp edges.

Some modern techniques are much simpler than historic ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmog.org/video/learn-about-glass-enameling|title=All About Glass - Corning Museum of Glass|website=www.cmog.org|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, there now exist glass enamel pens.&lt;ref&gt;http://images.delphiglass.com/assets/Free%20EBook%20-221524.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Enamelled glass is often used in combination with gilding. [[Mica]] may also be added for sparkle.&lt;ref name="glass-fusing-made-easy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glass-fusing-made-easy.com/how-to-enamel.html|title=How to Enamel|website=glass-fusing-made-easy.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enamelled [[Venetian glass]] was called ''smalto''.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Uses==
[[Mosque lamp]]s are made of enamelled glass. They generally have lugs, from which they are suspended to light not only mosques, but also similar spaces such as madrassas and mausoleums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mia.org.qa/en/collections/glass/lamp|title=Mosque Lamp|first=Super|last=User|website=www.mia.org.qa|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a religious symbolism based on the Quranic [[verse of light]], with which they are often calligraphed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacecollection.org/whatson/treasure/38|title=The Wallace Collection - What's On - Treasure of the Month|first=The Wallace|last=Collection|website=www.wallacecollection.org|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the European Renaissance, expensive enamelled goblets were used as courtship and marriage gifts. These goblets were rarely used, and some have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O987/goblet-unknown/|title=Goblet - V&amp;A Search the Collections|website=collections.vam.ac.uk|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass painting involves painting on glass, with glass, making the finished work transparent.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Glass fusing is similar, but powders are not mixed into a paintable paste first; however, the result is similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glassenamels.co.uk/pages/glass-fusing-classes|title=Glass Fusing Classes|website=glassenamels|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== History ==

Envision was founded by Lei Zhang in 2007 in [[Jiangyin]], [[Jiangsu Province|Jiangsu]] in the east region of China. Zhang was named Top 10 Chinese innovators in 2014 by [[China Daily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Chinese innovators in 2014|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2015-02/25/content_19652935_9.htm|publisher=[[China Daily]]|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company started full operations since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20131231/104011.shtml |title=Zhang Lei: Chasing the wind|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=Dec 31, 2013|website=[[China Network Television]]|access-date=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fault-tolerant computer systems''' are systems designed around the concepts of [[fault tolerance]]. In essence, they must be able to continue working to a level of satisfaction in the presence of errors or breakdowns.

Fault tolerance is not just a property of individual machines; it may also characterise the rules by which they interact. For example, the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is designed to allow reliable two-way communication in a [[packet-switched network]], even in the presence of communications links which are imperfect or overloaded. It does this by requiring the endpoints of the communication to ''expect'' packet loss, duplication, reordering and corruption, so that these conditions do not damage data integrity, and only reduce throughput by a proportional amount.

Recovery from errors in fault-tolerant systems can be characterised as either 'roll-forward' or 'roll-back'. When the system detects that it has made an error, roll-forward recovery takes the system state at that time and corrects it, to be able to move forward. Roll-back recovery reverts the system state back to some earlier, correct version, for example using [[checkpointing]], and moves forward from there. Roll-back recovery requires that the operations between the checkpoint and the detected erroneous state can be made [[Idempotence (computer science)|idempotent]]. Some systems make use of both roll-forward and roll-back recovery for different errors or different parts of one error.

== Types of fault tolerance ==
Most fault-tolerant [[computer systems]] are designed to handle several possible failures, including hardware-related faults such as [[hard disk]] failures, [[Input device|input]] or [[output device]] failures, or other temporary or permanent failures; [[software bug]]s and errors; interface errors between the hardware and software, including [[Device driver|driver]] failures; operator errors, such as erroneous keystrokes, bad command sequences or installing unexpected software and physical damage or other flaws introduced to the system from an outside source.&lt;ref&gt;Fault-tolerant computer system design  book contents. Dhiraj K. Pradhan, Pages: 135 – 138 1996 {{ISBN|0-13-057887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardware fault-tolerance is the most common application of these systems, designed to prevent failures due to hardware components. Most basically, this is provided by [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]], particularly [[dual modular redundancy]]. Typically, components have multiple backups and are separated into smaller "segments" that act to contain a fault, and extra redundancy is built into all physical connectors, power supplies, fans, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Formal Techniques in Real-Time and Fault-Tolerant Systems: Second International Symposium, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, January 8–10, 1992, Proceedings

Contributor Jan Vytopil, Published by Springer, 1991, {{ISBN|3-540-55092-5}}, 978-3-540-55092-1
&lt;/ref&gt; There are special software and instrumentation packages designed to detect failures, such as fault masking, which is a way to ignore faults by seamlessly preparing a backup component to execute something as soon as the instruction is sent, using a sort of voting protocol where if the main and backups don't give the same results, the flawed output is ignored.

Software fault-tolerance is based more around nullifying programming errors using real-time redundancy, or static "emergency" subprograms to fill in for programs that crash. There are many ways to conduct such fault-regulation, depending on the application and the available hardware.&lt;ref&gt;Fault-tolerant computer system design  book contents. Dhiraj K. Pradhan, Pages: 221 – 235 1996 {{ISBN|0-13-057887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first known fault-tolerant computer was [[SAPO (computer)|SAPO]], built in 1951 in [[Czechoslovakia]] by [[Antonín Svoboda (computer scientist)|Antonín Svoboda]].&lt;ref name="computer-structures"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/bell_gordon/bell.computer_structures_principles_and_examples.1982.102630397.pdf|title=Computer Structures: Principles and Examples|author1=Daniel P. Siewiorek|author2=C. Gordon Bell|author3=Allen Newell|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=1982|isbn=0-07-057302-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} Its basic design was [[Drum memory|magnetic drums]] connected via relays, with a voting method of [[RAM parity|memory error]] detection ([[triple modular redundancy]]). Several other machines were developed along this line, mostly for military use. Eventually, they separated into three distinct categories: machines that would last a long time without any maintenance, such as the ones used on [[NASA]] [[space probe]]s and [[satellites]]; computers that were very dependable but required constant monitoring, such as those used to monitor and control [[nuclear power plants]] or [[Collider|supercollider]] experiments; and finally, computers with a high amount of runtime which would be under heavy use, such as many of the supercomputers used by [[insurance companies]] for their [[probability]] monitoring.

Most of the development in the so-called LLNM (Long Life, No Maintenance) computing was done by NASA during the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/ftcsh/1995/7150/00/00532604.pdf|title=The STAR (Self-Testing And Repairing) Computer: An Investigation Of the Theory and Practice Of Fault-tolerant Computer Design|author1=Algirdas Avižienis|author2=George C. Gilley|author3=Francis P. Mathur|author4=David A. Rennels|author5=John A. Rohr|author6=David K. Rubin}}&lt;/ref&gt; in preparation for [[Project Apollo]] and other research aspects. NASA's first machine went into a [[space observatory]], and their second attempt, the JSTAR computer, was used in [[Voyager program|Voyager]]. This computer had a backup of memory arrays to use memory recovery methods and thus it was called the JPL Self-Testing-And-Repairing computer. It could detect its own errors and fix them or bring up redundant modules as needed. The computer is still working today{{when?|date=February 2017}}.

Hyper-dependable computers were pioneered mostly by [[aircraft]] manufacturers,&lt;ref name="computer-structures"/&gt;{{rp|210}} [[nuclear power]] companies, and the [[rail transport in the United States|railroad industry]] in the USA. These needed computers with massive amounts of uptime that would [[Graceful failure|fail gracefully]] enough with a fault to allow continued operation, while relying on the fact that the computer output would be constantly monitored by humans to detect faults. Again, IBM developed the first computer of this kind for NASA for guidance of [[Saturn V]] rockets, but later on [[BNSF]], [[Unisys]], and [[General Electric]] built their own.&lt;ref name="computer-structures"/&gt;{{rp|223}}

The 1970 [[F14 CADC]] had [[built-in self-test]] and redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;
Ray Holt.
[http://www.firstmicroprocessor.com/documents/lsistate-97.pdf "The F14A Central Air Data Computer, and the LSI Technology State-of-the-Art in 1968"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the early efforts at fault-tolerant designs were focused mainly on internal diagnosis, where a fault would indicate something was failing and a worker could replace it. SAPO, for instance, had a method by which faulty memory drums would emit a noise before failure.&lt;ref&gt;Fault tolerant computing in computer design
Neilforoshan, M.R
Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges archive
Volume 18 ,  Issue 4  (April 2003) Pages: 213 – 220, {{ISSN|1937-4771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later efforts showed that, to be fully effective, the system had to be self-repairing and diagnosing – isolating a fault and then implementing a redundant backup while alerting a need for repair. This is known as N-model redundancy, where faults cause automatic fail safes and a warning to the operator, and it is still the most common form of level one fault-tolerant design in use today.

Voting was another initial method, as discussed above, with multiple redundant backups operating constantly and checking each other's results, with the outcome that if, for example, four components reported an answer of 5 and one component reported an answer of 6, the other four would "vote" that the fifth component was faulty and have it taken out of service. This is called M out of N majority voting.

Historically, motion has always been to move further from N-model and more to M out of N due to the fact that the complexity of systems and the difficulty of ensuring the transitive state from fault-negative to fault-positive did not disrupt operations.

[[Tandem Computers|Tandem]] and [[Stratus Technologies|Stratus]] were among the first companies specializing in the design of fault-tolerant computer systems for [[online transaction processing]].

==Fault tolerance verification and validation==
The most important requirement of design in a [[Fault-tolerant design|fault tolerant]] computer system is making sure it actually meets its requirements for reliability. This is done by using various failure models to simulate various failures, and analyzing how well the system reacts. These [[statistical models]] are very complex, involving probability curves and specific fault rates, [[latency (engineering)|latency]] curves, error rates, and the like. The most commonly used models are HARP, SAVE, and SHARPE in the USA, and SURF or LASS in Europe.

== Fault tolerance research ==
Research into the kinds of tolerances needed for critical systems involves a large amount of interdisciplinary work. The more complex the system, the more carefully all possible interactions have to be considered and prepared for. Considering the importance of high-value systems in transport, [[public utilities]] and the military, the field of topics that touch on research is very wide: it can include such obvious subjects as [[software modeling]] and reliability, or [[hardware design]], to arcane elements such as [[stochastic]] models, [[graph theory]], formal or exclusionary logic, [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]], remote [[data transmission]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;

===Failure-oblivious computing===
''Failure-oblivious computing'' is a technique that enables [[computer programs]] to continue executing despite [[computer memory|memory]] [[data loss|errors]].  The technique handles attempts to read invalid memory by returning a manufactured value to the program, which in turn, makes use of the manufactured value and ignores the former [[computer memory|memory]] value it tried to access.  This is a great contrast to [[RAM parity|typical memory checkers]], which inform the program of the error or abort the program.

===Recovery shepherding===
Recovery shepherding is a lightweight technique to enable software programs to recover from otherwise fatal errors such as null pointer dereference and divide by zero.&lt;ref name=rcv&gt;{{cite book

It uses the [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] [[instrumentation (computer programming)|binary instrumentation]] framework [[Pin (computer program)|Pin]]. It attaches to the application process when an error occurs, repairs the execution, 
tracks the repair effects as the execution continues, contains the repair effects within the application process, and detaches from the process after all repair effects are flushed 
from the process state. It does not interfere with the normal execution of the program and therefore incurs negligible overhead.&lt;ref name=rcv/&gt; For 17 of 18 systematically collected real world null-dereference and divide-by-zero errors, a prototype implementation enables the application to continue to execute to provide acceptable output and service to its users on the error-triggering inputs.&lt;ref name=rcv/&gt;

'''GOG.com''' (formerly '''Good Old Games''') is a [[digital distribution]] platform for [[video game]]s and films. It is operated by GOG [[Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością|Sp. z o.o.]], a wholly owned subsidiary of [[CD Projekt]] based in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003539989-Company-Reorganisation|title=Company reorganisation|website=GOG.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021140933/https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003539989-Company-Reorganisation|archive-date=21 October 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shape your career with GOG.com|url=http://www.gog.com/work#gog_mentality|work=GOG.com|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOG.com delivers [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]]-free video games through its digital platform for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]].

== History ==

=== Launch of Good Old Games ===
Poland, where [[CD Projekt]] and Good Old Games were founded, had previously been under [[Communism|Communist]] rule but in 1990, the old government had fallen in favor of a more democratic government which spurred economic growth. While under Communism, copyright laws in Poland were virtually non-existent and unenforceable, and copyright infringement, in the form of piracy by stripping out any [[digital rights management]] (DRM), was rampant across electronic media. The consumer perception of copyright in Poland remained the same after the change of government, making it difficult for legitimate sales of electronic media; pirated and bootlegged versions were sold in open markets next to boxed copies of the legitimate productions for a fraction of the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/322696/How_piracy_led_to_GOG_encouraging_DRMfree_releases_.php | title = How piracy lead to GOG encouraging DRM free releases | first = Emma | last = Kidwell | date = July 23, 2018 | accessdate = July 23, 2018  |work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CD Projekt was founded by Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński in 1994 for the purposes to trying to bring legitimate sales of foreign game titles into Poland, knowing they would have no easy way to compete against pirated copies. They would obtain import rights from foreign publishers, and where possible, provide in-game localization for text and voice lines, typically through [[reverse engineering]] to decompile the game's code. They would then package the game with localized instruction manuals and other physical goodies, hoping that the added features would draw buyers away from pirated copies.&lt;ref name="noclip"&gt;{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffngZOB1U2A | title = GOG: Preserving Gaming's Past &amp; Future | publisher = [[Danny O'Dwyer|Noclip]] | date = July 23, 2018 | accessdate = July 25, 2018 | via = [[YouTube]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurog_cdprojekt_history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-06-seeing-red-the-story-of-cd-projekt | title=Seeing Red: The story of CD Projekt | work=[[Eurogamer]] | publisher=Gamer Network | first=Robert | last=Purchese | date=17 May 2015 | accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first major success was with ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' (1998) which with they had 18,000 units sold on its first day of release in Poland.&lt;ref name="eurog_cdprojekt_history"/&gt; Due to this success, [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]], the publisher of ''Baldur's Gate'', asked CD Projekt if they could do a similar treatment to ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]'', a console title released in 2001. As their past work had been strictly on personal computers, the company accepted to try to port it, but the project fell through before it was completed. However, as a result, CD Projekt realized they had the ability to make their own games, and moved into games development. This eventually proved fruitful, as it ultimately landed the company with rights to ''[[The Witcher]]'' video game series. The company's interest in game distribution has declined since then.&lt;ref name="eurog_cdprojekt_history"/&gt;

Digital distribution grew in the 2000s, along with the use of DRM to control access to games, which raised some resentment with players. CD Projekt saw potential to look back at their distribution days to offer DRM-free versions of classic games through digital distribution, using their past experience in reverse engineering to make the games work on modern platforms and provide a wide array of localization options. In this manner, they would have a reason to draw players to buy their product instead of simply downloading it for free from pirate game websites and services.&lt;ref name="noclip"/&gt; They founded a new [[subsidiary]], Good Old Games, to serve this purpose in early 2008.&lt;ref name="eurog_cdprojekt_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gspot_gog_six"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-celebrates-six-years-of-advancing-the-drm-free/1100-6422150/ | title=GOG Celebrates Six Years of Advancing the "DRM-Free Movement" | work=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | first=Eddie | last=Makuch | date=8 September 2014 | accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first challenge was to find a publisher that would be willing to work with them; they spoke to several who were generally unaware of CD Projekt; their first big break was from Interplay, who knew of the company's past work, and allowed them to offer their games on the service.&lt;ref name="noclip"/&gt; After some time, Good Old Games was approached by [[Ubisoft]], who were interested in selling their older titles through the service as well.&lt;ref name="noclip"/&gt; Once Ubisoft was signed, it became easier for Good Old Games to convince other publishers to allow them to offer older titles on the service.&lt;ref name="noclip"/&gt;

=== Marketing stunt and relaunch ===
During a period of days from 19 to 22 September 2010, the GOG.com website was disabled, leaving behind messages on the web site and their [[Twitter]] accounts that the site had been closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/5642141/what-happened-to-good-old-games | title = What's Happening With Good Old Games? | first =Owen | last = Good | date = 19 September 2010 | accessdate = 19 September 2010 | publisher = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Good Old Games reiterated that the site was not being shut down, and confirmed news would be forthcoming about changes to the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/news/good-old-games-not-shutting-down | title = Good Old Games Undergoing Changes But Not Shutting Down | first = Chris | last = Pereira | date = 20 September 2010 | accessdate = 20 September 2010 | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121016091211/http://www.1up.com/news/good-old-games-not-shutting-down | archivedate = 16 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A clarification posted on the site on 20 September 2010 said they had to shut down the site temporarily "due to business and technical reasons", with industry journalists believing the shutdown may be related to the nature of [[digital rights management|DRM]]-free strategy, based on Twitter messages from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/30505/Reboot_For_DRMFree_PC_Game_Download_Service_GOGcom.php | title = Reboot For DRM-Free PC Game Download Service GOG.com? | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | first= Kris | last = Graft | date = 20 September 2010 | accessdate = 20 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September 2010, GOG.com revealed that this shutdown was a marketing hoax as part of the site coming out of beta.&lt;ref name="pcgamer gog"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/09/22/gog-com-apologise-for-hoax-closure/ | title = GOG hoax: "we could not miss a chance to generate some buzz" | first= Graham | last = Smith |date = 22 September 2010 | accessdate = 22 September 2010 | work = [[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2010/09/22/gog-relaunches-admits-closure-was-a-hoax/1 | title = GOG relaunches, admits closure was a hoax | work = bitgamer.net | first = Joe | last = Martin | date=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's management, aware of the reactions to the fake closure, stated: "First of all we'd like to apologize to everyone who felt deceived or harmed in any way by the closedown of GOG.com. As a small company we don't have a huge marketing budget and this is why we could not miss a chance to generate some buzz around an event as big as launching a brand new version of our website and even more important, bringing back ''Baldur's Gate'' to life!"&lt;ref name="pcgamer gog"/&gt;

The site returned on 23 September 2010, with an improved storefront and additional benefits, as outlined during a webcast presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/22/good-old-games-gets-new-relaunches/#more-39792 | title = Good Old Games Gets New, Relaunches| first= John | last = Walker | date = 22 September 2010 | accessdate= 22 September 2010 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the presentation, GOG.com's co-founder Marcin Iwinski and managing director Guillaume Rambourg had dressed as [[monk]]s to atone for their sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/30541/Monks_Confirm_Good_Old_Games_PR_Stunt_Site_Relaunch.php | title = 'Monks' Confirm Good Old Games PR Stunt, Site Relaunch | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 22 September 2010 | accessdate = 22 September 2010 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaunch of the site was considered by Rambourg to have been successful, having brought new customers that were previously unaware of GOG.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/30608/InDepth_GOGs_Monk_Fiasco_And_The_Fight_For_Publicity.php | title = In-Depth: GOG's Monk Fiasco And The Fight For Publicity | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 24 September 2010 | accessdate= 24 September 2010 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As promised after its relaunch, GOG.com was able to offer several [[Black Isle Studios]] games such as ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'', ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' and ''[[Icewind Dale]]'' which have previously been unreleased through any download service due to legal issues about the ownership of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''-related games between [[Atari]], [[Hasbro]], and other companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26559 | title=Hasbro Files Suit Against Atari Over Dungeons &amp; Dragons Deal | first= Kris | last = Graft | date =19 December 2009 | accessdate = 28 September 2010 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-09-28-planescape-torment-re-released-at-last | title= Planescape: Torment re-released at last | first = Robert | last = Purchase | date =28 September 2010 | accessdate = 28 September 2010 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2012, Good Old Games announced that it was branching out to feature "AAA" and independent titles in addition to older games. The site was rebranded to GOG.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gog.com/news/bigger_fresher_newer_see_whats_new_on_gogcom | title=Bigger. Fresher. Newer. See what's new on GOG.com | date = 27 March 2012 | accessdate = 26 June 2018 | publisher = GOG.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== OS X and Linux support ===
In October 2012, GOG.com was announced to be bringing DRM-free games to [[OS X]]. This included the previously Steam exclusive (OS X version) ''The Witcher'' and ''The Witcher 2'', both made by CD Projekt Red. GOG.com gathered user feedback in a community wishlist, and one of the most demanded feature requests was support for native Linux games, which gathered close to 15,000 votes before it was marked as "in progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gog.com/wishlist/site/add_linux_versions_of_games | title= Add Linux versions of games - GOG.com | date =March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally GOG.com representatives said, that there are technical and operational issues which make it harder than it seems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://linuxgamecast.com/2012/10/good-old-games-no-linux-for-you/ | title=GOG.com (Good Old Games): No Linux For You! | date=16 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however it's something they would love to do, and they have been looking at.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/10/24/cd-projekt-red-interview-cyberpunk-2077-witcher-2-piracy-windows-8-and-more | title=GOG.com on Windows 8, Mac gaming, and Linux support | date =24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March 2014, GOG.com officially announced that they would be adding support for Linux, initially targeting [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and [[Linux Mint]] in the fall of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/news/gogcom_soon_on_more_platforms |title=GOG.com Soon On More Platforms |date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 2014, Linux support was released early, and 50 games were released compatible with the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gog.com/news/gogcom_now_supports_linux |title=GOG.com Now Supports Linux! | date =25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the launch titles included games that were newly compatible with Linux, while most of the games already supported downloads made for the operating system on other distribution platforms.

=== Expansion to DRM-free video ===
On 27 August 2014 GOG.com announced the launch of the new addition to their service – distribution of DRM-free films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gog.com/news/introducing_gogcom_drmfree_movies|title=Introducing GOG.com DRM-Free Movies | date =27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOG.com offers DRM-free downloading in [[mp4]] format and streaming of video in standard and DRM-free HTML fashion which doesn't bind users to any specific platforms or devices. The movies are made available in Full HD 1080p, 720p and 576p for limited bandwidth or download quotas; however, a few titles do not have the Full HD 1080p format available. GOG.com started with adding 21 documentaries about Internet culture and gaming. They also have plans for adding fiction films and series; according to GOG.com's managing director Guillaume Rambourg, they were in talks with many major studios. While studios' representatives liked the idea, they also were reluctant to let go of their current DRM approach until some other major studio would make the first step. Still GOG.com plan to work on overcoming the initial reluctance and moving DRM-free video forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gog.com/forum/general/introducing_gogcom_drmfree_movies/post499 |title=GOG.com forum: Cause there's no business like show-business! | date =1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policies ===
On 9 December 2013, GOG.com introduced a [[money-back guarantee]] for the first 30 days if a customer faces unresolvable technical problems with a bought game.&lt;ref name="30days"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/12/10/good-guy-gog-online-games-merchant-offers-money-back-guarantee/|work=[[Forbes]] |title=Good Guy GOG?

=== FCK DRM Initiative ===
In August 2018, GOG created an [[Digital rights management|anti-DRM]] program called "FCK DRM".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nichegamer.com/2018/08/21/gog-announces-new-fck-drm-initiative/|title= GOG Announces New “FCK DRM” Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homepage of the initiative offers links to the websites of [[Defective by Design]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], [[Bandcamp]], [[itch.io]], [[Wikisource]], [[Project Gutenberg]] and other projects that promote [[Free culture movement|free culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fckdrm.com/|title=FCK DRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==
GOG.com works to offer older games as well as new releases to users, with the product lacking any type of [[digital rights management]] to give consumers the ability to install the game anywhere and as many times as they want.

Prior to any development work to bring an older game for use on modern computers, legal experts within GOG.com need to track down all ownership rights to games and make sure that all necessary parties agree to their redistribution. This can be difficult for many games of the late 1990s and early 2000s, where very few publishers and developers kept digital records of their legal documentation, and there were large numbers of acquisitions and dissolutions that make tracking down rights difficult and take years to complete. One difficult case was acquiring the rights for the [[Strategic Simulations]] "[[Gold Box]]" series games, due to the number of acquisitions that Strategic Simulations went through since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="noclip"/&gt; GOG.com offers users a means to request back-catalog games they would like to see, and the company uses this list to identify games that may require more extensive licensing research. Some of this work has been done in coordination with [[Nightdive Studios]], who were able to find and acquire the rights to ''[[System Shock 2]]'', one of the most requested games at GOG.com for years, and have since found and relicensed other older games thought lost to licensing issues.&lt;ref name="Many Questions"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/13/many-questions-system-shock-2-comes-to-gog/ | title = Many Questions: System Shock 2 Comes To GOG | last = Smith | first = Adam | date = February 13, 2013 | website = [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] | publisher = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] | access-date = September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure [[Software incompatibility|compatibility]] with newer versions of [[operating system]]s and current PC hardware, games are [[Patch (computing)|pre-patched]] and restored by GOG.com. Whenever possible, GOG.com attempts to acquire the game's original [[source code]], which can prove as difficult as determining the legal rights to games.&lt;ref name="noclip"/&gt; From this, they can work to make the game compatible with modern and future hardware, directly apply [[Patch (computing)|compatibility fixes]], and sometimes incorporate well-established [[community-made patch]]es from a game's fan-community.&lt;ref name=polygon2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/21/5913763/gog-com-back-catalog-new-releases |title=Nostalgia is a powerful drug: How GoG.com is growing beyond a back catalog |first=Charlie |last=Hall |date=14 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014 |publisher=[[Polygon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also will seek external help with some of the code issues, approaching developers that may have previously worked on the title for assistance. They may also need to [[reverse engineer]] the game's code if it is not available.&lt;ref name="noclip"/&gt; In cases where it is impossible to recode the game, they will instead package the game with [[open source|open-source]] [[Emulator|emulation]] or compatibility software, such as [[ScummVM]] and [[DOSBox]]&lt;ref name="gogrestoration"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/09/16/how-gog-com-save-and-restore-classic-videogames/|title = How GOG.com Save And Restore Classic Videogames|first = Tom|last = Bennet|date = 16 September 2015|accessdate = 22 January 2016|publisher = rockpapershotgun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For newer titles, particularly for [[independent video game development|indie games]], GOG.com offers the ability to publish their games on the site starting 2013. GOG.com offers indie developers a typical 70/30 split on revenue (with GOG.com taking 30% of the sale), as well as an option for an upfront payment to the developer, with then GOG.com taking 40% of the sales until the upfront payment has been covered, reverting the cost back to 30%. Such games are still distributed DRM-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/20/gog-com-launches-indie-game-portal-that-could-compete-with-the-m/ | title=  GOG.com launches indie game portal that could compete with the Mac App Store | first = Mike | last =Wehner | date = August 20, 2013 | accessdate = July 25, 2018 | work = [[Engadget]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publishing agreements ===
On 26 March 2009, GOG.com announced it had signed a deal with [[Ubisoft]] to publish games from their back catalogue; this was the first deal with a major publisher to offer DRM-free downloads. The deal to publish through GOG.com also included games that were not available through any other online distribution channel. On 5 September 2014, GOG.com started to sell [[Amiga]] games from [[Cinemaware]]'s catalogue, starting with [[Defender of the Crown]].&lt;ref name="GOGAmigagames"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/read/cinemaware-announces-one-of-a-kind-amiga-pc-distribution-agreement-with-gog-com/0137975 |title=Cinemaware announces one-of-a-kind Amiga &amp; PC distribution agreement with GOG.com |publisher=mcvuk.com |author=Games Press |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was technically made possible through Cinemaware's own written [[emulator]] called "Rocklobster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indieretronews.com/2014/09/defender-of-crown-one-of-cinemawares.html |title=Defender of the Crown – One of Cinemaware's greatest games is now on GOG! |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=9 November 2014 |publisher=indieretronews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2014, GOG.com was able to secure another major publisher as a DRM-free partner, [[Disney Interactive]] / [[LucasArts]]. With this new partnership, GOG.com began to re-release several often-requested game titles from LucasArts,&lt;ref name="GOGDisney"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/10/28/x-wing-tie-fighter-sam-max-gog/ |title=Sam &amp; Max &amp; X-Wing &amp; TIE Fighter: GOG Get LucasArts |first=Alice|last=O'Connor |date=28 October 2014 |accessdate=9 November 2014 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/28/7083283/disney-lucasarts-star-wars-re-release|title=Disney and GoG re-release classic Lucasfilm games, X-Wing was just the beginning |first=Ben |last=Kuchera |date=28 October 2014| accessdate=9 November 2014 |publisher=[[polygon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with six titles (''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', ''[[Star Wars: TIE Fighter]]'', ''[[Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road]]'', ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'').&lt;ref name="GOGDisney2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/news/new_publisher_disney_interactivelucasfilm |title=New Publisher: Disney Interactive / Lucasfilm |date=28 October 2014 |accessdate=9 November 2014 |publisher=GOG.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May 2015, GOG.com released ''[[Pacific General]]'' and ''[[Fantasy General]]'' and named itself, GOG Ltd, as the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gog.com/news/release_pacific_general_fantasy_general|title = Release: Pacific General + Fantasy General|date = 5 May 2015|accessdate = 5 May 2015|website = GOG.com |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company revealed that it had acquired the copyright to these titles and that it intends to acquire more in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gog.com/forum/general/release_pacific_general_fantasy_general_d1234/page1/?staff=yes|title = GOG.com staff posts regarding the acquisition of copyright|date = 5 May 2015|accessdate = 5 May 2015|website = GOG.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 2015, [[Bethesda Softworks]] joined GOG.com with classical titles as [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (which had been sold on GOG by Interplay before the rights changed hands), and also some classic ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'' titles.&lt;ref name="beth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/psa-classic-bethesda-titles-available-drm-free-on-gog/ |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |title=PSA: Classic Bethesda titles available DRM-free on GOG – Older Doom, Fallout, and Elder Scrolls bundled with discounts this week. |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOG.com has more than 2,000 DRM-free games in its catalogue and new ones are added several times a week.&lt;ref name="Games Catalogue"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/games?sort=popularity&amp;page=1|title=Games on GOG.com |publisher=GOG.com |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
The offered [[digital goods]] ([[video game]]s and [[movie]]s) can be purchased and [[Digital distribution|downloaded online]] and they are distributed without [[digital rights management]].&lt;ref name="arsinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/09/idiocy-of-games-drm.ars|title=Good Old Games and the 'idiocy' of DRM |accessdate=27 September 2008 |first=Frank |last=Caron |date=25 September 2008 |publisher=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prices of products typically range from about $5 to $10 for older games, along with special offers in sales held several times a week. Some newer titles have a higher price. GOG.com's digital products can also be given to other persons via redeemable gift certificates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gog.com/support/website_help/gift_certificates Website Help Gift certificates] on GOG.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the games, customers are also able to download numerous extra materials relating to the game they purchased. Often these extras include the game's [[soundtrack]] (partly as [[FLAC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/how-nice-gog-com-adds-31-flac-soundtracks-269840.phtml |title=How nice: GOG.com adds 31 FLAC soundtracks |first=Jordan |last=Devore |publisher=Destructoid |date=31 January 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Computer wallpaper|wallpapers]], [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]], and [[Instruction manual (gaming)|manuals]]. GOG.com also offers full [[customer support]] for all purchases and a [[money-back guarantee]] for the first 30 days.&lt;ref name="30days"/&gt;

Promotions are organized regularly. The style of these promotions varies from a discount for products that are bought in [[Product bundling|bundles]], to thematic competitions like riddles, "guess a game from a picture" contests or "best time on a specific level". Also, GOG.com gives away promotion codes for a game with review contests.

=== GOG Galaxy ===
In the [[CD Projekt Red]] company update in June 2014, GOG.com announced that it would be bringing a [[Steam (software)|Steam]]-like client, GOG Galaxy, to Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms. The client is designed as a storefront, software delivery, and social network client, allowing players to buy and play games from GOG.com and share them with friends. Galaxy is also going to include an original multiplayer API, allowing developers to include the same kind of multiplayer functionality in GOG.com versions of games as on Steam. The client is optional and will retain the DRM-free objective of the GOG.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2014/6/5/5783284/gog-galaxy-drm-free-online | title = GOG Galaxy promises no online activation needed for gaming | first = Megan | last = Farokhmanesh | date =5 June 2014 | accessdate = 6 June 2014 | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 2014 the open multiplayer beta of the GOG Galaxy client was started, accompanied by the giveaway of ''[[Aliens versus Predator (1999 video game)|Alien vs Predator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/alien-versus-predator-classic-is-free-on-gog-this-week/|title=Alien versus Predator Classic is free on GOG this week|first=Shaun|last=Prescott|date=15 October 2014 |accessdate=9 November 2014 |publisher=[[PC Games]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015 the GOG Galaxy beta client was reviewed favorably by the [[PC Gamer]] magazine, especially noting the focus on user respect in comparison to Steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/gog-galaxy-is-a-necessary-break-from-steams-feature-creep/|title=GOG Galaxy is a necessary break from Steam's feature creep|first=James |last=Davenport |date=14 July 2015 |accessdate=15 July 2015 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March 2017, the client added in [[cloud storage|cloud saves]] for 29 games from its catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/news/this_game_now_supports_gog_galaxy_cloud_saves|title=This game supports GOG Galaxy cloud saves!

=== GOG Connect ===
Revealed in June 2016, GOG Connect enables users with both GOG.com and Steam accounts to claim certain games they already own on Steam as part of their GOG.com library, allowing them to download the DRM-free version and other bonus items for that game offered by GOG.com. Not all such games are part of this offer, as it requires GOG.com to work with the game publishers to enable this. Further, the time to claim such games will be limited, though once a user has claimed their game on GOG.com, it otherwise remains in their library indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/article/94956/gog-connect-lets-you-add-steam-games-to-your-gog-library-for-free | title = GOG Connect lets you add Steam games to your GOG library for free | first = David | last= Craddock | date = 1 June 2016 | accessdate = 1 June 2016 | work = [[Shacknews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market share ==
As GOG.com does not typically release absolute game selling numbers, market share considerations of GOG.com among the digital distributors are a challenge. But, sometimes an individual game developer releases their internal statistics about the selling performance on different game distribution channels for their specific game.

In an article dated 11 November 2011, [[PC Gamer]] reported statistics for online sales of ''[[The Witcher 2]]''.&lt;ref name="PCGamer&amp;nbsp;— Witcher 2 Online Sales Figures"&gt;{{cite web|title=GOG release The Witcher 2 sales stats. Steam dominates all competitors combined |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/gog-release-witcher-2-sales-stats-steam-dominates-all-competitors-combined/ |accessdate=4 April 2014 |first=Owen |last=Hill |date=30 November 2011 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to PC Gamer, Direct2Drive, Impulse and Gamersgate's combined sales were a total of 10,000 (4%),&lt;ref name="PCGamer&amp;nbsp;— Witcher 2 Online Sales Figures"/&gt; GOG.com sold 40,000 copies (16%),&lt;ref name="PCGamer&amp;nbsp;— Witcher 2 Online Sales Figures"/&gt; while Steam sold in the same time period 200,000 copies (80%).&lt;ref name="PCGamer&amp;nbsp;— Witcher 2 Online Sales Figures"/&gt;

On 20 February 2013, ''[[Defender's Quest]]'' developer [[Lars Doucet]] revealed the first three months of [[revenue]] following his game's release across 6 different digital distribution platforms, including 4 major digital game distributors and 2 methods of purchasing and downloading the game directly from the developer. The results showed that GOG.com generated 8.5% of the revenue – second only to [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s 58.6% among the digital distribution platforms used. Doucet noted that "for the major [digital game distributors], GOG's star is clearly rising. Even under direct competition, GOG generated 14.5 percent as much revenue as Steam. [...] Steam enjoys a captive market of ardent loyalists, but GOG is swiftly becoming an attractive alternative and gaining loyalists of its own, especially in the anti-DRM crowd."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/186940/Defenders_Quest_By_the_Numbers_Part_2.php |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |title=Defender's Quest: By the Numbers, Part 2 |first= Lars| last=Doucet |date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General Software''' was a Washington, USA based creator and supplier of system software headquartered in [[Bellevue, Washington]]. It was founded in 1989 by Steve Jones and later incorporated in 1990 as General Software, Inc. In 2008, the company was purchased by [[Phoenix Technologies]], Inc.&lt;ref name="Phoenix_2008"/&gt;

General Software developed firmware to support telecommunications, data communications, [[UMPC]] (Ultra Mobile Personal Computer), general consumer electronics, and support models designed for embedded ODMs ([[Original Design Manufacturer]]) and OEMs ([[Original Equipment Manufacturer]]).

Some of the products included General Software '''Embedded DOS''', '''Embedded DOS-ROM''', '''Embedded DOS-XL''' and '''Embedded BIOS'''.

In 1998 they partnered with [[Caldera Thin Clients, Inc.]] in order to ship their Embedded [[BIOS]] with [[Caldera DR-DOS]].&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_WS21_Announce"/&gt;

[[File:Angel Men (1413014127).jpg|thumb|right|One example of a gourmand scent is Thierry Mugler's ''A*Men''.]]

A '''gourmand fragrance''' is a [[perfume]] consisting primarily of synthetic edible ([[gourmand]]) notes, such as [[honey]], [[chocolate]], [[vanilla]] or [[candy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Vosnaki, Elena. [http://www.fragrantica.com/news/The-Lure-of-Gourmand-Fragrances-Delicious-Indulgences-3986.html "Lure of Gourmand Fragrances: Delicious Indulgences"], ''Fragrantica.com'' Retrieved on 24 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Michael. ''Fragrances of the World'' [http://theposhpeasant.com/pages/helpfulscentguide.htm/ "Helpful Scent Guide"]''ThePoshPeasant.com''&lt;/ref&gt; These top and middle notes may be blended with non-edible base notes such as [[patchouli]] or [[musk]]. They have been described as olfactory desserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boisdejasmin.com/2011/08/olfactory_desserts_gourmand_fragrances.html |title=Olfactory Desserts : On Gourmand Fragrances « Bois de Jasmin |publisher=Boisdejasmin.com |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also called "foodie" fragrances and can be both feminine and masculine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Thierry Mugler]]'s ''[[Angel (perfume)|Angel]]'', launched in 1992, is credited as the first modern gourmand scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wischhover |first=Cheryl |url=http://fashionista.com/2013/02/thierry-muglers-angel-perfume-celebrates-20-years-in-the-us-a-look-back-at-the-scent-and-the-fashion-behind-it/ |title=Thierry Mugler’s Angel Perfume Celebrates 20 Years in the US: A Look Back at the Scent and the Fashion Behind It |publisher=Fashionista |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/fashion/02MUGLER.html|title=Thierry Mugler, a Designer Transformed|last=Wilson|first=Eric|date=2010-04-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional examples include Mugler's ''A*Men'', [[Lolita Lempicka|Lolita Lempicka's]] ''Lolita Lempicka'' and ''Au Masculin'', [[Hanae Mori|Hanae Mori's]] ''Butterfly'', [[Calvin Klein|Calvin Klein's]] ''Euphoria'', [[Burberry|Burberry's]] ''Brit for Men'', [[Rochas|Rochas']] ''Rochas Man'', [[Chopard|Chopard's]] ''Wish'' and [[Viktor &amp; Rolf|Viktor &amp; Rolf's]] ''Antidote''. 

The gourmand trend has steadily increased in popularity since 1992 but is not a new concept. In 1956, Edmond Roundnitska created ''Diorissimo'' to counter the contemporary preference for heavy and sweet notes which are common in gourmand perfumes.&lt;ref&gt;Robin. [http://www.nstperfume.com/2005/04/18/christian-dior-diorissimo-fragrance-review/ Christian Dior Diorissimo ~ fragrance review] ''Nstperfume.com'' Retrieved 21 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Most gourmand scents, such as those in the form of bath products, perfume or cologne, are not intended for human consumption. Other gourmand scents are not only scented but flavoured, such as Amoretti's line of products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amoretti.com/amoretti/Edible%20Perfumes/19/1 |title=Amoretti® Ingredients and Flavors &amp;#124; Products |publisher=Amoretti.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202184125/http://www.amoretti.com/amoretti/Edible%20Perfumes/19/1 |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jessica Simpson]]'s discontinued ''Dessert Treats''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/desserttreatsrock/ |title=Dessert Treats Rock |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scented products include other forms such as lip glosses, dusting powders and lotions.

Gourmand is considered a subcategory of the modern family of fragrance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theperfumedcourt.com/fragrance_families.aspx The Perfumed Court: Fragrance families] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202092313/http://theperfumedcourt.com/fragrance_families.aspx |date=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gourmands may also work in combination with the fruity family of fragrance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2715">A '''hedonometer''' or '''hedonimeter''' is a device used to gauge [[happiness]] or [[pleasure]]. Conceived of at least as early as 1880,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50104110?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=hedonometer&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 Oxford English Dictionary definition]&lt;/ref&gt; the term was used in 1881 by the economist [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] to describe "an ideally perfect instrument, a psychophysical machine, continually registering the height of pleasure experienced by an individual."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/p/mdl/mdlpap/0723.html Edgeworth's Hedonimeter and the Quest to Measure Utility]&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, it has been used to refer to a tool developed by [[Peter Sheridan Dodds|Peter Dodds]] and [[Chris Danforth]] to gauge the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of various corpora, including historical [[State of the Union]] addresses, song lyrics, and online [[Twitter|tweets]] and [[blogs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE56S0TQ20090729 Reuters - "Jackson's death was blogosphere's saddest day: study"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/757723154j4w726k/ Measuring the Happiness of Large-Scale Written Expression: Songs, Blogs, and Presidents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/02/the-geography-of-happiness-according-to-10-million-tweets/273286/ The Atlantic - "The Geography of Happiness According to 10 Million Tweets"]&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the tool is available at [http://hedonometer.org/ hedonometer.org], which they call a sort of "Dow Jones Index of Happiness",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/storylab/2013/04/30/now-online-the-dow-jones-of-happiness/ Computational Story Lab - "Now online: the Dow Jones Index of Happiness"]&lt;/ref&gt; and hope will be used by government officials in conjunction with other metrics as a gauge of the population's well-being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-01/forget-gdp-dot-data-crunchers-measure-happy-tweets-for-key-economic-indicator Bloomberg Businessweek - "Forget GDP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6176">The '''Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators''' ('''ISTC''') is the UK's largest professional association for those involved in [[technical communication]] and [[information design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tceurope.org/memberorganisations/istc.htm Profile of ISTC published by TCeurope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qualityauthors.co.uk/aboutistc.php ABOUT ISTC]. Copyright © 2000 Quality Independent Authors.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astauthors.co.uk/aboutast/istc/index.php The Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators]. Site © copyright AST 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages professional education and standards, provides guidance about the value of using professional communicators, and provides research resources and networking opportunities for its members and affiliates.

==History==
The ISTC as it is today was created in 1972 from an amalgamation of three associations: the Presentation of Technical Information Group (founded in 1948&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reginaldkapp.org/AboutROK/About_biography.htm Involvement of Reginald Kapp in the PTI Group and the ISTC]&lt;/ref&gt;), the Technical Publications Association and the Institute of Technical Publicity &amp; Publications.&lt;ref&gt;Hockley, H R: "Communicator", May 1972, page 1. ITPP, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was incorporated as a limited company on 19 July 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/2b94e8c4de7394e8e35d5577f693cc20/compdetails limited company, 01061923]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The ISTC is managed by its Council, with day-to-day running handled by a professional administration company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.co.uk/pages/clients-test.htm Administration Services Ltd client list]&lt;/ref&gt; Members have the opportunity to contribute their ideas, skills and time to specific Steering Groups and can stand for Council.

The ISTC is a member of the [[Professional Associations Research Network]] (PARN). This organisation provides a network for professional bodies and offers services and events on subjects such as governance, [[Continuing Professional Development]], ethics and standards, and member relations. The ISTC was one of the sponsors of a project in 2006 to explore the issues affecting professional associations as they grow.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C; Woodhead, S: "The Growing Pains of Smaller Professional Associations: Key Issues and Interesting Practice". PARN, June 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISTC has a Code of Professional Practice, with which it expects its members to comply. This was developed in accordance with research carried out by PARN and its author was cited in PARN's third book on ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, A: "Ethical Competence and Professional Associations", pages 109-111. PARN, 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0-9545487-7-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Technical communication encompasses a wide range of activities, all with the common thread of communicating complex or important information in the most effective way for the reader. Technical communicators create information that affects people in virtually every industry and area of society. Examples of roles that may be involved in technical communication are:

* [[Technical writer|Technical writing]]
* [[Technical illustration]]
* [[Index (publishing)|Indexing]]
* [[Editing]]
* [[Instructional design]]
* [[Information architecture]]
* [[Single source publishing]]
*[[Environmental policy|Environmental]], [[safety]] and [[health]] communication
* [[Management]]

The ISTC offers several grades of individual membership. There are two corporate grades, Member (MISTC) and Fellow (FISTC), and two non-corporate grades, Associate and Student. Corporate grades are entitled to vote at the ISTC's AGM. Members cite a sense of community as an important factor in their continued membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stcfrance.org/files/STCFranceConnexionFebruary2008.pdf Newell, M: "Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators", page 4. France Connexion, STC France Chapter, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations can join the ISTC as Business Affiliates.

==Publications==	
The ISTC publishes periodicals and books:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cde.london.ac.uk/resources/documents/books/resource1752.htm Centre for Distance Learning listing for Professional Communication and Information Design]&lt;/ref&gt;
* a quarterly journal, ''Communicator'' (ISSN 0953-3699)

* an overview of the role of XML in the profession, ''XML in Technical Communication''.({{ISBN|978-0-9506459-7-1}})

==Events==	
The ISTC organises an annual conference, Technical Communication UK, which is held in September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ribaproductselector.com/Docs/7/13447/external/cov.htm?ac= Royal Institute of British Architecture listing for ISTC annual conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==	
The ISTC makes annual awards:
* UK Technical Communication Awards (formerly the ISTC Documentation Awards) for deliverables in five classes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lr.org/NR/exeres/BAEA09AA-4C70-4C1B-AA67-C5148E953F13.htm Lloyds Register announcement of win]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Horace Hockley Award for contribution to the profession&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shu.ac.uk/media/staff.html#nw Sheffield Hallam University announcement of win]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International==	
The ISTC participates in the international technical communication profession through its membership of two umbrella organisations:
* [[INTECOM]]&lt;ref&gt;Watson, M: "Communicator", Winter 2004, pages 14-15. ISTC, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[TCeurope]]&lt;ref&gt;Risku, H: "Communicator", Winter 2005, page 32-33. ISTC, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISTC was one of the founder members of both organisations, INTECOM in 1970&lt;ref&gt;Hockley, H R: "Communicator", July 1974, page 2. ISTC, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and TCeurope in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, A: "Communicator", Spring/Summer 2002, page 28. ISTC, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands (toponymy)|Netherlands]] had a considerable part in the making of [[modern society]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lothrop Motley|Motley, John Lothrop]] (1855). "The Rise of the Dutch Republic", Volume I, Preface. "The rise of the Dutch Republic must ever be regarded as one of the leading events of modern times. Without the birth of this great commonwealth, the various historical phenomena of the sixteenth and following centuries must have either not existed, or have presented themselves under essential modifications."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Witold Rybczynski|Rybczynski, Witold]] (1987). ''Home: A Short History of an Idea''. According to [[Witold Rybczynski]]’s ''[[Home: A Short History of an Idea]]'', private spaces in households are a Dutch seventeenth-century invention, despite their commonplace nature today. He has argued that home as we now know it came from the Dutch canal house of the seventeenth century. That, he said, was the first time that people identified living quarters as being precisely the residence of a man, a woman and their children. "The feminization of the home in seventeenth century Holland was one of the most important events in the evolution of the domestic interior." This evolution took place in part due to Dutch law being "explicit on contractual arrangements and on the civil rights of servants". And, "for the first time, the person who was in intimate contact with housework was also in a position to influence the arrangement and disposition of the house." &lt;br /&gt; Rybczynski (2007) discusses why we live in houses in the first place: "To understand why we live in [[house]]s, it is necessary to go back several hundred years to Europe. Rural people have always lived in houses, but the typical medieval town dwelling, which combined living space and workplace, was occupied by a mixture of extended families, servants, and employees. This changed in seventeenth-century Holland. [[Dutch Republic|The Netherlands]] was Europe’s first republic, and the world’s first middle-class nation. Prosperity allowed extensive [[home]] ownership, [[republicanism]] discouraged the widespread use of servants, a love of children promoted the [[nuclear family]], and [[Calvinism]] encouraged thrift and other domestic virtues. These circumstances, coupled with a particular affection for the private family home, brought about a [[cultural revolution]]... The idea of urban houses spread to the British Isles thanks to England's strong commercial and cultural links with the Netherlands."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabor, Philip 2005"&gt;Tabor, Philip (2005). "Striking Home: The Telematic Assault on Identity". Published in [[Jonathan Hill (architect)|Jonathan Hill]], editor, ''Occupying Architecture: Between the Architect and the User''. Philip Tabor states the contribution of 17th century Dutch houses as the foundation of houses today: "As far as the idea of the home is concerned, the home of the home is the Netherlands. This idea's crystallization might be dated to the first three-quarters of the seventeenth century, when the Dutch Netherlands amassed the unprecedented and unrivalled accumulation of capital, and emptied their purses into domestic space." &lt;br /&gt; According to [[Jonathan Hill (architect)|Jonathan Hill]] (''Immaterial Architecture'', 2006), compared to the large scaled houses in England and the Renaissance, the [[Dutch Golden Age|17th Century Dutch]] house was smaller, and was only inhabited by up to four to five members. This was due to their embracing "self-reliance", in contrast to the dependence on servants, and a design for a lifestyle centered on the [[family]]. It was important for the Dutch to separate work from domesticity, as the [[home]] became an escape and a place of [[comfort]]. This way of living and the home has been noted as highly similar to the [[contemporary]] family and their dwellings. House layouts also incorporated the idea of the corridor as well as the importance of function and privacy. By the end of the 17th Century, the house layout was soon transformed to become employment-free, enforcing these ideas for the future. This came in favour for the industrial revolution, gaining large-scale factory production and workers. The house layout of the Dutch and its functions are still relevant today.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;including the Dutch-speaking [[Southern Netherlands]] prior to [[Fall of Antwerp|1585]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[History of Dutch nationality|its people]] have made numerous seminal contributions to the world's civilization,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Peter J. (2002). ''Dutch Hegemony and Contemporary Globalization''. "The Dutch developed a social formula, which we have come to call modern capitalism, that proved to be transferable and ultimately deadly to all other social formulations."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunthorne, Hugh (2004). ''The Dutch Republic: That mother nation of liberty'', in ''The Enlightenment World'', M. Fitzpatrick, P. Jones, C. Knellwolf and I. McCalman eds.

Libertarians value the Dutch Republic as a historical phenomenon not because it represented any sort of perfection, but above all because it demonstrated to several generations of intellectuals the practicality of allowing citizens greater liberties than were customarily accorded them, which in turn contributed to producing what we now know as classical liberalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/daily/4600 |author=[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] |title=The Rise, Fall, and Renaissance of Classical Liberalism |publisher=Mises Daily |quote=As the modern age began, rulers started to shake free of age-old customary constraints on their power. Royal absolutism became the main tendency of the time. The kings of Europe raised a novel claim: they declared that they were appointed by God to be the fountainhead of all life and activity in society. Accordingly, they sought to direct religion, culture, politics, and, especially, the economic life of the people. To support their burgeoning bureaucracies and constant wars, the rulers required ever-increasing quantities of taxes, which they tried to squeeze out of their subjects in ways that were contrary to precedent and custom. &lt;br /&gt; The first people to revolt against this system were the Dutch. After a struggle that lasted for decades, they won their independence from Spain and proceeded to set up a unique polity. The United Provinces, as the radically decentralized state was called, had no king and little power at the federal level. Making money was the passion of these busy manufacturers and traders; they had no time for hunting heretics or suppressing new ideas. Thus de facto religious toleration and a wide-ranging freedom of the press came to prevail. Devoted to industry and trade, the Dutch established a legal system based solidly on the rule of law and the sanctity of property and contract. Taxes were low, and everyone worked. The Dutch "economic miracle" was the wonder of the age. Thoughtful observers throughout Europe noted the Dutch success with great interest. |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russellshorto.com/book/amsterdam |author=[[Russell Shorto|Shorto, Russell]] |title=Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City (overview) |publisher=russellshorto.com |quote=Liberalism has many meanings, but in its classical sense it is a philosophy based on individual freedom.

Until the 17th century, commissioning [[works of art]] was largely the preserve of the [[christian Church|church]], [[monarchs]] and [[aristocrats]]. The emergence of a powerful and wealthy [[middle class]] in [[Holland]], though, produced a radical change in [[patronage]] as the new Dutch bourgeoisie bought art. For the first time, the direction of [[art]] was shaped by relatively broadly-based demand rather than [[religious dogma]] or royal whim, and the result was the birth of a large-scale open (free) art market which today's dealers and collectors would find familiar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, H.

Considered by many experts to be the world's first truly (modern) [[multinational corporation]], the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] was also the first permanently organized [[limited liability company|limited-liability]] [[joint-stock company]], with a permanent [[Financial capital|capital]] base. The Dutch merchants were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern [[corporate governance]]. The VOC is often considered as the precursor of modern [[corporation]]s, if not the first truly modern corporation. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. With its pioneering features such as [[corporate identity]] (first globally-recognized [[corporate logo]]), entrepreneurial spirit, [[legal personality|legal personhood]], [[transnational corporation|transnational]] ([[multinational corporation|multinational]]) operational structure, high stable profitability, permanent [[Financial capital|capital]] (fixed capital stock), freely transferable [[Share (finance)|shares]] and [[securities trading|tradable securities]], separation of [[ownership]] and [[management]], and [[limited liability]] for both [[shareholder]]s and managers, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for the large-scale business enterprises that now dominate the global economy. &lt;br /&gt; The second major innovation was the creation of the world's first fully functioning [[financial market]], with the birth of a fully fledged [[capital market]]. The Dutch were also the first to effectively use a fully-fledged [[capital market]] (including the [[bond market]] and the [[stock market]]) to finance [[companies]] (such as the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and the [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]). It was in seventeenth-century Amsterdam that the global [[securities market]] began to take on its modern form. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company ([[Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie|VOC]]) established an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] in [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|Amsterdam]] where VOC [[stock]] and [[bond (finance)|bonds]] could be traded in a [[secondary market]]. The VOC undertook the world's first recorded [[IPO]] in the same year. The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (''Amsterdamsche Beurs'' in Dutch) was also the world's first fully-fledged [[stock exchange]]. While the [[Italian city-states]] produced the first transferable government bonds, they didn't develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged [[capital market]]: corporate shareholders. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first [[company]] to offer [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]]. The dividend averaged around 18% of capital over the course of the company's 200-year existence. Dutch investors were the first to trade their [[Share (finance)|shares]] at a regular [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|stock exchange]]. The buying and selling of these [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]] in the VOC became the basis of the first [[stock market]]. It was in the [[Dutch Republic]] that the early techniques of [[market manipulation|stock-market manipulation]] were developed. The Dutch pioneered [[Futures contract|stock futures]], [[stock options]], [[short selling]], [[bear raid]]s, debt-equity swaps, and other [[speculation|speculative instruments]]. Amsterdam businessman [[Joseph de la Vega]]'s ''Confusion of Confusions'' (1688) was the earliest book about [[stock trading]]. &lt;br /&gt; The third major innovation was the establishment of the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] ([[Amsterdamsche Wisselbank]] in Dutch) in 1609, which led to the introduction of the concept of [[bank money]]. The [[Bank of Amsterdam]] was arguably the world's first [[central bank]]. The Wisselbank's innovations helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the [[central banking|central banking system]] that now plays a vital role in the world's economy. It occupied a central position in the financial world of its day, providing an effective, efficient and trusted system for national and international payments, and introduced the first ever [[international reserve currency]], the [[Dutch guilder|bank guilder]]. Lucien Gillard (2004) calls it the ''European guilder'' (''le florin européen''), and [[Adam Smith]] devotes many pages to explaining how the bank guilder works (Smith 1776: 446–55). The model of the Wisselbank as a [[state bank]] was adapted throughout Europe, including the [[Bank of Sweden]] (1668) and the [[Bank of England]] (1694).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Jan; Woude, Ad van der (1997).

== Inventions and innovations ==
=== Arts and architecture ===

==== Movements and styles ====
===== De Stijl (Neo-Plasticism) (1917) =====
The [[De Stijl]] school proposed simplicity and abstraction, both in architecture and painting, by using only straight horizontal and vertical lines and rectangular forms. Furthermore, their formal vocabulary was limited to the primary colours, red, yellow, and blue and the three primary values, black, white and grey. De Stijl's principal members were painters [[Theo van Doesburg]] (1883–1931), [[Piet Mondrian]] (1872–1944), [[Vilmos Huszár]] (1884–1960), and [[Bart van der Leck]] (1876–1958) and architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]] (1888–1964), [[Robert van 't Hoff]] (1888–1979) and [[J.J.P. Oud]] (1890–1963).

==== Architecture ====
===== Brabantine Gothic architecture (14th century) =====
[[Brabantine Gothic]], occasionally called [[Brabantian Gothic]], is a significant variant of [[Gothic architecture]] that is typical for the [[Low Countries]]. It surfaced in the first half of the 14th century at [[Saint Rumbold's Cathedral]] in the City of [[Mechelen]]. The Brabantine Gothic style originated with the advent of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and spread across the [[Burgundian Netherlands]].

===== Netherlandish gabled architecture (15th–17th centuries) =====
[[File:Frederiksborg Slot Hilleroed Denmark outer courtyard1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Frederiksborg Castle]] ([[Hillerød]], [[Denmark]]) was built as a royal residence for King [[Christian IV of Denmark]]. The majority of the present castle was built between 1600–1620 in [[Dutch Renaissance]] style with [[Dutch brick|red brick]] façade, sweeping [[Dutch gable|gables]], and [[sandstone]] decorations.]]
[[File:Boersen corner 2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Børsen]], [[Copenhagen]]'s old stock exchange, was designed by Lorentz and [[Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger]] and is the oldest [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange|stock exchange in Denmark]].]]
[[File:House of Blackheads - Riga.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Dutch Renaissance]] [[Dutch gable|gabled]] [[façade]] of the [[House of the Blackheads|House of Blackheads]] ([[Riga]]'s [[Vecrīga|Old Town]]). The original building was erected during the first third of the 14th century for the [[Brotherhood of Blackheads]], a [[guild]] for unmarried German merchants in Riga. The Dutch Renaissance/Mannerist style (with typically [[Dutch gables]] and red [[Dutch brick]] façades) blossomed more fully in [[Nordic countries]] and [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic cities]] than in its homeland.]]
[[File:Great Armoury in Gdańsk (5).jpg|thumb|right|180px|The [[:pl:Wielka Zbrojownia w Gdańsku|Great Armoury]] in [[Gdańsk]]/[[Danzig]], [[Poland]]. It was built in typically Dutch [[Mannerist]] style with a [[Dutch gable|stepped-gable]] façade of red [[Dutch brick]] and [[sandstone]] decorations.]]
[[File:Gdańsk Zielona Brama.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The [[Green Gate]] (Brama Zielona) is one of the most notable tourist attractions in [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]. It was built between 1568–1571 in the Netherlandic/Dutch Mannerist style with a typically [[Dutch gable]] façade.]]
[[File:Meuseujid Raya.JPG|thumb|right|180px|The [[Baiturrahman Grand Mosque]] in the center of [[Banda Aceh]] city, [[Aceh]] Province, [[Indonesia]]. The [[mosque]] was built (1879) in [[Dutch East Indies]] [[Colonial architecture of Indonesia|architectural style]] with the combination of occidental and oriental features. The mosque's [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped gables]] ([[:nl:trapgevel|trapgevel]] in Dutch) are reminiscent of [[Dutch Renaissance]] architectural style.]]
The [[Dutch gable]] was a notable feature of the [[Dutch Renaissance|Dutch-Flemish Renaissance]] [[Renaissance architecture|architecture]] (or [[Northern Mannerist]] [[Mannerist architecture|architecture]]) that spread to northern Europe from the [[Low Countries]], arriving in Britain during the latter part of the 16th century. Notable castles/buildings including [[Frederiksborg Castle]], [[Rosenborg Castle]], [[Kronborg Castle]], [[Børsen]], [[Riga]]'s [[House of the Blackheads]] and [[Green Gate|Gdańsk's Green Gate]] were built in Dutch-Flemish Renaissance style with sweeping [[gable]]s, [[sandstone]] decorations and [[copper]]-covered roofs. Later Dutch gables with flowing curves became absorbed into [[Baroque architecture]]. Examples of Dutch-gabled buildings can be found in historic cities across Europe such as [[Potsdam]] ([[Dutch Quarter]]), [[Friedrichstadt]], [[Gdańsk]] and [[Gothenburg]]. The style spread beyond Europe, for example [[Barbados]] is well known for Dutch gables on its historic buildings. Dutch settlers in [[South Africa]] brought with them building styles from the [[Netherlands]]: Dutch gables, then adjusted to the [[Western Cape]] region where the style became known as [[Cape Dutch architecture]]. In [[the Americas]] and [[Northern Europe]], the [[West End Collegiate Church]] (New York City, 1892), the [[Chicago Varnish Company Building]] ([[Chicago]], 1895), [[Pont Street Dutch|Pont Street Dutch-style]] buildings (London, 1800s), [[Helsingør Station]] ([[Helsingør]], 1891), and [[Gdańsk University of Technology]]'s Main Building ([[Gdańsk]], 1904) are typical examples of the Dutch Renaissance [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Revival]] ([[Neo-Renaissance]]) architecture in the late 19th century.

===== Netherlandish Mannerist architecture (Antwerp Mannerism) (16th century) =====
[[Antwerp Mannerism]] is the name given to the style of a largely anonymous group of painters from Antwerp in the beginning of the 16th century. The style bore no direct relation to Renaissance or Italian [[Mannerism]], but the name suggests a peculiarity that was a reaction to the classic style of the [[early Netherlandish painting]]. [[Antwerp Mannerism]] may also be used to describe the style of architecture, which is loosely [[Northern Mannerism|Mannerist]], developed in [[Antwerp]] by about 1540, which was then influential all over [[Northern Europe]]. The [[Green Gate]] (Brama Zielona) in [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]], is a building which is inspired by the [[Antwerp City Hall]]. It was built between 1568 and 1571 by Regnier van Amsterdam and Hans Kramer to serve as the formal residence of the Polish monarchs when visiting Gdańsk.

===== Cape Dutch architecture (1650s) =====
[[Cape Dutch architecture]] is an [[architecture|architectural]] style found in the [[Western Cape]] of [[South Africa]]. The style was prominent in the early days (17th century) of the [[Cape Colony]], and the name derives from the fact that the initial settlers of the Cape were primarily Dutch. The style has roots in medieval Netherlands, Germany, France and Indonesia. Houses in this style have a distinctive and recognisable design, with a prominent feature being the grand, ornately rounded [[Dutch gable|gables]], reminiscent of features in townhouses of [[Amsterdam]] built in the [[Dutch architecture|Dutch style]].

===== Amsterdam School (Dutch Expressionist architecture) (1910s) =====
The Amsterdam School (Dutch: ''Amsterdamse School'') flourished from 1910 through about 1930 in the Netherlands. The Amsterdam School movement is part of [[Expressionist architecture|international Expressionist architecture]], sometimes linked to [[Brick Expressionism|German Brick Expressionism]].

===== Rietveld Schröder House (De Stijl architecture) (1924) =====
[[File:Rietveld Schröderhuis HayKranen-20.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The exterior of the [[Rietveld Schröder House]]. The [[Rietveld Schröder House]] (Rietveld Schröderhuis) is considered one of the icons of the [[Modern architecture]]. With its radical approach to design and the use of space, the Rietveld Schröderhuis occupies a seminal position in the development of architecture in the modern age.]]

The [[Rietveld Schröder House]] or Schröder House (Rietveld Schröderhuis in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) in [[Utrecht]] was built in 1924 by Dutch architect [[Gerrit Rietveld]]. It became a listed monument in 1976 and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000. The Rietveld Schröder House constitutes both inside and outside a radical break with tradition, offering little distinction between interior and exterior space. The rectilinear lines and planes flow from outside to inside, with the same colour palette and surfaces. Inside is a dynamic, changeable open zone rather than a static accumulation of rooms. The [[house]] is one of the best known examples of ''[[De Stijl]]'' architecture and arguably the only true ''De Stijl'' building.&lt;ref&gt;Hertzberger, Herman (1991).

===== Van Nelle Factory (1925–1931) =====
The [[Van Nelle factory]] was built between 1925 and 1931. Its most striking feature is its huge [[glass]] [[façade]]s. The [[factory]] was designed on the premise that a modern, transparent and healthy working environment in green surroundings would be good both for production and for workers' welfare. The factory had a huge impact on the development of [[modern architecture]] in Europe and elsewhere. The Van Nelle Factory is a Dutch national monument ([[Rijksmonument]]) and since 2014 has the status of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The Justification of Outstanding Universal Value was presented in 2013 to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee.

===== Super Dutch (1990-present) =====
An architectural movement started by a generation of new architects during the 1990, among this generation of architects were OMA, MVRDV, UNStudio, Mecanoo, Meyer en Van Schooten and many more. They started with buildings, which became internationally known for their new and refreshing style. After which Super Dutch Architecture spread out across the globe.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==== Furniture ====
===== Dutch door (17th century) =====

[[File:Dutch door open.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Dutch door]] with the top half open, in [[South Africa]]]]

The [[Dutch door]] (also known as ''stable door'' or ''half door'') is a type of door divided horizontally in such a fashion that the bottom half may remain shut while the top half opens. The initial purpose of this door was to keep animals out of farmhouses, while keeping children inside, yet allowing light and air to filter through the open top. This type of door was common in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century and appears in Dutch paintings of the period. They were commonly found in Dutch areas of New York and New Jersey (before the [[American Revolution]]) and in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/34.79a,b "Dutch door (American) (34.79a,b)"]. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Red and Blue Chair (1917) =====
[[File:Rietveld chair 1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A [[Rietveld joint]], also called a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] node in furniture-making, is an overlapping [[joint]] of three battens in the three orthogonal directions. It was a prominent feature in the [[Red and Blue Chair]] that was designed by [[Gerrit Rietveld]] in 1917. [[Rietveld joint]]s are inextricably linked with the early 20th century Dutch artistic movement called [[De Stijl]] (of which Gerrit Rietveld was a member).]]

The [[Red and Blue Chair]] was designed in 1917 by [[Gerrit Rietveld]]. It represents one of the first explorations by the [[De Stijl]] [[art movement]] in three dimensions. It features several [[Rietveld joint]]s.

===== Zig-Zag Chair (1934) =====
The [[Zig-Zag Chair]] was designed by Rietveld in 1934. It is a minimalist design without legs, made by 4 flat wooden tiles that are merged in a Z-shape using [[Dovetail joint]]s. It was designed for the Rietveld Schröder House in Utrecht.

===== Foundations of modern oil painting (15th century) =====

[[File:JanVanEyck-Signatura.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Signature of Jan van Eyck. [[Jan Van Eyck]] is often credited as the first master of [[oil painting]].]]

Although oil paint was first used for [[Buddhist]] paintings by Indian and Chinese painters sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries, it did not gain notoriety until the 15th century. Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages. [[Oil paint]] eventually became the principal [[Artistic medium|medium]] used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in northern Europe, and by the height of the Renaissance [[oil painting]] techniques had almost completely replaced [[tempera]] paints in the majority of Europe. [[Early Netherlandish painting]] ([[Jan van Eyck]] in particular) in the 15th century was the first to make oil the default painting medium, and to explore the use of layers and [[glaze (painting technique)|glazes]], followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and only then Italy.&lt;ref name="Jones, Susan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/optg/hd_optg.htm |author=Jones, Susan |title=''Painting in Oil in the Low Countries and Its Spread to Southern Europe'' |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=31 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ione, Amy (2005). ''Innovation and Visualization: Trajectories, Strategies, and Myths (Consciousness, Literature and the Arts 1)'', p. 97–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Janetta Rebold (2009). ''Materials, Methods, and Masterpieces of Medieval Art'', p. 36–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jamie L. (2012). ''Als ich can: How Jan van Eyck Extended the Vernacular from Dutch Poetry to Oil Painting'' in ''The Transformation of Vernacular Expression in Early Modern Arts'', edited by Joost Keizer and Todd M. Richardson (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Glaze (painting technique) (15th century) =====
[[Glaze (painting technique)|Glazing]] is a technique employed by painters since the invention of modern [[oil painting]]. [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]] in the 15th century were the first to make oil the usual painting medium, and explore the use of layers and [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazes]], followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and only then Italy.&lt;ref name="Jones, Susan"/&gt;

===== Proto-Realism (15th–17th centuries) =====
Two aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] were rooted in at least two centuries of Dutch tradition: conspicuous textural imitation and a penchant for ordinary and exaggeratedly comic scenes. Two hundred years before the rise of literary realism, Dutch painters had already made an art of the everyday – pictures that served as a compelling model for the later novelists. By the mid-1800s, [[Dutch Golden Age painting|17th-century Dutch painting]] figured virtually everywhere in the British and French fiction we esteem today as the vanguard of [[Realism (arts)|realism]].

===== Proto-Surrealism (1470s–1510s) =====
[[Hieronymus Bosch]] is considered one of the prime examples of [[Surrealism|Pre-Surrealism]]. The surrealists relied most on his insights. In the 20th century, [[List of paintings by Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch's paintings]] (e.g. [[The Garden of Earthly Delights]], [[The Haywain Triptych|The Haywain]], [[Triptych of the Temptation of St. Anthony|The Temptation of St. Anthony]] and [[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]) were cited by the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] as precursors to their own visions.

===== Modern still-life painting (16th–17th century) =====
[[Still life|Still-life painting]] as an independent genre or specialty first flourished in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 16th century, and the English term derives from ''stilleven'': ''still life'', which is a [[calque]], while Romance languages (as well as Greek, Polish, Russian and Turkish) tend to use terms meaning ''dead nature''.

===== Naturalistic landscape painting (16th–17th century) =====
[[File:The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede 1670 Ruisdael.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''The Windmill at Wijk'' by [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] (1670). It is a commonplace of art history that the genre of "[[landscape painting|naturalistic landscape painting]]" first emerged in Holland in the seventeenth century. The word "[[landscape]]" entered the modern English language as ''landskip'' (variously spelt), an anglicization of the Dutch ''landschap'', around the start of the 17th century. The [[Dutch Golden Age painting|17th-century Dutch landscape art]] had considerable influences on the [[British art|British]] [[landscape art]], American [[Hudson River School]], and French [[Barbizon School]] in subsequent centuries.]]
The term "[[landscape]]" derives from the Dutch word ''landschap'' (and the German ''Landschaft''), which originally meant "region, tract of land" but acquired the artistic connotation, "a picture depicting scenery on land" in the early 16th century. After the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], the tradition of depicting pure landscapes declined and the landscape was seen only as a setting for religious and figural scenes. This tradition continued until the 16th century when artists began to view the landscape as a subject in its own right. The [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of [[Landscape art|landscape painting]], in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather.

===== Genre painting (15th century) =====
The Flemish Renaissance painter [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] chose peasants and their activities as the subject of many paintings. Genre painting flourished in Northern Europe in his wake. [[Adriaen van Ostade]], [[David Teniers the Elder|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Netherlands during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers.

===== Marine painting (17th century) =====
[[File:Vroom Hendrick Cornelisz Battle between England and Spain 1601.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The genre of [[marine painting]] as a distinct category separate from [[landscape art|landscape]] is attributed to [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]] from early in the seventeenth century.]]
Marine painting began in keeping with medieval [[Christian art]] tradition. Such works portrayed the sea only from a bird's eye view, and everything, even the waves, was organized and symmetrical. The viewpoint, symmetry and overall order of these early paintings underlined the organization of the heavenly cosmos from which the earth was viewed. Later Dutch artists such as [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]], Cornelius Claesz, [[Abraham Storck]], [[Jan Porcellis]], [[Simon de Vlieger]], [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]], [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]] and [[Ludolf Bakhuizen]] developed new methods for painting, often from a horizontal point of view, with a lower horizon and more focus on realism than symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Margarita (1983). ''Visions of the Sea: Hendrick C. Vroom and the Origins of Dutch Marine Painting''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unger, Richard W. 1996 p. 75–93"&gt;Unger, Richard W. (1996). ''Marine Paintings and the History of Shipbuilding'' (p. 75–93) in ''Art in History/History in Art: Studies in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Culture'', edited by David Freedberg and Jan de Vries (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Vanitas (17th century) =====
The term [[vanitas]] is most often associated with still life paintings that were popular in seventeenth-century Dutch art, produced by the artists such as [[Pieter Claesz]]. Common vanitas symbols included skulls (a reminder of the certainty of death); rotten fruit (decay); bubbles, (brevity of life and suddenness of death); smoke, watches, and hourglasses, (the brevity of life); and musical instruments (the brevity and ephemeral nature of life). Fruit, flowers and butterflies can be interpreted in the same way, while a peeled lemon, as well as the typical accompanying seafood was, like life, visually attractive but with a bitter flavor.

===== Civil group portraiture (17th century) =====
Group portraits were produced in great numbers during the [[Baroque period]], particularly in the Netherlands. Unlike in the rest of Europe, Dutch artists received no commissions from the [[Calvinist Church]] which had forbidden such images or from the aristocracy which was virtually non-existent. Instead, commissions came from civic and businesses associations. Dutch painter [[Frans Hals]] used fluid brush strokes of vivid color to enliven his group [[portrait]]s, including those of the civil guard to which he belonged. [[Rembrandt]] benefitted greatly from such commissions and from the general appreciation of art by bourgeois clients, who supported [[portrait painting|portraiture]] as well as still-life and landscape painting. Notably, the world's first significant art and dealer markets flourished in Holland at that time.

===== Tronie (17th century) =====
[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' (1665), [[Vermeer]]'s masterpiece is often considered as a “[[tronie]]”.]]
In the 17th century, Dutch painters (especially [[Frans Hals]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Jan Lievens]] and [[Johannes Vermeer]]) began to create uncommissioned paintings called ''tronies'' that focused on the features and/or expressions of people who were not intended to be identifiable. They were conceived more for art's sake than to satisfy conventions. The tronie was a distinctive type of [[painting]], combining elements of the [[portrait]], history, and [[genre painting]]. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model was not supposed to be important, but they might represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. In contrast to [[portrait]]s, "[[tronie]]s" were painted for the [[open market]]. They differ from figurative paintings and religious figures in that they are not restricted to a moral or narrative context. It is, rather, much more an exploration of the spectrum of human physiognomy and expression and the reflection of conceptions of character that are intrinsic to psychology's pre-history.

===== Rembrandt lighting (17th century) =====
[[File:Rembrandt lighting.png|thumb|right|180px|The typical Rembrandt lighting setup. Rembrandt's treatment of light and dark in his [[portraiture]] created a style of lighting known today as ''[[Rembrandt lighting]]''. Rembrandt lighting technique is used by many modern [[photographer]]s and [[cinematographer]]s.]]
Rembrandt lighting is a [[lighting]] technique that is used in studio [[portrait photography]].
It can be achieved using one light and a reflector, or two lights, and is popular because
it is capable of producing images which appear both natural and compelling with a minimum
of equipment. Rembrandt lighting is characterized by an illuminated triangle under the eye
of the subject, on the less illuminated side of the face. It is named for the Dutch painter
[[Rembrandt]], who often used this type of lighting in his [[portrait painting]]s.

==== Mezzotint (1642) ====
The first known [[mezzotint]] was done in [[Amsterdam]] in 1642 by [[Utrecht]]-born German artist [[Ludwig von Siegen]]. He lived in Amsterdam from 1641 to about 1644, when he was supposedly influenced by [[Rembrandt]].&lt;ref&gt;Hind, Arthur M. (1963). ''A History of Engraving and Etching'', p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin, Henri-Jean 1994 p. 407"&gt;Martin, Henri-Jean (1994). ''The History and Power of Writing'', p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aquatint (1650s) ====
The painter and printmaker [[Jan van de Velde]] is often credited to be the inventor of the [[aquatint]] technique, in Amsterdam around 1650.&lt;ref name="Martin, Henri-Jean 1994 p. 407"/&gt;

===== Pronkstilleven (1650s) =====
[[Pronkstilleven]] (''pronk still life'' or ''ostentatious still life'') is a type of banquet piece whose distinguishing feature is a quality of ostentation and splendor. These still lifes usually depict one or more especially precious objects. Although the term is a post-17th century invention, this type is characteristic of the second half of the seventeenth century. It was developed in the 1640s in [[Antwerp]] from where it spread quickly to the [[Dutch Republic]]. Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] started to paint still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals. The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/pronkstilleven Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms: Pronkstilleven]&lt;/ref&gt; A leading Dutch representative was [[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], who spent a long period of his active career in Antwerp and was one of the founders of the style in Holland.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150608162904/https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/36842 Jan Davidsz. de Heem] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Proto-Expressionism (1880s) =====
[[Vincent van Gogh]]'s work is most often associated with [[Post-Impressionism]], but his innovative style had a vast influence on 20th-century art and established what would later be known as [[Expressionism]], also greatly influencing [[fauvism]] and early [[abstractionism]]. His impact on German and Austrian [[Expressionist]]s was especially profound. "Van Gogh was father to us all," the German Expressionist painter [[Max Pechstein]] proclaimed in 1901, when Van Gogh's vibrant oils were first shown in Germany and triggered the artistic reformation, a decade after his suicide in obscurity in France. In his final letter to [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], Van Gogh stated that, as he had no children, he viewed his paintings as his progeny. Reflecting on this, the British art historian [[Simon Schama]] concluded that he "did have a child of course, Expressionism, and many, many heirs."

===== M. C. Escher's graphic arts (1920s–1960s) =====
Dutch [[graphic artist]] [[Maurits Cornelis Escher]], usually referred to as M. C. Escher, is known for his often mathematically inspired [[woodcut]]s, [[lithography|lithographs]], and [[mezzotint]]s. These feature [[Impossible object|impossible constructions]], explorations of [[infinity]], architecture and [[tessellation]]s. His special way of thinking and rich graphic work has had a continuous influence in science and art, as well as permeating popular culture. His ideas have been used in fields as diverse as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], logic, [[crystallography]] and [[topology]]. His art is based on mathematical principles like tessellations, [[spherical geometry]], the [[Möbius strip]], unusual perspectives, visual [[paradox]]es and illusions, different kinds of symmetries and impossible objects. ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] discusses the ideas of self-reference and [[strange loop]]s, drawing on a wide range of artistic and scientific work, including Escher's art and the music of [[J. S. Bach]], to illustrate ideas behind [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

===== Miffy (Nijntje) (1955) =====
[[Miffy]] ([[Nijntje]]) is a small female rabbit in a series of picture books drawn and written by Dutch artist [[Dick Bruna]].

==== Music ====
===== Franco-Flemish School (Netherlandish School) (15th–16th century) =====

In music, the [[Franco-Flemish School]] or more precisely the [[Netherlandish school|Netherlandish School]] refers to the style of polyphonic vocal music composition in the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and to the composers who wrote it.

===== Venetian School (Venetian polychoral style) (16th century) =====
The [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] of [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral music]] was founded by the Netherlandish composer [[Adrian Willaert]].

===== Hardcore (electronic dance music genre) (1990s) =====
[[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|Hardcore]] or [[hardcore techno]] is a subgenre of [[electronic dance music]] originating in Europe from the emergent [[rave]]s in the 1990s. It was initially designed at [[Rotterdam]] in [[Netherlands]], derived from [[techno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gfl-journal.de/2-2002/robb.pdf|title=Techno in Germany:Its Musical Origins and Cultural Relevance|author=David Robb |pages=134–35 |year=2002 |accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hardstyle (electronic dance music genre) (1990s–2000s) =====
[[Hardstyle]] is an [[electronic dance music|electronic dance]] genre mixing influences from [[hardtechno]] and [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]]. Hardstyle was influenced by [[gabber]]. Hardstyle has its origins in the Netherlands where artists like [[DJ Zany]], [[Lady Dana]], DJ Isaac, DJ Pavo, DJ Luna and [[The Prophet (musician)|The Prophet]], who produced hardcore, started experimenting while playing their hardcore records.

=== Agriculture ===
==== Holstein Friesian cattle (2nd century BC) ====

[[File:Cow female black white.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A typical [[Holstein-Friesian]] cow. [[Holstein cattle]], a [[breed]] that now dominates the global [[dairy industry]], are most quickly recognized by their distinctive color markings and outstanding milk production.]]
[[Holstein cattle|Holsteins]] or [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein-Friesians]] are a [[List of cattle breeds|breed]] of [[cattle]] known today as the world's highest-production [[Dairy cattle|dairy]] animals. Originating in Europe, Holstein-Friesians were bred in the two northern provinces of [[North Holland]] and [[Friesland]], and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in what became Germany. The animals were the regional cattle of the [[Frisians]] and the [[Saxons]]. The origins of the [[breed]] can be traced to the black [[cows]] and white cows of the [[Batavians]] and [[Frisians]] – [[Germanic tribes|migrant tribes]] who settled the coastal Rhine region more than two thousand years ago.

==== Brussels sprout ( 13th century) ====
Forerunners to modern [[Brussels sprout]]s were likely cultivated in ancient [[Rome]]. [[Brussels sprout]]s as we now know them were grown possibly as early as the 13th century in the [[Low Countries]] (may have originated in [[Brussels]]). The first written reference dates to 1587. During the 16th century, they enjoyed a popularity in the [[Southern Netherlands]] that eventually spread throughout the cooler parts of [[Northern Europe]].

==== Orange-coloured carrot (16th century) ====
[[File:CarrotRoots.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Orange (colour)|Orange-coloured]] [[carrot]]s. Before the 18th century, carrots from Asia were usually purple, while those in Europe were either white or red. Dutch farmers bred a variety that was orange. The long orange Dutch carrot, first described in 1721, is the ancestor of the orange horn carrot, one of the most common types found in supermarkets today. It takes its name from the town of [[Hoorn]], in the Netherlands.]]
[[File:Carrots of many colors.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Carrots can be [[artificial selection|selectively bred]] to produce different colours.]]

Through history, [[carrot]]s weren’t always [[Orange (colour)|orange]]. They were [[black]], [[purple]], white, [[brown]], red and yellow. Probably orange too, but this was not the dominant colour. [[Orange (colour)|Orange-coloured]] carrots appeared in the [[Netherlands]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/royal-history-carrot |author=Tyler, John |title=''The royal history of the... carrot??'' |publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide |date= 3 Oct 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch farmers in [[Hoorn]] bred the color. They succeeded by cross-breeding pale [[yellow]] with [[red]] carrots. It is more likely that Dutch horticulturists actually found an orange rooted [[mutant]] variety and then worked on its development through [[selective breeding]] to make the plant consistent. Through successive hybridisation the orange colour intensified. This was developed to become the dominant species across the world, a sweet orange.

==== Belle de Boskoop (apple) (1856) ====
[[Belle de Boskoop]] is an [[List of apple cultivars|apple]] [[cultivar]] which, as its name suggests, originated in [[Boskoop]], where it began as a chance seedling in 1856. There are many variants: Boskoop red, yellow or green. This rustic apple is firm, tart and fragrant. Greenish-gray tinged with red, the apple stands up well to cooking. Generally Boskoop varieties are very high in acid content and can contain more than four times the vitamin C of '[[Granny Smith]]' or '[[Golden Delicious]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Violeta, N. O. U. R., Ion Trandafir, and Mira Elena Ionica. "Compositional characteristics of fruits of several apple (''Malus domestica'' Borkh.) cultivars." Notulae Botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca 38.3 (2010): 228–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Karmijn de Sonnaville (apple) (1949) ====
[[Karmijn de Sonnaville]] is a variety of [[List of apple cultivars|apple]] bred by Piet de Sonnaville, working in [[Wageningen]] in 1949. It is a cross of [[Cox's Orange Pippin]] and [[Jonathan (apple)|Jonathan]], and was first grown commercially beginning in 1971. It is high both in sugars (including some sucrose) and acidity. It is a [[triploid]], and hence needs good pollination, and can be difficult to grow. It also suffers from fruit [[russet apple|russet]], which can be severe. In Manhart's book, “apples for the 21st century”, Karmijn de Sonnaville is tipped as a possible success for the future. Karmijn de Sonnaville is not widely grown in large quantities, but in Ireland, at The Apple Farm, {{convert|8|acre|m2}} it is grown for fresh sale and juice-making, for which the variety is well suited.

==== Elstar (apple) (1950s) ====
[[Elstar]] [[apple]] is an [[List of apple cultivars|apple]] [[cultivar]] that was first developed in the Netherlands in the 1950s by crossing [[Golden Delicious]] and [[Ingrid Marie]] apples. It quickly became popular, especially in [[Europe]] and was first introduced to America in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cffresh.com/fresh/elstar_profile.html Elstar profile on cffresh.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509152948/http://www.cffresh.com/fresh/elstar_profile.html |date=9 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains popular in Continental Europe. The Elstar is a medium-sized apple whose skin is mostly red with yellow showing. The flesh is white, and has a soft, crispy texture. It may be used for cooking and is especially good for making [[apple sauce]]. In general, however, it is used in desserts due to its sweet flavour.

==== Groasis Waterboxx (2010) ====
The Groasis Waterboxx is a device designed to help grow trees in dry areas. It was developed by former flower exporter [[Pieter Hoff]], and won ''[[Popular Science]]'s'' "Green Tech Best of What's New" Innovation of the year award for 2010.

=== Cartography and geography ===
==== Method for determining longitude using a clock (1530) ====
The Dutch-Frisian geographer [[Gemma Frisius]] was the first to propose the use of a [[Clock|chronometer]] to determine [[longitude]] in 1530. In his book ''On the Principles of Astronomy and Cosmography'' (1530), Frisius explains for the first time how to use a very accurate [[History of timekeeping devices|clock]] to determine [[longitude]].&lt;ref&gt;Allaby, Michael (2009). ''Oceans: A Scientific History of Oceans and Marine Life (Discovering the Earth)''&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was that in Frisius’ day, no [[clock]] was sufficiently precise to use his method. In 1761, the British clock-builder [[John Harrison]] constructed the first [[marine chronometer]], which allowed the method developed by Frisius.

====Triangulation and the modern systematic use of triangulation networks (1533 &amp; 1615)'====
[[Triangulation]] had first emerged as a [[map making|map-making]] method in the mid sixteenth century when the Dutch-Frisian mathematician [[Gemma Frisius]] set out the idea in his ''Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione'' (''Booklet concerning a way of describing places'').&lt;ref&gt;Swann, G. M. Peter (2006). ''Putting Econometrics in Its Place: A New Direction in Applied Economics'', p. 29–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stachurski, Richard (2009). ''Longitude by Wire: Finding North America'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henzel, Cynthia Kennedy (2010). ''Creating Modern Maps'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bagrow, Leo (2010). ''History of Cartography'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Rachel (2011). ''Map of a Nation: A Biography of the Ordnance Survey''. "Triangulation had first emerged as a map-making method in the mid sixteenth century when the Flemish mathematician Gemma Frisius set out the idea in his ''Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione'' (''Booklet concerning a way of describing places''), and by the turn of the eighteenth century it had become the most respected surveying technique in use."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellos, Alex (2014). ''The Grapes of Math: How Life Reflects Numbers and Numbers Reflect Life'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch cartographer [[Jacob van Deventer (cartographer)|Jacob van Deventer]] was among the first to make systematic use of [[triangulation]], the technique whose theory was described by Gemma Frisius in his 1533 book.

The modern systematic use of [[triangulation network]]s stems from the work of the Dutch mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]] (born Willebrord Snel van Royen), who in 1615 surveyed the distance from [[Alkmaar]] to [[Bergen op Zoom]], approximately 70 miles (110 kilometres), using a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Richard Shelton et al.

The [[Mercator projection]] is a cylindrical [[map projection]] presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer [[Gerardus Mercator]] in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical purposes because of its ability to represent lines of constant [[Course (navigation)|course]], known as [[rhumb line]]s or loxodromes, as straight segments which conserve the angles with the [[meridian (geography)|meridians]].&lt;ref&gt;Haven, Kendall (2005). 100 Greatest Science Inventions of All Time, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==== First modern world atlas (1570) ====
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|right|200px|World map ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' by Ortelius (1570). The period of late 16th and much of the 17th century (approximately 1570–1672) has been called the "[[History of cartography#The golden age of Dutch and Flemish cartography (Netherlandish cartographic schools)|Golden Age of Dutch (Netherlandish) Cartography]]". The cartographers/publishers of [[Antwerp]] and [[Amsterdam]], especially, were leaders in supplying maps and charts for all of Western Europe.]]

Flemish geographer and cartographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] generally recognized as the creator of the world's first modern [[Atlas (cartography)|atlas]], the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' (''Theatre of the World''). Ortelius's ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' is considered the first true [[atlas]] in the modern sense: a collection of uniform map sheets and sustaining text bound to form a book for which copper printing plates were specifically engraved. It is sometimes referred to as the summary of sixteenth-century [[cartography]].&lt;ref&gt;Harwood, Jeremy (2006).

==== First printed atlas of nautical charts (1584) ====
[[File:1584 Portugal Waghenaer.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''Portugal'' by [[Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer|Waghenaer]] (1584). The publication of Waghenaer's ''De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt'' (1584) is widely considered as one of the most important developments in the history of nautical cartography.]]
The first printed [[atlas]] of [[nautical chart]]s (''De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt'' or ''The Mirror of Navigation'' / ''The Mariner's Mirror'') was produced by [[Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer]] in [[Leiden]]. This atlas was the first attempt to systematically codify nautical maps. This chart-book combined an atlas of nautical charts and sailing directions with instructions for navigation on the western and north-western coastal waters of Europe. It was the first of its kind in the history of maritime cartography, and was an immediate success. The English translation of Waghenaer's work was published in 1588 and became so popular that any volume of sea charts soon became known as a "waggoner", the Anglicized form of Waghenaer's surname.&lt;ref&gt;Struik, Dirk J.

[[Gerardus Mercator]] was the first to coin the word ''[[atlas]]'' to describe a bound collection of maps through his own collection entitled "Atlas sive Cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mvndi et fabricati figvra". He coined this name after the [[Atlas (mythology)|Greek god]] who held the earth in his arms.&lt;ref name="Thrower, Norman J. W. 2008 p. 81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harwood, Jeremy (2006).

==== First systematic charting of the far southern skies (southern constellations) (1595–97) ====
[[File:Constellations ecliptic equirectangular plot.svg|thumb|right|200px|The Dutch were the first to systematically observe and [[star map|map]] ([[star chart|chart]]) the largely unknown far southern skies in the late 16th century. Among the [[IAU]]'s [[88 modern constellations]], there are 15 Dutch-created [[constellations]], including 12 [[:Category:Southern constellations|southern constellations]].]]
The [[Dutch Republic]]'s explorers and cartographers like [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]], [[Frederick de Houtman]], [[Petrus Plancius]] and [[Jodocus Hondius]] were the pioneers in first systematic [[star chart|charting]]/mapping of largely unknown [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]] skies in the late 16th century.

The constellations around the [[South Pole]] were not observable from north of the [[equator]], by Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese or [[Arabs]]. The modern constellations in this region were defined during the [[Age of Exploration]], notably by Dutch navigators [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] at the end of sixteenth century. These twelve Dutch-created [[:Category:Southern constellations|southern constellations]] represented [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of the [[East Indies]] and [[Madagascar]]. They were depicted by [[Johann Bayer]] in his [[star atlas]] ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title = Bayer's southern star chart| author = Ian Ridpath}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several more were created by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in his star catalogue, published in 1756.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm | title = Lacaille's southern planisphere| author = Ian Ridpath}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Xu Guangqi]] introduced 23 asterisms of the southern sky based on the knowledge of western star charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sun | first=Xiaochun | editor=Helaine Selin | editor-link=Helaine Selin | title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | year=1997 | page=910 | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | isbn=0-7923-4066-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These asterisms have since been incorporated into the traditional Chinese star maps. Among the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s [[88 modern constellations]], there are 15 Dutch-created [[constellation]]s (including [[Apus]], [[Camelopardalis]], [[Chamaeleon]], [[Columba]], [[Dorado]], [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]], [[Hydrus]], [[Indus (constellation)|Indus]], [[Monoceros]], [[Musca]], [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]], [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]], [[Triangulum Australe]], [[Tucana]] and [[Volans]]).

==== Continental drift hypothesis (1596) ====
The speculation that [[continent]]s might have 'drifted' was first put forward by [[Abraham Ortelius]] in 1596. The concept was independently and more fully developed by [[Alfred Wegener]] in 1912. Because Wegener's publications were widely available in German and English and because he adduced geological support for the idea, he is credited by most geologists as the first to recognize the possibility of [[continental drift]]. During the 1960s geophysical and geological evidence for seafloor spreading at mid-oceanic ridges established continental drift as the standard theory or continental origin and an ongoing global mechanism.

While making a coloured liquid for a [[thermometer]], [[Cornelis Drebbel]] dropped a flask of [[Aqua regia]] on a [[tin]] window sill, and discovered that [[Tin(II) chloride|stannous chloride]] makes the color of [[carmine]] much brighter and more durable. Though Drebbel himself never made much from his work, his daughters Anna and Catharina and his sons-in-law Abraham and [[Johannes Sibertus Kuffler]] set up a successful [[dye]] works. One was set up in 1643 in [[Bow, London]], and the resulting color was called [[bow dye]].

==== Dyneema (1979) ====
Dutch chemical company [[DSM (company)|DSM]] invented and patented the [[Dyneema]] in 1979. Dyneema fibres have been in commercial production since 1990 at their plant at [[Heerlen]]. These [[fiber]]s are manufactured by means of a gel-spinning process that combines extreme strength with incredible softness. Dyneema fibres, based on [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] ([[UHMWPE]]), is used in many applications in markets such as life protection, shipping, fishing, offshore, sailing, medical and textiles.

==== Compact cassette (1962) ====

[[File:Tdkc60cassette.jpg|thumb|right|Compact Cassette]]

In 1962 [[Philips]] invented the [[compact audio cassette]] medium for [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio storage]], introducing it in Europe in August 1963 (at the [[Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin|Berlin Radio Show]]) and in the United States (under the ''[[Norelco]]'' brand) in November 1964, with the trademark name ''Compact Cassette''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Eric D.; Mee, C.

==== Laserdisc (1969) ====
[[History of optical recording|Laserdisc technology]], using a transparent disc,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3,430,966}} Transparent recording disc, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; was invented by [[David Paul Gregg]] in 1958 (and patented in 1961 and 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3,530,258}} Video signal transducer, 1970.&lt;br /&gt;{{US patent|4,893,297}} Disc-shaped member, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, [[Philips]] developed a videodisc in reflective mode, which has great advantages over the transparent mode. [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] and Philips decided to join forces. They first publicly demonstrated the videodisc in 1972. Laserdisc entered the market in Atlanta, on 15 December 1978, two years after the [[VHS]] [[VCR]] and four years before the [[CD]], which is based on Laserdisc technology. Philips produced the players and MCA made the discs.

==== Compact disc (1979) ====
[[File:OD Compact disc.svg|thumb|right|Compact Disc]]

The compact disc was jointly developed by [[Philips]] (Joop Sinjou) and [[Sony]] ([[Toshitada Doi]]). In the early 1970s, Philips' researchers started experiments with "audio-only" optical discs, and at the end of the 1970s, [[Philips]], [[Sony]], and other companies presented prototypes of digital audio discs.

==== Bluetooth (1990s) ====
[[Bluetooth]], a low-energy, [[peer-to-peer]] [[wireless]] technology was originally developed by Dutch electrical engineer [[Jaap Haartsen]] and Swedish engineer Sven Mattisson in the 1990s, working at [[Ericsson]] in [[Lund]], Sweden. It became a global standard of short distance [[wireless connection]].

==== Wi-fi (1990s) ====
In 1991, [[NCR Corporation]]/[[AT&amp;T Corporation]] invented the precursor to [[802.11]] in [[Nieuwegein]]. Dutch electrical engineer [[Vic Hayes]] chaired [[IEEE 802.11]] committee for 10 years, which was set up in 1990 to establish a wireless networking standard. He has been called the father of [[Wi-Fi]] (the brand name for products using [[IEEE 802.11]] standards) for his work on IEEE 802.11 (802.11a &amp; 802.11b) standard in 1997.

==== DVD (1995) ====
The [[DVD]] [[optical disc]] storage format was invented and developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] in 1995.

==== Ambilight (2002) ====
[[Ambilight]], short for "ambient lighting", is a lighting system for televisions developed by [[Philips]] in 2002.

==== Blu-ray (2006) ====
[[Philips]] and [[Sony]] in 1997 and 2006 respectively, launched the [[Blu-ray]] video recording/playback standard.

=== Computer science and information technology ===
==== Dijkstra's algorithm (1956) ====

[[Dijkstra's algorithm]], conceived by Dutch computer scientist [[Edsger Dijkstra]] in 1956 and published in 1959, is a [[graph search algorithm]] that solves the single-source [[shortest path problem]] for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a [[shortest path tree]]. Dijkstra's algorithm is so powerful that it not only finds the shortest path from a chosen source to a given destination, it finds all of the shortest paths from the source to all destinations. This algorithm is often used in [[routing]] and as a [[subroutine]] in other [[graph algorithms]].

Dijkstra's algorithm is considered as one of the most popular [[algorithm]]s in [[computer science]]. It is also widely used in the fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[operational research]]/[[operations research]], [[network routing]], [[network analysis (electronics)|network analysis]], and [[transportation engineering]].

==== Foundations of distributed computing (1960s) ====
Through his fundamental contributions [[Edsger Dijkstra]] helped shape the field of [[computer science]]. His groundbreaking contributions ranged from the engineering side of computer science to the [[Theoretical computer science|theoretical one]] and covered several areas including [[compiler construction]], [[operating systems]], [[distributed systems]], sequential and [[concurrent programming]], [[software engineering]], and [[graph algorithms]]. Many of his papers, often just a few pages long, are the source of whole new research areas. Several concepts that are now completely standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra and/or bear names coined by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/10/obituaries/10DIJK.html |author=Markoff, John |title=''Edsger Dijkstra: Physicist Who Shaped Computer Era'' |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=10 August 2002 |accessdate=10 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/aug/19/guardianobituaries.obituaries1 |author=Schofield, Jack |title=''Edsger Dijkstra: Pioneering computer programmer who made his subject intellectually respectable'' |publisher=The Guardian |date=19 August 2002 |accessdate=19 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edsger Dijkstra's foundational work on [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]], [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], [[mutual exclusion]], deadlock, finding shortest paths in graphs, [[fault-tolerance]], [[self-stabilization]], among many other contributions comprises many of the pillars upon which the field of [[distributed computing]] is built. The [[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]] (sponsored jointly by the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] and the [[EATCS]] [[International Symposium on Distributed Computing]]) is given for outstanding papers on the principles of distributed computing, whose significance and impact on the theory and/or practice of distributed computing has been evident for at least a decade.

==== Foundations of concurrent programming (1960s) ====
The academic study of [[concurrent programming]] ([[concurrent algorithm]]s in particular) started in the 1960s, with [[Edsger Dijkstra]] (1965) credited with being the first paper in this field, identifying and solving [[mutual exclusion]].&lt;ref name="PODC Influential Paper Award: 2002"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.podc.org/influential/2002.html | title=PODC Influential Paper Award: 2002 | work=ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing | accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pioneer in the field of [[concurrent computing]], [[Per Brinch Hansen]] considers Dijkstra's ''Cooperating Sequential Processes'' (1965) to be the first classic paper in [[concurrent programming]]. As Brinch Hansen notes: ‘Here Dijkstra lays the conceptual foundation for abstract concurrent programming.’&lt;ref&gt;[[Per Brinch Hansen|Brinch Hansen, Per]] (2002). ''The Origin of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls''. (Springer)., p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Foundations of software engineering (1960s) ====
[[Computer programming]] in the 1950s to 1960s was not recognized as an academic discipline and unlike physics there were no theoretical concepts or coding systems. Dijkstra was one of the moving forces behind the acceptance of computer programming as a scientific discipline. In 1968, computer programming was in a [[software crisis|state of crisis]]. Dijkstra was one of a small group of academics and industrial programmers who advocated a new [[programming style]] to improve the quality of programs. Dijkstra coined the phrase "[[structured programming]]" and during the 1970s this became the new programming orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth|Knuth, Donald]] (1974). ''Structured Programming with Go To Statements''. Computing Surveys 6 (4): 261–301. doi:10.1145/356635.356640. "A revolution is taking place in the way we write programs and teach programming, because we are beginning to understand the associated mental processes more deeply. It is impossible to read the recent [E. W. Dijkstra, O.-J. Dahl, and C. A. R. Hoare] book ''Structured Programming'', without having it change your life. The reason for this revolution and its future prospects have been aptly described by E.W. Dijkstra in his 1972 Turing Award Lecture, ''The Humble Programmer''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harlan Mills|Mills, Harlan D.]] (1986). ''Structured Programming: Retrospect and Prospect''. (IEEE Software 3(6): 58–66, November 1986). "Edsger W. Dijkstra's 1969 "Structured Programming" article precipitated a decade of intense focus on programming techniques that has fundamentally altered human expectations and achievements in software development. &lt;br /&gt; Before this decade of intense focus, programming was regarded as a private, puzzle-solving activity of writing computer instructions to work as a program. After this decade, programming could be regarded as a public, mathematics-based activity of restructuring specifications into programs. &lt;br /&gt; Before, the challenge was in getting programs to run at all, and then in getting them further debugged to do the right things. After, programs could be expected to both run and do the right things with little or no debugging. Before, it was common wisdom that no sizable program could be error-free. After, many sizable programs have run a year or more with no errors detected. &lt;br /&gt; These expectations and achievements are not universal because of the inertia of industrial practices. But they are well-enough established to herald fundamental change in software development."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Edwin D. (2004). ''Concise Encyclopedia of Computer Science''. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.), p. 734. "The major contributions of structured programming have been twofold – the elevation of programming technique to something less of an art and more of a science, and the demonstration that carefully structured programs can be creative works of sufficient literary merit to deserve being read by humans and not just by computer."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broy, Manfred; Denert, Ernst (eds.) (2002). ''Software Pioneers: Contributions to Software Engineering'', p. 19. (Springer)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.triz-journal.com/software-engineering-triz-1-structured-programming-reviewed-triz/ |author=Nakagawa, Toru |title=''Software Engineering And TRIZ (1) – Structured Programming Reviewed With TRIZ'' |publisher=TRIZ Journal |date=18 July 2005 |accessdate=18 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Bertrand Meyer]] remarked: "The revolution in views of programming started by Dijkstra's iconoclasm led to a movement known as structured programming, which advocated a systematic, rational approach to program construction. Structured programming is the basis for all that has been done since in [[programming methodology]], including [[object-oriented programming]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Meyer|Meyer, Bertrand]] (2009). ''Touch of Class: Learning to Program Well with Objects and Contracts''. (Springer), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dijkstra's ideas about structured programming helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the professional discipline of [[software engineering]], enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects.&lt;ref&gt;Hashagen, Ulf; Keil-Slawik, Reinhard; Norberg, A. (eds.) (2002). ''History of Computing: Software Issues (International Conference on the History of Computing, ICHC 2000 April 5–7, 2000 Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum Paderborn, Germany)''. (Springer), p. 106. "Structured programming is a topic which links the histories of software as science, software as engineering, software dependability, and, perhaps above all, software as labour process."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Harry (2009). ''Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology'', revised edition. (Facts on File, Inc.), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shunting-yard algorithm (1960) ====
In [[computer science]], the [[shunting-yard algorithm]] is a method for parsing mathematical expressions specified in [[infix notation]]. It can be used to produce output in [[Reverse Polish notation]] (RPN) or as an [[abstract syntax tree]] (AST). The [[algorithm]] was invented by [[Edsger Dijkstra]] and named the "shunting yard" algorithm because its operation resembles that of a [[classification yard|railroad shunting yard]]. Dijkstra first described the Shunting Yard Algorithm in the [[Mathematisch Centrum]] report.

==== Schoonschip (early computer algebra system) (1963) ====
In 1963/64, during an extended stay at SLAC, Dutch theoretical physicist [[Martinus Veltman]] designed the computer program ''[[Schoonschip]]'' for symbolic manipulation of mathematical equations, which is now considered the very first [[computer algebra system]].

==== Mutual exclusion (mutex) (1965) ====
In [[computer science]], [[mutual exclusion]] refers to the requirement of ensuring that no two [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] [[process (computing)|processes]] are in their [[critical section]] at the same time; it is a basic requirement in [[concurrency control]], to prevent [[race condition]]s. The requirement of mutual exclusion was first identified and solved by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] in his seminal 1965 paper titled ''Solution of a problem in concurrent programming control'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=E. W.|title=Solution of a problem in concurrent programming control|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=8|issue=9|page=569|doi=10.1145/365559.365617|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taubenfeld:2004"&gt;Taubenfeld, [http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~afek/gadi.pdf The Black-White Bakery Algorithm]. In Proc. Distributed Computing, 18th international conference, DISC 2004. Vol 18, 56–70, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited as the first topic in the study of [[concurrent algorithm]]s.&lt;ref name="PODC Influential Paper Award: 2002"/&gt;

==== Semaphore (programming) (1965) ====
The [[semaphore (programming)|semaphore]] concept was invented by Dijkstra in 1965 and the concept has found widespread use in a variety of operating systems.

==== Sleeping barber problem (1965) ====
In [[computer science]], the [[sleeping barber problem]] is a classic [[inter-process communication]] and [[synchronization]] problem between multiple [[operating system]] [[Process (computing)|processes]]. The problem is analogous to that of keeping a barber working when there are customers, resting when there are none and doing so in an orderly manner. The [[sleeping barber problem|Sleeping Barber Problem]] was introduced by [[Edsger Dijkstra]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;McHoes, Ann; Flynn, Ida M. (2014). ''Understanding Operating Systems'' (7th edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Banker's algorithm (deadlock prevention algorithm) (1965) ====
The [[Banker's algorithm]] is a [[resource allocation]] and [[deadlock]] avoidance [[algorithm]] developed by [[Edsger Dijkstra]] that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all [[resource (computer science)|resources]], and then makes an "s-state" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue. The algorithm was developed in the design process for the [[THE multiprogramming system]] and originally described (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) in EWD108.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|108|Een algorithme ter voorkoming van de dodelijke omarming}} (in Dutch; ''An algorithm for the prevention of the [[deadly embrace]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; The name is by analogy with the way that bankers account for [[liquidity]] constraints.

==== Dining philosophers problem (1965) ====
In [[computer science]], the [[dining philosophers problem]] is an example problem often used in [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] algorithm design to illustrate [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] issues and techniques for resolving them. It was originally formulated in 1965 by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]] as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers [[resource contention|competing for access]] to [[tape drive]] peripherals.
Soon after, [[Tony Hoare]] gave the problem its present formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EWD|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Díaz|author2=I. Ramos|title=Formalization of Programming Concepts: International Colloquium, Peniscola, Spain, April 19–25, 1981.

==== Dekker's algorithm (1965) ====
[[Dekker's algorithm]] is the first known correct solution to the [[mutual exclusion]] problem in [[concurrent programming]]. Dijkstra attributed the solution to Dutch mathematician [[Theodorus Dekker]] in his manuscript on cooperating sequential processes. It allows two threads to share a single-use resource without conflict, using only [[shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] for communication. Dekker's algorithm is the first published software-only, two-process mutual exclusion algorithm.

==== THE multiprogramming system (1968) ====
The [[THE multiprogramming system]] was a computer [[operating system]] designed by a team led by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]], described in monographs in 1965–66&lt;ref name="ewd196"&gt;

==== Van Wijngaarden grammar (1968) ====
[[Van Wijngaarden grammar]] (also vW-grammar or W-grammar) is a [[two-level grammar]] that provides a technique to define potentially infinite [[context-free grammar]]s in a finite number of rules. The formalism was invented by [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]] to rigorously define some syntactic restrictions that previously had to be formulated in [[natural language]], despite their formal content. Typical applications are the treatment of gender and number in natural language syntax and the well-definedness of identifiers in programming languages. The technique was used and developed in the definition of the [[programming language]] [[ALGOL 68]]. It is an example of the larger class of [[affix grammar]]s.

==== Structured programming (1968) ====
In 1968, [[computer programming]] was in a [[software crisis|state of crisis]]. Dijkstra was one of a small group of academics and industrial programmers who advocated a new [[programming style]] to improve the quality of programs. Dijkstra coined the phrase "[[structured programming]]" and during the 1970s this became the new programming orthodoxy. [[Structured programming]] is often regarded as “goto-less programming”. But as Bertrand Meyer notes, “As the first book on the topic [''Structured Programming'' by Dijkstra, Dahl, and Hoare] shows, structured programming is about much more than control structures and the [[goto]]. Its principal message is that programming should be considered a scientific discipline based on mathematical rigor.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Meyer|Meyer, Bertrand]] (2009), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[:Category:Structured programming languages|As a programming paradigm]], structured programming – especially in the 1970s and 1980s – significantly influenced the birth of many modern [[programming languages]] such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]],&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, Barbara G.; Soffa, Mary Lou; [[Margaret Burnett|Burnett, Margaret]] (2005). ''Impact of Software Engineering Research on Modern Programming Languages''. ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, Vol. 14, No. 4, October 2005, p. 431–77. "Of great influence to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] was [[Structured Programming]], put forth by E. W. Dijkstra. This method of proceeding in a design would obliviously be greatly encouraged by the use of a [[:Category:Structured programming languages|Structured Language]], a language with a set of constructs that could freely be combined and nested. The textual structure of a program should directly reflect its flow of control."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Niklaus Wirth|Wirth, Niklaus]] (2008). ''A Brief History of Software Engineering''. IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, vol.30, no. 3, July–September 2008, p. 32–39. "In 1965 Dijkstra wrote his famous ''Notes on Structured Programming'' and declared programming as a discipline in contrast to a craft. Also in 1965 Hoare published an important paper about data structuring. These ideas had a profound influence on new programming language, in particular [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Languages are the vehicles in which these ideas were to be expressed. [[Structured programming]] became supported by a [[:Category:Structured programming languages|structured programming language]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Modula-2]], and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]].&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Edwin D. (2004), p. 734. "The first significant SP [Structured Programming] language was [[Algol 60]] (q.v.). Subsequently developed SP languages in current use are [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]] (q.v.), [[C++]] (q.v.), [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (q.v.)."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fortran 77]] version which incorporates the concepts of structured programming, was released in 1978. The [[C++]] language was a considerably extended and enhanced version of the popular [[:Category:Structured programming languages|structured programming language]] [[C (programming language)|C]] (see also: [[list of C-based programming languages]]). Since C++ was developed from a more traditional [[:Category:Structured programming languages|structured language]], it is a '[[Multi-paradigm programming language|hybrid language]]', rather than a pure [[object-oriented programming]] language.&lt;ref&gt;Graba, Jan (1998). ''Up and Running with C++''. (Springer), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==== EPROM (1971) ====
An ''[[EPROM]]'' or ''erasable programmable [[read only memory]]'', is a type of memory [[integrated circuit|chip]] that retains its data when its [[power supply]] is switched off. Development of the EPROM memory cell started with investigation of faulty [[integrated circuits]] where the gate connections of [[transistor]]s had broken. Stored charge on these isolated gates changed their properties. The EPROM was invented by the [[Amsterdam]]-born Israeli electrical engineer [[Dov Frohman]] in 1971, who was awarded US patent 3660819&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=vcwtAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = EPROM patent | publisher = Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1972.

==== Self-stabilization (1974) ====
[[Self-stabilization]] is a concept of [[fault-tolerance]] in [[distributed computing]]. A distributed system that is self-stabilizing will end up in a correct [[State (computer science)|state]] no matter what state it is initialized with. That correct state is reached after a finite number of execution steps. Many years after the seminal paper of [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]] in 1974, this concept remains important as it presents an important foundation for [[Self-management (computer science)|self-managing computer systems]] and [[fault-tolerant system]]s. [[Self-stabilization]] became its own area of study in [[distributed systems]] research, and Dijkstra set the stage for the next generation of computer scientists such as [[Leslie Lamport]], [[Nancy Lynch]], and [[Shlomi Dolev]]. As a result, Dijkstra's paper received the 2002 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[PODC Influential-Paper Award]] (later renamed as ''[[Dijkstra Prize]]'' or ''[[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]]'' since 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.podc.org/influential/2002.html | title=PODC Influential Paper Award: 2002 | work=ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing | accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Predicate transformer semantics (1975) ====
[[Predicate (mathematical logic)|Predicate]] transformer semantics were introduced by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]] in his seminal paper "[[Guarded commands|Guarded commands, nondeterminacy and formal derivation of programs]]".

==== Guarded Command Language (1975) ====
The [[Guarded Command Language]] (GCL) is a language defined by [[Edsger Dijkstra]] for [[predicate transformer semantics]].&lt;ref name="EWD472"&gt;{{cite web | last=Dijkstra | first=Edsger W | authorlink=E.

==== Van Emde Boas tree (VEB tree) (1975) ====
A ''[[Van Emde Boas tree]]'' (or ''Van Emde Boas priority queue'', also known as a ''vEB tree'', is a [[tree data structure]] which implements an [[associative array]] with ''m''-bit integer keys. The [[vEB tree]] was invented by a team led by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] computer scientist [[Peter van Emde Boas]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van Emde Boas | first1 = Peter | authorlink = Peter van Emde Boas | year = 1975 | title = Preserving order in a forest in less than logarithmic time | url = | journal = Proceedings of the 16th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 75–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ABC (programming language) (1980s) ====
[[ABC (programming language)|ABC]] is an imperative general-purpose [[programming language]] and [[integrated development environment|programming environment]] developed at [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]], [[Netherlands]] by [[Leo Geurts]], [[Lambert Meertens]], and [[Steven Pemberton]]. It is interactive, structured, high-level, and intended to be used instead of [[BASIC]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], or [[AWK]]. It is not meant to be a systems-programming language but is intended for teaching or prototyping.

The language had a major influence on the design of the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] (as a counterexample); [[Guido van Rossum]], who developed Python, previously worked for several years on the ABC system in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;66665771 The A-Z of Programming Languages: Python] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229095320/http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id%3B66665771 |date=29 December 2008 }}.

==== Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm (1980) ====
The [[Dijkstra–Scholten algorithm]] (named after [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] and [[Carel S. Scholten]]) is an [[algorithm]] for detecting [[Termination analysis|termination]] in a [[distributed system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach|first=Sukumar|last=Ghosh|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|contribution=9.3.1 The Dijkstra–Scholten Algorithm|pages=140–143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVjVzuav7cIC&amp;pg=PA140|isbn=9781420010848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Distributed Algorithms: An Intuitive Approach|first=Wan|last=Fokkink|publisher=MIT Press|year=2013|isbn=9780262318952|pages=38–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqNWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|contribution=6.1 Dijkstra–Scholten algorithm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[algorithm]] was proposed by Dijkstra and Scholten in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==== Smoothsort (1981) ====
[[Smoothsort]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|796a|Smoothsort – an alternative to sorting in situ}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[comparison sort|comparison-based]] [[sorting algorithm]]. It is a variation of [[heapsort]] developed by [[Edsger Dijkstra]] in 1981. Like heapsort, smoothsort's upper bound is [[Big O notation|O]](''n'' log&amp;nbsp;''n''). The advantage of smoothsort is that it comes closer to O(''n'') time if the [[Adaptive sort|input is already sorted to some degree]], whereas heapsort averages O(''n'' log&amp;nbsp;''n'') regardless of the initial sorted state.

==== Amsterdam Compiler Kit (1983) ====
The [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] (ACK) is a fast, lightweight and [[retargeting|retargetable compiler]] suite and toolchain developed by [[Andrew Tanenbaum]] and [[Ceriel Jacobs]] at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in [[Amsterdam]]. It is [[MINIX]]'s native [[toolchain]]. The ACK was originally closed-source software (that allowed [[executable|binaries]] to be distributed for MINIX as a special case), but in April 2003 it was released under an [[Open-source license|open-source]] [[BSD licenses|BSD]] license. It has frontends for [[programming language]]s [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Modula-2]], [[Occam (programming language)|Occam]], and [[BASIC]]. The ACK's notability stems from the fact that in the early 1980s it was one of the first portable compilation systems designed to support multiple source languages and target platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.V Aho, R.

==== Eight-to-fourteen modulation (1985) ====
EFM ([[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation]]) was invented by Dutch electrical engineer [[Kees A. Schouhamer Immink]] in 1985. EFM is a data encoding technique – formally, a [[channel code]] – used by CDs, laserdiscs and pre-[[Hi-MD]] [[MiniDisc]]s.

==== MINIX (1987) ====
[[MINIX]] (from "mini-[[Unix]]") is a [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]] based on a [[microkernel]] [[Software architecture|architecture]]. Early versions of MINIX were created by [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]] for educational purposes. Starting with [[MINIX 3]], the primary aim of development shifted from education to the creation of a [[high availability|highly reliable]] and self-healing microkernel OS. MINIX is now developed as [[open-source software]]. MINIX was first released in 1987, with its complete source code made available to universities for study in courses and research. It has been [[free and open-source software]] since it was re-licensed under the [[BSD license]] in April 2000. Tanenbaum created MINIX at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in [[Amsterdam]] to exemplify the principles conveyed in his [[textbook]], ''[[Operating Systems: Design and Implementation]]'' (1987), that [[Linus Torvalds]] described as "the book that launched me to new heights".

==== Amoeba (operating system) (1989) ====
[[Amoeba (operating system)|Amoeba]] is a [[distributed operating system]] developed by [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]] and others at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in [[Amsterdam]]. The aim of the Amoeba project was to build a [[timesharing]] system that makes an entire network of computers appear to the user as a [[Single-system image|single machine]]. The [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] was originally developed for this platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place |title=Why was Python created in the first place? |publisher=Python FAQ |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223222507/http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/ |archivedate=23 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Python supports multiple [[programming paradigm]]s, including [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], [[imperative programming|imperative]] and [[functional programming]] or [[procedural programming|procedural]] styles. It features a [[dynamic type]] system and automatic [[memory management]] and has a large and comprehensive [[standard library]].

Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by [[Guido van Rossum]] at [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]] in the [[Netherlands]] as a successor to the [[ABC (programming language)|ABC language]] (itself inspired by [[SETL]]) capable of [[exception handling]] and interfacing with the [[Amoeba (operating system)|Amoeba operating system]]. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, ''[[benevolent dictator for life]]'' (BDFL).

==== Vim (text editor) (1991) ====
[[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] is a [[text editor]] written by the Dutch [[free software]] programmer [[Bram Moolenaar]] and first released publicly in 1991. Based on the [[Vi]] editor common to [[Unix-like]] systems, Vim carefully separated the user interface from editing functions.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} This allowed it to be used both from a [[command line interface]] and as a standalone application in a [[graphical user interface]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[Blender (software)|Blender]] is a professional [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[3D computer graphics software]] product used for creating [[animated films]], [[visual effects]], art, 3D printed models, interactive 3D applications and [[video games]]. Blender's features include [[3D modeling]], [[UV mapping|UV unwrapping]], [[Texture mapping|texturing]], [[Raster graphics editor|raster graphics editing]], [[Skeletal animation|rigging and skinning]], [[Fluid simulation|fluid and smoke simulation]], [[Particle system|particle]] simulation, [[Soft body dynamics|soft body]] simulation, [[Digital sculpting|sculpting]], [[Computer animation|animating]], [[match moving]], [[camera tracking]], [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], [[video editing software|video editing]] and [[compositing]]. Alongside the modelling features it also has an integrated [[Game Blender|game engine]]. Blender has been successfully used in the [[media industry]] in several parts of the world including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Russia, Sweden, and the United States.

The Dutch animation studio [[Neo Geo (animation studio)|Neo Geo]] and Not a Number Technologies (NaN) developed Blender as an in-house application, with the primary author being [[Ton Roosendaal]]. The name ''Blender'' was inspired by a song by [[Yello]], from the album ''[[Baby (Yello album)|Baby]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsbestlogos.blogspot.com/2007/10/blender-logo.html |title=Brief history of the Blender logo |accessdate=January 18, 2007 |last=Kassenaar |first=Joeri |date=May 21, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023161523/http://worldsbestlogos.blogspot.com/2007/10/blender-logo.html |archivedate=23 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== EFMPlus (1995) ====
[[EFMPlus]] is the [[channel code]] used in DVDs and [[Super Audio CD|SACDs]], a more efficient successor to EFM used in CDs. It was created by Dutch electrical engineer [[Kees A. Schouhamer Immink]], who also designed EFM. It is 6% less efficient than [[Toshiba]]'s [[Super Density Disc|SD]] code, which resulted in a capacity of 4.7 gigabytes instead of SD's original 5 GB. The advantage of [[EFMPlus]] is its superior resilience against disc damage such as scratches and fingerprints.

==== Dutch East India Company ====

[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A [[bond (finance)|bond]] from the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), dating from 7 November 1623. The VOC was the first company in history to actually issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]] to the general public. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. The VOC was also the first company to use a fully-fledged [[capital market]] (including the [[bond market]] and the [[stock market]]) as a crucial channel to raise medium-term and long-term funds.]]

==== First megacorporation (1602) ====
[[Image:Münze Niederländische Ostindien Companie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[coin]] ([[duit]]) minted in 1744 by the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]].]]

The [[Dutch East India Company]] was arguably the first [[megacorporation]], possessing quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, coin money and establish colonies. Many economic and political historians consider the [[Dutch East India Company]] as the most valuable, powerful and influential [[corporation]] in the world history.

The VOC existed for almost 200 years from its founding in 1602, when the [[States-General of the Netherlands]] granted it a 21-year monopoly over Dutch operations in Asia until its demise in 1796. During those two centuries (between 1602 and 1796), the VOC sent almost a million Europeans to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships, and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the [[Kingdom of England|English]] (later [[Territorial evolution of the British Empire|British]]) [[East India Company]], the VOC's nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Van Boven |first=M.

==== Dutch auction (17th century) ====
A [[Dutch auction]] is also known as an ''open descending price auction''. Named after the famous [[auction]]s of Dutch [[tulip]] bulbs in the 17th century, it is based on a pricing system devised by Nobel Prize–winning economist [[William Vickrey]]. In the traditional Dutch [[auction]], the auctioneer begins with a high asking price which is lowered until some participant is willing to accept the auctioneer's price. The winning participant pays the last announced price. Dutch auction is also sometimes used to describe online auctions where several identical goods are sold simultaneously to an equal number of high bidders. In addition to cut flower sales in the Netherlands, Dutch auctions have also been used for perishable commodities such as fish and tobacco.

==== First modern art market (17th century) ====
The [[Dutch Republic]] was the birthplace of the first modern [[Economics of the arts and literature#The Market of Artworks|art market]] (''open art market'' or ''free art market''). The seventeenth-century Dutch were the pioneering [[arts]] [[Marketing|marketers]], successfully combining [[art]] and [[commerce]] together as we would recognise it today.&lt;ref&gt;North, Michael (1999). ''Art and Commerce in the Dutch Golden Age''. Translated by Catherine Hill. (Yale University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century, commissioning works of art was largely the preserve of the church, monarchs and aristocrats. The emergence of a powerful and wealthy middle class in [[Holland]], though, produced a radical change in [[patronage]] as the new Dutch bourgeoisie bought art. For the first time, the direction of art was shaped by relatively broadly-based demand rather than religious dogma or royal whim, and the result was a market which today's dealers and collectors would find familiar. With the creation of the first large-scale open art market, prosperous Dutch merchants, artisans, and civil servants bought paintings and prints in unprecedented numbers. Foreign visitors were astonished that even modest members of Dutch society such as farmers and bakers owned multiple works of art.

==== Concept of corporate governance (17th century) ====
The seventeenth-century Dutch businessmen were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern [[corporate governance]]. [[Isaac Le Maire]], an Amsterdam businessman and a sizeable shareholder of the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]], became the first recorded investor to actually consider the [[corporate governance]]'s problems. In 1609, he complained of the VOC's shoddy [[corporate governance]]. On January 24, 1609, Le Maire filed a petition against the VOC, marking the first recorded expression of [[shareholder activism]]. In what is the first recorded [[corporate governance]] dispute, Le Maire formally charged that the directors (the VOC's board of directors – the Heeren XVII) sought to “retain another’s money for longer or use it ways other than the latter wishes” and petitioned for the liquidation of the VOC in accordance with standard business practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gelderblom, Oscar; De Jong, Abe; Jonker, Joost (2010). ''Putting Le Maire into Perspective: Business Organization and the Evolution of Corporate Governance in the Dutch Republic, 1590–1610'', in J. Koppell, ed., ''Origins of Shareholder Advocacy''.

(ed.), (2012). ''The Oxford Handbook of Capitalism'', p. 333. (New York: Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[shareholder revolt]] happened in 1622, among Dutch East India Company (VOC) investors who complained that the company account books had been “smeared with bacon” so that they might be “eaten by dogs.” The investors demanded a “reeckeninge,” a proper financial audit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/no-accounting-skills-no-moral-reckoning/ |author=Soll, Jacob |title=''No Accounting Skills? No Moral Reckoning'' |publisher=The New York Times |date=27 April 2014 |accessdate=10 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1622 campaign by the [[shareholder]]s of the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] is a testimony of genesis of [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] ([[Corporate Social Responsibility]]) in which shareholders staged protests by distributing pamphlets and complaining about management self enrichment and secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;De Jongh, Matthijs (2010). ''Shareholder Activism at the Dutch East India Company 1622–1625'', in ''Origins of Shareholder Advocacy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern concept of foreign direct investment (17th century) ====
The construction in 1619 of a train-oil factory on [[Smeerenburg]] in the [[Spitsbergen]] islands by the [[Noordsche Compagnie]], and the acquisition in 1626 of [[Manhattan Island]] by the [[Dutch West India Company]] are referred to as the earliest cases of [[foreign direct investment|outward foreign direct investment]] (FDI) in Dutch and world history. Throughout the seventeenth century, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the [[Dutch West India Company]] (GWIC/WIC) also began to create trading settlements around the globe. Their trading activities generated enormous wealth, making the [[Dutch Republic]] one of the most prosperous countries of that time. The Dutch Republic's extensive [[arms industry|arms trade]] occasioned an episode in the industrial development of early-modern Sweden, where arms merchants like [[Louis De Geer (1587–1652)|Louis de Geer]] and the Trip brothers, invested in iron mines and iron works, another early example of [[foreign direct investment|outward foreign direct investment]].

==== First modern market-oriented economy (17th century) ====
It was in the [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500–1815)|Dutch Republic]] that some important industries ([[economic sectors]]) such as [[shipbuilding]], [[shipping]], [[printing]] and [[publishing]] were developed on a large-scale export-driven model for the first time in history. The ship building district of [[Zaan]], near [[Amsterdam]], became the first [[industrialized area]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt; with around 900 industrial windmills at the end of the 17th century, but there were industrialized towns and cities on a smaller scale also. Other industries that saw significant growth were [[papermaking]], [[Sugarcane|sugar refining]], printing, the [[linen]] industry (with spin-offs in vegetable oils, like [[flax]] and [[Rapeseed|rape oil]]), and industries that used the cheap peat fuel, like [[brewing]] and [[ceramic]]s ([[brickworks]], [[pottery]] and [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|clay-pipe making]]).

The Dutch [[shipbuilding]] industry was of modern dimensions, inclining strongly toward standardised, repetitive methods. It was highly mechanized and used many labor-saving devices-wind-powered [[sawmill]]s, powered feeders for saw, block and tackles, great cranes to move heavy timbers-all of which increased productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (2011). ''The Modern World-System II: Mercantilism and the Consolidation of the European World-Economy, 1600–1750'', p. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch [[shipbuilding]] benefited from various design innovations which increased carrying capacity and cut costs.&lt;ref name="Unger, Richard W. 1996 p. 75–93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kotilane, J.

==== First modern economic miracle (1585–1714) ====
The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[economic growth|economic transition]] from a possession of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 1590s to the foremost maritime and economic power in the world has been called the “Dutch [[Economic miracle|Miracle]]” (or “Dutch [[Tiger economy|Tiger]]”) by many economic historians, including [[K. W. Swart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dianamuirappelbaum.com/?p=583 |author=[[K. W.

''Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis'', p. 109. "In 1602, exploiting their advantage against the declining Spanish and Portuguese maritime powers, the citizens of Holland founded the Dutch East India Company, quickly gaining a monopoly over most of Europe's trade with Asia. This incredible commercial opportunity inspired and financially underpinned the creation in Holland of the first mercantile capitalist nation. This was arguably the most important event in the economic history of the world up to that point."&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch economist [[Jan Tinbergen]] developed the first national comprehensive [[macroeconomic model]], which he first built for the Netherlands and after [[World War II]] later applied to the United States and the United Kingdom.

==== Fairtrade certification (1988) ====
The concept of ''fair trade'' has been around for over 40 years, but a formal labelling scheme emerged only in the 1980s. At the initiative of Mexican coffee farmers, the world's first Fairtrade labeling organisation, [[Stichting Max Havelaar]], was launched in the Netherlands on 15 November 1988 by [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans van der Hoff]] and Dutch ecumenical development agency [[Solidaridad]]. It was branded "[[Max Havelaar]]" after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee pickers in Dutch colonies.

==== Concept of bourse ( 13th century) ====

An ''[[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]]'', or ''[[Stock exchange|bourse]]'', is a highly organized [[Market (economics)|market]] where (especially) tradable [[Security (finance)|securities]], [[commodities]], [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], [[futures contract|futures]], and [[Option (finance)|options]] contracts are sold and bought. The term ''bourse'' is derived from the 13th-century inn named ''[[Huis ter Beurze]]'' in [[Bruges]], [[Low Countries]], where traders and foreign merchants from across Europe conducted business in the late medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bourse&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Bourse.] Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The building, which was established by Robert van der Buerze as a hostelry, had operated from 1285. Its managers became famous for offering judicious financial advice to the traders and merchants who frequented the building. This service became known as the "Beurze Purse" which is the basis of ''bourse'', meaning an organised place of exchange.

Although bond sales by municipalities and states can be traced to the thirteenth century, the origin of modern [[stock exchanges]] that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in [[corporate securities]] goes back to the formation of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in the year 1602.&lt;ref name="Nadesan, Majia Holmer 2008 p. 48"&gt;Nadesan, Majia Holmer (2008).

"The truly revolutionary innovation of Amsterdam's stock market lay in the fact that it became the world's first market in the sale of company shares: a secondary securities market. If a company's shares of stock are frozen, its ownership is frozen and the business is a private affair. But if those shares, or derivatives based on them, can be resold, then you have a financial marketplace, which is a kind of living thing, constantly churning. It can then become a means of individual expression and power, allowing for anyone with a few extra coins to play a part in the great economic drama society."&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch investors were the first to trade their [[Share (finance)|shares]] at a regular [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|stock exchange]].&lt;ref name="Micklethwait, John 2003"&gt;Micklethwait, John; Wooldridge, Adrian (2003). ''The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] is considered the oldest in the world. It was established in 1602 by the [[Dutch East India Company]] for dealings in its printed stocks and bonds. Here, the Dutch also pioneered [[Futures contract|stock futures]], [[stock options]], [[short selling]], debt-equity swaps, [[merchant banking]], [[bond (finance)|bonds]], unit [[trust law|trusts]] and other [[speculation|speculative instruments]]. Unlike the competing companies, the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] allowed anyone (including [[housemaid]]s) to purchase [[stock]] in the [[stock trading|trading]] at the fully operational [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|Amsterdam Bourse]]. The practice of [[naked short selling]] was also invented in the Dutch Republic. In 1609, [[Isaac Le Maire]], an Amsterdam merchant and a sizeable shareholder of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), became the first recorded [[short seller]] in history. The first recorded ban on [[short selling]] also took place in the Dutch Republic in the same year. In the early 17th century, Dutch merchants invented the [[common stock]]  –  that of the VOC. Also, the Dutch experienced the first recorded [[stock market crash]] in history, the [[Tulip Mania]] of 1636–1637. Since 1602, stock market trading has come a long way. But basically, the concept and principle of stock market trading is still upheld and is still being implemented up to now.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Brooks (writer)|Brooks, John]] (1968). "The Fluctuation: The Little Crash in '62" in "Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street". (New York: Weybright &amp; Talley). "The stock market  –  the daytime adventure serial of the well-to-do  –  would not be the stock market if it did not have its ups and downs. (...) And it has many other distinctive characteristics. Apart from the economic advantages and disadvantages of stock exchanges  –  the advantage that they provide a free flow of capital to finance industrial expansion, for instance, and the disadvantage that they provide an all too convenient way for the unlucky, the imprudent, and the gullible to lose their money  –  their development has created a whole pattern of social behavior, complete with customs, language, and predictable responses to given events. What is truly extraordinary is the speed with which this pattern emerged full blown following the establishment, in 1611, of the world’s first important stock exchange  –  a roofless courtyard in Amsterdam  –  and the degree to which it persists (with variations, it is true) on the New York Stock Exchange in the nineteen-sixties. Present-day stock trading in the United States  –  a bewilderingly vast enterprise, involving millions of miles of private telegraph wires, computers that can read and copy the Manhattan Telephone Directory in three minutes, and over twenty million stockholder participants  –  would seem to be a far cry from a handful of seventeenth-century Dutchmen haggling in the rain. But the field marks are much the same. The first stock exchange was, inadvertently, a laboratory in which new human reactions were revealed. By the same token, the New York Stock Exchange is also a sociological test tube, forever contributing to the human species’ self-understanding. The behaviour of the pioneering Dutch stock traders is ably documented in a book entitled "Confusion of Confusions," written by a plunger on the Amsterdam market named Joseph de la Vega; originally published in 1688, it was reprinted in English translation a few years ago by the Harvard Business School."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petram, Lodewijk (2014). ''The World's First Stock Exchange (Columbia Business School Publishing)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== First fully functioning (fully-fledged) financial market (17th century) ====
The Dutch Republic ([[Amsterdam]] in particular) was the birthplace of the world's first fully functioning [[financial market]], with the birth of a fully fledged [[capital market]]. [[Capital market]]s for debt and [[equity shares]] are used to raise long-term funds. New [[stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] are sold in [[primary market]]s (including [[initial public offerings]]) and [[secondary market]]s (including [[stock exchanges]]). While the [[Italian city-states]] produced the first transferable [[municipal bonds]], they didn't develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged [[capital market]]: corporate [[shareholders]]. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first [[company]] to offer [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]] to the general public. Dutch investors were the first to trade their [[Share (finance)|shares]] at a regular [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|stock exchange]]. In 1602 the [[Dutch East India Company]] ([[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]) established an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] in [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|Amsterdam]] where the VOC [[stock]]s and [[bond (finance)|bonds]] could be traded in a [[secondary market]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser, Kevin 2013 p. 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, Gary (2013). ''Business Scandals, Corruption, and Reform: An Encyclopedia [2 volumes]'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The buying and selling of the VOC's [[Security (finance)|securities]] (including [[Share (finance)|shares]] and bonds) became the basis of the first official [[stock market]]. The Dutch were also the first to use a fully-fledged [[capital market]] (including [[bond market]] and [[stock market]]) to finance [[companies]] (such as the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and the [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]). It was in seventeenth-century Amsterdam that the global [[securities market]] began to take on its modern form.

==== Foundations of corporate finance (17th century) ====
What is now known as [[corporate finance]] has its modern roots in [[financial management]] policies of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in the 17th century and some basic aspects of modern corporate finance began to appear in financial activities of Dutch businessmen in the early 17th century.

==== Initial public offering (1602) ====
The earliest form of a [[company]] which issued ''public shares'' was the ''publicani'' during the [[Roman Republic]]. In 1602, the [[Dutch East India Company]] ([[Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie]] or VOC) became the first modern company to issue shares to the public, thus launching the first modern [[initial public offering]] (IPO). The VOC held the first public offering of shares in history shortly after its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Chorafas, Dimitris N. (2005). ''The Management of Equity Investments'', p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Niall (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gfmag.com/magazine/march-2013/milestonemoscows-stock-exchange-goes-public |author=Gupta, Udayan |title=''Milestone: Moscow’S Stock Exchange Goes Public'' |publisher=Global Finance Magazine |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=22 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this first recorded initial public offering ([[IPO]]), the VOC brought in 6,424,588 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]] and the company subsequently grew to become the first true [[transnational corporation]] in the world.

==== Institutional foundations of investment banking (17th century) ====
The Dutch were the pioneers in laying the basis for [[investment banking]], allowing the risk of loans to be distributed among thousands of investors in the early seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Frank B.; Prentice, Robert A. (2007). ''Law and Corporate Finance'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Institutional foundations of central banking (first central bank) (1609) ====
[[Image:Saenredam - Het oude stadhuis te Amsterdam.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|A painting by [[Pieter Saenredam]] of the old town hall in Amsterdam where the ''Wisselbank'' was founded in 1609. The [[Amsterdamsche Wisselbank]] (literally meaning “Amsterdam Exchange Bank”), the precursor to, if not the first modern [[central bank]]. The Wisselbank's innovations helped lay the foundations for the [[central banking|central banking system]] that now plays a vital role in the world's economy.]]

Prior to the 17th century most [[money]] was [[commodity money]], typically [[gold]] or [[silver]]. However, promises to pay were widely circulated and accepted as value at least five hundred years earlier in both Europe and Asia. The [[Song Dynasty]] was the first to issue generally circulating paper currency, while the [[Yuan Dynasty]] was the first to use notes as the predominant circulating medium. In 1455, in an effort to control [[inflation]], the succeeding [[Ming Dynasty]] ended the use of [[paper money]] and closed much of Chinese trade. The medieval European [[Knights Templar]] ran an early prototype of a [[central banking]] system, as their promises to pay were widely respected, and many regard their activities as having laid the basis for the modern banking system. As the first [[public bank]] to "offer accounts not directly convertible to coin", the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] (''Amsterdamsche Wisselbank'' or literally Amsterdam Exchange Bank) established in 1609 is considered to be the precursor to modern [[central banks]], if not the first true central bank.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, Niall 2008"&gt;[[Niall Ferguson|Ferguson, Niall]] (2008).

(Working Paper 2012-14, September 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; There were earlier banks, especially in the [[Italian city-states]], but the Wisselbank, with its public backing, provided for a scale of operations and stability hitherto unmatched. Along with a number of subsidiary local banks, it performed many of modern-day [[central banking]] functions.&lt;ref name="sustainability38"&gt;Kuzminski, Adrian (2013). ''The Ecology of Money: Debt, Growth, and Sustainability'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the Wisselbank as a [[state bank]] was adapted throughout Europe, including the [[Bank of Sweden]] (1668) and the [[Bank of England]] (1694).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Hazel J. (2000). ''Banking Alliances'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It occupied a central position in the financial world of its day, providing an effective, efficient and trusted system for national and international payments. The establishment of the Wisselbank led to the introduction of the concept of [[bank money]]  –  the [[Dutch guilder|bank guilder]]. Lucien Gillard (2004) calls it the ''European guilder'' (''le florin européen''),&lt;ref&gt;Gillard, Lucien (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adam Smith]] devotes many pages to explaining how the bank guilder works (Smith 1776: 446–55). Considered by many experts to be the first [[international reserve currency|internationally dominant reserve currency]] of modern times, the [[Dutch guilder]] was the dominant currency during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was just replaced by British pound sterling in the 19th century and the US dollar took the lead just after World War Two and has held it until this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2008/html/sp081010.en.html |author=Smaghi, Lorenzo Bini |title=''The internationalisation of currencies – A central banking perspective'' |publisher=European Central Bank |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/web/rielcano_en/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/dt54-2009 |author=de la Dehesa, Guillermo |title=''Will the Euro Ever Replace the US Dollar as the Dominant Global Currency?

==== Short selling (1609) ====
Financial innovation in Amsterdam took many forms. In 1609, investors led by [[Isaac Le Maire]] formed history's first bear syndicate to engage in [[short selling]], but their coordinated trading had only a modest impact in driving down share prices, which tended to be robust throughout the 17th century.

==== Concept of dividend policy (1610) ====
In the first decades of the 17th century, the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] was the first recorded company ever to pay regular [[dividend]]s. To encourage investors to buy shares, a promise of an annual payment (called a dividend) was made. An investor would receive [[dividends]] instead [[interest]] and the investment was permanent in the form of shares in the company. Between 1600 and 1800 the Dutch East India Company (VOC) paid annual dividends worth around 18 percent of the value of the shares.

==== First European banknote (1661) ====
In 1656, King [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] signed two charters creating two private banks under the directorship of [[Johan Palmstruch]] (though before having been ennobled he was called Johan Wittmacher or Hans Wittmacher), a [[Riga]]-born merchant of Dutch origin. Palmstruch modeled the banks on those of [[Bank of Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] where he had become a [[Citizen|burgher]]. The first real European [[banknote]] was issued in 1661 by the [[Stockholms Banco]] of [[Johan Palmstruch]], a private bank under state charter (precursor to the [[Sveriges Riksbank]], the [[central bank]] of Sweden).

==== First book ever on stock trading (1688) ====
[[Joseph de la Vega]], also known as Joseph Penso de la Vega, was an Amsterdam trader from a Spanish Jewish family and a prolific writer as well as a successful businessman. His 1688 book ''Confusion de Confusiones'' (''Confusion of Confusions'') explained the workings of the city's stock market. It was the earliest book about [[stock trading]], taking the form of a dialogue between a merchant, a shareholder and a philosopher. The book described a market that was sophisticated but also prone to excesses, and de la Vega offered advice to his readers on such topics as the unpredictability of market shifts and the importance of patience in investment. The book has been described as the first precursor of modern behavioural finance, with its descriptions of investor decision-making still reflected in the way some investors operate today, and in 2001 was still rated by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as one of the ten best investment book ever written.&lt;ref&gt;Westbrook, Ian (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Concept of technical analysis (1688) ====
The principles of [[technical analysis]] are derived from hundreds of years of [[financial market]] data. These principles in a raw form have been studied since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph de la Vega, ''Confusión de Confusiones'', 1688&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspects of [[technical analysis]] began to appear in [[Joseph de la Vega]]'s accounts of the Dutch markets in the late 17th century. In Asia, technical analysis is said to be a method developed by [[Homma Munehisa]] during the early 18th century which evolved into the use of [[Candlestick chart|candlestick techniques]], and is today a technical analysis charting tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Steve | last = Nison | title = Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques | year = 1991 | pages = 15–18 | isbn = 0-13-931650-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nison, Steve (1994).

==== Concept of behavioral finance (1688) ====
[[Josseph de la Vega]] was in 1688 the first person to give an account of irrational behaviour in [[financial market]]s. His 1688 book ''Confusion of Confusions'', has been described as the first precursor of modern [[behavioural finance]], with its descriptions of investor decision-making still reflected in the way some investors operate today.

==== First modern model of a financial centre (17th century) ====
[[File:The Dam in Amsterdam, by Gerrit Adriaensz Berckheyde.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The [[Dam Square]] in Amsterdam, by [[Gerrit Adriaensz Berckheyde]], c. 1660. In the picture of the centre of highly cosmopolitan and tolerant Amsterdam, [[Muslim]]/[[Oriental]] figures (possibly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] or [[Morocco|Moroccan]] merchants) are shown negotiating. The [[Dutch Golden Age|seventeenth-century Amsterdam]]’s institutional innovations greatly helped lay the foundations for modern (international) [[financial centres]] that now dominate the [[global financial system]].&lt;ref&gt;Sylla, Richard (2015). "Financial Development, Corporations, and Inequality". (BHC-EBHA Meeting). As [[Richard Sylla]] notes, "In modern history, several nations had what some of us call financial revolutions. These can be thought of as creating in a short period of time all the key components of a modern [[financial system]]. The first was the Dutch Republic four centuries ago."&lt;/ref&gt;]]
By the first decades of the 18th century, Amsterdam had become the world’s leading [[financial centre]] for more than a century, having developed a sophisticated [[financial system]] with [[central banking]], fully-fledged [[capital markets]], certain kinds of [[financial derivatives]], and [[publicly traded]] [[multinational corporations]]. Amsterdam was the first modern model of an international (global) [[financial centre]] that now operated in several countries around the world.

==== Foundations of modern financial system (17th century) ====
In the early 17th century, the Dutch revolutionized domestic and international finance by inventing [[common stock]]  –  that of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and founding a proto-[[central bank]], the Wisselbank or [[Bank of Amsterdam]]. In 1609, the Dutch had already had a government [[bond market]] for some decades. Shortly thereafter, the [[Dutch Republic]] had in place, in one form or another, all of the key components of a modern [[financial system]]: formalized public credit, stable money, elements of a banking system, a central bank of sorts and securities markets. The Dutch Republic went on to become that century's leading economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/walter-russell-mead-why-lula-was-right-77431 |title=''Walter Russell Mead On Why Lula Was Right (The Debt We Owe the Dutch: Blue-Eyed Bankers Have Given Us More Than the Current Financial Crisis)'' |publisher=Newsweek Magazine |last=Mead |first=Walter Russell |quote=The modern financial system grows out of a series of innovations in 17th-century Netherlands, and the Dutch were, on the whole, as Lula describes them. From the Netherlands, what the English called "Dutch finance" traveled over the English Channel, as the English borrowed Dutch ideas to build a stock market, promote global trade and establish the Bank of England, going on to build a maritime empire of commerce and sea power that dominated the world until World War II. Dutch finance became "Anglo-Saxon capitalism," but otherwise went on as before. When the British system fell apart, the center of world finance crossed the water again, and New York and Washington replaced London and Amsterdam as centers of global politics and finance. This financial and political system is the operating system on which the world runs; the Dutch introduced version 1.0 in about 1620; the British introduced 2.0 in about 1700; the Americans upgraded to version 3.0 in 1945, and as an operating system, it works pretty well – most of the time. The 300 years of liberal, global capitalism have seen an extraordinary explosion in knowledge and human affluence. |date=18 Apr 2009 |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Concept of investment fund (1774) ====
The first [[investment fund]] has its roots back in 1774. A Dutch merchant named Adriaan van Ketwich formed a trust named ''Eendragt Maakt Magt''. The name of Ketwich's fund translates to "unity creates strength". In response to the [[financial crisis]] of 1772–1773, Ketwich's aim was to provide small investors an opportunity to diversify (Rouwenhorst &amp; Goetzman, 2005). This investment scheme can be seen as the first [[mutual fund|near-mutual fund]]. In the years following, near-mutual funds evolved and become more diverse and complex.

==== Mutual fund (1774) ====
The first [[mutual fund]]s were established in 1774 in the [[Netherlands]]. Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham van Ketwich (a.k.a. Adriaan van Ketwich) is often credited as the originator of the world's first [[mutual fund]].&lt;ref&gt;Rouwenhorst, K. Geert, "The Origins of Mutual Funds," ''Yale ICF Working Paper No. 04-48'' (December 12, 2004), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The first mutual fund outside the Netherlands was the Foreign &amp; Colonial Government Trust, which was established in London in 1868.

=== Foods and drinks ===
==== Gibbing (14th century) ====

[[Gibbing]] is the process of preparing salt [[herring]] (or [[soused herring]]), in which the gills and part of the gullet are removed from the fish, eliminating any bitter taste. The liver and pancreas are left in the fish during the salt-curing process because they release enzymes essential for flavor. The fish is then cured in a barrel with one part salt to 20 herring. Today many variations and local preferences exist on this process. The process of [[gibbing]] was invented by Willem Beuckelszoon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutus.org/William_Buckels William Buckels]&lt;/ref&gt; (aka Willem Beuckelsz, William Buckels&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Willem Beukelszoon|Willem Beuckelszoon]]&lt;/ref&gt; or William Buckelsson), a 14th-century [[Zeeland|Zealand]] Fisherman. The invention of this fish preservation technique led to the Dutch becoming a seafaring power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.holland.com/e/7775/Herring.php Herring]&lt;/ref&gt; This invention created an export industry for salt [[herring]] that was monopolized by the Dutch.

==== Doughnut (17th century) ====
Many people believe it was the Dutch who invented [[doughnut]]s. A Dutch [[snack]] made from potatoes had a round shape like a ball, but, like [[Gregory's dough ball]]s, needed a little longer time when fried to cook the inside thoroughly. These potato-balls developed into doughnuts when the Dutch finally made them into ring-shapes reduce frying time.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==== Gin (jenever) (1650) ====
[[File:DecaturGins.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A selection of bottled [[gin]]s offered at a [[liquor store]].]]

[[Gin]] is a [[distilled beverage|spirit]] which derives its predominant flavour from [[Juniper berry|juniper berries]] (''Juniperus communis''). From its earliest origins in the [[Middle Ages]], gin has evolved over the course of a millennium from a [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin was developed on the basis of the older [[Jenever]], and become widely popular in [[Great Britain]] when [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], leader of the [[Dutch Republic]], occupied the British throne with his wife Mary. Today, the gin category is one of the most popular and widely distributed range of spirits, and is represented by products of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.

The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physician [[Franciscus Sylvius]] is often credited with the invention of gin in the mid 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bluecoatgin.com/history_orgins.html |title=Origins of Gin |accessdate=5 April 2009 |publisher=Bluecoat American Dry Gin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213205501/http://bluecoatgin.com/history_orgins.html |archivedate=13 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tasteoftx.com/spirits/gin.html|title=Gin|accessdate=5 April 2009|publisher=tasteoftx.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416234849/http://www.tasteoftx.com/spirits/gin.html|archivedate=16 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the existence of genever is confirmed in Massinger's play ''The Duke of Milan'' (1623), when Dr. Sylvius would have been but nine years of age. It is further claimed that British soldiers who provided support in [[Antwerp, Belgium|Antwerp]] against the Spanish in 1585, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], were already drinking [[genever]] ([[jenever]]) for its calming effects before battle, from which the term ''Dutch Courage'' is believed to have originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.amazon.com/Genever-500-Years-History-Bottle/dp/0615795854|title=Genever|accessdate=3 June 2013|publisher=[http://www.FlemishLion.com FlemishLion.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known written reference to genever appears in the 13th century encyclopaedic work ''Der Naturen Bloeme'' ([[Bruges, Belgium|Bruges]]), and the earliest printed genever recipe from 16th century work ''Een Constelijck Distileerboec'' (Antwerp).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belgiangenever.com Belgian Genever: Belgium's Traditional Spirit for over 500 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stroopwafel (1780s) ====
A [[stroopwafel]] (also known as ''syrup waffle'', ''treacle waffle'' or ''caramel waffle'') is a [[waffle]] made from two thin layers of baked batter with a caramel-like [[syrup]] filling the middle. They were first made in [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]] in the 1780s. The traditional way to eat the stroopwafel is to place it atop of a drinking vessel with a hot beverage (coffee, tea or chocolate) inside that fits the diameter of the waffle. The heat from the rising steam warms the waffle and slightly softens the inside and makes the waffle soft on one side while still crispy on the other.

==== Cocoa powder (foundations of modern chocolate industry) (1828) ====
[[File:Cocoa powder.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A bowl of [[cocoa powder]]. In 1828, [[Coenraad Johannes van Houten|C. J. van Houten]] revolutionized the modern [[chocolate]] industry by inventing a hydraulic press that squeezed the [[cocoa butter]] (fat) out of the [[cocoa bean]]s, producing [[cocoa powder]].]]
In 1815, Dutch chemist [[Coenraad van Houten|Coenraad Van Houten]] introduced [[alkaline]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s to [[chocolate]], which reduced its bitterness. In the 1820s, Casparus van Houten, Sr. patented an inexpensive method for pressing the fat from roasted [[cocoa bean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Satre, Lowell Joseph (2005). ''Chocolate on Trial: Slavery, Politics, and the Ethics of Business'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grivetti, Louis E. 2011"&gt;Grivetti, Louis E.; Shapiro, Howard-Yana (2011).

''Chocolate as Medicine: A Quest Over the Centuries'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; He created a press to remove about half the natural fat ([[Cocoa butter|cacao butter]]) from [[chocolate liquor]], which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of [[chocolate]]. Van Houten developed the first [[cocoa powder]] producing machine in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleboro.k12.ma.us/Middleboro/CHOC/Chocolate.htm|title=Chocolate History|accessdate=June 26, 2008|publisher=Middleborough Public Schools|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702220326/http://www.middleboro.k12.ma.us/Middleboro/CHOC/Chocolate.htm|archivedate=2 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Houten's machine – a hydraulic press – reduced the [[cocoa butter]] content by nearly half. This created a "cake" that could be pulverized into [[cocoa powder]], which was to become the basis of all [[chocolate]] products.&lt;ref&gt;Ensminger, Marion Eugene; Ensminger, Audrey H. (1994).

''Cocoa Production and Processing Technology'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The press separated the greasy [[cocoa butter]] from [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]] seeds, leaving a purer [[chocolate powder]] behind. This powder, much like the instant [[cocoa powder]] used today, was easier to stir into [[milk]] and [[water]]. As a result, another very important discovery was made: solid chocolate. By using cocoa powder and low amounts of [[cocoa butter]], it was then possible to manufacture [[chocolate bar]]. The term "[[chocolate]]" then came to mean [[solid chocolate]], rather than [[hot chocolate]].

==== Dutch-process chocolate (1828) ====
Dutch-processed chocolate or Dutched chocolate is chocolate that has been treated with an alkalizing agent to modify its color and give it a milder taste compared to "natural cocoa" extracted with the [[Broma process]]. It forms the basis for much of modern chocolate, and is used in [[ice cream]], [[hot cocoa]], and baking. The Dutch process was developed in the early 19th century by Dutch chocolate maker [[Coenraad Johannes van Houten]], whose father Casparus is responsible for the development of the method of removing fat from cacao beans by [[hydraulic press]] around 1828, forming the basis for cocoa powder.&lt;ref name="Grivetti, Louis E. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson, Philip K. 2012 p. 81"/&gt;

=== Law and jurisprudence ===
==== Doctrine of the Freedom of the Seas (foundations of the Law of the Sea/UNCLOS) (1609) ====

In 1609, [[Hugo Grotius]], the Dutch jurist who is generally known as the father of modern [[international law]], published his book ''[[Mare Liberum]]'' (''The Free Sea''), which first formulated the notion of ''[[freedom of the seas]]''. He developed this idea into a [[legal principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Milun, Kathryn (2011). ''The Political Uncommons: The Cross-Cultural Logic of the Global Commons'', p. 77–79&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be 'the first, and classic, exposition of the doctrine of the freedom of the seas' which has been the essence and backbone of the modern [[law of the sea]].&lt;ref name="Anand, Ram Prakash 1987 p. 5–9"&gt;Anand, Ram Prakash (1987). ''International Law and the Developing Countries: Confrontation Or Cooperation?'', p. 5–9, 53–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milun, Kathryn 2011 p.12"&gt;Milun, Kathryn (2011). ''The Political Uncommons: The Cross-Cultural Logic of the Global Commons'', p. 12, 77–79&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that Grotius first propounded the principle of [[freedom of the seas]], although all countries in the [[Indian Ocean]] and other Asian seas accepted the right of [[Freedom of navigation|unobstructed navigation]] long before Grotius wrote his ''De Jure Praedae'' (''On the Law of Spoils'') in the year of 1604. His work sparked a debate in the seventeenth century over whether states could exclude the vessels of other states from certain waters. Grotius won this debate, as ''freedom of the seas'' became a universally recognized legal principle, associated with concepts such as communication, trade and peace. Grotius's notion of the freedom of the seas would persist until the mid-twentieth century, and it continues to be applied even to this day for much of the [[high seas]], though the application of the concept and the scope of its reach is changing.

==== Secularized natural law (foundations of modern international law) (1625) ====
The publication of ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''On the Laws of War and Peace'') by Hugo Grotius in 1625 had marked the emergence of [[international law]] as an 'autonomous legal science'.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, John (2001). ''International Law'', p. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boczek, Boleslaw Adam (2005). ''International Law: A Dictionary'', p. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Linda A. (2008). ''International Law'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Grotius's ''[[On the Law of War and Peace]]'', published in 1625, is best known as the first systematic treatise on [[international law]], but to thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it seemed to set a new agenda in moral and political philosophy across the board. Grotius developed pivotal treatises on freedom of the seas, the law of spoils, the laws of war and peace and he created an autonomous place for international law as its own discipline. [[Jean Barbeyrac]]’s ''Historical and Critical Account of the Science of Morality'', attached to his translation of [[Samuel von Pufendorf]]’s ''Law of Nature and Nations'' in 1706, praised Grotius as “the first who broke the ice” of “the ''Scholastic Philosophy''; which [had] spread itself all over Europe” (1749: 67, 66).&lt;ref&gt;Darwall, Stephen (2013). ''Grotius at the Creation of Modern Moral Philosophy'' in ''Honor, History, and Relationship: Essays in Second-Personal Ethics II'', p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Grotius' truly distinctive contribution to [[jurisprudence]] and [[philosophy of law]] ([[public international law]] or [[law of nations]] in particular) was that he [[secularized]] [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Carl Joachim (1963).

==== Grotian conception of international society (1625) ====
The [[English school of international relations theory|Grotian conception of international society]] became the most distinctive characteristic of the [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] (or [[rationalist]]) tradition in [[international relations]]. This is why it is also called the ''Grotian tradition''. According to it international politics takes place within international society in which [[Sovereign state|states]] are bound not only by rules of prudence or expediency but also of [[morality]] and [[law]]. Grotius was arguably not the first to formulate such a doctrine. However, he was first to clearly define the idea of one society of states, governed not by force or warfare but by laws and mutual agreement to enforce those laws. As many international law scholars noted, the spirit of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) was preceded with the thoughts and ideas of Grotius. [[Thomas M. Franck|Thomas Franck]] observed: ‘Since the Reformation, the Peace of Westphalia, and the writings of Hugo Grotius, there has been an explicit assumption that the international system is an association of [[Westphalian sovereignty|sovereign states]].’&lt;ref&gt;Franck, Thomas M. (1999). ''The Empowered Self − Law and Society in the Age of Individualism''. (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Hedley Bull]] declared: ‘The idea of international society which Grotius propounded was given concrete expression in the [[Peace of Westphalia]]’, affirming that ‘Grotius must be considered the intellectual father of this first general peace settlement of modern times’.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, Hedley ''Hugo Grotius and International Relations'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cannon shot rule (1702) ====
By the end of the seventeenth century, support was growing for some limitation to the seaward extent of [[territorial waters]]. What emerged was the so-called "cannon shot rule", which acknowledged the idea that property rights could be acquired by physical occupation and in practice to the effective range of shore-based [[cannon]]: about [[Three-mile limit|three nautical miles]]. The rule was long associated with [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek|Cornelis van Bijnkershoek]], a Dutch jurist who, especially in his ''De Dominio Maris Dissertatio'' (1702), advocated a middle ground between the extremes of ''Mare Liberum'' and [[John Selden]]'s ''[[Mare Clausum]]'', accepting both the freedom of states to navigate and exploit the resources of the high seas and a right of coastal states to assert wide-ranging rights in a limited marine territory.

==== Permanent Court of Arbitration (1899) ====
The [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] (PCA) is an [[international organization]] based in [[The Hague]] in the Netherlands. The court was established in 1899 as one of the acts of the first [[Hague Peace Conference]], which makes it the oldest global institution for international dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=311 |title='’Permanent Court of Arbitration (general introduction)'' |publisher=[[The Hague Justice Portal]] |accessdate=20 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its creation is set out under Articles 20 to 29 of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|1899 Hague Convention]] for the pacific settlement of international disputes, which was a result of the first [[Hague Peace Conference]]. The most concrete achievement of the Conference was the establishment of the PCA as the first institutionalized global mechanism for the settlement of disputes between states. The PCA encourages the resolution of disputes that involve states, state entities, [[intergovernmental organizations]], and private parties by assisting in the establishment of [[arbitration]] tribunals and facilitating their work. The court offers a wide range of services for the resolution of [[international disputes]] which the parties concerned have expressly agreed to submit for resolution under its auspices. Dutch-Jew [[legal scholar]] [[Tobias Asser]]'s role in the creation of the PCA at the first Hague Peace Conference (1899) earned him the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1911.

==== International Opium Convention (1912) ====
The [[International Opium Convention]], sometimes referred to as the [[International Opium Convention|Hague Convention]] of 1912, signed on 23 January 1912 at [[The Hague]], was the first international [[Drug prohibition law|drug control treaty]] and is the core of the international [[drug]] control system. The adoption of the Convention was a turning point in [[multilateralism]], based on the recognition of the transnational nature of the drug problem and the principle of shared responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/2012/03/incb-celebrates-centennial-of-the-1912-international-opium-convention/ |title='’INCB celebrates centennial of the 1912 International Opium Convention '' |publisher=United Nations Radio |date= 18 March 2012 |accessdate= 18 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marriage equality (legalization of same-sex marriage) (2001) ====
[[Denmark]] was the first state to recognize a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing "registered partnerships" very much like marriage in 1989. In 2001, the [[Netherlands]] became the first nation in the world to grant [[same-sex marriage]]s. The first laws enabling same-sex marriage in modern times were enacted during the first decade of the 21st century. {{As of|2014|03|29}}, sixteen countries ([[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="Denmark"&gt;Excluding the Faroe Islands and Greenland.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]], [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="Netherlands"&gt;Excluding Aruba, Curaçao and St Maarten.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="New Zealand"&gt;Excluding Tokelau, Niue and the Cook Islands.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]], [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]], [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]], [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="United Kingdom"&gt;Excluding Northern Ireland. The [[Same-sex marriage in Scotland|Scottish]] parliament has passed a bill that allows same-sex marriages to take place from October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]]) and several sub-national jurisdictions (parts of [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Mexico|Mexico]] and the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|United States]]) allow same-sex couples to marry. Polls in various countries show that there is rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage across race, ethnicity, age, religion, political affiliation, and socioeconomic status.

The first [[mechanical clock]]s, employing the [[verge escapement]] mechanism with a [[Balance wheel|foliot]] or [[balance wheel]] timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the [[pendulum clock]] was invented in 1656. The [[pendulum clock]] remained the most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when [[quartz oscillator]]s were invented, followed by [[atomic clock]]s after World War 2.&lt;ref name="Huygens' Clocks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/huygens_clocks.aspx |title=''Huygens' Clocks'' |publisher=Science Museum, London |accessdate=10 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010034250/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/huygens_clocks.aspx |archivedate=10 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pendulum clock uses a pendulum's arc to mark intervals of time. From their invention until about 1930, the most accurate [[clock]]s were [[pendulum]] clocks. Pendulum clocks cannot operate on vehicles or [[marine chronometer|ships at sea]], because the [[acceleration]]s disrupt the pendulum's motion, causing inaccuracies. The pendulum clock was invented by [[Christian Huygens]], based on the pendulum introduced by [[Galileo Galilei]]. Although Galileo studied the [[pendulum]] as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a [[clock]] based on that design. [[Christiaan Huygens]] invented [[pendulum clock]] in 1656 and patented the following year. He contracted the construction of his clock designs to [[clockmaker]] [[Salomon Coster]], who actually built the [[clock]].

==== Concept of the standardization of the temperature scale (1665) ====
Various authors have credited the invention of the [[thermometer]] to [[Cornelis Drebbel]], [[Robert Fludd]], [[Galileo Galilei]] or [[Sanctorius|Santorio Santorio]]. The thermometer was [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|not a single invention, however, but a development]]. However, each inventor and each thermometer was unique – there was [[Conversion of units of temperature|no standard scale]]. In 1665 [[Christiaan Huygens]] suggested using the [[Melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s of water as standards.&lt;ref&gt;Biró, Tamás Sándor (2011). ''Is There a Temperature?: Conceptual Challenges at High Energy, Acceleration and Complexity (Fundamental Theories of Physics)'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wei, James (2012). ''Great Inventions that Changed the World'', p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fahrenheit scale]] is now usually defined by two [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]]: the [[temperature]] at which [[water]] freezes into [[ice]] is defined as 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and the [[boiling point]] of water is defined to be 212&amp;nbsp;°F, a 180 degree separation, as defined at [[sea level]] and [[standard atmospheric pressure]]. In 1742, Swedish astronomer [[Anders Celsius]] created a [[temperature scale]] which was the reverse of the scale now known by the name "[[Celsius]]": ''0'' represented the boiling point of water, while ''100'' represented the freezing point of water. From 1744 until 1954, 0&amp;nbsp;°C was defined as the [[freezing point]] of [[water]] and 100&amp;nbsp;°C was defined as the [[boiling point]] of water, both at a pressure of one [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] being the working material.

The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the [[balance wheel]] in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist [[Robert Hooke]] (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the actual inventor of the [[balance spring]]. Huygens was clearly the first to successfully implement a spiral balance spring in a portable timekeeper. This is significant because up to that point the pendulum was the most reliable.&lt;ref name="Mäkikalli, Aino 2007 p. 160–61"&gt;Mäkikalli, Aino (2007).

==== Mercury thermometer (first practical, accurate thermometer) (1714) ====
[[Image:Clinical thermometer 38.7.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A medical mercury-in-glass maximum thermometer. Fahrenheit's [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] was far more reliable and accurate than any that had existed before, and the mercury thermometers in use today are made in the way Fahrenheit devised.]]
Various authors have credited the invention of the [[thermometer]] to [[Cornelis Drebbel]], [[Robert Fludd]], [[Galileo Galilei]] or [[Sanctorius|Santorio Santorio]]. The thermometer was [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|not a single invention, however, but a development]]. Though Galileo is often said to be the inventor of the [[thermometer]], what he produced were [[thermoscope]]s. The difference between a [[thermoscope]] and a [[thermometer]] is that the latter has a scale.&lt;ref&gt;T.D. McGee (1988) ''Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement'' p. 3, {{ISBN|0-471-62767-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first person to put a scale on a [[thermoscope]] is variously said to be [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo|Francesco Sagredo]]&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Drinkwater (1832)''Life of Galileo Galilei'' p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; or Santorio Santorio&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/santorio.html The Galileo Project: Santorio Santorio]&lt;/ref&gt; in about 1611 to 1613.

Before there was the [[thermometer]], there was the earlier and closely related [[thermoscope]], best described as a thermometer without a [[temperature scale]]. A thermoscope only showed the differences in [[temperature]]s, for example, it could show something was getting hotter. However, the thermoscope did not measure all the data that a thermometer could, for example an exact temperature in degrees. What can be considered the first modern thermometer, the [[mercury thermometer]] with a standardized scale, was invented by German-Dutch scientist [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]] (who had settled in [[Amsterdam]] in 1701) in 1714.&lt;ref&gt;Lydolph, Paul E.

==== Fahrenheit scale (first standardized temperature scale) (1724) ====
[[File:Raumthermometer Fahrenheit+Celsius.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Thermometer with [[Fahrenheit]] (symbol °F) and [[Celsius]] (symbol °C) units.]]
Various authors have credited the invention of the [[thermometer]] to [[Cornelis Drebbel]], [[Robert Fludd]], [[Galileo Galilei]] or [[Sanctorius|Santorio Santorio]]. The thermometer was [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|not a single invention, however, but a development]]. However, each inventor and each thermometer was unique – there was [[Conversion of units of temperature|no standard scale]]. In 1665 [[Christiaan Huygens]] suggested using the [[Melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s of water as standards, and in 1694 [[Carlo Renaldini]] proposed using them as fixed points on a universal scale. In 1701 [[Isaac Newton]] proposed a scale of 12 degrees between the melting point of ice and [[Normal human body temperature|body temperature]]. Finally in 1724 [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]] produced a [[temperature scale]] which now (slightly adjusted) [[Fahrenheit|bears his name]]. He could do this because he manufactured [[thermometer]]s, using [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (which has a high [[Thermal expansion|coefficient of expansion]]) for the first time and the quality of his production could provide a finer scale and greater reproducibility, leading to its general adoption. The [[Fahrenheit scale]] was the first widely used [[temperature scale]]. By the end of the 20th century, most countries used the [[Celsius]] scale rather than the [[Fahrenheit]] scale, though [[Canada]] retained it as a supplementary scale used alongside Celsius. Fahrenheit remains the official scale for [[Jamaica]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Belize]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Palau]] and the United States and associated territories.

==== Snellen chart (1862) ====
The Snellen chart is an [[eye chart]] used by eye care professionals and others to measure [[visual acuity]]. Snellen charts are named after Dutch ophthalmologist [[Hermann Snellen]] who developed the chart in 1862. Vision scientists now use a [[LogMAR chart|variation]] of this chart, designed by Ian Bailey and Jan Lovie.

==== String galvanometer (1902) ====
Previous to the [[string galvanometer]], scientists used a machine called the [[electrometer|capillary electrometer]] to measure the heart's electrical activity, but this device was unable to produce results at a diagnostic level. Dutch physiologist [[Willem Einthoven]] developed the [[string galvanometer]] in the early 20th century, publishing the first registration of its use to record an [[electrocardiogram]] in a [[Festschrift]] book in 1902. The first human electrocardiogram was recorded in 1887, however only in 1901 was a quantifiable result obtained from the string galvanometer.

==== Schilt photometer (1922) ====
In 1922, Dutch astronomer [[Jan Schilt]] invented the [[Photometer|Schilt photometer]], a device that measures the light output of [[star]]s and, indirectly, their distances.

==== Clinical electrocardiography (first diagnostic electrocardiogram) (1902) ====

[[File:Willem Einthoven ECG.jpg|thumb|right|[[ECG]] as done by [[Willem Einthoven]]]]

In the 19th century it became clear that the heart generated electric currents. The first to systematically approach the heart from an electrical point-of-view was ''Augustus Waller'', working in [[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]] in [[Paddington]], London. In 1911 he saw little clinical application for his work. The breakthrough came when Einthoven, working in [[Leiden]], used his more sensitive string galvanometer, than the ''[[capillary electrometer]]'' that Waller used.

==== Rotating drum dialysis machine (first practical artificial kidney) (1943) ====
[[File:Museum Boerhaave Kolff's Artificial Kidney.jpg|left|200px|Kolff's artificial kidney]]

An [[artificial kidney]] is a machine and its related devices which clean blood for patients who have an acute or chronic failure of their kidneys. The first artificial kidney was developed by Dutchman [[Willem Johan Kolff]]. The procedure of cleaning the blood by this means is called ''[[dialysis]]'', a type of [[renal replacement therapy]] that is used to provide an artificial replacement for lost [[kidney]] function due to [[renal failure]]. It is a [[life support]] treatment and does not treat disease.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jay; Capron, Alexander Morgan (1975).

==== Artificial heart (1957) ====
On 12 December 1957, Kolff implanted an [[artificial heart]] into a dog at Cleveland Clinic. The dog lived for 90 minutes. In 1967, Dr. Kolff left Cleveland Clinic to start the Division of Artificial Organs at the [[University of Utah]] and pursue his work on the artificial heart. Under his supervision, a team of surgeons, chemists, physicists and bioengineers developed an artificial heart and made it ready for industrial production. To help manage his many endeavors, Dr. Kolff assigned project managers. Each project was named after its manager. Graduate student [[Robert Jarvik]] was the project manager for the artificial heart, which was subsequently renamed the ''Jarvik-7''. Based on lengthy animal trials, this first artificial heart was successfully implanted into the thorax of patient [[Barney Clark (patient)|Barney Clark]] in December 1982. Clark survived 112 days with the device.

==== Modern model of sea power (1585–1688) ====

The [[Dutch Republic]] has been considered by many political and military historians as the first modern (global) [[sea power]].&lt;ref&gt;Mead, Walter Russell (2007). ''God and Gold: Britain, America and the Making of the Modern World''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2009/07/21/2003449215 |author=Holmes, James |title=''Dutch history augurs PRC’s future'' |publisher=The Taipei Times |date=21 Jul 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraska, James (2011).

''The Future of the Jews: How Global Forces are Impacting the Jewish People, Israel, and Its Relationship with the United States'', p. 12. As Eizenstat observes, "since the Dutch invented modern capitalism in the seventeenth century, global powers have thrived by combining economic and military forces."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Provinces of the Netherlands]] was the first state to possess the full triad of foreign commerce, forward [[military base|bases]] and [[merchant navy|merchant]] and [[naval fleet]]s. In the middle of the 17th century the [[Naval history of the Netherlands|Dutch navy]] was the most powerful [[navy]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Glete|Glete, Jan]] (2000). ''Warfare at Sea, 1500–1650: Maritime Conflicts and the Transformation of Europe''. (Routledge)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Glete|Glete, Jan]] (2001). ''The Dutch Navy, Dutch State Formation and the Rise of Dutch Maritime Supremacy''. (Paper for the Anglo-American Conference for Historians:The Sea, 4–6 July 2001, University of London, Institute of Historical Research). "From the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth century, Holland, Zeeland and Friesland, that is, the maritime provinces of the Dutch Republic, formed Europe’s leading maritime society. This society had a great mercantile community, a huge mercantile marine, a large seafaring population, many ports, shipyards and a large market for naval stores. Dutch maritime activities are normally described as superior to those of other nations and proofs of the Dutch society’s ability to combine technology, entrepreneurship and low transaction costs. The Dutch was in this period the naval enemy or ally of Spain, Portugal, England, France, Denmark-Norway and Sweden. In the naval histories of these countries, the Dutch navy is treated with respect, admiration or envy. In 1639, it won one of the most decisive victories ever achieved in a major fleet contest against Spain-Portugal in the Channel, and in 1658–59 it saved Denmark from possible extinction as an independent state by Sweden. In 1667, it attacked the English fleet in its bases, in 1672–73 it waged a very successful defensive campaign against the combined fleets of France and England, and in 1688 it achieved an invasion of England in an excellently administrated surprise mobilisation of a major fleet. In a European perspective, the Dutch navy is a strong candidate for the position as the most successful naval organisation of the seventeenth century."&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Republic had a [[merchant fleet|commercial fleet]] that was larger than that of England, France, Germany, Portugal, and Spain combined. According to [[Walter Russell Mead]], the “modern version of sea power was invented by the Dutch. The system of global trade, investment, and military power the Dutch built in the seventeenth century was the envy and the wonder of the world at the time, and many of its basic features were adopted by the British and the Americans in subsequent years.”&lt;ref&gt;Mead, Walter Russell (2007). ''God and Gold: Britain, America and the Making of the Modern World''. "That Dutch system was like version 1.0 of the operating software on which much of the world still runs. At the turn of eighteenth century the British introduced version 2.0; there were several incremental upgrades along the way until the Americans introduced version 3.0 after the Second World War."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/acmart/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307472724&amp;view=printqa |author=Mead, Walter Russell |title=''A Conversation with Walter Russell Mead'' |publisher=Random House Inc. |quote=This global system, which I call the ‘maritime system’ because it is based on global trade and sea power, was actually invented by the Dutch almost 400 years ago.

The British introduced version 2.0 in 1700 and the United States introduced version 3.0 during World War II. Ever since 1600 the country that sets up the operating system has been the world’s most important power, and that is how I get to the ten letters.

(1988). ''The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution''&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Czar Peter House (Netherlands)|his stay]] in [[Holland]] (1697) the [[Tsar]] engaged, with the help of Russian and Dutch assistants, many skilled workers such as builders of locks, fortresses, shipwrights and seamen. They had to help him with his modernization of Russia. The best-known sailor who made the journey from the Dutch Republic to [[Russia]] was Norwegian-Dutch [[Cornelius Cruys]]. Cruys performed well in Russia and came be regarded as the architect of the [[Russian Navy]]. He became the first commander of the [[Russian Baltic Fleet]] and the [[vice admiral]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. Peter the Great designed his [[History of Saint Petersburg|new capital]] on the model of Amsterdam and gave it a Dutch name, Sint Pieterburgh (later Germanized into Sankt Peterburg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/71dc9640-dcc0-11e1-99f3-00144feab49a.html |author=Wrathall, Claire |title=''St Petersburg’s cultural revolution'' |publisher=The Financial Times |quote=Yet the city’s real inspiration lay in Amsterdam, where Peter the Great had studied shipbuilding.

He also developed a 43-step drill for firing the [[musket]] that was included in an illustrated weapons manual by [[Jacob de Gheyn II]] in 1607 (''Wapenhandelinghe'' or ''Exerise of Arms''). This became known as the ''[[Dutch drill]]''. It was widely read and emulated in the rest of Europe. Adopting and perfecting the techniques pioneered by Maurice of Nassau several decades earlier, [[Gustavus Adolphus]] repeatedly proved his techniques by defeating the armies of the [[Holy Roman empire]](1630–1632), an adversary with resources fantastically larger than Sweden's during the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinmetz, George (1999).

==== Norden bombsight (1920s) ====
The [[Norden bombsight]] was designed by [[Carl Norden]], a Dutch engineer educated in Switzerland who emigrated to the U.S. in 1904. In 1920, he started work on the Norden bombsight for the [[United States Navy]]. The first [[bombsight]] was produced in 1927. It was essentially an analog computer, and bombardiers were trained in great secrecy on how to use it. The device was used to drop bombs accurately from an aircraft, supposedly accurate enough to hit a 100-foot circle from an altitude of 21,000 feet – but under actual combat situations, such an accuracy was never achieved.

==== Submarine snorkel (1939) ====
A submarine snorkel is a device that allows a submarine to operate submerged while still taking in air from above the surface. It was invented by the Dutchman J.J. Wichers shortly before World War II and copied by the Germans during the war for use by [[U-Boat]]s. Its common military name is snort.

==== Goalkeeper CIWS (1975) ====
[[Goalkeeper CIWS|Goalkeeper]] is a [[close-in weapon system]] (CIWS) still in use as of 2015. It is autonomous and completely automatic short-range defense of ships against highly maneuverable missiles, aircraft and fast maneuvering surface vessels. Once activated the system automatically performs the entire process from surveillance and detection to destruction, including selection of priority targets.

==== Fokker organ (1950) ====
Dutch musician-physicist [[Adriaan Fokker]] designed and had built [[keyboard instrument]]s capable of playing [[Microtonal music|microtonal]] scales via a [[generalized keyboard]]. The best-known of these is his [[31 equal temperament|31-tone equal-tempered]] [[organ (music)|organ]], which was installed in [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]] in 1951. It is commonly called the [[Fokker organ]].

==== Kraakdoos (1960s) ====
The [[Kraakdoos]] or Cracklebox is a custom-made battery-powered noise-making [[electronic device]]. It is a small box with six metal contacts on top, which when pressed by fingers generates unusual sounds and [[Musical tone|tones]]. The human body becomes a part of the [[Electrical circuit|circuit]] and determines the range of sounds possible – different players generate different results. The concept was first conceived by [[Michel Waisvisz]] and Geert Hamelberg in the 1960s, and developed further in the 1970s when Waisvisz joined the [[STEIM]] foundation in Amsterdam.

==== Moodswinger (2006) ====
The [[Moodswinger]] is a twelve-string electric [[zither]] with an additional [[3rd bridge|third bridge]] designed by Dutch [[luthier]] [[Yuri Landman]]. The rod functions as the third bridge and divides the strings into two sections to add [[overtone]]s, creating a [[multiphonic]] sound.

==== Springtime (guitar) (2008) ====
The [[Springtime (guitar)|Springtime]] is an [[Experimental musical instrument|experimental electric guitar]] with [[Seven string guitar|seven strings]] and three outputs. Landman created the instrument in 2008.

=== Philosophy and social sciences ===
==== Neostoicism (1580s) ====

[[Neostoicism]] was a [[syncretic]] [[philosophical movement]], joining [[Stoicism]] and [[Christianity]]. Neostoicism was founded by Dutch-Flemish [[humanism|humanist]] [[Justus Lipsius]], who in 1584 presented its rules, expounded in his book ''[[De Constantia]]'' (''On Constancy''), as a dialogue between Lipsius and his friend Charles de Langhe. The eleven years (1579–1590) that Lipsius spent in [[Leiden]] ([[Leiden University]]) were the period of his greatest productivity. It was during this time that he wrote a series of works designed to revive ancient [[Stoicism]] in a form that would be compatible with [[Christianity]]. The most famous of these is ''[[De Constantia]]'' (1584). [[Neostoicism]] had a direct influence on many seventeenth and eighteenth-century writers including Montesquieu, Bossuet, Francis Bacon, Joseph Hall, Francisco de Quevedo and Juan de Vera y Figueroa.

==== Modern rationalism (1630s–1670s) ====
The rise of [[Rationalism#Modern rationalism|modern rationalism]] in the Dutch Republic, had a profound influence on the [[17th-century philosophy]]. [[Descartes]] is often considered to be the first of the modern [[rationalists]]. Descartes himself had lived in the Dutch Republic for some twenty years (1628–1649) and served for a while in the army of the [[Dutch States Army|Dutch military]] leader [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange-Nassau]]. The Dutch Republic was the first country in which Descartes' [[rationalistic]] philosophy ([[Cartesianism]]) succeeded in replacing Aristotelianism as the academic orthodoxy. [[Fritz Berolzheimer]] considers [[Hugo Grotius]] the Descartes of [[philosophy of law|legal philosophy]] and notes [[Grotian]] [[rationalism]]'s influence on the 17th-century [[jurisprudence]]: "As the Cartesian "cogito ergo sum" became the point of departure of rationalistic philosophy, so the establishment of government and law upon reason made Hugo Grotius the founder of an independent and purely rationalistic system of [[natural law]]." In the late 1650s [[Leiden]] was a place where one could study Cartesian philosophy. Sometime between 1656 and 1661 it appears that [[Spinoza]] did some formal study of philosophy at the [[University of Leiden]]. [[Philosophy of Spinoza]] ([[Spinozism]]) was an systematic answer to Descartes' famous [[Mind–body dualism|dualist]] theory that the body and spirit are separate.

==== Modern pantheism (1670s) ====
[[Pantheism]] was popularized in the modern era as both a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century [[Dutch Jew]] philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], whose ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' was an answer to [[Descartes]]' famous dualist theory that the body and spirit are separate. Spinoza is regarded as the chief source of modern pantheism. Spinoza held that the two are the same, and this [[monism]] is a fundamental quality of his philosophy. He was described as a "God-intoxicated man," and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance. Although the term pantheism was not coined until after his death, Spinoza is regarded as its most celebrated advocate.

==== Early liberalism (foundations of liberalism) (17th century) ====
European liberalism, [[Isaiah Berlin]] wrote, "wears the appearance of a single coherent movement, little altered during almost three centuries, founded upon relatively simple foundations, laid by [[John Locke|Locke]] or [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] or even [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]; stretching back to [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] and [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]..."&lt;ref name="Ullmann-Margalit, Edna 1991 p. 16"&gt;Ullmann-Margalit, Edna; Margalit, Avishai (1991). ''Isaiah Berlin: A Celebration'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Bertrand Russell]] noted in his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945): "[[Descartes]] lived in [[Holland]] for twenty years (1629–49), except for a few brief visits to France and one to England, all on business. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Holland in the seventeenth century, as the one country where there was freedom of speculation. [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] had to have his books printed there; [[John Locke|Locke]] took refuge there during the five worst years of reaction in England before [[Glorious Revolution|1688]]; [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]] (of the ''Dictionary'') found it necessary to live there; and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] would hardly have been allowed to do his work in any other country."&lt;ref name="Russell, Bertrand 1945"&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1945). ''A History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Russell described [[History of liberalism|early liberalism]] in Europe: "Early liberalism was a product of England and Holland, and had certain well-marked characteristics. It stood for religious toleration; it was Protestant, but of a latitudinarian rather than of a fanatical kind; it regarded the wars of religion as silly..."&lt;ref name="Russell, Bertrand 1945"/&gt;

As [[Russell Shorto]] states: “[[Liberalism]] has many meanings, but in its classical sense it is a philosophy based on [[individual freedom]]. History has long taught that our modern sensibility comes from the eighteenth century [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]]. In recent decades, historians have seen the [[Dutch Golden Age|Dutch Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth century as the root of the wider [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Ullmann-Margalit, Edna 1991 p. 16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuer, Lewis S.

Six of the 14 were Dutch, and the Frenchman Bayle spent most of his adult life as a professor in Rotterdam... The Netherlands was the European frontier of liberalism. Locke, finally publishing in the late 1680s, was in many respects a culmination of Dutch thinking, and more, of practicing. He spent five years in worried exile in Holland, before returning to England with the Dutch stadhouder William, now also the English King, having absorbed in Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Rotterdam the results of the country’s liberal thought and practice from Erasmus through Episcopius to Bayle. He stayed two years in Rotterdam with the English Quaker merchant, Benjamin Furly and was friendly with the Arminian theologian Philip van Limborch, both of whom typified the liberal side of opinion gathered in a tolerant Holland of the 1680s.

==== Cartesianism (1630s–1640s) ====
If [[Descartes]] is still considered the father of [[modern philosophy]], [[Dutch Republic]] can be called its cradle. [[Cartesianism]] is the name given to the philosophical doctrine of [[René Descartes]]. Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural sciences]]. [[Cartesianism]] had been controversial for several years before 1656. Descartes himself had lived in the [[Dutch Republic]] for some twenty years (1628–1649). [[Descartes]] served for a while in the army of the [[Dutch States Army|Dutch military]] leader [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange-Nassau]], and developed a fascination for practical technology. In the 1630s, while staying in the Dutch city [[Deventer]], Descartes worked on a text which became published as ''Traite' de l'Homme'' (1664). Throughout his writing, he used words such as [[clock]], [[automaton]], and self – moving machine as interchangeable constructs. He postulated an account of the physical world that was thoroughly [[materialistic]]. His mechanical view of nature replaced the organism model which had been popular since the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Karsten, Luchien 2012"/&gt; His ''[[Discourse on the Method|Discours de la méthode]]'' (1637) was originally published at [[Leiden]], and his ''[[Principles of Philosophy|Principia philosophiae]]'' (1644) appeared from the presses at [[Amsterdam]]. In the 1630s and 1640s, Descartes's ideas gained a foothold at the Dutch universities.&lt;ref&gt;Frijhoff, Willem; Spies, Marijke (2004). ''Dutch Culture in a European Perspective 1: 1650: Hard-Won Unity'', p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spinozism (1660s–1670s) ====
Spinozism is the [[Monism|monist]] [[Philosophy of Spinoza|philosophical system]] of the Dutch-Jewish philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] which defines "God" as a singular self-subsistent substance, with both [[matter]] and thought as its attributes.

==== Affect (philosophy) (1670s) ====
Affect (''affectus'' or ''adfectus'' in [[Latin]]) is a concept used in the [[philosophy of Spinoza]] and elaborated by [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] that emphasizes bodily experience. The term "affect" is central to what became known as the "affective turn" in the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s.

==== Mandeville's paradox (1714) ====
[[Mandeville's paradox]] is named after [[Bernard Mandeville]], who shows that actions which may be qualified as vicious with regard to individuals have benefits for society as a whole. This is already clear from the subtitle of his most famous work, ''[[The Fable of The Bees]]'': ‘Private Vices, Publick Benefits’. He states that "Fraud, Luxury, and Pride must live; Whilst we the Benefits receive.") (The Fable of the Bees, ‘The Moral’).

==== Mathematical intuitionism (1907–1908) ====
Mathematical [[intuitionism]] was founded by the Dutch mathematician and philosopher [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]]. In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], intuitionism, or ''neointuitionism'' (opposed to [[preintuitionism]]), is an approach where mathematics is considered to be purely the result of the constructive [[mental activity]] of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an [[objective reality]]. That is, [[logic]] and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied, but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs, regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality.

=== Religion and ethics ===
==== Devotio Moderna (1370s–1390s) ====

[[Devotio Moderna]], or [[Modern Devotion]], was a movement for religious reform, calling for apostolic renewal through the rediscovery of genuine pious practices such as humility, obedience and simplicity of life. It began in the late fourteenth-century, largely through the work of [[Gerard Groote]], and flourished in the [[Low Countries]] and Germany in the fifteenth century, but came to an end with the Protestant Reformation. [[Gerard Groote]], father of the movement, founded the [[Brethren of the Common Life]]; after his death, disciples established a house of Augustinian Canons at Windesheim (near [[Zwolle]], Overijssel). These two communities became the principal exponents of Devotio Moderna. [[Martin Luther]] studied under the Brethren of the Common Life at [[Magdeburg]] before going on to the University of Erfurt. Another famous member of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] was [[Desiderius Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam]].

Devotio Moderna, an undogmatic form of piety which some historians have argued helped to pave the road for the Protestant Reformation, is most known today through its influence on [[Thomas à Kempis]], the author of ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' a book which proved highly influential for centuries.

==== Mennonites (1536) ====
The [[Mennonites]] are a [[Christianity|Christian]] group based around the church communities of [[Anabaptist]] denominations named after [[Menno Simons]] (1496–1561) of [[Friesland]]. Through his writings, Simons articulated and formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders. The teachings of the Mennonites were founded on their belief in both the mission and [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry of Jesus Christ]], which they held to with great conviction despite persecution by various [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] states.

==== Dutch Reformed Church (1571) ====
The [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Nederlandse Hervormde Kerk'' or NHK) was a [[Reformed]] [[Christian denomination]]. It developed during the [[Protestant Reformation]], with its base in what became known as the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It was founded in the 1570s and lasted until 2004, the year it merged with the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands]] to form the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]].

==== Arminianism (1620) ====
[[Arminianism]] is based on the [[Christian theology|theological]] ideas of [[Dutch Reformed]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560–1609) and his historic supporters known as the [[Remonstrants]]. His teachings held to the [[five solae]] of the Reformation, but they were distinct from the particular teachings of [[Martin Luther]], [[Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]], and other [[Protestant Reformers]]. Arminius (Jacobus Hermanszoon) was a student of Beza (successor of Calvin) at the [[Theological University of Geneva]].

Many [[Christian denominations]] have been influenced by Arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration, notably the [[Baptists]] in the 16th century, the [[Methodists]] in the 18th century and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. [[John Wesley]] was influenced by Arminianism. Also, Arminianism was an important influence in [[Methodism]], which developed out of the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan movement]]. Some assert that [[Universalists]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] in the 18th and 19th centuries were theologically linked with Arminianism.

==== First synagogue to be established in the (Americas) New World (1636) ====
The first [[synagogue]] of the [[New World]], [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], is founded in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]] by the [[Dutch Jews]]. The [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]] in [[Recife]], [[Dutch Brazil|Brazil]], erected in 1636, was the first synagogue erected in the [[Americas]]. Its foundations have been recently discovered, and the 20th-century buildings on the site have been altered to resemble a 17th-century Dutch synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, Jonathan Irvine; Schwartz, Stuart B. (2007). ''The Expansion of Tolerance: Religion in Dutch Brazil (1624–1654)'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jansenism (1640s) ====
[[Jansenism]] was a [[Catholic]] [[theology|theological]] movement, primarily in [[France]], that emphasized [[original sin]], human [[Total depravity|depravity]], the necessity of [[divine grace]], and [[predestination]]. The movement originated from the posthumously published work (''[[Augustinus (Jansenist book)|Augustinus]]'') of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] theologian [[Cornelius Jansen]], who died in 1638. It was first popularized by Jansen's friend [[Abbot]] [[Jean Duvergier de Hauranne]], of [[Saint-Cyran-en-Brenne Abbey]], and after Duvergier's death in 1643, was led by [[Antoine Arnauld]]. Through the 17th and into the 18th centuries, Jansenism was a distinct movement within the [[Catholic Church]]. The theological centre of the movement was the convent of [[Port-Royal Abbey, Paris]], which was a haven for writers including Duvergier, Arnauld, [[Pierre Nicole]], [[Blaise Pascal]], and [[Jean Racine]].

==== First Jewish congregation to be established in (the United States) North America (1654) ====
[[Congregation Shearith Israel]], the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in the City of [[New Amsterdam]], was founded in 1654, the first [[Oldest synagogues in the United States|Jewish congregation]] to be established in [[North America]]. Its founders were twenty-three Jews, mostly of Spanish and Portuguese origin, who had been living in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]]. When the Portuguese defeated the Dutch for control of Recife, and brought with them the Inquisition, the Jews of that area left. Some returned to [[Amsterdam]], where they had originated. Others went to places in the Caribbean such as St. Thomas, Jamaica, Surinam and Curaçao, where they founded sister Sephardic congregations. One group of twenty-three Jews, after a series of unexpected events, landed in [[New Amsterdam]]. After being initially rebuffed by anti-Semitic Governor [[Peter Stuyvesant]], Jews were given official permission to settle in the colony in 1655. These pioneers fought for their rights and won permission to remain. This marks the founding of the [[Congregation Shearith Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shearithisrael.org/content/congregational-history |author=Congregation Shearith Israel |title=''America's First Jewish Congregation (Congregational History)'' |publisher=Congregation Shearith Israel |accessdate=20 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific instruments ===

==== Telescope (optical telescope) (1608) ====
The first historical records of a [[telescope]] appear in patents filed 1608 by [[Hans Lippershey]] and [[Jacob Metius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu ''The Galileo Project {{!}} Science {{!}} The Telescope'' by Al Van Helden: "The Hague discussed the patent applications first of Hans Lipperhey of Middelburg, and then of Jacob Metius of Alkmaar... another citizen of Middelburg, Sacharias Janssen had a telescope at about the same time but was at the Frankfurt Fair where he tried to sell it"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford, Lewis 2010 p. 126"&gt;Mumford, Lewis (2010).

==== Huygens eyepiece (first compound eyepiece) (1670s) ====
[[Huygens eyepiece]]s consist of two [[plano-convex lens]]es with the plane sides towards the eye separated by an air gap. The lenses are called the eye lens and the field lens. The focal plane is located between the two lenses. It was invented by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the late 1660s and was the first compound (multi-lens) [[eyepiece]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2lIwU313wgkC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=Huygens+eyepiece Philip S. Harrington, "'''Star Ware'''", p. 181]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Allyn J. (2003). ''Making Your Own Telescope'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dijksterhuis, Fokko Jan (2004). ''Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the Seventeenth Century'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muktavat, Kshamata; Upadhayaya, Arun. K. (2010). ''Applied Physics'', p. 303–04&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paolini, William (2013). ''Choosing and Using Astronomical Eyepieces'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens discovered that two air spaced lenses can be used to make an eyepiece with zero transverse chromatic aberration. These eyepieces work well with the very long focal length telescopes (in Huygens day they were used with single element long focal length [[non-achromatic objective|non-achromatic]] [[refracting telescope]]s, including very long focal length [[aerial telescope]]s). This optical design is now considered obsolete since with today's shorter focal length telescopes the eyepiece suffers from short eye relief, high image distortion, chromatic aberration, and a very narrow apparent field of view. Since these eyepieces are cheap to make they can often be found on inexpensive telescopes and microscopes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro-tom.com/telescopes/eyepieces.htm astro-tom.com Huygens]&lt;/ref&gt; Because Huygens eyepieces do not contain cement to hold the lens elements, telescope users sometimes use these eyepieces in the role of "solar projection", i.e. projecting an image of the [[Sun]] onto a screen. Other cemented eyepieces can be damaged by the intense, concentrated light of the Sun.

==== Microorganisms (1670s) ====
[[File:Leeuwenhoek Microscope.png|thumb|left|upright|Replica of microscope by [[Leeuwenhoek]]. Van Leeuwenhoek is considered to be the first to observe and describe [[microorganisms]] (''[[animalcules]]'') using a [[microscope]].]]
Using an improved simple [[microscope]], in [[1673 in science|1673]] [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] becomes the first to  discover, observe, describe, study and conduct scientific experiments with single-celled organisms, which he originally referred to as ''animalcules'', and which now referred to as [[microorganism|micro-organisms]] or [[microbe]]s.&lt;ref name="Burgess, Jeremy 1990 p. 186"&gt;Burgess, Jeremy; Marten, Michael; Taylor, Rosemary (1990).

''Principles of Modern Microbiology'', p. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt; For these observations he created at least 25 simple microscopes, of differing types, of which only nine survive. His simple microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding specially shaped single glass sphere that acted as a small lens. The smaller the sphere, the more in magnified. Those that have survived are capable of magnification up to 275 times. It is suspected that Van Leeuwenhoek possessed units that could magnify up to 500 times.

==== Cycloidal pendulum (1673) ====
The [[cycloid]] [[pendulum]] was invented by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1673. Its purpose is to eliminate the lack of [[isochronism]] of the ordinary simple pendulum. This is achieved by making the mass point move on a [[cycloid]] instead of a [[Circle|circular]] [[Arc (geometry)|arc]].&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Frank (2005).

==== Pyrometer (1739) ====
The [[pyrometer]], invented by [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]], is a temperature measuring device. A simple type uses a [[thermocouple]] placed either in a furnace or on the item to be measured. The voltage output of the thermocouple is read from a meter. Many different types of thermocouple are available, for measuring temperatures from −200&amp;nbsp;°C to above 1500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Hebert | first=Luke | date=January 1, 1839 | url=http://chestofbooks.com/crafts/mechanics/Engineer-Mechanic-Encyclopedia-Vol2/Pyrometer.html | title=: Engineer's And Mechanic's Encyclopaedia | accessdate=1 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leyden jar (first practical capacitor) (1745–1746) ====
[[File:Leidse flessen Museum Boerhave december 2003 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A battery of four water-filled [[Leyden jar]]s, [[Museum Boerhaave]], [[Leiden]]. The [[Leyden jar]] was the [[capacitor|first device]] capable of storing an [[electric charge]].]]

A [[Leyden jar]], or [[Leiden jar]], is a device that "stores" static [[electricity]] between two [[electrode]]s on the inside and outside of a glass jar. It was the original form of a [[capacitor]] (originally known as a "condenser"). It was invented independently by German cleric [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] on 11 October 1745 and by Dutch scientist [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of [[Leiden]] ([[Leyden]]) in 1745–1746. The invention was named for the city. The Leyden jar was used to conduct many early [[experiment]]s in [[electricity]], and its discovery was of fundamental importance in the study of electricity. Previously, researchers had to resort to insulated conductors of large dimensions to store a charge. The Leyden jar provided a much more compact alternative. Like many early electrical devices, there was no particular use for the Leyden jar at first, other than to allow scientists to do a greater variety of electrical experiments. [[Benjamin Franklin]], for example, used a Leyden jar to store [[electricity]] from [[lightning]] in his famous [[kite experiment]] in 1752. By doing so he proved that [[lightning]] was really [[electricity]].

The idea for the [[Leyden jar]] was discovered independently by two parties: German scientist and jurist [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]], and Dutchmen [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] and [[Andreas Cunaeus]]. These scientists developed the [[Leyden jar]] while working under a theory of electricity that saw electricity as a fluid, and hoped to develop the jar to "capture" this fluid. In 1744 von Kleist lined a glass jar with silver foil, and charged the foil with a friction machine. Kleist was convinced that a substantial electric charge could be collected when he received a significant shock from the device. The effects of this "Kleistian jar" were independently discovered around the same time by Dutch scientists [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] and Cunaeus at the [[University of Leiden]]. Van Musschenbroek communicated on it with the French scientific community where it was called the [[Leyden jar]].&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, J. L. (1979).

==== Eisinga Planetarium (1781) ====
The [[Eisinga Planetarium]] (Royal Eise Eisinga Planetarium) was built by [[Eise Eisinga]] in his home in [[Franeker]], [[Friesland]]. It took Eisinga seven years to build his [[planetarium]], completing it in 1781. The [[orrery]] still exists and is the world's oldest working [[planetarium]].

==== Kipp's apparatus (1860) ====
[[Kipp's apparatus]], also called a Kipp generator, is designed for preparation of small volumes of gases. It was invented around 1860 by Dutch pharmacist [[Petrus Jacobus Kipp]] and widely used in chemical [[laboratories]] and for demonstrations in schools into the second half of the 20th century.

==== Phase contrast microscope (1933) ====
[[File:Phase contrast microscope.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[phase contrast microscope]]. [[Frits Zernike]]'s invention permits the study of internal [[cell (biology)|cell]] structure without the need to [[staining (biology)|stain]] and thus kill the cells.]]
In [[optical microscopy]] many objects such as [[Cell (biology)|cell]] parts in [[protozoan]]s, bacteria and sperm tails are essentially fully transparent unless stained (and therefore killed). The difference in densities and composition within these objects however often gives rise to changes in the phase of light passing through them, hence they are sometimes called "phase objects". Using the [[Phase contrast microscopy|phase-contrast technique]] makes these structures visible and allows the study of living specimens. This phase contrast technique proved to be such an advancement in [[microscopy]] that Dutch physicist [[Frits Zernike]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] in 1953.

==== Magnetic horn (1961) ====
The [[magnetic horn]] (also known as the ''Van der Meer horn'') is a high-current, pulsed focusing device, invented by the Dutch physicist [[Simon van der Meer]] at [[CERN]]. It selects [[pion]]s and focuses them into a sharp beam. Its original application was in the context of neutrino physics, where beams of pions have to be tightly focused. When the pions then decay into [[muon]]s and [[neutrino]]s or antineutrinos, an equally well-focused neutrino beam is obtained. The muons were stopped in a wall of 3000 tons of iron and 1000 tons of concrete, leaving the neutrinos or antineutrinos to reach the [[Gargamelle]] [[bubble chamber]].

=== Sports and games ===
==== Kolf (forerunner of modern golf) ( 13th century) ====

[[File:Hendrick Avercamp, Kolfspelers op het ijs, Circa 1625.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kolf players on ice, [[Hendrick Avercamp]]'s painting (1625)]]

A [[golf]]-like game (''[[kolf]]'' in Dutch) is recorded as taking place on 26 February 1297, in a city called Loenen aan de Vecht, where the Dutch played a game with a stick and leather ball. The winner was whomever hit the ball with the least number of strokes into a target several hundred yards away. Some scholars argue that this game of putting a small ball in a hole in the ground using clubs was also played in 17th-century Netherlands and that this predates the game in Scotland.

==== Figure skating (prototype) (15th–17th centuries) ====
[[File:Lidwinas fall.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Lidwina|St. Lidwina of Schiedam]]'s fall when she was [[ice skating]], wood drawing from the 1498 edition of [[John Brugman]]'s ''Vita of Lidwina''.]]

The Dutch played a significant role in the history of [[ice skating]] (including [[speed skating]] and [[figure skating]]). The first feature of [[ice skating]] in a [[work of art]] was made in the 15th century. The picture, depicted [[Saint Lidwina]], [[patron saint]] of ice skaters, falling on the ice. Another important aspect is a man seen in the background, who is skating on one leg. This means that his skates must have had sharp edges similar to those found on modern [[ice skate]]s. Until the 17th century, ice skating was mostly used for transportation. Some of the [[Stuarts]] (including King [[Charles II of England]]) who had fled to the [[Dutch Republic]] during the [[Cromwell]] Royal reign later returned to Britain, bringing with them the new sport. Upon his return to England in 1658, the King brought two innovations in ice skating – a pair of iron skates and the [[Dutch roll]]. The [[Dutch roll]] was the first form of a gliding or skating motion made possible by the iron skate's two edges. However, [[speed skating]] was the focus of the Dutch, while the English developed modern [[figure skating]].

==== Speed skating (15th–17th centuries) ====
[[File:Kortebaanwedstrijd in Hindelopen.jpg|thumb|Speed skating match on the [[Zuiderzee]] near [[Hindeloopen]] in 1828]]

[[Speed skating]], which had developed in the Netherlands in the 17th century, was given a boost by the innovations in [[Ice skate|skate]] construction. Speed skating, or speedskating, is a competitive form of skating in which skaters race each other over a certain distance. Types of speed skating are [[long track speed skating]], [[short track speed skating]] and [[marathon speed skating]]. In the [[modern Olympic Games]], long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just "speed skating", while short-track speed skating is known as "short track".

==== Yachting (sport sailing) (17th century) ====
Sailing, also known as [[yachting]], is a sport in which competitors race from point to point, or around a race course, in sail-powered [[Marine vessel|boats]]. Yachting refers to recreational sailing or [[boating]], the specific act of sailing or using other water vessels for sporting purposes. The invention of sailing is prehistoric, but the racing of sailing boats is believed to have started in the Netherlands some time in the 17th century. While living in the Dutch Republic, King Charles II of England fell in love with sailing and in 1660, took home the Dutch [[Dutch Gift|gifted]] 66-foot [[yacht]] he called ''[[HMY Mary|Mary]]''. The sport's popularity spread across the British Isles. The world's first [[yacht club]] was founded in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland in 1720.

==== International Skating Union (1892) ====
The [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) is the international [[sport governing body|governing body]] for competitive ice skating disciplines, including [[figure skating]], [[synchronized skating]], [[speed skating]], and [[short track speed skating]]. It was founded in [[Scheveningen]], Netherlands, in 1892, making it the oldest governing international [[winter sport]] federation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isu.org/en/about-isu/history |title=''Some key dates in ISU history'' |publisher=[[International Skating Union]] (ISU) |accessdate=20 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702104041/http://www.isu.org/en/about-isu/history |archivedate=2 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the oldest international sport federations.

The [[World Speed Skating Championships|first official World Championships in Speed Skating]] ([[World All-Round Speed Skating Championships for Men|open to men only]]) directly under the auspices of the ISU [[1893 World Allround Speed Skating Championships|were held in Amsterdam in 1893]].

==== Korfball (1902) ====
[[Korfball]] (Korfbal in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a mixed gender [[team sport]], with similarities to [[netball]] and [[basketball]]. A team consists of eight players; four female and four male. A team also includes a coach. It was founded in the Netherlands in 1902 by Nico Broekhuysen.

==== Cruyff Turn (1974) ====
The [[Cruijff Turn]] (also known as ''[[Cruyff Turn]]''), is a famous [[dribble|dribbling]] trick in [[soccer|football]], was perfected by the Dutch football player [[Johan Cruyff|Johan Cruijff]] for whom the evasive trick was named. To make this move, the player first looks to pass or cross the ball. However, instead of kicking it, he drags the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot, turns through 180 degrees and accelerates away. The trick was famously employed by Cruijff in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], first seen in the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and soon widely copied.

==== Total Football (1970s) ====
The foundations for [[Total Football]] (Dutch: totaalvoetbal) were laid by Englishman [[Jack Reynolds (footballer born 1881)|Jack Reynolds]] who was the manager of [[AFC Ajax]]. [[Rinus Michels]], who played under Reynolds, later became manager of Ajax and refined the concept into what is known today as "Total Football" (''Totaalvoetbal'' in Dutch language), using it in his training for the [[Ajax Amsterdam]] squad and the [[Netherlands national football team]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, David (2000).

[[Johan Cruyff]] was the system's most famous exponent. Due to Cruyff's style of play, he is still referred to as ''the total footballer''.&lt;ref&gt;With regards to role models, Brazilian football manager and former player [[Telê Santana]] has mentioned in one interview (1992) that he had no idols, though: "My greatest satisfaction would be to manage a team such as [[Total Football|1974 Holland]]. It was a team where you could pick [Johan] Cruyff and place him on the right wing. If I had to put him in the left-wing, he would still play [the same]. I could choose [[Johan Neeskens|Neeskens]], who played both to the right and to the left of the midfield. Thus, everyone played in any position."&lt;/ref&gt; Its cornerstone was a focus on positional interchange. The invention of ''[[totaalvoetbal]]'' helped lay the foundations for the significant successes of [[Football in the Netherlands|Dutch football]] at both club and [[Netherlands national football team|international level]] in the 1970s. During that decade, the Dutch football rose from almost total obscurity to become a powerhouse in world football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = Ric | year = 2014 | title = Looking at the extraordinary success of the 'Clockwork Orange': examining the brilliance of total football played by the Netherlands''.

==== Tiki-taka (1990s) ====
[[FC Barcelona]] and the [[Spanish national football team]] play a style of football known as ''[[Tiki-taka]]'' that has its roots in [[Total Football]]. [[Johan Cruyff]] founded Tiki-taka (commonly spelled ''[[tiqui-taca]]'' in Spanish) during his time as manager of [[FC Barcelona]] (1988–1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arxiu.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/club/temporada09-10/04/08/n100408110309.html |title=''Recognition of the man who created a style'' |publisher=fcbarcelona.cat |last= Forns |first=Vanessa |quote=FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta: "As a player, he turned football into an art form.

=== Technology and engineering ===
==== First pound lock in Europe (1373) ====
[[File:Oosterscheldekering-pohled.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier. The [[Delta Works]] and the [[Zuiderzee Works]] have been declared one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].]]
[[Image:Zuiderzeeworks.png|thumb|right|180px|The ''[[Zuiderzee Works]]'' turned the [[Zuiderzee]] into a fresh water lake [[IJsselmeer]], and created 1650 km² of land. [[Flood control in the Netherlands|Flood control]] and [[land reclamation]] have been ongoing through history, making the Dutch among the world's leading experts in [[hydraulic engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;In the Netherlands, one of the earliest large-scale [[land reclamation]] projects was the [[Beemster]] [[Polder]], realized in 1612 adding 70 km2 of land. The [[Flevopolder]], reclaimed from the [[IJsselmeer]], is the largest reclaimed [[artificial island]] in the world. Dutch [[hydraulic engineering]] (flood control, drainage, land reclamation, and canal building) helped form many urban areas of the world such as [[Friedrichstadt]], [[History of Gdańsk|Gdańsk/Danzig]], [[History of Gothenburg|Gothenburg]], [[History of Jakarta|Jakarta]], and [[History of Saint Petersburg|Saint Petersburg]]. Skilled in the art of land reclamation, the Dutch were in demand all over Europe. With their experiences in land reclamation and farming, Dutch [[Mennonites]] were invited to farm the wetlands in the [[Vistula Delta]] of [[Prussia]]. Dutch hydraulic engineer [[Cornelius Vermuyden]] introduced Dutch land-reclamation methods in [[England]] and drained [[the Fens]], the low marshy lands in the [[Eastern England|east of England]]. The [[Palm Islands]] ([[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]) are [[artificial island]]s constructed from sand dredged from the bottom of the [[Persian Gulf]] by the Dutch company, [[Van Oord]] and the Belgian company, [[Jan De Nul]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch have demonstrated that it is perfectly feasible to safely live below sea level. About 30% of the Netherlands lies below [[sea level]]. Also, about 55% of its area is vulnerable to [[flooding]], and about 29% is susceptible to river flooding. As a really small-sized country with few [[natural resources]], about 1/6 of the entire country (about 7,000 km2 in total) has been reclaimed from the sea, lakes, [[marshes]] and [[swamp]]s. This has led to an old Dutch saying, "God created the world, but the Dutch created [[Holland]] (or [[the Netherlands]])".]]
The Netherlands revived the construction of [[canal]]s during the 13th–14th century that had generally been discontinued since the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. They also contributed in the development of canal construction technology, such as introducing the first [[flash lock]]s in Europe. The first [[Lock (water transport)|pound lock]] in Europe was built by the Dutch in 1373 at [[Vreeswijk]], where a canal from [[Utrecht]] joins the river [[Lek (river)|Lek]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, Rodney (2004).

[[File:OfficeThermostat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bimetallic [[thermostat]] for buildings. In the 1620s, [[Cornelius Drebbel]] invented a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] thermostat to regulate the temperature of a chicken incubator. This is one of the first recorded modern [[Feedback|feedback-controlled]] devices.]]

Around the 1620s, [[Cornelis Drebbel]] developed an [[automatic control|automatic]] temperature [[control system]] for a [[furnace]], motivated by his belief that base metals could be turned to gold by holding them at a precise constant temperature for long periods of time. He also used this [[thermostat|temperature regulator]] in an [[incubator (egg)|incubator]] for hatching chickens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Beniger, James R.]] (1986).

==== Feedback control system (1620s) ====
Feedback control has been used for centuries to regulate engineered systems. In the 17th century, Drebbel invented one of the earliest devices to use [[feedback]], an chicken [[incubator (egg)|incubator]] that used a damper controlled by a thermostat to maintain a constant temperature.

==== Magic lantern (first practical image projector; the forerunner of modern slide projector) (1659) ====
[[File:Wymondham magic lantern.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Magic lantern]] at the [[Wymondham]] Museum. The magic lantern (Laterna magica or Lanterna magica) was the forerunner of the modern [[slide projector]].]]

The [[magic lantern]] is an [[optical device]], an early type of [[image projector]] developed in the 17th century. People have been projecting images using concave mirrors and pin-hole cameras ([[camera obscura]]) since Roman times. But glass lens technology wasn't sufficiently developed to make advanced [[optical device]]s (such as [[telescope]] and [[microscope]]) until the 17th century. With pinhole cameras and [[camera obscura]] it was only possible to project an image of actual scene, such as an image of the sun, on a surface. The [[magic lantern]] on the other hand could project a painted image on a surface, and marks the point where [[camera]]s and [[projector]]s became two different kinds of devices. There has been some debate about who the original inventor of the magic lantern is, but the most widely accepted theory is that [[Christiaan Huygens]] developed the original device in the late 1650s.&lt;ref&gt;Pfragner, Julius.

''X-Ray Vision: A Way of Looking'', p. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources give credit to the German priest [[Athanasius Kircher]]. He describes a device such as the magic lantern in his book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, Damer. “Introduction.” Panoramas, Magic Lanterns and Cinemas. Channel Islands, NJ: Tocan Books. xiii-xv. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars magna"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gki6ZIbrgQ8C| title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae. Athanasius Kircher. 1671| accessdate = 19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens is credited because of his major innovation in lantern technology, which was the replacement of images etched on mirrors from earlier lanterns such as Kircher's with images painted on glass. This is what paved the way for the use of colour and for double-layered slide projections (generally used to simulate movement).

The first allusion to a 'magic lantern' is by Huygens in the 1650s and he is generally credited with inventing it – though he didn't want to admit it, considering it frivolous. Huygens was the first to describe a fully functioning [[magic lantern]], one he made, and wrote about it in a work in 1659. Huygens magic lantern has been described as the predecessor of today's [[slide projector]] and the forerunner of the [[motion picture]] [[projector]]. Images were hand painted onto the glass slide until the mid-19th century when photographic slides were employed. Huygens introduced this curiosity to the Danish mathematician [[Thomas Walgenstein]] who realized its commercial value for entertainment and traveled through Europe – mostly France and Italy – demonstrating his machine to foreign princes and selling them replicas for their own amusement. The forerunner of the modern [[slide projector]] as well as moving pictures, [[magic lantern]]s retained their popularity for centuries and were also the first optical toy to be used for family entertainment in the home.

In Amsterdam, the Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, [[Jan van der Heyden]], and his son Nicholaas took firefighting to its next step with the fashioning of the first [[fire hose]] in 1673.

[[Gunpowder]] was inserted into the tube and lit through a small hole at the base, like a [[cannon]]. The expanding [[gasses]] would drive the piston up the tube until the reached a point near the top. Here, the piston uncovered holes in the tube that allowed any remaining hot gasses to escape. The weight of the piston and the [[vacuum]] formed by the cooling gasses in the now-closed cylinder drew the piston back into the tube, lifting a test mass to provide power.&lt;ref name="Galloway, Robert Lindsay 1881 p. 22"&gt;Galloway, Robert Lindsay (1881). "The Steam Engine and Its Inventors", p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; According to sources, a single example of this sort of [[engine]] was built in 1678 or 79 using a cannon as the cylinder. The cylinder was held down to a base where the gunpowder sat, making it a [[Breech-loading weapon|breech loading]] design. The gasses escaped via two leather tubes attached at the top of the barrel. When the piston reached them the gasses blew the tubes open, and when the [[pressure]] fell, gravity pulled the [[leather]] down causing the tubes droop to the side of the cylinder, sealing the holes.&lt;ref name="Galloway, Robert Lindsay 1881 p. 22"/&gt; Huygens’ presented a paper on his invention in 1680, ''A New Motive Power by Means of Gunpowder and Air''.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Robert Lindsay (1881). "The Steam Engine and Its Inventors", p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; By 1682, the device had successfully shown that a dram (1/16th of an ounce) of gunpowder, in a cylinder seven or eight feet high and fifteen or eighteen inches in diameter, could raise seven or eight boys (or about 1,100 pounds) into the air, who held the end of the rope.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Robert Lindsay (1881).

==== Hollander beater (1680s) ====
The [[Hollander beater]] is a machine developed by the Dutch in 1680 to produce [[pulp (paper)|pulp]] from [[cellulose]]-containing plant fibers. It replaced stamp mills for preparing pulp because the Hollander could produce in one day the same quantity of pulp that a stamp mill could produce in eight.

A ''[[meat slicer]]'', also called a ''slicing machine'', ''deli slicer'' or simply a ''slicer'', is a tool used in [[butcher]] shops and [[delicatessen]]s to slice [[meat]]s and [[cheese]]s. The first meat slicer was invented by Wilhelm van Berkel (Wilhelmus Adrianus van Berkel) in [[Rotterdam]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feith|first=Jan|title=Modern Holland|publisher=Nijgh &amp; van Ditmar's Publishing Co., ltd|year=1922|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.averyberkel.com/main.aspx?p=1.1.3.7|title=Berkel|publisher=Avery Berkel|accessdate=2008-10-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707193242/http://www.averyberkel.com/main.aspx?p=1.1.3.7|archivedate=7 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkelcompany.com/details.cfm?id=61|title=Company history|publisher=Berkel|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older models of meat slicer may be operated by [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], while newer ones generally use an [[electric motor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emiliomiti.com/restaurant-news/vintage-hand-cranked-meat-slicers-popular-among-green-chefs-and-restaurants/|title=Vintage Hand-cranked Meat Slicers Popular Among ‘Green’ Chefs and Restaurants|publisher=Emiliomiti LLC|accessdate=2008-10-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907115243/http://www.emiliomiti.com/restaurant-news/vintage-hand-cranked-meat-slicers-popular-among-green-chefs-and-restaurants/|archivedate=7 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pentode (1926) ====
A pentode is an electronic device having five active [[electrode]]s. The term most commonly applies to a three-grid [[vacuum tube]] (thermionic valve), which was invented by the Dutchman [[Bernard Tellegen|Bernhard D.H. Tellegen]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Okamura, Sōgo (1994). ''History of Electron Tubes'', p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, Anton A. (2003).

==== Philishave (1939) ====
[[Philishave]] was the [[brand name]] for [[Electric razors|electric shavers]] manufactured by the Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care unit of Philips (in the US, the [[Norelco]] name is used). The Philishave shaver was invented by Philips engineer [[Alexandre Horowitz]], who used rotating cutters instead of the reciprocating cutters that had been used in previous electric shavers.

==== Gyrator (1948) ====
A [[gyrator]] is a [[passivity (engineering)|passive]], linear, lossless, [[two-port network|two-port]] electrical [[lumped element model|network element]] invented by Tellegen as a hypothetical fifth [[linear element]] after the [[resistor]], [[capacitor]], [[inductor]] and [[transformer#Ideal power equation|ideal transformer]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorf, Richard C.

==== Traffic enforcement camera (1958) ====
Dutch company ''Gatsometer BV'', founded by the 1950s [[rally (sports)|rally]] driver ''[[Maurice Gatsonides]]'', invented the first traffic enforcement camera. Gatsonides wished to better monitor his speed around the corners of a race track and came up with the device in order to improve his time around the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50608-10.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326120409/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50608-10.htm |date=26 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company developed the first [[radar]] for use with road traffic and is the world's largest supplier of speed-monitoring camera systems. Because of this, in some countries speed cameras are sometimes referred to as "[[Gatso]]s". They are also sometimes referred to as "photo radar", even though many of them do not use radar.

The first systems introduced in the late 1960s used [[film camera]]s, replaced by [[digital camera]]s beginning in the late 1990s.

==== Variomatic (1958) ====
[[Variomatic]] is the stepless, fully [[automatic transmission]] of the Dutch car manufacturer [[DAF Trucks|DAF]], originally developed by [[Hub van Doorne]]. The Variomatic was introduced in 1958 ([[DAF 600]]), the first automatic gear box made in the Netherlands. It continues in use in [[motorscooter]]s. Variomatic was the first commercially successful [[continuously variable transmission]]s (CVT).

==== Red light camera (1965) ====
A [[Red light camera]] is a [[traffic enforcement camera]] that captures an image of a vehicle that enters an intersection against a red traffic light. By automatically photographing such vehicles, the camera produces evidence that assists authorities in their enforcement of traffic laws. The first [[red light camera]] system was introduced in 1965, using tubes stretched across the road to detect the violation and trigger the camera. One of the first developers of these red light camera systems was Dutch company [[Gatso|Gatsometer BV]].

==== Stochastic cooling (1968) ====
[[Stochastic cooling]] is a form of [[particle beam cooling]]. It is used in some [[particle accelerator]]s and [[storage ring]]s to control the emission of [[particle beam]]s. This process uses the electrical signals that the individual [[charged particle]]s generate in a feedback loop to reduce the tendency of individual particles to move away from other particles in the beam. This technique was invented and applied at the [[Intersecting Storage Rings]], and later the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]], at [[CERN]] in Geneva, Switzerland by Dutch physicist [[Simon van der Meer]]. By increasing the particle density to close to the required energy, this technique improved the beam quality and, inter alia, brought the discovery of [[W and Z bosons]] within reach.

==== Clap skate (1980) ====
The [[clap skate]] (also called clapskates, slap skates, slapskates) is a type of ice skate used in speed skating. Clap skates were developed at the Faculty of Human Movement Sciences of the [[Vrije Universiteit]] of Amsterdam, led by [[Gerrit Jan van Ingen Schenau]], although the idea is much older. van Ingen Schenau, who started work on a hinged speed skate in 1979, created his first prototype in 1980 and finished his PhD thesis on the subject in 1981 using the premise that a skater would benefit from extended movement keeping the blade on the ice, allowing the calf muscles more time to exert force.

==== Cremulator (1981) ====
The [[Cremulator]] is a machine developed by the Dutch company ALL Europe in 1981. The Cremulator is used after cremation, about 3&amp;nbsp;kg of ashes remain on average. These ash residues are reduced in a cremulator for subsequent scattering or in an urn. Also called asmill. The Cremulator is now further developed by [[DFW Europe]] as cremation equipment manufacturer in The Netherlands.

==== Ice skate improvements (14th–15th centuries) ====

[[File:Hendrick Avercamp - A Scene on the Ice - WGA01076.jpg|thumb|right|200px|During the 13th and 14th century, wooden skates with metal blades were introduced by Dutch. These ice skates were made of steel, with sharpened edges on the bottom to aid movement. The construction of modern [[ice skate]]s has stayed largely the same since then.]]

In the 14th century, the Dutch started using wooden platform skates with flat iron bottom runners. The skates were attached to the skater's shoes with leather straps and poles were used to propel the [[Ice skating|skater]]. Around 1500, the Dutch shifted to a narrow metal double edged blade, so the skater could now push and glide with his feet, eliminating the need for a pole.

==== Herring Buss (15th century) ====
A [[herring buss]] ({{lang-nl|Haringbuis}}) was a type of seagoing [[fishing vessel]], used by Dutch and Flemish [[herring]] fishermen in the 15th through early 19th centuries. The ''Buis'' was first adapted for use as a fishing vessel in the Netherlands, after the invention of [[gibbing]] made it possible to preserve herring at sea.&lt;ref name="De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 244"&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; This made longer voyages feasible, and hence enabled Dutch fishermen to follow the herring [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]] far from the coasts. The first herring buss was probably built in [[Hoorn]] around 1415. The last one was built in [[Vlaardingen]] in 1841.

==== Yacht (1580s) ====
[[File:Jacob van Strij - Het Jacht van de kamer Rotterdam.jpg|thumb|upright|An 18th-century Dutch [[yacht]] owned by the [[Rotterdam]] chapter of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. This yacht has the gaff rig and [[leeboard]]s of the period.]]

Originally defined as a light, fast sailing vessel used by the Dutch navy to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into the shallow waters of the Low Countries. Later, [[yacht]]s came to be perceived as luxury, or recreational vessels.

==== Fluyt (16th century) ====
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - A Flute (State 2).jpg|thumb|right|Dutch [[fluyt]], 1677]]

[[Fluyt]], a type of [[sailing ship|sailing vessel]] originally designed as a dedicated cargo vessel. Originating from the Netherlands in the 16th century, the vessel was designed to facilitate transoceanic delivery with the maximum of space and crew efficiency. The inexpensive ship could be built in large numbers. This ship class was credited with enhancing Dutch competitiveness in international trade and was widely employed by the Dutch East India Company in the 17th and 18th centuries. The fluyt was a significant factor in the 17th century rise of the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch seaborne empire]].&lt;ref name="Wiesner, Merry E. 2013 p. 220"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, Gary; Korzeniewicz, Miguel (1994).

==== Wind-powered sawmill (1592) ====
[[File:Sawmill 'Salamander' in Leidschendam, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''De Salamander'', a wind-driven [[sawmill]] in [[Leidschendam]]]]

[[Cornelis Corneliszoon]] was the inventor of the wind-powered [[sawmill]].&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, Gary; Korzeniewicz, Miguel (1994). ''Commodity Chains and Global Capitalism (Contributions in Economics and Economic History)'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Martin (2000). ''Water and Wind Power'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Neil (2006). ''Wind Power'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curley, Robert (2009). ''The Britannica Guide to Inventions That Changed the Modern World'', p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curley, Robert (2012). ''Renewable and Alternative Energy'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the invention of [[sawmill]]s, boards were rived and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a [[whipsaw]] using saddleblocks to hold the log and a pit for the pitman who worked below and got the benefit of sawdust in his eyes. Sawing was slow and required strong and durable sawmen. The topsawer had to be the stronger of the two because the saw was pulled in turn by each man, and the lower had the advantage of gravity. The topsawyer also had to guide the saw to produce a plank of even thickness. This was often done by following a chalkline.

Early sawmills adapted the whipsaw to mechanical power, generally driven by a [[water wheel]] to speed up the process. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by a ''pitman'' thus introducing a term used in many mechanical applications. A pitman is similar to a [[crankshaft]] used in reverse. A crankshaft converts back-and-forth motion to circular motion.

Generally only the saw was powered and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to steadily advance the log through the saw blade.

==== Schooner (prototype) (17th century) ====
A [[schooner]] is a type of [[sailing ship|sailing vessel]] with [[fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] sails on two or more [[mast (sailing)|masts]], the foremast being no taller than the rear mast(s). Such vessels were first used by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in the 16th or 17th century (but may not have been called that at the time). Schooners first evolved from a variety of small two-masted gaff-rigged vessels used in the coast and estuaries of the [[Netherlands]] in the late 17th century. Most were working craft but some pleasure yachts with schooner rigs were built for wealthy merchants and Dutch nobility. Following arrival of the Dutch-born prince [[William III of England|William III the Orange]] on the British throne, the British [[Royal Navy]] built a [[Royal yacht]] with a schooner rig in 1695, HMS ''Royal Transport''. This vessel, captured in a detailed Admiralty model, is the earliest fully documented schooner.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heinz Marquardt, ''The Global Schooner: Origins, Development, Design and Construction 1695–1845'', Naval Institute Press (2003), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; ''Royal Transport'' was quickly noted for its speed and ease of handling and mercantile vessels soon adopted the rig in Europe and in European colonies in North America. Schooners were immediately popular with colonial traders and fishermen in North America with the first documented reference to a schooner in America appearing in [[Boston]] port records in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;Marquardt, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; North American shipbuilders quickly developed a variety of schooner forms for trading, fishing and privateering. According to the language scholar [[Walter William Skeat]], the term ''schooner'' comes from ''scoon'', while the ''sch'' spelling comes from the later adoption of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spelling ("schoener"). Another study suggests that a Dutch expression praising ornate schooner yachts in the 17th century, "een schoone Schip", may have led to the term "schooner" being used by English speakers to describe the early versions of the schooner rig as it evolved in England and America.&lt;ref name="Marquardt, p. 8"&gt;Marquardt, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Land yacht (1600) ====
[[File:Simon Stevins zeilwagen voor Prins Maurits 1649.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Land yacht]]s designed by [[Simon Stevin]] in the year 1600]]

The Wind chariot or [[land yacht]] (Zeilwagen) was designed by Flemish-born mathematician &amp; engineer [[Simon Stevin]] for [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]]. [[Land sailing|Land yacht]]. It offered a carriage with sails, of which a little model was preserved in [[Scheveningen]] until 2012. Around the year 1600, Stevin, Maurice and twenty-six others used it on the beach between Scheveningen and Petten. The carriage was propelled solely by force of wind, and traveled faster than horse-drawn vehicles.

==== First verified practical (navigable) submarine (1620) ====

He designed and manufactured a steerable submarine with a leather-covered wooden frame. Between 1620 and 1624 Drebbel successfully built and tested two more, successively larger vessels. The third model had 6 [[oar]]s and could carry 16 passengers. This model was demonstrated to [[King James I]] and several thousand Londoners. The submarine stayed submerged for three hours and could travel from [[Westminster]] to [[Greenwich]] and back, cruising at a depth of from {{convert|12|to|15|ft}}. This submarine was tested many times in the [[River Thames|Thames]], but never used in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Cartmell, Donald (2004).

In 2002, the British boatbuilder [[Mark Edwards (boatbuilder)|Mark Edwards]] built a wooden submarine based on the original 17th-century version by Drebbel. This was shown in the BBC TV programme ''Building the Impossible'' in November 2002. It is a scale working model of the original and was built using tools and construction methods common in 17th century boat building and was successfully tested under water with two rowers at Dorney Lake, diving beneath the surface and being rowed underwater for 10 minutes. Legal considerations prevented its use on the River Thames itself.

==== First ever car equipped with a six-cylinder engine, along with four-wheel drive (1903) ====

=== Others ===
==== First practical national anthem (''Het Wilhelmus'') (1574) ====
''[[Wilhelmus|Wilhelmus van Nassouwe]]'' (''[[Het Wilhelmus]]'') is the [[national anthem]] of the [[Netherlands]] and is the oldest national anthem in the world. The anthem was first written down in 1574 (during the [[Dutch Revolt]]). The Japanese anthem, [[Kimigayo]], has the oldest (9th century) lyrics, but a melody was only added in the late 19th century, making it a poem rather than an anthem for most of its lifespan. Although the [[Wilhelmus]] was not officially recognised as the Dutch national anthem until 1932, it has always been popular with parts of the Dutch population and resurfaced on several occasions in the course of Dutch history before gaining its present status.

=== Archaeology ===

==== Java Man (Homo erectus erectus) (1891) ====
[[File:Pithecanthropus-erectus.jpg|thumb|Original fossils of ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (now ''Homo erectus'') found in Java in 1891.

[[Java Man]] (''Homo erectus erectus'') is the name given to hominid fossils discovered in 1891 at [[Trinil]] – [[Ngawi Regency]] on the banks of the Solo River in [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]], one of the first known specimens of [[Homo erectus]]. Its discoverer, Dutch paleontologist [[Eugène Dubois]], gave it the scientific name '''Pithecanthropus erectus''', a name derived from Greek and Latin roots meaning ''upright ape-man''.

=== Astronomy ===
==== Columba (constellation) (1592) ====

[[Constellation Columba|Columba]] is a small, faint [[constellation]] named in the late sixteenth century. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[dove]]. It is located just south of [[Canis Major]] and [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]]. Columba was named by Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1592 in order to differentiate the 'unformed stars' of the large constellation [[Canis Major]]. Plancius first depicted Columba on the small celestial planispheres of his large wall map of 1592. It is also shown on his smaller world map of 1594 and on early Dutch celestial globes.

==== Novaya Zemlya effect (1597) ====
The first person to record the [[Novaya Zemlya effect]] was [[Gerrit de Veer]], a member of [[Willem Barentsz]]' ill-fated third expedition into the polar region. [[Novaya Zemlya]], the [[archipelago]] where de Veer first observed the phenomenon, lends its name to the effect.

* ''[[Indus (constellation)|Indus]]'' represents an Indian, a word that could refer at the time to any native of Asia or the Americas.
* ''[[Musca]]'' is one of the minor southern constellations. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.
* ''[[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]]'' is [[Latin]] for [[peacock]].
* ''[[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]]'' is a minor southern constellation, named after the mythical [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]. It was the largest of the twelve.
* ''[[Triangulum Australe]]'' is Latin for "the southern triangle", which distinguishes it from [[Triangulum]] in the northern sky and is derived from the almost equilateral pattern of its three brightest stars. It was first depicted on a [[celestial globe]] as Triangulus Antarcticus by Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''Uranometria''.
* ''[[Tucana]]'' is Latin for the [[toucan]], a South American bird.
* ''[[Volans]]'' represents a [[flying fish]]; its name is a shortened form of its original name, ''Piscis Volans''.

==== Camelopardalis (constellation) (1612–1613) ====
''Camelopardalis'' was created by Plancius in 1613 to represent the animal [[Rebecca]] rode to marry [[Isaac]] in [[the Bible]]. One year later, [[Jakob Bartsch]] featured it in his atlas. [[Johannes Hevelius]] gave it the official name of "Camelopardus" or "Camelopardalis" because he saw the [[constellation]]'s many faint stars as the spots of a [[giraffe]].

==== Monoceros (constellation) (1612–1613) ====
''Monoceros'' is a relatively modern creation. Its first certain appearance was on a globe created by Plancius in 1612 or 1613. It was later charted by Bartsch as ''Unicornus'' in his 1624 star chart.

==== Rings of Saturn (1655) ====
[[Image:Unraveling Saturn's Rings.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first person to describe [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn's rings]] as a disk surrounding [[Saturn]]]]

In 1655, Huygens became the first person to suggest that Saturn was surrounded by a ring, after Galileo's much less advanced telescope had failed to show rings. Galileo had reported the anomaly as possibly 3 planets instead of one.

==== Titan (Saturn's moon) (1655) ====
[[Image:Titan in natural color Cassini.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] was the first known [[Moons of Saturn|moon of Saturn]], discovered in 1655 by [[Christiaan Huygens]].]]

In 1655, using a 50 power [[refracting telescope]] that he designed himself, Huygens discovered the first of [[Saturn]]'s moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

==== Kapteyn's Star (1897) ====
[[Kapteyn's Star]] is a [[Stellar classification|class M1]] [[red dwarf]] about 12.76 [[light year]]s from Earth in the southern [[constellation]] [[Pictor]], and the closest [[galactic halo|halo]] star to the Solar System. With a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of nearly 9 it is visible through [[binoculars]] or a [[telescope]]. It had the highest [[proper motion]] of any star known until the discovery of [[Barnard's Star]] in 1916. Attention was first drawn to what is now known as [[Kapteyn's Star]] by the Dutch astronomer [[Jacobus Kapteyn]], in 1897.

==== Discovery of evidence for galactic rotation (1904) ====
In 1904, studying the [[proper motion]]s of stars, Dutch astronomer [[Jacobus Kapteyn]] reported that these were not random, as it was believed in that time; stars could be divided into two streams, moving in nearly opposite directions. It was later realized that Kapteyn's data had been the first evidence of the rotation of our [[Galaxy]], which ultimately led to the finding of [[Galaxy rotation curve|galactic rotation]] by [[Bertil Lindblad]] and [[Jan Oort]].

==== Galactic halo (1924) ====
In 1924, Dutch astronomer [[Jan Oort]] [[:Category:Discoveries by Jan Oort|discovered]] the [[galactic halo]], a group of stars orbiting the [[Milky Way]] but outside the main disk.

==== Oort constants (1927) ====
The [[Oort constants]] (discovered by [[Jan Oort]]) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are empirically derived parameters that characterize the local rotational properties of the [[Milky Way]].

==== Evidence of dark matter (1932) ====
In 1932, Dutch astronomer [[Jan Oort]] became the first person to discover evidence of [[dark matter]]. Oort proposed the substance after measuring the motions of nearby stars in the [[Milky Way]] relative to the galactic plane. He found that the mass of the galactic plane must be more than the mass of the material that can be seen. A year later (1933), [[Fritz Zwicky]] examined the dynamics of clusters of galaxies and found their movements similarly perplexing.

==== Discovery of methane in the atmosphere of Titan (1944) ====
The first formal proof of the existence of an [[Atmosphere of Titan|atmosphere]] around [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] came in 1944, when [[Gerald Kuiper]] observed Titan with the new McDonald {{convert|82|in|m|adj=on}} telescope and discovered spectral signatures on Titan at wavelengths longer than 0.6&amp;nbsp;μm (micrometers), among which he identified two absorption bands of [[methane]] at 6190 and 7250&amp;nbsp;Å (Kuiper1944). This discovery was significant not only because it requires a dense [[atmosphere]] with a significant fraction of methane, but also because the atmosphere needs to be chemically evolved, since methane requires [[hydrogen]] in the presence of [[carbon]], and molecular and atomic hydrogen would have escaped from Titan's weak gravitational field since the formation of the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert Hanbury; Lebreton, Jean-Pierre; Waite, John H. (2009). ''Titan from Cassini-Huygens'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Discovery of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mars (1947) ====
Using [[infrared]] spectrometry, in 1947 the Dutch-American astronomer [[Gerard Kuiper]] detected [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]], a discovery of biological significance because it is a principal [[gas]] in the process of [[photosynthesis]] (see also: [[History of Mars observation]]). He was able to estimate that the amount of carbon dioxide over a given area of the surface is double that on the [[Earth]].

==== Miranda (Uranus's moon) (1948) ====
[[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]] is the smallest and innermost of [[Uranus]]'s five major moons. It was discovered by [[Gerard Kuiper]] on 16 February 1948 at [[McDonald Observatory]].

==== Nereid (Neptune's moon) (1949) ====
[[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], also known as Neptune II, is the third-largest [[natural satellite|moon]] of [[Neptune]] and was its second moon to be discovered, on 1 May 1949, by Gerard Kuiper, on photographic plates taken with the 82-inch telescope at McDonald Observatory.

==== Oort cloud (1950) ====
The ''[[Oort cloud]]'' or ''Öpik–Oort cloud'', named after Dutch astronomer [[Jan Oort]] and Estonian astronomer [[Ernst Öpik]], is a spherical cloud of predominantly [[volatiles|icy]] [[planetesimal]]s believed to surround the [[Sun]] at a distance of up to {{convert|50,000|AU|ly|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=1}}. Further evidence for the existence of the [[Kuiper belt]] emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their [[volatility (physics)|volatile]] surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually evaporating them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently.&lt;ref name="matter"&gt;{{cite journal | author=David Jewitt | title=From Kuiper Belt Object to Cometary Nucleus: The Missing Ultrared Matter | journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]] | volume=123 | issue=2 | pages=1039–49 | year=2002 | doi=10.1086/338692 | bibcode=2002AJ....123.1039J}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such area of replenishment is the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer [[:Category:Discoveries by Jan Oort|Jan Oort]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1950BAN....11...91O |title=The structure of the cloud of comets surrounding the Solar System and a hypothesis concerning its origin |author1=Oort |first1=J. H. |volume=11 |year=1950 |page=91 |journal=Bull. Astron. Inst. Neth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oort cloud]] is believed to be the point of origin of [[long-period comet]]s, which are those, like [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale–Bopp]], with orbits lasting thousands of years.

==== Kuiper belt (1951) ====
The [[Kuiper belt]] was named after Dutch-American astronomer [[Gerard Kuiper]], regarded by many as the father of modern [[planetary science]], though his role in hypothesising it has been heavily contested. In 1951, he proposed the existence of what is now called the [[Kuiper Belt]], a disk-shaped region of [[minor planets]] outside the orbit of [[Neptune]], which also is a source of short-period [[comet]]s.

=== Biology ===
==== Foundations of modern reproductive biology (1660s –1670s) ====

In the 1660s and 1670s the [[Dutch Republic]]-based scientists (in particular [[Leiden University]]-based [[Jan Swammerdam]] and [[Nicolas Steno]], and [[Delft]]-based [[Regnier de Graaf]] and [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]) made key discoveries about [[animal reproduction|animal]] and [[human reproduction]]. Their research and discoveries contributed greatly to the modern understanding of the female [[mammalian]] [[reproductive system]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Matthew (2006). ''Generation: The Seventeenth-Century Scientists Who Unraveled the Secrets of Sex, Life, and Growth''. (New York: Bloomsbury)&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors see [[Regnier de Graaf]] as the founder of modern [[reproductive biology]] (Setchell, 1974).&lt;ref&gt;Setchell, B. P. (1974) "The Contributions of Regnier de Graaf to Reproductive Biology," ''European Journal of Gynecology and Reproductive Biology'', Volume 4, Issue 1, p. 1–39, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; This is due essentially to his use of convergent scientific methods: meticulous dissections, clinical observations and critical analysis of the available literature (Ankumet al., 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R. H. F. (2003). ''Physiology of the Graafian Follicle and Ovulation''. (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Function of the Fallopian tubes (1660s) ====
Dutch physician &amp; anatomist [[Regnier de Graaf]] may have been the first to understand the reproductive function of the [[Fallopian tube]]s. He described the [[hydrosalpinx]], linking its development to female [[infertility]]. de Graaf recognized pathologic conditions of the tubes. He was aware of tubal pregnancies, and he surmised that the mammalian egg traveled from the [[ovary]] to the [[uterus]] through the tube.

==== Development of ovarian follicles (1672) ====
In his ''De Mulierum Organis Generatione Inservientibus'' (1672), de Graaf provided the first thorough description of the female [[gonad]] and established that it produced the [[ovum]]. De Graaf used the terminology [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] or egg (ovum) for what now called the [[ovarian follicle]]. Because the fluid-filled ovarian vesicles had been observed previously by others, including [[Andreas Vesalius]] and [[Falloppio]], De Graaf did not claim their discovery. He noted that he was not the first to describe them, but to describe their development. De Graaf was the first to observe changes in the ovary before and after mating and describe the [[corpus luteum]]. From the observation of [[pregnancy]] in rabbits, he concluded that the follicle contained the [[oocyte]]. The mature stage of the ovarian follicle is called the [[Graafian follicle]] in his honour, although others, including [[Fallopius]], had noticed it previously but failed to recognize its reproductive significance.

==== Foundations of microbiology (discovery of microorganisms) (1670s) ====
[[Image:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Van Leeuwenhoek]] is universally acknowledged as the [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|father of microbiology]] because he was the first to undisputedly discover/observe, describe, study and conduct scientific experiments with [[microbes]] ([[microorganisms]]), using simple single-lensed microscopes of his own design.&lt;ref name="Huerta, Robert D. 2003"&gt;Huerta, Robert D.

[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] is often considered to be the [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|father]] of [[microbiology]]. [[Robert Hooke]] is cited as the first to record microscopic observation of the fruiting bodies of [[mold]]s, in 1665. However, the first observation of [[microbe]]s using a microscope is generally credited to van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1670s, he observed and researched bacteria and other [[microorganism]]s, using a single-lens microscope of his own design.&lt;ref name="Windelspecht, Michael 2002 p. 168"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fensham, Peter J.; Gunstone, Richard F.; White, Richard Thomas (1994).

In 1981 the British microscopist [[Brian J.

==== Photosynthesis (1779) ====
[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|thumb|right|The [[leaf]] is the primary site of [[photosynthesis]] in plants. In 1779, [[Jan Ingenhousz]] discovered the essential role of [[light]] in the process of [[photosynthesis]], by which [[green plant]]s in [[sunlight]] absorb [[carbon dioxide]] and release [[oxygen]].]]
[[Photosynthesis]] is a fundamental [[biochemistry|biochemical]] process in which plants, [[alga]]e, and some [[bacterium|bacteria]] convert sunlight to chemical energy. The process was discovered by [[Jan Ingenhousz]] in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;Ord, M.G.; Stocken, L.A. (1997). ''Further Milestones in Biochemistry (Foundations of Modern Biochemistry)'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankenship, Robert E. (2002).

''The Development of Modern Chemistry'', p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Jane F. (2013). ''Chemical Research on Plant Growth: A translation of Théodore de Saussure's Recherches chimiques sur la Végétation''&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical energy is used to drive reactions such as the formation of sugars or the fixation of nitrogen into [[amino acid]]s, the building blocks for [[protein synthesis]]. Ultimately, nearly all living things depend on energy produced from photosynthesis. It is also responsible for producing the [[oxygen]] that makes animal life possible. Organisms that produce energy through photosynthesis are called [[photoautotroph]]s. Plants are the most visible representatives of photoautotrophs, but bacteria and algae also employ the process.

==== Plant respiration (1779) ====
Plant respiration was also discovered by Ingenhousz in 1779.

==== Foundations of virology (1898) ====
[[Martinus Beijerinck]] is considered one of the founders of [[History of virology|virology]]. In 1898, he published results on his filtration experiments, demonstrating that [[tobacco mosaic disease]] is caused by an infectious agent smaller than a bacterium. His results were in accordance with similar observations made by [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] in 1892. Like Ivanovsky and [[Adolf Mayer]], predecessor at [[Wageningen]], Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent. He concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new [[pathogen]] ''[[virus]]'' to indicate its non-bacterial nature. This discovery is considered to be the beginning of [[virology]].

==== Chemistry of photosynthesis (1931) ====
In 1931, [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] made key discoveries explaining the [[chemistry]] of [[photosynthesis]]. By studying [[purple sulfur bacteria]] and [[green sulfur bacteria]], he was the first scientist to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a [[Light-dependent reaction|light-dependent]] [[redox]] reaction, in which [[hydrogen]] reduces [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;Stenesh, J. (1998). ''Biochemistry'', p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Pragya (2008). ''Cell and Molecular Biology'', p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Expressed as:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2A + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

where A is the [[electron acceptor]]. His discovery predicted that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is the hydrogen donor in green plant photosynthesis and is oxidized to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The chemical summation of photosynthesis was a milestone in the understanding of the chemistry of photosynthesis. This was later experimentally verified by [[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robert Hill]].

==== Foundations of modern ethology (Tinbergen's four questions) (1930s) ====
Many [[naturalists]] have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. [[Ethology]] has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of [[ethology]] is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and by Austrian biologists [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkhardt, Jr., Richard W. (2005). ''Patterns of Behavior: Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and the Founding of Ethology''. (University of Chicago Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tinbergen's four questions]], named after [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], one of the founders of modern [[ethology]], are complementary categories of explanations for behaviour. It suggests that an integrative understanding of behaviour must include both a proximate and ultimate (functional) analysis of behaviour, as well as an understanding of both phylogenetic/developmental history and the operation of current mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, M &amp; Wilson, M. (1983). Sex, evolution, and behaviour. Brooks-Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vroman effect (1975) ====
The [[Vroman effect]], named after [[Leo Vroman]], is exhibited by [[protein]] [[adsorption]] to a surface by [[blood plasma|blood serum]] proteins.

=== Chemistry ===
==== Concept of gas (1600s) ====

Flemish physician [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] is sometimes considered the founder of [[pneumatic chemistry]], coining the word ''[[gas]]'' and conducting experiments involving gases. Van Helmont had derived the word “gas” from the Dutch word ''geest'', which means ghost or spirit.

==== Foundations of stereochemistry (1874) ====
Dutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] is generally considered to be one of the founders of the field of [[stereochemistry]]. In 1874, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|Van 't Hoff]] built on the work on isomers of German chemist [[Johannes Wislicenus]], and showed that the four valencies of the [[carbon atom]] were probably directed in space toward the four corners of a regular tetrahedron, a model which explained how optical activity could be associated with an asymmetric carbon atom. He shares credit for this with the French chemist [[Joseph Le Bel]], who independently came up with the same idea. Three months before his doctoral degree was awarded Van 't Hoff published this theory, which today is regarded as the foundation of [[stereochemistry]], first in a Dutch pamphlet in the fall of 1874, and then in the following May in a small French book entitled ''La chimie dans l'espace''. A German translation appeared in 1877, at a time when the only job Van 't Hoff could find was at the Veterinary School in [[Utrecht]]. In these early years his theory was largely ignored by the scientific community, and was sharply criticized by one prominent chemist, [[Hermann Kolbe]]. However, by about 1880 support for Van 't Hoff's theory by such important chemists as [[Johannes Wislicenus]] and [[Viktor Meyer]] brought recognition.

==== Foundations of modern physical chemistry (1880s) ====
[[Jacobus van 't Hoff]] is also considered as one of the modern founders of the disciple of [[physical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler, Keith J.]]. ''Chemical Kinetics and the Origins of Physical Chemistry''. (''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', March 1985, Volume 32, Issue 1, p. 43–75)&lt;/ref&gt; The first scientific journal specifically in the field of physical chemistry was the German journal, ''Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie'', founded in 1887 by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] and Van 't Hoff. Together with [[Svante Arrhenius]], these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

==== Van 't Hoff equation (1884) ====
The [[Van 't Hoff equation]] in [[chemical thermodynamics]] relates the change in the [[equilibrium constant]], ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'', of a chemical equilibrium to the change in [[temperature]], ''T'', given the [[Enthalpy of formation|standard enthalpy change]], ''ΔH&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'', for the process. It was proposed by Dutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/hoff-bio.html Biography on Nobel prize website]. Nobelprize.org (1911-03-01). Retrieved on 2013-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Van 't Hoff equation'' has been widely utilized to explore the changes in [[state functions]] in a [[thermodynamic system]]. The ''Van 't Hoff plot'', which is derived from this equation, is especially effective in estimating the change in [[enthalpy]], or total energy, and [[entropy]], or amount of disorder, of a [[chemical reaction]].

==== Van 't Hoff factor (1884) ====
The '''van 't Hoff factor &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;''' is a measure of the effect of a solute upon [[colligative properties]] such as [[osmotic pressure]], relative lowering in [[vapor pressure]], [[Boiling-point elevation|elevation of boiling point]] and [[freezing point depression]]. The [[van 't Hoff factor]] is the ratio between the actual concentration of particles produced when the substance is dissolved, and the [[concentration]] of a substance as calculated from its mass.

==== Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation (1885) ====
In [[carbohydrate chemistry]], the [[Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation]] is the base or acid-catalyzed transformation of an [[aldose]] into the [[ketose isomer]] or vice versa, with a tautomeric [[enediol]] as reaction intermediate. The transformation is relevant for the industrial production of certain [[ketose]]s and was discovered in 1885 by [[Cornelis Adriaan Lobry van Troostenburg de Bruyn]] and [[Willem Alberda van Ekenstein]].

==== Prins reaction (1919) ====
The Prins reaction is an [[organic reaction]] consisting of an [[electrophilic addition]] of an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] to an [[alkene]] or [[alkyne]] followed by capture of a [[nucleophile]]. Dutch chemist Hendrik Jacobus Prins discovered two new [[organic reaction]]s, both now carrying the name [[Prins reaction]]. The first was the addition of [[polyhalogen]] compounds to [[olefin]]s, was found during Prins doctoral research, while the others, the acid-catalyzed addition of aldehydes to olefinic compounds, became of industrial relevance.

==== Hafnium (1923) ====
Dutch physicist [[Dirk Coster]] and Hungarian-Swedish chemist [[George de Hevesy]] co-discovered ''[[Hafnium]]'' (Hf) in 1923, by means of [[X-ray]] spectroscopic analysis of [[zirconium]] ore. ''Hafnium' is named after ''Hafnia', the Latin name for [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark), where it was discovered.

==== Crystal bar process (1925) ====
The [[crystal bar process]] (also known as ''iodide process'' or the ''van Arkel–de Boer process'') was developed by Dutch chemists [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] and [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]] in 1925. It was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure ductile metallic [[zirconium]]. It is used in the production of small quantities of ultra-pure [[titanium]] and zirconium.

==== Koopmans' theorem (1934) ====
[[Koopmans' theorem]] states that in closed-shell [[Hartree–Fock theory]], the first [[ionization energy]] of a molecular system is equal to the negative of the orbital energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO]]). This theorem is named after [[Tjalling Koopmans]], who published this result in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Koopmans became a [[Nobel laureate]] in 1975, though neither in physics nor chemistry, but in [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|economics]].

=== Genetics ===
==== Concept of pangene/gene (1889) ====

In 1889, Dutch botanist [[Hugo de Vries]] published his book ''Intracellular Pangenesis'', in which he postulated that different characters have different hereditary carriers, based on a modified version of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[Pangenesis]] of 1868. He specifically postulated that inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in ''particles''. He called these units ''pangenes'', a term shortened in 1909 to [[gene]]s by Danish botanist [[Wilhelm Johannsen]].

==== Rediscovery the laws of inheritance (1900) ====
1900 marked the "rediscovery of [[Mendelian genetics]]". The significance of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work was not understood until early in the twentieth century, after his death, when his research was re-discovered by [[Hugo de Vries]], [[Carl Correns]] and [[Erich von Tschermak]], who were working on similar problems.&lt;ref&gt;Kuiper, Kathleen (2010). ''The Britannica Guide to Theories and Ideas That Changed the Modern World'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; They were unaware of Mendel's work. They worked independently on different plant hybrids, and came to Mendel's conclusions about the rules of [[inheritance]].

=== Geology ===
==== Bushveld Igneous Complex (1897) ====

The [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]] (or BIC) is a large, layered igneous intrusion within the Earth's crust that has been tilted and eroded and now outcrops around what appears to be the edge of a great geological basin, the [[Transvaal Basin]]. Located in South Africa, the BIC contains some of Earth's richest [[ore deposit]]s. The complex contains the world's largest reserves of [[platinum group metals]] (PGMs), [[platinum]], [[palladium]], [[osmium]], [[iridium]], [[rhodium]], and [[ruthenium]], along with vast quantities of iron, [[tin]], [[chromium]], [[titanium]] and [[vanadium]]. The site was discovered around 1897 by Dutch geologist [[Gustaaf Molengraaff]].

=== Mathematics ===
==== Analytic geometry (1637) ====

Descartes (1596–1650) was born in France, but spent most of his adult life in the Dutch Republic. As [[Bertrand Russell]] noted in his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945): "He lived in [[Holland]] for twenty years (1629–49), except for a few brief visits to France and one to England, all on business....". In 1637, Descartes published his work on the methods of science, ''[[Discourse on the Method|Discours de la méthode]]'' in Leiden. One of its three appendices was ''[[La Géométrie]]'', in which he outlined a method to connect the expressions of [[algebra]] with the [[diagram]]s of [[geometry]]. It combined both algebra and geometry under one specialty  –  [[algebraic geometry]], now called [[analytic geometry]], which involves reducing geometry to a form of [[arithmetic]] and algebra and translating geometric shapes into [[algebraic equation]]s.

==== Cartesian coordinate system (1637) ====
Descartes' ''La Géométrie'' contains Descartes' first introduction of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==== Differential geometry of curves (concepts of the involute and evolute of a curve) (1673) ====
[[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to publish in 1673 (''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'') a specific method of determining the [[evolute]] and [[involute]] of a [[curve]]&lt;ref&gt;Ungs, Michael (2010). ''The Theory of Quantum Torus Knots: Its Foundation in Differential Geometry'', Volume II, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Korteweg–de Vries equation (1895) ====
In [[mathematics]], the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]] ('''KdV equation''' for short) is a [[mathematical model]] of waves on shallow water surfaces. It is particularly notable as the prototypical example of an [[exactly solvable model]], that is, a non-linear [[partial differential equation]] whose solutions can be exactly and precisely specified. The equation is named for [[Diederik Korteweg]] and [[Gustav de Vries]] who, in 1895, proposed a mathematical model which allowed to predict the waves behaviour on shallow water surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;De Gloria, Alessandro (2014). ''Applications in Electronics Pervading Industry, Environment and Society'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proof of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem (1911) ====
[[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] is a [[fixed-point theorem]] in [[topology]], named after Dutchman [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Luitzen Brouwer]], who proved it in 1911.

==== Proof of the hairy ball theorem (1912) ====
The [[hairy ball theorem]] of [[algebraic topology]] states that there is no nonvanishing [[continuous function|continuous]] tangent [[vector field]] on even-dimensional [[n‑sphere|''n''-spheres]]. The theorem was first stated by [[Henri Poincaré]] in the late 19th century. It was first proved in 1912 by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub/digbib/loader?ht=VIEW&amp;did=D28661 Georg-August-Universität Göttingen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526145611/http://dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub/digbib/loader?ht=VIEW&amp;did=D28661 |date=26 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Debye functions (1912) ====
The [[Debye functions]] are named in honor of [[Peter Debye]], who came across this function (with ''n'' = 3) in 1912 when he analytically computed the [[heat capacity]] of what is now called the [[Debye model]].

==== Kramers–Kronig relations (1927) ====
The [[Kramers–Kronig relations]] are bidirectional [[mathematics|mathematical]] relations, connecting the [[real number|real]] and [[imaginary number|imaginary]] parts of any [[complex analysis|complex function]] that is [[analytic function|analytic]] in the [[upper half-plane]]. The relation is named in honor of [[Ralph Kronig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/JOSA.12.000547|author=R. de L. Kronig| title=On the theory of the dispersion of X-rays|journal= J. Opt. Soc.

==== Heyting algebra (formalized intuitionistic logic) (1930) ====
Formalized [[intuitionistic logic]] was originally developed by [[Arend Heyting]] to provide a formal basis for [[Luitzen Brouwer]]'s programme of [[intuitionism]]. Arend Heyting introduced [[Heyting algebra]] (1930) to formalize [[intuitionistic logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesseling, Dennis E. (2003). ''Gnomes in the Fog: The Reception of Brouwer's Intuitionism in the 1920s''. (Birkhäuser Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Atten, Mark; Boldini, Pascal; Bourdeau, Michel; Heinzmann, Gerhard (2008). ''One Hundred Years of Intuitionism (1907–2007)''. (Birkhäuser Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Zernike polynomials (1934) ====
In mathematics, the [[Zernike polynomials]] are a [[polynomial sequence|sequence]] of [[polynomial]]s that are [[orthogonal polynomials|orthogonal]] on the [[unit disk]]. Named after [[Frits Zernike]], the Dutch optical physicist, and the inventor of [[phase contrast microscopy]], they play an important role in beam [[optics]].

==== Minnaert function (1941) ====
In 1941, [[Marcel Minnaert]] invented the [[Minnaert function]], which is used in optical measurements of celestial bodies. The [[Marcel Minnaert|Minnaert]] function is a [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] function used to interpret [[astronomical]] observations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00075-7 | bibcode=2003Icar..163..150C | volume=163 | title=Probing Titan’s lower atmosphere with acousto-optic tuning | journal=Icarus | pages=150–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2006.05.006 | bibcode=2006Icar..184..401S | volume=184 | title=Martian phase function: Modeling the visible to near-infrared surface photometric function using HST-WFPC2 data | journal=Icarus | pages=401–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[remote sensing]] data for the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/01431160500104194 | volume=26 | title=The use of the Minnaert correction for land‐cover classification in mountainous terrain | journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing | pages=3831–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanics ===
==== Proof of the law of equilibrium on an inclined plane (1586) ====

In 1586, [[Simon Stevin]] (Stevinus) derived the mechanical advantage of the [[inclined plane]] by an argument that used a string of beads.&lt;ref name="Koetsier"&gt;{{cite conference

==== Centripetal force (1659) ====
[[Image:Centripetal force diagram.svg|thumb|A body experiencing [[uniform circular motion]] requires a [[centripetal force]], towards the axis as shown, to maintain its circular path. In 1659, [[Christiaan Huygens]] coined the term "[[centrifugal force]]" and was the first to derive the now standard mathematical description for the [[centripetal force]].]]
[[Christiaan Huygens]] stated what is now known as the second of Newton's laws of motion in a quadratic form.&lt;ref name="mach"&gt;[[Ernst Mach]], ''The Science of Mechanics'' (1919), e.g. p. 143, p. 172 and p. 187 &lt;https://archive.org/details/scienceofmechani005860mbp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1659 he derived the now standard formula for the [[centripetal force]], exerted by an object describing a [[circular motion]], for instance on the string to which it is attached.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, Richard S. (1971). ''The Construction of Modern Science: Mechanisms and Mechanics'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gindikin, Semyon Grigorevich (1988).

:&lt;math&gt;F_{c}=\frac{m\ v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''m'' the [[mass (physics)|mass]] of the object, ''v'' the [[velocity]] and ''r'' the [[radius]]. The publication of the general formula for this force in 1673 was a significant step in studying orbits in astronomy. It enabled the transition from [[Kepler's third law]] of planetary motion, to the [[inverse square law]] of gravitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B.

==== Centrifugal force (1659) ====
Huygens coined the term ''[[centrifugal force]]'' in his 1659 ''De Vi Centrifiga'' and wrote of it in his 1673 ''Horologium Oscillatorium'' on [[pendulum]]s.

==== Formula for the period of mathematical pendulum (1659) ====
In 1659, [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to derive the formula for the [[Frequency|period]] of an ideal mathematical [[pendulum]] (with massless rod or cord and length much longer than its swing),&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Julian B. (1989). ''Absolute or Relative Motion?: Volume 1, The Discovery of Dynamics: A Study from a Machian Point of View of the Discovery and the Structure of Dynamical Theories'', p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Michael; Gauld, Colin F.; Stinner, Arthur (2006).

''A Cultural History of Physics'', p. 240–55&lt;/ref&gt; in modern notation:

:&lt;math&gt;T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''T'' the period, ''l'' the length of the [[pendulum]] and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]]. By his study of the oscillation period of compound pendulums Huygens made pivotal contributions to the development of the concept of [[moment of inertia]].

==== Tautochrone curve (isochrone curve) (1659) ====
A [[tautochrone]] or [[isochrone curve]] is the curve for which the time taken by an object sliding without friction in uniform gravity to its lowest point is independent of its starting point. The curve is a [[cycloid]], and the time is equal to π times the square root of the radius over the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]]. [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to discover the [[tautochrone|tautochronous property]] (or [[isochrone curve|isochronous property]]) of the cycloid.&lt;ref&gt;Knoebel, Arthur; Laubenbacher, Reinhard; Lodder, Jerry; Pengelley, David (2007). ''Mathematical Masterpieces: Further Chronicles by the Explorers''. (Springer), p. 169. "The cycloid had already occupied the minds of great mathematicians and scientists such as Galileo, Torricelli, Mersenne, Roberval, Fermat, Descartes, Pascal, and others [18], yet none of them discovered its isochronous property."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tautochrone]] problem, the attempt to identify this curve, was solved by Christiaan Huygens in 1659. He proved geometrically in his ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'', originally published in 1673, that the curve was a [[cycloid]]. Huygens also proved that the time of descent is equal to the time a body takes to fall vertically the same distance as the diameter of the circle which generates the cycloid, multiplied by π⁄2. The [[tautochrone curve]] is the same as the [[brachistochrone curve]] for any given starting point. [[Johann Bernoulli]] posed the problem of the [[brachistochrone]] to the readers of ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'' in June, 1696. He published his solution in the journal in May of the following year, and noted that the solution is the same curve as Huygens's [[tautochrone curve]].&lt;ref&gt;Struik, Dirk Jan (1986). ''A Source Book in Mathematics, 1200–1800''. (Princeton University Press), p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farouki, Rida T. (2007). ''Pythagorean-Hodograph Curves: Algebra and Geometry Inseparable''. (Springer), p. 161. As Bernoulli noted: "We have a just admiration for Huygens, because he was the first to discover that a heavy point on an ordinary cycloid falls in the same time, whatever the position from which the motion begins."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coupled oscillation (spontaneous synchronization) (1665) ====
[[Christiaan Huygens]] observed that two pendulum clocks mounted next to each other on the same support often become synchronized, swinging in opposite directions. In 1665, he reported the results by letter to the [[Royal Society of London]]. It is referred to as "an odd kind of sympathy" in the Society's minutes. This may be the first published observation of what is now called ''coupled oscillations''. In the 20th century, ''coupled oscillators'' took on great practical importance because of two discoveries: [[laser]]s, in which different atoms give off light waves that oscillate in unison, and [[superconductor]]s, in which pairs of electrons oscillate in synchrony, allowing electricity to flow with almost no resistance. ''Coupled oscillators'' are even more ubiquitous in nature, showing up, for example, in the synchronized flashing of fireflies and chirping of crickets, and in the pacemaker cells that regulate [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeats]].

=== Medicine ===
==== Foundations of modern (human) anatomy (1543) ====

[[Image:Vesalius 164frc.png|right|thumb|200px|One of the large, detailed illustrations in [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', 1543]]

Flemish anatomist and physician [[Andreas Vesalius]] is often referred to as the founder of modern [[human anatomy]] for the publication of the seven-volume ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Structure of the Human Body'') in 1543.

==== Crystals in gouty tophi (1679) ====
In 1679, van Leeuwenhoek used a microscopes to assess tophaceous material and found that [[Tophus|gouty tophi]] consist of aggregates of needle-shaped crystals, and not globules of chalk as was previously believed.

==== Boerhaave syndrome (1724) ====
[[Boerhaave syndrome]] (also known as ''spontaneous esophageal perforation'' or ''esophageal rupture'') refers to an [[esophagus|esophageal]] rupture secondary to forceful [[vomiting]]. Originally described in 1724 by Dutch physician/botanist [[Herman Boerhaave]], it is a rare condition with high mortality. The syndrome was described after the case of a Dutch admiral, Baron Jan von Wassenaer, who died of the condition.

==== Factor V Leiden (1994) ====
[[Factor V Leiden]] is an inherited disorder of blood clotting. It is a variant of human [[factor V]] that causes a hypercoagulability disorder. It is named after the city Leiden, where it was first identified by R. Bertina, et al., in 1994.

=== Microbiology ===
==== Blood cells (1658) ====

In 1658 Dutch naturalist [[Jan Swammerdam]] was the first person to observe [[red blood cells]] under a microscope and in 1695, [[microscopist]] [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]], also Dutch, was the first to draw an illustration of "red corpuscles", as they were called. No further [[blood cells]] were discovered until 1842 when the [[platelets]] were discovered.

==== Red blood cells (1658) ====
The first person to observe and describe [[red blood cell]]s was Dutch biologist [[Jan Swammerdam]], who had used an early microscope to study the [[blood]] of a frog.

==== Micro-organisms (1670s) ====
[[File:Leeuwenhoek Microscope.png|thumb|left|upright|Replica of microscope by [[Leeuwenhoek]]. Van Leeuwenhoek is considered to be the first to observe and describe [[microorganisms]] (''[[animalcules]]'') using a [[microscope]].]]

A resident of Delft, [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], used a high-power single-lens simple microscope to discover the world of [[microorganism|micro-organisms]]. His simple microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding hand-ground lenses were capable of magnification up to 275 times. Using these he was the first to observe and describe single-celled organisms, which he originally referred to as ''animalcules'', and which now referred to as [[microorganism|micro-organisms]] or [[microbe]]s.&lt;ref name="Ruestow, Edward G. 1996"&gt;Ruestow, Edward G. (1996). ''The Microscope in the Dutch Republic: The Shaping of Discovery''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huerta, Robert D. 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess, Jeremy 1990 p. 186"/&gt;
* [[Infusoria]] (1674) – Infusoria is a collective term for minute aquatic creatures including [[ciliate]], [[euglena]], [[paramecium]], [[protozoa]] and unicellular [[algae]] that exist in freshwater ponds. However, in formal classification [[microorganism]] called infusoria belongs to [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] [[Animal]]ia, [[Phylum]] [[Protozoa]], [[Class (biology)|Class]] [[Ciliates]] (Infusoria). They were first discovered by [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]].

[[File:Leishmania donovani 01.png|thumb|right|200px|''[[Leishmania]] donovani'', (a species of protozoa) in a [[bone marrow]] cell]]
* [[Protozoa]] (1674) – In 1674, [[Van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first person to observe and describe [[protozoa]].
* [[Bacteria]] (1676) – The first [[bacteria]] were observed by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 using his single-lens microscope.&lt;ref name="Maczulak, Anne 2010 p. 12"&gt;Maczulak, Anne (2010).

''The Eye in History'', p. 338–41&lt;/ref&gt; He described the creatures he saw as small creatures. The name ''bacterium'' was introduced much later, by [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] in 1828, derived from the [[Greek word]] βακτηριον meaning "small stick". Because of the difficulty in describing individual bacteria and the importance of their discovery, the study of bacteria is generally that of the study of [[microbiology]].
* [[Sperm cells]] (1677) – Sperm cells were first observed by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1677. The term "[[sperm]]" refers to the male [[reproductive]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. A uniflagellar [[sperm]] cell that is [[Motility|motile]] is referred to as a "[[spermatozoon]]", whereas a non-motile [[sperm cell]] is referred to as a "spermatium".
* [[Spermatozoa]] (1677) – A [[spermatozoon]] or spermatozoon (''pl.'' spermatozoa), from the [[ancient Greek]] ''σπερμα'' (seed) and ''ζων'' (alive) and more commonly known as a sperm cell, is the [[ploidy|haploid]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] that is the male [[gamete]]. Sperm cells were first observed by a student of van Leeuwenhoek in 1677. Leeuwenhoek pictured sperm cells with great accuracy.

Their life cycle alternates between an actively swimming [[trophozoite]] and an infective, resistant [[Microbial cyst|cyst]]. The [[trophozoite]] form of [[Giardia]] was first observed in 1681 by [[Van Leeuwenhoek]] during observation of his own stool.&lt;ref name="ErlandsenMeyer1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanley L.

[[Volvox]] (1700)- [[Volvox]] is a [[genus]] of [[chlorophyte]]s, a type of [[green algae]]. It forms spherical [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] of up to 50,000 cells. They live in a variety of [[freshwater]] habitats, and were first reported by Van Leeuwenhoek in 1700.

==== Biological nitrogen fixation (1885) ====
Biological [[nitrogen fixation]] was discovered by [[Martinus Beijerinck]] in 1885.

==== Rhizobium (1888) ====
''[[Rhizobium]]'' is a [[genus]] of [[Gram-negative]] [[soil]] [[bacteria]] that [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]]. Rhizobium forms an [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing]] association with roots of [[legumes]] and ''Parasponia''. [[Martinus Beijerinck]] in the [[Netherlands]] was the first to isolate and cultivate a [[microorganism]] from the nodules of legumes in 1888. He named it ''Bacillus radicicola'', which is now placed in ''[[Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology]]'' under the genus Rhizobium.

==== Spirillum (first isolated sulfate-reducing bacteria) (1895) ====
[[Martinus Beijerinck]] discovered the phenomenon of bacterial [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate reduction]], a form of [[anaerobic respiration]]. He learned that bacteria could use [[sulfate]] as a terminal [[electron acceptor]], instead of oxygen. He isolated and described ''[[Spirillum|Spirillum desulfuricans]]'' (now called ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bacterio.net/desulfovibrio.html |title=Genus ''Desulfovibrio'' |last1=Jean |first1=Euzeby |website= |publisher=[[List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]] |accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the first known [[sulfate-reducing bacterium]].

==== Concept of virus (1898) ====
[[File:Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms tobacco.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) symptoms on [[tobacco]]. TMV was the first virus to ever be discovered and crystallized. In 1898, [[Martinus Beijerinck]] coined the term of "[[virus]]" to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-[[bacterial]] nature. This discovery is considered to be the beginning of [[History of virology|virology]].]]
In 1898 Beijerinck coined the term "virus" to indicate that the causal agent of [[tobacco mosaic disease]] was non-bacterial. Beijerinck discovered what is now known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing and he called it a [[contagium vivum fluidum]] (''contagious living fluid'').

==== Azotobacter (1901) ====
''[[Azotobacter]]'' is a [[genus]] of usually [[Motility|motile]], oval or spherical [[bacteria]] that form thick-walled [[cyst]]s and may produce large quantities of capsular [[Mucus|slime]]. They are aerobic, free-living soil [[Microorganism|microbes]] which play an important role in the [[nitrogen cycle]] in nature, binding atmospheric [[nitrogen]], which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of [[ammonium]] ions into the soil. Apart from being a [[model organism]], it is used by humans for the production of [[biofertilizer]]s, [[food additive]]s, and some [[biopolymer]]s. The first representative of the genus, ''Azotobacter chroococcum'', was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch [[microbiologist]] and botanist [[Martinus Beijerinck]].

==== Enrichment culture (1904) ====
Beijerinck is credited with developing the first [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying microbes from the environment.

==== 31 equal temperament (1661) ====

Division of the [[octave]] into 31 steps arose naturally out of Renaissance [[music theory]]; the lesser [[diesis]]  –  the ratio of an octave to three major thirds, 128:125 or 41.06 cents  –  was approximately a [[interval (music)|fifth]] of a tone and a third of a [[semitone]]. In 1666, [[Lemme Rossi]] first proposed an equal temperament of this order. Shortly thereafter, having discovered it independently, scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] wrote about it also. Since the standard system of [[musical tuning|tuning]] at that time was [[quarter-comma meantone]], in which the fifth is tuned to 5&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt;, the appeal of this method was immediate, as the fifth of 31-et, at 696.77 cents, is only 0.19 cent wider than the fifth of quarter-comma meantone. Huygens not only realized this, he went farther and noted that 31-ET provides an excellent approximation of septimal, or [[limit (music)|7-limit]] harmony. In the twentieth century, physicist, music theorist and composer [[Adriaan Fokker]], after reading Huygens's work, led a revival of interest in this system of tuning which led to a number of compositions, particularly by Dutch composers. Fokker designed the [[Fokker organ]], a 31-tone equal-tempered organ, which was installed in [[Teylers Museum|Teyler's Museum]] in [[Haarlem]] in 1951.

==== Foundations of classical mechanics (1673) ====
Through his fundamental contributions [[Christiaan Huygens]] helped shape and lay the foundations of [[classical mechanics]]. His works cover all the fields of [[mechanics]], from the invention of technical devices applicable to different machines to a purely rational knowledge of motion.&lt;ref&gt;Chareix, Fabien (2004). ''Huygens and Mechanics'' (ESA Science &amp; Technology, University of Paris IV).&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens published his results in a classic of the 17th-century mechanics, ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'' (1673), that is regarded as one of the three most important work done in mechanics in the 17th century, the other two being [[Galileo Galilei]]’s ''Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences'' (1638) and [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica'' (1687). It is Huygens' major work on [[pendulum]]s and [[horology]]. As Domenico Bertoloni Meli (2006) notes, ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'' was “a masterful combination of sophisticated mathematics and mechanics mixed with a range of practical applications culminating with a new clock aimed at resolving the vexing problem of longitude.”&lt;ref&gt;Meli, Domenico Bertoloni (2006). ''Thinking with Objects: The Transformation of Mechanics in the Seventeenth Century''. (Johns Hopkins University Press), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Foundations of physical optics / wave optics (wave theory of light) (1678) ====
Huygens' groundbreaking research on the nature of [[light]] helped lay the foundations of modern [[optics]] ([[physical optics]] in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Laermann, Karl-Hans (2000). ''Optical Methods in Experimental Solid Mechanics''. (Springer), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Randy O. (2014). ''Light and Video Microscopy''. (Academic Press, Elsevier), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens is remembered especially for his [[wave theory of light]], which he first communicated in 1678 to France's Royal [[Académie des sciences]] and which he published in 1690 in his ''[[Treatise on light]]''. His argument that light consists of [[wave]]s now known as the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]], two centuries later became instrumental in the understanding of [[wave–particle duality]]. The [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] experiments of [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] vindicated Huygens' s wave theory in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Buchwald, Jed Z. (1989). ''The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light: Optical Theory and Experiment in the Early Nineteenth Century'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dijksterhuis, Fokko Jan (2006). ''Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the Seventeenth Century'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Polarization of light (1678) ====
In 1678, [[Huygens]] discovered the [[polarization of light]] by [[double refraction]] in [[calcite]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Gerard L'Estrange (1983). ''Nineteenth-century Scientific Instruments'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Driggers, Ronald G. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Optical Engineering, Volume 1'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulson, Kinsell (2012). ''Solar and Terrestrial Radiation: Methods and Measurements'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Huygens' principle (concepts of the wavefront and wavelet) (1690) ====
[[File:Huygens Fresnel Principle2.gif|thumb|right|180px|Huygens is now remembered mostly as the founder and the foremost champion of [[wave theory of light]]. His argument that [[light]] consists of [[wave]]s, expounded in his ''Traité de la Lumiére'' (''[[Treatise on light]]''), now known as the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]], which two centuries later became instrumental in the understanding of [[wave–particle duality]].]]
In his ''[[Treatise on light]]'', Huygens showed how [[Snell's law]] of sines could be explained by, or derived from, the [[wave]] nature of [[light]], using the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]].

==== Bernoulli's principle (1738) ====
[[Bernoulli's principle]] was discovered by Dutch-Swiss mathematician and physicist [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and named after him. It states that for an [[inviscid flow]], an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.

==== Brownian motion (1785) ====
In 1785, Ingenhousz described the irregular movement of [[coal dust]] on the surface of alcohol and therefore has a claim as discoverer of what came to be known as [[Brownian motion]].

==== Buys Ballot's law (1857) ====
The law takes its name from Dutch meteorologist [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot]], who published it in the ''Comptes Rendus'', in November 1857. While [[William Ferrel]] first theorized this in 1856, Buys Ballot was the first to provide an [[empirical validation]]. The law states that in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], if a person stands with his back to the wind, the low pressure area will be on his left, because wind travels counterclockwise around low pressure zones in that [[Hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]]. this is approximately true in the higher latitudes and is reversed in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

==== Foundations of molecular physics (1873) ====
Spearheaded by [[Ernst Mach|Mach]] and [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]], a strong philosophical current that denied the existence of [[molecules]] arose towards the end of the 19th century. The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time Van der Waals' thesis was written (1873), the [[molecular structure]] of [[fluids]] had not been accepted by most physicists, and [[liquid]] and [[vapor]] were often considered as chemically distinct. But [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals|Van der Waals]]'s work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and [[Van der Waals forces|attractive strength]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannes van der Waals: "...It will be perfectly clear that in all my studies I was quite convinced of the real existence of [[molecules]], that I never regarded them as a figment of my imagination, nor even as mere [[centres of force]] effects. I considered them to be the actual bodies, thus what we term "body" in daily speech ought better to be called "pseudo body". It is an aggregate of bodies and empty space. We do not know the nature of a molecule consisting of a single chemical atom. It would be premature to seek to answer this question but to admit this ignorance in no way impairs the belief in its real existence. When I began my studies I had the feeling that I was almost alone in holding that view. And when, as occurred already in my 1873 treatise, I determined their number in one gram-mol, their size and the nature of their action, I was strengthened in my opinion, yet still there often arose within me the question whether in the final analysis a molecule is a figment of the imagination and the entire molecular theory too. And now I do not think it any exaggeration to state that the real existence of molecules is universally assumed by physicists. Many of those who opposed it most have ultimately been won over, and my theory may have been a contributory factor. And precisely this, I feel, is a step forward. Anyone acquainted with the writings of Boltzmann and Willard Gibbs will admit that physicists carrying great authority believe that the complex phenomena of the heat theory can only be interpreted in this way. It is a great pleasure for me that an increasing number of younger physicists find the inspiration for their work in studies and contemplations of the molecular theory..." (''The equation of state for gases and liquids'', Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1910)&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing [[Van der Waals equation of state|his equation of state]] with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of [[Van der Waals forces|their mutual attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of Van der Waals's work on [[molecular science]] in the 20th century was direct and fundamental, as is well recognized and documented, due in large part to books by [[John Rowlinson]] (1988), and by Kipnis and Yavelov (1996). By [[Van der Waals constants (data page)|introducing parameters]] characterizing molecular size and attraction in constructing his [[equation of state]], Van der Waals set the tone for [[molecular physics]] ([[molecular dynamics]] in particular) of the 20th century. That molecular aspects such as size, shape, attraction, and [[intermolecular force|multipolar interactions]] should form the basis for mathematical formulations of the thermodynamic and transport properties of [[fluids]] is presently considered an axiom.&lt;ref&gt;Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), p. 255–56&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Van der Waals equation of state (1873) ====
In 1873, [[J. D. van der Waals]] introduced the [[Van der Waals equation of state|first equation of state]] derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent [[molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Waals, J. D. (1873). ''On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States'' (Doctoral dissertation, Universiteit Leiden).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Van der Waals equation]] is generally regarded as the first somewhat realistic [[equation of state]] (beyond the ideal gas law). Van der Waals noted the [[ideal gas|non-ideality]] of [[gases]] and attributed it to the existence of [[intermolecular interaction|molecular]] or atomic interactions. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the [[Redlich-Kwong equation of state]] (1949) and the Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong. While the Van der Waals equation is definitely superior to the [[ideal gas law]] and does predict the formation of a [[liquid phase]], the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. Except at higher pressures, the [[real gas]]es do not obey [[Van der Waals equation]] in all ranges of pressures and temperatures. Despite its limitations, the equation has historical importance, because it was the first attempt to model the behaviour of [[real gas]]es.

==== Van der Waals forces (1873) ====
[[File:Gecko Leaftail 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Van der Waals force]] between [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s and surfaces is a part of everyday life in many different ways. [[Gecko]]s can stick to walls and ceilings because of [[Van der Waals force]]s.]]

The [[van der Waals force]]s are named after the scientist who first described them in 1873. [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]] noted the non-ideality of gases and attributed it to the existence of molecular or atomic interactions. They are forces that develop between the atoms inside molecules and keep them together.&lt;ref&gt;Parsegian, V. Adrian (2005). ''Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physicists'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Van der Waals forces between molecules, much weaker than [[chemical bonds]] but present universally, play a fundamental role in fields as diverse as [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[structural biology]], [[polymer science]], [[nanotechnology]], [[surface science]], and [[condensed matter physics]]. Elucidation of the nature of the Van der Waals forces between molecules has remained a scientific effort from Van der Waals's days to the present.

==== Van der Waals radius (1873) ====
The [[Van der Waals radius]], ''r''{{sub|w}}, of an [[atom]] is the radius of an imaginary hard [[sphere]] which can be used to model the atom for many purposes. It is named after [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]], winner of the 1910 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], as he was the first to recognise that atoms were not simply [[Point (geometry)|points]] and to demonstrate the physical consequences of their size through the [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals equation of state]].

==== Law of corresponding states (1880) ====
The [[Theorem of corresponding states|law of corresponding states]] was first suggested and formulated by van der Waals in 1880. This showed that the van der Waals equation of state can be expressed as a simple function of the critical pressure, critical volume and critical temperature. This general form is applicable to all substances. The compound-specific constants a and b in the original equation are replaced by universal (compound-independent) quantities. It was this law that served as a guide during experiments which ultimately led to the [[liquefaction]] of [[hydrogen]] by [[James Dewar]] in 1898 and of [[helium]] by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] in 1908.

==== Lorentz ether theory (1892) ====
[[Lorentz ether theory]] has its roots in [[Hendrik Lorentz]]'s "theory of electrons", which was the final point in the development of the classical [[aether (classical element)|aether]] theories at the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century. Lorentz's initial theory created in 1892 and 1895 was based on a completely motionless aether. Many aspects of Lorentz's theory were incorporated into [[special relativity]] with the works of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]].

==== Lorentz force law (1892) ====
[[File:Lorentz force particle.svg|180px|thumb|[[Lorentz force]] '''F''' on a [[charged particle]] (of [[electric charge|charge]] ''q'') in motion (instantaneous velocity '''v'''). The [[electric field|'''E''' field]] and [[magnetic field|'''B''' field]] vary in space and time.]]
In 1892, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] derived the modern form of the formula for the electromagnetic force which includes the contributions to the total force from both the electric and the magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;Wadhwani, Navina (2007). ''Electricity And Magnetism'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andriesse, Cornelis Dirk (2008). ''Dutch Messengers: A History of Science Publishing, 1930–1980'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, Terunobu; Jin, Hanmin (2012). ''The Physics of Ferromagnetism'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the [[Lorentz force law]] is used as the ''definition'' of the electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''B'''.&lt;ref name=Jackson20&gt;See, for example, Jackson p. 777–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|pages=72–73|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}. These authors use the Lorentz force in tensor form as definer of the [[electromagnetic tensor]] ''F'', in turn the fields '''E''' and '''B'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism|edition=2nd|author1=I.S. Grant |author2=W.R. Phillips |author3=Manchester Physics |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|page=122|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be specific, the Lorentz force is understood to be the following empirical statement:

:''The electromagnetic force '''F''' on a [[test charge]] at a given point and time is a certain function of its charge ''q'' and velocity '''v''', which can be parameterized by exactly two vectors '''E''' and '''B''', in the functional form'':

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=q(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

==== Abraham–Lorentz force (1895) ====
In the physics of [[electromagnetism]], the [[Abraham–Lorentz force]] (also ''Lorentz-Abraham force'') is the [[recoil]] [[force]] on an [[acceleration|accelerating]] [[charged particle]] caused by the particle emitting [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is also called the ''radiation reaction force'' or the ''self force''.

==== Lorentz transformation (1895) ====
In physics, the [[Lorentz transformation]] (or [[Lorentz transformations]]) is named after the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. It was the result of attempts by Lorentz and others to explain how the speed of [[light]] was observed to be independent of the [[frame of reference|reference frame]], and to understand the symmetries of the laws of [[electromagnetism]]. The Lorentz transformation is in accordance with [[special relativity]], but was derived before special relativity. Early approximations of the transformation were published by Lorentz in 1895. In 1905, [[Poincaré]] was the first to recognize that the transformation has the properties of a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]], and named it after Lorentz.

==== Lorentz contraction (1895) ====
In physics, [[length contraction]] (more formally called [[Lorentz contraction]] or [[Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction]] after [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[George FitzGerald]]) is the phenomenon of a decrease in length measured by the observer, of an object which is traveling at any non-zero velocity relative to the observer. This contraction is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the [[speed of light]].

==== Lorentz factor (1895) ====
The [[Lorentz factor]] or ''Lorentz term'' is the factor by which time, length, and [[relativistic mass]] change for an object while that object is moving. It is an expression which appears in several equations in [[special relativity]], and it arises from deriving the [[Lorentz transformation]]s. The name originates from its earlier appearance in [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentzian electrodynamics]] – named after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/html/oneuniverse/motion_knowledge_concept_12.html One universe], by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], Charles Tsun-Chu Liu, and Robert Irion.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Zeeman effect (1896) ====
[[File:EinsteinZeemanEhrenfest.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Discoverer of the [[Zeeman effect]], [[Pieter Zeeman]] with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Paul Ehrenfest]] in his laboratory in Amsterdam (circa 1920).]]
The [[Zeeman effect]], named after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicist [[Pieter Zeeman]], is the effect of splitting a [[spectral line]] into several components in the presence of a static [[magnetic field]]. It is analogous to the [[Stark effect]], the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an [[electric field]]. Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the [[dipole]] approximation), as governed by the [[selection rule]]s.

Since the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of the magnetic field, this effect can be used to measure the magnetic field, e.g. that of the [[Sun]] and other [[star]]s or in laboratory [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].
The Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy, [[electron spin resonance]] spectroscopy, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]]. It may also be utilized to improve accuracy in [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]].

A theory about the [[magnetic sense]] of birds assumes that a protein in the retina is changed due to the Zeeman effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/583.full The magnetic compass mechanisms of birds and rodents are based on different physical principles]. Journal of the Royal Society&lt;/ref&gt;

When the spectral lines are absorption lines, the effect is called ''inverse Zeeman effect''.

==== Liquid helium (liquefaction of helium) (1908) ====
[[File:2 Helium.png|thumb|Liquid helium in a cup.]]
[[Helium]] was first liquefied ([[liquid helium]]) on 10 July 1908, by Dutch physicist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]]. With the production of [[liquid helium]], it was said that “the coldest place on Earth” was in [[Leiden]].&lt;ref&gt;Matricon, Jean; Waysand, Georges (1994).

==== Einstein–de Haas effect (1910s) ====
The [[Einstein–de Haas effect]] or the ''Richardson effect'' (after [[Owen Willans Richardson]]), is a physical phenomenon delineated by [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] in the mid 1910s, that exposes a relationship between [[magnetism]], [[angular momentum]], and the [[Electron magnetic moment|spin]] of elementary particles.

==== Debye model (1912) ====
In [[thermodynamics]] and [[solid state physics]], the [[Debye model]] is a method developed by [[Peter Debye]] in 1912 for estimating the [[phonon]] contribution to the [[specific heat]] (heat capacity) in a [[solid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Debye |title=Zur Theorie der spezifischen Waerme |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |location=Leipzig |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=789–839 |year=1912 |doi= 10.1002/andp.19123441404 |bibcode=1912AnP...344..789D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It treats the [[oscillation|vibrations]] of the [[Crystal structure#Classification|atomic lattice]] (heat) as [[phonon]]s in a box, in contrast to the [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]], which treats the solid as many individual, non-interacting [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s. The Debye model correctly predicts the low temperature dependence of the heat capacity.

==== De Sitter precession (1916) ====
The [[geodetic effect]] (also known as geodetic precession, [[de Sitter precession]] or [[De Sitter precession|de Sitter effect]]) represents the effect of the curvature of [[spacetime]], predicted by [[general relativity]], on a vector carried along with an orbiting body. The geodetic effect was first predicted by [[Willem de Sitter]] in 1916, who provided relativistic corrections to the Earth–Moon system's motion.

==== De Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space (1920s) ====
In mathematics and physics, a [[de Sitter space]] is the analog in [[Minkowski space]], or spacetime, of a sphere in ordinary, [[Euclidean space]]. The ''n''-dimensional de Sitter space, denoted dS&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, is the [[Lorentzian manifold]] analog of an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] (with its canonical [[Riemannian metric]]); it is maximally [[symmetric]], has constant positive [[scalar curvature|curvature]], and is [[simply connected]] for ''n'' at least 3. The de Sitter space, as well as the [[anti-de Sitter space]] is named after [[Willem de Sitter]] (1872–1934), professor of astronomy at [[Leiden University]] and director of the [[Leiden Observatory]]. Willem de Sitter and [[Albert Einstein]] worked in the 1920s in [[Leiden]] closely together on the spacetime structure of our universe. De Sitter space was discovered by [[Willem de Sitter]], and, at the same time, independently by [[Tullio Levi-Civita]].

==== Van der Pol oscillator (1920) ====
In [[dynamical system]]s, a [[Van der Pol oscillator]] is a non-conservative [[oscillator]] with non-linear [[damping]]. It was originally proposed by Dutch physicist [[Balthasar van der Pol]] while he was working at Philips in 1920. Van der Pol studied a [[differential equation]] that describes the circuit of a [[vacuum tube]]. It has been used to model other phenomenon such as human [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeats]] by colleague Jan van der Mark.

==== Kramers' opacity law (1923) ====
[[Kramers' opacity law]] describes the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of a medium in terms of the ambient [[density]] and [[temperature]], assuming that the opacity is dominated by [[ionization|bound-free absorption]] (the absorption of light during ionization of a bound [[electron]]) or [[free-free absorption]] (the absorption of light when scattering a free ion, also called [[bremsstrahlung]]).&lt;ref&gt;Phillips (1999), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to model [[radiative transfer]], particularly in [[stellar atmosphere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (1996), p. 274–276.&lt;/ref&gt; The relation is named after the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[physicist]] [[Hendrik Kramers]], who first derived the form in 1923.&lt;ref name="Carroll274"&gt;Carroll (1996), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Electron spin (1925) ====
In 1925, Dutch physicists [[George Eugene Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] co-discovered the concept of [[electron spin]], which posits an intrinsic [[angular momentum]] for all electrons.

==== Solidification of helium (1926) ====
In 1926, Onnes' student, Dutch physicist [[Willem Hendrik Keesom]], invented a method
to freeze [[liquid helium]] and was the first person who was able to solidify the noble gas.

==== Ehrenfest theorem (1927) ====
The [[Ehrenfest theorem]], named after the Austrian-born [[Dutch Jew|Dutch-Jew]] theoretical physicist [[Paul Ehrenfest]] at [[Leiden University]].

==== De Haas–van Alphen effect (1930) ====
The [[de Haas–van Alphen effect]], often abbreviated to dHvA, is a [[quantum mechanical]] effect in which the [[magnetic moment]] of a pure metal [[crystal]] oscillates as the intensity of an applied [[magnetic field]] B is increased. It was discovered in 1930 by [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] and his student P. M. van Alphen.

==== Shubnikov–de Haas effect (1930) ====
The [[Shubnikov–de Haas effect]] (ShdH) is named after Dutch physicist [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] and Russian physicist [[Lev Shubnikov]].

==== Kramers degeneracy theorem (1930) ====
In quantum mechanics, the [[Kramers theorem|Kramers degeneracy theorem]] states that for every energy eigenstate of a [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetric]] system with half-integer total spin, there is at least one more eigenstate with the same energy. It was first discovered in 1930 by [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|H. A. Kramers]]&lt;ref&gt;Kramers, H. A., Proc. Amsterdam Acad. 33, 959 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of the [[Breit equation]].

==== Minnaert resonance frequency (1933) ====
In 1933, [[Marcel Minnaert]] published a solution for the [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[resonance frequency]] of a single [[Liquid bubble|bubble]] in [[water]], the so-called [[Minnaert resonance]]. The [[Minnaert resonance]] or [[Minnaert frequency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Minnaert |first=M. |authorlink=Marcel Minnaert |year=1933 |title=On musical air-bubbles and the sound of running water |journal=Philosophical Magazine |volume=16 |issue=104 |pages=235–48 |doi=10.1080/14786443309462277}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[acoustic resonance|acoustic]] [[resonance]] frequency of a single bubble in an infinite domain of water (neglecting the effects of [[surface tension]] and [[Viscosity|viscous]] [[attenuation]]).

==== Casimir effect (1948) ====
In quantum field theory, the [[Casimir effect]] and the [[Casimir–Polder force]] are physical forces arising from a quantized field. Dutch physicists [[Hendrik Casimir]] and [[Dirk Polder]] at Philips Research Labs proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947. After a conversation with [[Niels Bohr]] who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948; the former is called the Casimir–Polder force while the latter is the Casimir effect in the narrow sense.

==== Tellegen's theorem (1952) ====
[[Tellegen's theorem]] is one of the most powerful theorems in [[network theory]]. Most of the energy distribution theorems and extremum principles in network theory can be derived from it. It was published in 1952 by [[Bernard Tellegen]]. Fundamentally, Tellegen's theorem gives a simple relation between magnitudes that satisfy [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]] of [[electrical circuit theory]].

==== Stochastic cooling (1970s) ====
In the early 1970s [[Simon van der Meer]], a Dutch particle physicist at [[CERN]], discovered this technique to concentrate proton and anti-proton beams, leading to the discovery of the [[W particle|W]] and [[Z particle]]s. He won the 1984 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] together with [[Carlo Rubbia]].

==== Renormalization of gauge theories (1971) ====
In 1971, [[Gerardus 't Hooft]], who was completing his PhD under the supervision of Dutch theoretical physicist [[Martinus Veltman]], [[renormalization|renormalized]] [[Yang–Mills theory]]. They showed that if the symmetries of Yang–Mills theory were to be realized in the [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] mode, referred to as the Higgs mechanism, then Yang–Mills theory can be renormalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=G.

==== Holographic principle (1993) ====
The [[holographic principle]] is a property of [[string theory|string theories]] and a supposed property of [[quantum gravity]] that states that the description of a volume of [[space]] can be thought of as encoded on a [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] to the region – preferably a [[light-like]] boundary like a [[apparent horizon|gravitational horizon]]. In 1993, Dutch theoretical physicist [[Gerard 't Hooft]] proposed what is now known as the [[holographic principle]]. It was given a precise string-theory interpretation by [[Leonard Susskind]]&lt;ref name=SusskindArXiv&gt;{{cite journal |title=The World as a Hologram |last=Susskind |first=Leonard |doi=10.1063/1.531249 |date=1995 |journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=6377–96|arxiv=hep-th/9409089 |bibcode = 1995JMP....36.6377S }}&lt;/ref&gt; who combined his ideas with previous ones of 't Hooft and [[Charles Thorn]].&lt;ref name=SusskindArXiv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Charles B. |last=Thorn |title=Reformulating string theory with the 1/N expansion |conference=International A.D.

==== Orange Islands (1594) ====
[[File:Linschotens nordenkart, 1601 (12067624705).jpg|thumb|right|Map of Willem Barentsz' first voyage]]

During his first journey in 1594, Dutch explorer [[Willem Barentsz]] discovered the [[Orange Islands]], at the northern extremity of [[Novaya Zemlya|Nova Zembla]].

==== Svalbard (1596) ====

[[File:Behouden Finds 1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Objects found in ''Het Behouden Huys'' (''The Saved House'') on [[Novaya Zemlya]].]]

The first undisputedly to have discovered the archipelago is an expedition led by the Dutch mariner [[Willem Barentsz]], who was looking for the [[Northern Sea Route]] to China.&lt;ref name=a9&gt;Arlov (1994): 9&lt;/ref&gt; He first spotted [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bjørnøya]] on 10 June 1596&lt;ref&gt;Arlov (1994): 10&lt;/ref&gt; and the northwestern tip of [[Spitsbergen]] on 17 June.&lt;ref name=a9 /&gt; The sighting of the archipelago was included in the accounts and maps made by the expedition and Spitsbergen was quickly included by cartographers. The name ''Spitsbergen'', meaning "pointed mountains" (from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''spits'' – pointed, ''bergen'' – mountains), was at first applied to both the [[Spitsbergen|main island]] and the [[Svalbard archipelago]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="Grimbly, Shona 2001 p. 47"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pletcher, Kenneth 2010 p. 162"/&gt;

==== Winter surviving in the High Arctic (1596–1597) ====
[[File:Barents' ship among the arctic ice.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Willem Barentsz' ship among the [[Arctic]] ice]]
[[File:Barents house inside.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''Het Behouden Huys'' on [[Novaya Zemlya]]]]
The search for the [[Northern Sea Route]] in the 16th century led to its exploration.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;Novaya Zemlya in: {{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Novaya_Zemlya|title=Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.)|year=1911|accessdate=2006-10-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017172753/http://1911encyclopedia.org/Novaya_Zemlya|archivedate=17 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch explorer [[Willem Barentsz]] reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] in 1594, and in a subsequent expedition of 1596 rounded the Northern point and wintered on the Northeast coast.&lt;ref name="whitfield"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Found Lands: Maps in the History of Exploration|year=1998|first=Peter|last=Whitfield|publisher=Routledge|location=UK|isbn=0-415-92026-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willem Barents]], [[Jacob van Heemskerck]] and their crew were blocked by the pack ice in the [[Kara Sea]] and forced to winter on the east coast of Novaya Zemlya. The wintering of the shipwrecked crew in the 'Saved House' was the first successful wintering of Europeans in the High Arctic. Twelve of the 17 men managed to survive the polar winter (De Veer, 1917). Barentsz died during the expedition, and may have been buried on the northern island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic55-4-329.pdf "Search for Barents: Evaluation of Possible Burial Sites on North Novaya Zemlya, Russia"], Jaapjan J. Zeeberg et al., ''Arctic'' Vol. 55, No. 4 (December 2002) p. 329–338&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Falkland Islands/Sebald Islands (1600) ====
In 1600 the Dutch navigator [[Sebald de Weert]] made the first undisputed sighting of the [[Falkland Islands]]. It was on his homeward leg back to the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] after having left the [[Straits of Magellan]] that [[Sebald De Weert]] noticed some unnamed and uncharted islands, at least islands that did not exist on his [[nautical chart]]s. There he attempted to stop and replenish but was unable to land due to harsh conditions. The [[Jason Islands|islands]] Sebald de Weert charted were a small group off the northwest coast of the [[Falkland Islands]] and are in fact part of the Falklands. De Weert then named these islands the “Sebald de Weert Islands” and the Falklands as a whole were known as the [[Sebald Islands]] until well into the 18th century.

==== Pennefather River, Northern Australia (1606) ====
[[File:Duyfken Replica Under Sail.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''[[Duyfken]]'' [[replica]] under sail. The first documented and undisputed European [[Janszoon voyage of 1605-6|sighting of and landing on]] Australia was in late February or early March 1606, by the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] aboard the ''[[Duyfken]]''. [[Australia]] is more than three times the size of [[Greenland]], the [[List of islands by area|world's largest island]]. [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] is sometimes dubbed "The Island Continent", and sometimes accorded the role of "Earth’s largest [[island]] but smallest [[continent]]".]]

The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland, and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent, are attributed to the Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]]. He sighted the coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]] in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February at the [[Pennefather River]] near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]] on Cape York.&lt;ref name=dhm233&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Australian History |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-553597-9 |author=Davison, Graeme |author2=Hirst, John |author-link2=John Hirst (historian) |author3=Macintyre, Stuart |author-link3=Stuart Macintyre |ref= CITEREFDavison, Hirst and Macintyre}} p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent "[[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]" during the 17th century, but made no attempt at settlement.&lt;ref name=dhm233/&gt;

==== First charting of Manhattan, New York (1609) ====
The area that is now [[Manhattan]] was long inhabited by the [[Lenape]] Indians. In 1524, Florentine explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] – sailing in service of the king [[Francis I of France]] – was the first European to visit the area that would become New York City. It was not until the voyage of [[Henry Hudson]], an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company, that the area was mapped.

==== Hudson Valley (1609) ====
At the time of the arrival of the first Europeans in the 17th century, the [[Hudson Valley]] was inhabited primarily by the Algonquian-speaking [[Mahican]] and [[Munsee]] Native American people, known collectively as River Indians. The first Dutch settlement was in the 1610s at [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]], a trading post (factorij) south of modern-day Albany, that traded European goods for [[beaver]] pelts. Fort Nassau was later replaced by [[Fort Orange]]. During the rest of the 17th century, the Hudson Valley formed the heart of the [[New Netherland]] colony operations, with the [[New Amsterdam]] settlement on Manhattan serving as a post for supplies and defense of the upriver operations.

==== Brouwer Route (1610–1611) ====
The [[Brouwer Route]] was a route for sailing from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to [[Java, Indonesia|Java]]. The Route took ships south from the Cape into the [[Roaring Forties]], then east across the [[Indian Ocean]], before turning northwest for Java. Thus it took advantage of the strong westerly winds for which the Roaring Forties are named, greatly increasing travel speed. It was devised by Dutch sea explorer [[Hendrik Brouwer]] in 1611, and found to halve the duration of the journey from Europe to Java, compared to the previous Arab and Portuguese [[monsoon]] route, which involved following the coast of East Africa northwards, sailing through the [[Mozambique Channel]] and then across the Indian Ocean, sometimes via India. The Brouwer Route played a major role in the discovery of the west coast of Australia.

==== Jan Mayen Island (1614) ====
After unconfirmed reports of Dutch discovery as early as 1611, the island was named after Dutchman [[Jan Jacobszoon May van Schellinkhout]], who visited the island in July 1614. As locations of these islands were kept secret by the whalers, Jan Mayen got its current name only in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, William J. (2003). ''Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'', p. 332–33&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hell Gate, Long Island Sound, Connecticut River and Fisher's Island (1614) ====
[[File:Wpdms aq block 1614.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Block's map of his 1614 voyage, with the first appearance of the term "New Netherland"]]

The name "Hell Gate" is a corruption of Dutch phrase ''Hellegat'', which could mean either "hell's hole" or "bright gate/passage". It was originally applied to the entirety of the [[East River]]. The [[strait]] was described in the journals of Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]], who is the first European known to have navigated the strait, during his 1614 voyage aboard the ''Onrust''.

The first European to record the existence of [[Long Island Sound]] and the [[Connecticut River]] was Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]], who entered it from the East River in 1614.

[[Fishers Island]] was called ''Munnawtawkit'' by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Pequot]] nation. Block named it ''Visher's Island'' in 1614, after one of his companions. For the next 25 years, it remained a wilderness, visited occasionally by Dutch traders.

==== Staten Island (Argentina), Cape Horn, Tonga, Hoorn Islands (1615) ====
On 25 December 1615, Dutch explorers [[Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]] aboard the Eendracht, discovered [[Staten Island, Argentina|Staten Island]], close to Cape Horn.

[[File:Le Maire en Schouten - Reis via Kaap Hoorn naar Indie 1615-1616.png|thumb|200px|right|The voyage of [[Willem Schouten]] and [[Jacob le Maire]] in 1615–1616]]

On 29 January 1616, they sighted land they called [[Cape Horn]], after the city of Hoorn. Aboard the Eendracht was the crew of the recently wrecked ship called Hoorn.

[[File:Tasman-dagboek-a.jpg|thumb|right|Arrival of [[Abel Tasman]] in [[Tongatapu]], 1643, drawing by [[Isaack Gilsemans]]]]

They discovered [[Tonga]] on 21 April 1616 and the [[Hoorn Islands]] on 28 April 1616.

They discovered [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] around May–July 1616.

They discovered the [[Schouten Islands]] (also known as ''Biak Islands'' or ''Geelvink Islands'') on 24 July 1616.

The Schouten Islands (also known as ''Eastern Schouten Islands'' or ''Le Maire Islands'') of [[Papua New Guinea]], were named after Schouten, who visited them in 1616.

==== Dirk Hartog Island (1616) ====
[[File:Ac dirkhartogplate.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Hartog plate|Dirk Hartog's plate]] in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]]]

[[File:Shark Bay.svg|thumb|right|200px|Map of Shark Bay area showing [[Dirk Hartog Island]] and Cape Inscription]]

[[Hendrik Brouwer]]'s discovery that sailing east from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] until land was sighted, and then sailing north along the west coast of Australia was a much quicker route than around the coast of the Indian Ocean made Dutch landfalls on the west coast inevitable. The first such landfall was in 1616, when [[Dirk Hartog]] landed at Cape Inscription on what is now known as [[Dirk Hartog Island]], off the coast of Western Australia, and left behind an inscription on a [[pewter]] [[Hartog plate|plate]]. In 1697 the Dutch captain [[Willem de Vlamingh]] landed on the island and discovered [[Hartog Plate|Hartog's plate]]. He replaced it with one of his own, which included a copy of Hartog's inscription, and took the original plate home to [[Amsterdam]], where it is still kept in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].

==== Houtman Abrolhos (1619) ====
The first sighting of the [[Houtman Abrolhos]] by Europeans was by Dutch VOC ships ''Dordrecht'' and ''Amsterdam'' in 1619, three years after Hartog made the first authenticated sighting of what is now Western Australia, 13 years after the first authenticated voyage to Australia, that of the ''Duyfke'' in 1606. Discovery of the islands was credited to [[Frederick de Houtman]], Captain-General of the ''Dordrecht'', as it was Houtman who later wrote of the discovery in a letter to Company directors.

==== Carstensz Glacier, Carstensz Pyramid/Puncak Jaya (1623) ====
The first person to spot [[Carstensz Pyramid]] (or [[Puncak Jaya]]) is reported to be the Dutch navigator and explorer [[Jan Carstenszoon|Jan Carstensz]] in 1623, for whom the mountain is named. Carstensz was the first (non-native) to sight the [[Carstensz Glacier|glaciers]] on the peak of the [[mountain]] on a rare clear day. The sighting went unverified for over two centuries, and Carstensz was ridiculed in Europe when he said he had seen [[snow]] and [[glacier]]s near the [[equator]]. The [[snowfield]] of Puncak Jaya was reached as early as 1909 by a Dutch explorer, [[Hendrik Albert Lorentz]] with six of his indigenous [[Dayak people|Dayak]] [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] porters recruited from the [[Apo Kayan]] in [[Borneo]]. The now highest Carstensz Pyramid summit was not climbed until 1962, by an expedition led by the Austrian mountaineer [[Heinrich Harrer]] with three other expedition members – the New Zealand mountaineer Philip Temple, the Australian rock climber Russell Kippax, and the Dutch patrol officer Albertus (Bert) Huizenga.

==== Gulf of Carpentaria (Northern Australia) (1623) ====
The first known [[European maritime exploration of Australia|European explorer]] to visit the region was Dutch [[Willem Janszoon]] (also known as ''Willem Jansz'') on [[Janszoon voyage of 1605–06|his 1605–06 voyage]]. His fellow countryman, [[Jan Carstenszoon]] (also known as ''Jan Carstensz''), visited in 1623 and named the gulf in honour of [[Pieter de Carpentier]], at that time the Governor-General of Dutch East Indies. [[Abel Tasman]] explored the coast in 1644.

==== Staaten River (Cape York Peninsula, Northern Australia) (1623) ====
The Staaten River is a river in the [[Cape York Peninsula]], Australia that rises more than {{convert|200|km}} to the west of [[Cairns]] and empties into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. The river was first named by Carstenszoon in 1623.

==== Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt (Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Australia) (1623) ====
In 1623 Dutch East India Company captain Willem van Colster sailed into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Cape Arnhem is named after his ship, the [[Arnhem (ship)|''Arnhem'']], which itself was named after the city of [[Arnhem]].

[[Groote Eylandt]] was first sighted the ''Arnhem''. Only in 1644, when [[Abel Tasman]] arrived, was the island given a European name, Dutch for "Large Island" in an archaic spelling. The modern Dutch spelling is ''Groot Eiland''.

==== Hermite Islands (1624) ====
In February 1624, Dutch admiral [[Jacques l'Hermite]] discovered the [[Hermite Islands]] at Cape Horn.

==== Southern Australia coast (1627) ====
In 1627, Dutch explorers [[François Thijssen]] and [[Pieter Nuyts]] discovered the south coast of Australia and charted about {{convert|1800|km}} of it between [[Cape Leeuwin]] and the [[Nuyts Archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = McHugh | first1 = Evan | title = 1606: An Epic Adventure | publisher = University of New South Wales Press | year = 2006 | location = Sydney | pages = 44–57 | isbn = 978-0-86840-866-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;Garden 1977, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Thijssen]], captain of the ship ''[['t Gulden Zeepaert]]'' (The Golden Seahorse), sailed to the east as far as [[Ceduna]] in [[South Australia]]. The first known ship to have visited the area is the ''Leeuwin'' ("Lioness"), a Dutch vessel that charted some of the nearby coastline in 1622. The log of the ''Leeuwin'' has been lost, so very little is known of the voyage. However, the land discovered by the ''Leeuwin'' was recorded on a 1627 map by [[Hessel Gerritsz]]: [[Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht]] ("Chart of the Land of Eendracht"), which appears to show the coast between present-day [[Hamelin Bay]] and [[Point D’Entrecasteaux]]. Part of Thijssen's map shows the islands St Francis and St Peter, now known collectively with their respective groups as the [[Nuyts Archipelago]]. Thijssen's observations were included as soon as 1628 by the VOC cartographer [[Hessel Gerritsz]] in a chart of the Indies and New Holland. This voyage defined most of the southern coast of Australia and discouraged the notion that "New Holland", as it was then known, was linked to Antarctica.

[[St Francis Island]] (originally in Dutch: ''Eyland St. François'') is an island on the south coast of [[South Australia]] near Ceduna. It is now part of the [[Nuyts Archipelago Wilderness Protection Area]]. It was one of the first parts of [[South Australia]] to be discovered and named by Europeans, along with [[St Peter Island]]. Thijssen named it after his patron saint, [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]].

[[St Peter Island]] is an island on the south coast of [[South Australia]] near Ceduna to the south of [[Denial Bay]]. It is the second largest island in South Australia at about 13&amp;nbsp;km long. It was named in 1627 by Thijssen after [[Pieter Nuyts]]' patron saint.

==== Western Australia (1629) ====

The [[Weibbe Hayes Stone Fort]], remnants of improvised [[defensive wall]]s and stone shelters built by [[Wiebbe Hayes]] and his men on the [[West Wallabi Island]], are Australia's oldest known European structures, more than 150 years before expeditions to the Australian continent by [[James Cook]] and [[Arthur Phillip]].

==== Tasmania and the surrounding islands (1642) ====
[[File:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|200px|Tasman's routes of the first and second voyage]]

In 1642, [[Abel Tasman]] sailed from [[Mauritius]] and on 24 November, sighted [[Tasmania]]. He named Tasmania [[Van Diemen's Land]], after [[Anthony van Diemen]], the [[Dutch East India Company]]'s Governor General, who had commissioned his voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Fenton, James (1884).

[[File:Maatsuyker Islands.png|thumb|200px|right|Map of the [[Maatsuyker Islands]]]]

[[Maatsuyker Islands]], a group of small islands that are the southernmost point of the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]]. were discovered and named by Tasman in 1642 after a Dutch official. The main islands of the group are [[De Witt Island]] (354 m), [[Maatsuyker Island]] (296 m), [[Flat Witch Island]], [[Flat Top Island]], [[Round Top Island (Tasmania)|Round Top Island]], [[Walker Island (Southern Tasmania)|Walker Island]], [[Needle Rocks]] and [[Mewstone (Tasmania)|Mewstone]].

[[Maria Island]] was discovered and named in 1642 by Tasman after Maria van Diemen (née van Aelst), wife of Anthony. The island was known as ''Maria's Isle'' in the early 19th century.

Tasman's journal entry for 29 November 1642 records that he observed a rock which was similar to a rock named [[Pedra Branca (Tasmania)|Pedra Branca]] off China, presumably referring to the [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|Pedra Branca]] in the [[South China Sea]].

[[Schouten Island]] is a {{convert|28|km2}} island in eastern [[Tasmania]], Australia. It lies 1.6 kilometres south of [[Freycinet Peninsula]] and is a part of [[Freycinet National Park]]. In 1642, while surveying the south-west coast of Tasmania, Tasman named the island after [[Joost Schouten]], a member of the Council of the Dutch East India Company.

Tasman also reached [[Storm Bay]], a large [[bay]] in the south-east of [[Tasmania]], Australia. It is the entrance to the [[Derwent River (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] [[estuary]] and the port of [[Hobart]], the capital city of [[Tasmania]]. It is bordered by [[Bruny Island]] to the west and the [[Tasman Peninsula]] to the east.

==== New Zealand and Fiji (1642) ====
[[File:Gilsemans 1642.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Golden Bay|Murderers' Bay]], drawing by [[Isaack Gilsemans]], 1642]]

[[File:Detail of 1657 map Polus Antarcticus by Jan Janssonius, showing Nova Zeelandia.png|thumb|right|200px|Detail from a 1657 map by [[Jan Janssonius]], showing the western coastline of [[Nova Zeelandia]].]]

[[File:Tasman Sea.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Tasman voyage of 1642–43 was the known (documented) first to sail across the [[Tasman Sea]] and explore its islands.]]

In 1642, the first Europeans known to reach [[New Zealand]] were the crew of Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] who arrived in his ships ''Heemskerck'' and ''Zeehaen''. Tasman anchored at the northern end of the [[South Island]] in [[Golden Bay]] (he named it Murderers' Bay) in December 1642 and sailed northward to [[Tonga]] following a clash with local Māori. Tasman sketched sections of the two main islands' west coasts. Tasman called them ''Staten Landt'', after the ''[[States General of the Netherlands]]'', and that name appeared on his first maps of the country. In 1645 Dutch cartographers changed the name to ''[[Nova Zeelandia]]'' in Latin, from ''Nieuw Zeeland'', after the [[Seventeen Provinces|Dutch province]] of ''[[Zeeland]]''. It was subsequently Anglicised as ''New Zealand'' by British naval captain [[James Cook]]

Various claims have been made that New Zealand was reached by other non-Polynesian voyagers before Tasman, but these are not widely accepted. Peter Trickett, for example, argues in ''[[Beyond Capricorn]]'' that the Portuguese explorer [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|reached New Zealand]] in the 1520s, and the [[Tamil bell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/1135/the-tamil-bell "The Tamil Bell"], Te Papa&lt;/ref&gt; discovered by [[missionary]] [[William Colenso]] has given rise to a number of theories,&lt;ref name="tamils_spread"/&gt;

In 1643, still during the same expedition, Tasman discovered [[Fiji]].

==== Tongatapu and Haʻapai (Tonga) (1643) ====
Tasman discovered [[Tongatapu]] and [[Haʻapai]] in 1643 commanding two ships, the ''Heemskerck'' and the ''Zeehaen'' commissioned by the Dutch East India Company. The expedition's goals were to chart the unknown southern and eastern seas and to find a possible passage through the South Pacific and Indian Ocean providing a faster route to Chile.

==== Sakhalin (Cape Patience) (1643) ====
The first European known to visit [[Sakhalin]] was [[Martin Gerritz de Vries]], who mapped [[Cape Patience]] and [[Cape Aniva]] on the island's east coast in 1643.

==== Kuril Islands (1643) ====
In the summer of 1643, the ''Castricum'', under command of [[Martin Gerritz de Vries]] sailed by the southern [[Kuril Islands]], visiting [[Kunashir]], Iturup and Urup, which they named "Company Island" and claimed for the Netherlands.

[[Vries Strait]] or [[Miyabe Line]] is a strait between two main islands of the [[Kurils]]. It is located between the northeastern end of the island of [[Iturup]] and the southwestern headland of [[Urup Island]], connecting the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] on the west with the Pacific Ocean on the east. The strait is named after de Vries, the first recorded European to explore the area.

The [[Gulf of Patience]] is a large body of water off the southeastern coast of Sakhalin, Russia, between the main body of Sakhalin Island in the west and Cape Patience in the east. It is part of the Sea of Okhotsk. The first Europeans to visit the bay sailed on ''Castricum''. They named the gulf in memory of the [[fog]] that had to clear for them to continue their expedition.

==== Rottnest Island and Swan River (1696) ====
[[File:Quokka family.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Quokka]] family on [[Rottnest Island]], Western Australia]]

The first Europeans known to land on the [[Rottnest Island]] were 13 Dutch sailors including Abraham Leeman from the ''Waeckende Boey'' who landed near Bathurst Point on 19 March 1658 while their ship was nearby. The ship had sailed from Batavia in search of survivors of the missing ''[[Vergulde Draeck]]'' which was later found wrecked {{convert|80|km}} north near present-day [[Ledge Point]]. The island was given the name "Rotte nest" (meaning "rat nest" in the 17th century Dutch language) by Dutch captain [[Willem de Vlamingh]] who spent six days exploring the island from 29 December 1696, mistaking the [[quokka]]s for giant [[rat]]s. De Vlamingh led a fleet of three ships, ''De Geelvink'', ''De Nijptang'' and ''Weseltje'' and anchored on the northern side of the island, near The Basin.

[[File:Vlamingh ships at the Swan River, Keulen 1796.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Willem de Vlamingh's ships, with black swans, at the entrance to the Swan River, Western Australia'', coloured engraving (1796), derived from an earlier drawing (now lost) from the de Vlamingh expeditions of 1696–97.]]

[[File:Black Swan and Cygnet.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An adult [[black swan]] and [[cygnet (bird)|cygnet]]. For some 1500 years, the [[Black Swan emblems and popular culture|black swan]] existed in the European imagination as a [[metaphor]] for that which could not exist. Dutch explorer [[Willem de Vlamingh]] made the first European record of sighting a [[black swan]] in 1697. The sighting was significant in Europe, where "[[Black swan theory|all swans are white]]" had long been used as a standard example of a well-known truth.]]

On 10 January 1697, de Vlamingh ventured up the Swan River. He and his crew are believed to have been the first Europeans to do so. He named the ''[[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]'' (''Zwaanenrivier'' in Dutch) after the large numbers of [[black swan]]s that he observed there.

==== Easter Island and Samoa (1722) ====
[[File:Moai Rano raraku.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Easter Island]] is world-famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called ''[[moai]]'']]

On Easter Sunday, 5 April 1722, Dutch explorer [[Jacob Roggeveen]] discovered Easter Island. [[Easter Island]] is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.portalrapanui.cl/easterisland/index.htm|title= Welcome to Rapa Nui – Isla de Pascua – Easter Island|work= Portal RapaNui, the island's official website|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111101221510/http://www.portalrapanui.cl/easterisland/index.htm|archivedate= 1 November 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest inhabited land (50 residents) is [[Pitcairn Island]] {{convert|2075|km|mi}} away, the nearest town with a population over 500 is [[Rikitea]] on island [[Mangareva]] {{convert|2606|km|0|abbr=on}} away, and the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, {{convert|3512|km|mi}} away.

The name "Easter Island" was given by the island's first recorded European visitor, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] explorer [[Jacob Roggeveen]], who encountered it on [[Easter Sunday]] (5 April&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assa.org.au/edm "Calculate the Date of Easter Sunday]", Astronomical Society of South Australia. Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;) 1722, while searching for [[Edward Davis (buccaneer)|Davis or David's island]]. Roggeveen named it ''Paasch-Eyland'' (18th century [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "Easter Island").&lt;ref name=jrjournal&gt;An English translation of the originally Dutch journal by Jacob Roggeveen, with additional significant information from the log by Cornelis Bouwman, was published in: Andrew Sharp (ed.), The Journal of Jacob Roggeveen (Oxford 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; The island's official Spanish name, ''Isla de Pascua'', also means "Easter Island".

On 13 June Roggeveen discovered the islands of [[Samoa]].

==== Orange River (1779) ====
The Orange River was named by [[Robert Jacob Gordon|Colonel Robert Gordon]], commander of the Dutch East India Company garrison at [[Cape Town]], on a trip to the interior in 1779.

=== Scientific explorations ===
==== First systematic mapping of southern celestial hemisphere (1595–1597) ====

In 1595, [[Petrus Plancius]], a key promoter to the [[East Indies]] expeditions, asked [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]], the chief pilot on the ''Hollandia'', to make observations to fill in the blank area around the [[South pole|south celestial pole]] on European maps of the [[Southern hemisphere|southern sky]]. Plancius had instructed Keyser to map the skies in the [[southern hemisphere]], which were largely uncharted at the time. Keyser died in [[Java]] the following year but his catalogue of 135 [[star]]s, probably measured up with the help of explorer-colleague [[Frederick de Houtman]], was delivered to Plancius, and then those stars were arranged into 12 new southern [[constellation]]s, letting them be inscribed on a 35-cm celestial globe that was prepared in late 1597 (or early 1598). This globe was produced in collaboration with the Amsterdam cartographer [[Jodocus Hondius]].

Plancius's constellations (mostly referring to animals and subjects described in natural history books and travellers' journals of his day) are [[Apis (constellation)|Apis]] the Bee (later changed to [[Musca]] by [[Lacaille]]), [[Apus]] the Bird of Paradise, [[Chamaeleon]], [[Dorado]] the Goldfish (or Swordfish), [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]] the Crane, [[Hydrus]] the Small Water Snake, [[Indus (constellation)|Indus]] the Indian, [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] the Peacock, [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]], [[Triangulum Australe]] the Southern Triangle, [[Tucana]] the Toucan, and [[Volans]] the Flying Fish. The acceptance of these new [[List of constellations|constellations]] was assured when [[Johann Bayer]], a German astronomer, included them in his ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603, the leading [[star atlas]] of its day. These 12 southern constellations are still recognized today by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU).&lt;ref name="Ridpath, Ian 1988 p. 9–10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lankford, John 1997 p. 161"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephenson, Bruce 2000 p. 24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanas, Nick 2007 p. 119–21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gendler, Robert 2011 p. 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson, Phil 2012 p. 559–61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ridpath, Ian 2012 p. 96"/&gt;

==== First major scientific expedition to Brazil (1637–1644) ====
Within the thirty-year period the [[Dutch West India Company]] controlled the northeast region of [[Dutch Brazil|Brazil]] (1624–1654), the seven-year governorship of Count [[Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen]] was marked by an intense ethnographic exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Brienen, Rebecca Parker (2006). ''Visions of Savage Paradise: Albert Eckcourt, Court Painter in Colonial Dutch Brazil, 1637–1644''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Groesen, Michiel (2014).

Together with Georg Marcgraf, and originally published by [[Joannes de Laet]], Piso wrote the ''[[Historia Naturalis Brasiliae]]'' (1648), an important early western insight into Brazilian [[flora]] and [[fauna]], also is the first scientific book about Brazil. Albert Eckhout, along with the landscape artist Frans Post, was one of two formally trained painters charged with recording the complexity of the local scene. The seven years Eckhout spent in Brazil constitute an invaluable contribution to the understanding of the European colonization of the [[New World]]. During his stay he created hundreds of oil sketches – mostly from life – of the local flora, fauna and people. These paintings by Eckhout and the landscapes by Post were among the Europeans' first, introductions to South America.

==== First ethnographic descriptions of New Netherland and North American Indians (1641–1653) ====
In 1641, [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (merchant)|Kiliaen van Rensselaer]], the director of the [[Dutch West India Company]], hired [[Adriaen van der Donck]] (1620–1655) to be his lawyer for his large, semi-independent estate, [[Rensselaerswijck]], in [[New Netherland]]. Until 1645, van der Donck lived in the Upper Hudson River Valley, near Fort Orange (later [[Albany, New York|Albany]]), where he learned about the Company's fur trade, the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] and [[Mahican Indians]] who traded with Dutch, the agriculturist settlers, and the area's plants and animals. In 1649, after a serious disagreement with the new governor, [[Peter Stuyvesant]], he returned to the [[Dutch Republic]] to petition Dutch government. In 1653, still in the Netherlands waiting for the government to decide his case, [[Adriaen van der Donck]] wrote a comprehensive description of the [[New Netherland]]'s geography and native peoples based on material in his earlier ''Remonstrance''. The book, ''Beschryvinge van Nieuw-Nederlant'' or ''A Description of New Netherland'' later published in 1655. This new book was well-crafted to the interests of his audience, consisting of an extensive description of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and their customs, reports on the abundance of the area's agriculture and wealth of its natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Wayne (1979).

==== First non-Asian first-hand account of Korea (1653–1666) ====

[[Jan Jansz. Weltevree|Jan Weltevree]] (1595-?) is regarded as the first naturalized Westerner to [[Korea]]. Weltevree was a Dutch sailor who arrived on the shores of an island off [[Joseon]]’s west coast in 1627 in a [[shipwreck]]. The [[Joseon Dynasty]] at that time maintained an [[Hermit kingdom|isolation policy]], so the captured foreigner could not leave the country. Weltevree took the name ''Bak Yeon'' (also ''Pak Yeon''). He became an important government official and aided [[Hyojong of Joseon|King Hyojong]] with his keen knowledge of modern weaponry. His adventures were recorded in the report by [[Dutch East India Company]] accountant [[Hendrik Hamel]].&lt;ref&gt;Lach, Donald F.; Van Kley, Edwin J. (1993).

Dutch seafarer and [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]'s [[bookkeeper]] [[Hendrick Hamel]] was the first westerner to experience first-hand and write about [[Korea]] in [[Joseon]] era (1392–1897). In 1653, Hamel and his men were shipwrecked on [[Jeju-do|Jeju island]], and they remained captives in Korea for more than a decade. The [[Joseon dynasty]] was often referred to as the "[[Hermit Kingdom]]" for its harsh isolationism and closed borders. The shipwrecked Dutchmen were given some freedom of movement, but were forbidden to leave the country. After thirteen years (1653–1666), [[Hendrick Hamel|Hamel]] and seven of his crewmates managed to escape to the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] trading mission at [[Dejima]] (an [[artificial island]] in the [[bay]] of [[Nagasaki]], Japan), and from there to the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]]. In 1666, three different publishers published his report (''Journal van de Ongeluckige Voyage van 't Jacht de Sperwer'' or ''An account of the shipwreck of a Dutch vessel on the coast of the isle of Quelpaert together with the description of the kingdom of Corea''), describing their improbable adventure and giving the first detailed and accurate description of [[History of Korea|Korea]] to the western world.&lt;ref name="Lee, Kenneth B. 1997 p. 122"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seth, Michael J. 2011 p. 227–28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker, Hugh Dyson 2012 p. 316"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lach, Donald F.; Van Kley, Edwin J.

[[File:Diagram of Hard Disk Drive Manufacturer Consolidation.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of consolidation]]

At least 221 companies were '''hard disk drive manufacturers''' in the past.&lt;ref name="Maleval"/&gt;  Most of that industry has vanished through [[bankruptcy]] or [[mergers and acquisitions]]. None of the first four entrants continue in the industry today.&lt;ref name="Informics"/&gt;  As shown in the graphic surviving manufacturers are [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Western Digital]] (WD) all of whom grew at least in part through mergers and acquisitions.

[[File:Louis H. Kauffman, Oct 2014.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Louis Kauffman]]
'''Louis Hirsch Kauffman''' (born February 3, 1945) is an American [[mathematician]], [[topology|topologist]], and professor of [[Mathematics]] in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer science at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. He is known for the introduction and development of the [[bracket polynomial]] and the [[Kauffman polynomial]].

== Biography ==
Kauffman was [[wiktionary:valedictorian|valedictorian]] of his graduating class at Norwood Norfolk Central High School in 1962. He received his [[B.S.]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1966 and his [[Ph.D.]] in [[mathematics]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1972 (with the famous mathematician [[William Browder (mathematician)|William Browder]] as thesis advisor).

Kauffman has worked at many places as a visiting professor and researcher, including the [[University of Zaragoza]] in Spain, the [[University of Iowa]] in Iowa City, the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] in Bures Sur Yevette, France, the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, France, the [[University of Bologna]], Italy, the [[Federal University of Pernambuco]] in Recife, Brazil, and the [[Newton Institute]] in Cambridge England.&lt;ref name = "Knot Information"&gt;http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/569.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founding editor and one of the managing editors of the ''[[Journal of Knot Theory and Its Ramifications]]'', and editor of the ''World Scientific Book Series On Knots and Everything''. He writes a column entitled Virtual Logic for the journal ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing''

From 2005 to 2008 he was president of the [[American Society for Cybernetics]]. He plays
clarinet in the ChickenFat Klezmer Orchestra in Chicago.

== Work ==
Kauffman's research interests are in the fields of cybernetics, topology and foundations of mathematics and physics. His work is primarily in the topics of [[knot theory]] and connections with [[statistical mechanics]], [[Quantum field theory|quantum theory]], [[algebra]], [[combinatorics]] and foundations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asci.org/artsci2002/artworks/Sunday/explorations.htm Presentation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[topology]] he introduced and developed the [[bracket polynomial]] and [[Kauffman polynomial]].

=== Bracket polynomial ===
{{main|Bracket polynomial}}
In the mathematical field of [[knot theory]], the [[bracket polynomial]], also known as the ''Kauffman bracket'', is a [[polynomial]] invariant of [[framed link]]s.  Although it is not an invariant of knots or links (as it is not invariant under type I [[Reidemeister move]]s), a suitably "normalized" version yields the famous [[knot invariant]] called the [[Jones polynomial]].  The bracket polynomial plays an important role in unifying the Jones polynomial with other [[quantum invariant]]s.  In particular, Kauffman's interpretation of the Jones polynomial allows generalization to state sum invariants of [[3-manifold]]s.  Recently the bracket polynomial formed the basis for Mikhail Khovanov's construction of a homology for knots and links, creating
a stronger invariant than the Jones polynomial and such that the graded Euler characteristic of the [[Khovanov homology]] is equal to the original
Jones polynomial. The generators for the chain complex of the Khovanov homology are states of the bracket polynomial decorated with elements
of a [[Frobenius algebra]].

=== Kauffman polynomial ===
{{main|Kauffman polynomial}}
The [[Kauffman polynomial]] is a 2-variable [[knot polynomial]] due to Louis Kauffman. It is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;F(K)(a,z)=a^{-w(K)}L(K)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w(K)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[writhe]] and &lt;math&gt;L(K)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[regular isotopy]] invariant which generalizes the bracket polynomial.

=== Discrete ordered calculus ===
In 1994, Kauffman and Tom Etter wrote a draft proposal for a non-commutative ''discrete ordered calculus'' (DOC), which they presented in revised form in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;T. Etter, L.H. Kauffman, ANPA West Journal, vol. 6, no. 1, pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, the theory was presented in a modified form by Kauffman and [[H. Pierre Noyes]] together with a presentation of a derivation of free space [[Maxwell's equations]] on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;Louis H. Kauffman, H. Pierre Noyes, Discrete physics and the derivation of electromagnetism from the formalism of quantum mechanics, Proceedings of the Royal Society London A (1996), vol. 452, pp. 81–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
He won a [[Lester R. Ford Award]] (with [[Thomas Banchoff]]) in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kauffman, Louis|author2=Banchoff, Thomas|title=Immersions and Mod-2 quadratic forms|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=84|year=1977|pages=168–185|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/immersions-and-mod-2-quadratic-forms|doi=10.2307/2319486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kauffman is the 1993 recipient of the Warren McCulloch award of the American Society for Cybernetics and the 1996 award of the Alternative Natural Philosophy Association for his work in discrete physics. He is the 2014 recipient of the Norbert Wiener award of the American Society for Cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc-cybernetics.org/organization/awards.htm About SSC: Awards], retrieved 2014-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FSIMC.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Mud Cleaner]]
A '''mud cleaner''' is a combination  of [[desander]]s and/or [[wiktionary:desilter|desilter]]s to remove drilled solids from [[mud]].

==History==

Although US Patent No.3,766,997 covering Mud Cleaner was issued on October 23, 1973 granted to J.K. Heilhecker and L.H. Robinson and assigned to Exxon Production Research Company, it was found invalid and efforts for re-issue was unsuccessful because of the existence of [[prior art]] filed at the [[UK Intellectual Property Office|British Patent Office]] by a German Inventor in the late 1800s.

Nowadays, mud cleaner used in oilfield means the equipment processing [[Drilling fluid|drilling mud]]. It is combined with desander cone and desilter cone as well as bottom shaker. It is called 2nd and 3rd phase solids control equipment.

==Description==

A mud cleaner is a combination  of [[desander]]s and/or desilters mounted over a shaker with a fine mesh screen. A mud is fed to the inlet of the [[hydrocyclone]] (desander and/or desilter) to separate particles and the underflow passes to the fine screen mesh where in particles larger than [[barite]] are discarded and thrown away. In most drilling operations, a mud cleaner is installed in its [[mud systems]]. It is usually located in a mud tank in the same location as with the desilters.

==Process flow==

The weighted mud flows to the inlet head section of the desander and/or desilter entering the hydrocyclones for separation of particles.  Mud leaving the underflow is further screened with fine mesh to separate larger particles allowing only barite size particles to pass through the screen returning and recovering then the clean mud.

==Purpose==

The purpose of the mud cleaner is to remove drilled solids larger than barite. Solids larger than 74–105 micrometres can be removed by the mud cleaner before the viscosity builds up.
Mud cleaner can effectively control weighted drilling fluid solid content. Prevent differential pressure sticking, adhesion stuck drill accident, reduce the drill string and the filter cake thickness on bond issues.

'''Nanopore sequencing''' is a third generation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Niedringhaus |first=Thomas P. |last2=Milanova |first2=Denitsa |last3=Kerby |first3=Matthew B. |last4=Snyder |first4=Michael P. |last5=Barron |first5=Annelise E. |date=2011-06-15 |title=Landscape of Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=83 |issue=12 |pages=4327–4341 |doi=10.1021/ac2010857 |pmc=3437308 |pmid=21612267}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach used in the [[sequencing]] of [[biopolymer]]s- specifically, [[polynucleotide]]s in the form of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]].

Using nanopore sequencing, a single molecule of DNA or RNA can be sequenced without the need for [[PCR]] amplification or chemical labeling of the sample.  At least one of these aforementioned steps is necessary in the procedure of any previously developed sequencing approach.  Nanopore sequencing has the potential to offer relatively low-cost [[genotyping]], high mobility for testing, and rapid processing of samples with the ability to display results in real-time. Publications on the method outline its use in rapid identification of viral pathogens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greninger |first1=Alexander L. |display-authors=etal |year=2015 |title=Rapid metagenomic identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples by real-time nanopore sequencing analysis |journal=Genome Medicine |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=99 |doi=10.1186/s13073-015-0220-9 |pmid=26416663 |pmc=4587849 |biorxiv=020420}}&lt;/ref&gt;  monitoring ebola,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/how-a-small-backpack-for-fast-genomic-sequencing-is-helping-combat-ebola-41863 |title=How a small backpack for fast genomic sequencing is helping combat Ebola |date=15 May 2015 |author=Nick Loman |work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt; environmental monitoring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tgac-tto031715.php |title=TGAC's take on the first portable DNA sequencing 'laboratory' |date=19 March 2015 |work=EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt; food safety monitoring, human genome sequencing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878 |title=nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878 |website=GitHub |access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; plant genome sequencing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.plabipd.de/portal/solanum-pennellii |title=Solanum pennellii (new cultivar) - PlabiPD |website=www.plabipd.de |access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; monitoring of [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cao |first1=Minh Duc |last2=Ganesamoorthy |first2=Devika |last3=Elliott |first3=Alysha G. |last4=Zhang |first4=Huihui |last5=Cooper |first5=Matthew A. |last6=Coin |first6=Lachlan J.M. |year=2016 |title=Streaming algorithms for identification of pathogens and antibiotic resistance potential from real-time MinIONTM sequencing |journal=GigaScience |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=32 |doi=10.1186/s13742-016-0137-2|pmid=27457073 |pmc=4960868 |biorxiv=019356}}&lt;/ref&gt; haplotyping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ammar |first1=Ron |last2=Paton |first2=Tara A. |last3=Torti |first3=Dax |last4=Shlien |first4=Adam |last5=Bader |first5=Gary D. |title=Long read nanopore sequencing for detection of HLA and CYP2D6 variants and haplotypes |journal=F1000Research |volume=4 |pages=17 |year=2015 |doi=10.12688/f1000research.6037.2|pmid=25901276 |pmc=4392832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other applications.

==Principles for detection and base identification==
Nanopore sequencing uses [[electrophoresis]] to transport an unknown sample through an [[Nanopore|orifice of 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; meters in diameter]].  A nanopore system always contains an [[Electrolyte|electrolytic]] solution- when a constant [[electric field]] is applied, an [[electric current]] can be observed in the system. The magnitude of the electric [[current density]] across a nanopore surface depends on the nanopore's dimensions and the composition of DNA or RNA that is occupying the nanopore.  Sequencing is made possible because, when close enough to nanopores, samples cause characteristic changes in electric current density across nanopore surfaces. The total charge flowing through a nanopore channel is equal to the surface integral of electric current density flux across the nanopore unit normal surfaces between times t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Types==
=== Biological ===
[[Image:AHL DNA.GIF|thumb|alpha-hemolysin pore (made up of 7 identical subunits in 7 colors) and 12-mer single-stranded DNA (in white) on the same scale to illustrate DNA effects on conductance when moving through a nanopore. Below is an orthogonal view of the same molecules.]]Biological nanopore sequencing relies on the use of transmembrane proteins, called [[Porin (protein)|porins]], that are embedded in [[Lipid bilayer|lipid membranes]] so as to create size dependent porous surfaces- with nanometer scale "holes" distributed across the membranes.  Sufficiently low translocation velocity can be attained through the incorporation of various proteins that facilitate the movement of DNA or RNA through the pores of the lipid membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zewen|last2=Wang|first2=Yifan|last3=Deng|first3=Tao|last4=Chen|first4=Qi|date=2016-05-30|title=Solid-State Nanopore-Based DNA Sequencing Technology|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2016/5284786/|journal=Journal of Nanomaterials|language=en|volume=2016|pages=1–13|doi=10.1155/2016/5284786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alpha hemolysin====
Alpha [[hemolysin]] (αHL), a nanopore from bacteria that causes lysis of red blood cells, has been studied for over 15 years.&lt;ref name="pmid8943010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kasianowicz|first= JJ|author2=Brandin E |author3=Branton D |author4=Deamer DW |title= Characterization of individual polynucleotide molecules using a membrane channel

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 106 | issue = 19| pages = 7702–7707 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0901054106 | pmid=19380741 | pmc=2683137| bibcode = 2009PNAS..106.7702S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adescrim"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Purnell | first1 = R | last2 = Mehta | first2 = K | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = J | date = 2008 | title = Nucleotide identification and orientation discrimination of DNA homopolymers immobilized in a protein nanopore | journal = Nano Letters | volume = 8 | issue = 9| pages = 3029–3034 | doi=10.1021/nl802312f | pmid=18698831| bibcode = 2008NanoL...8.3029P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of αHL is advantageous to identify specific bases moving through the pore. The αHL pore is ~10&amp;nbsp;nm long, with two distinct 5&amp;nbsp;nm sections. The upper section consists of a larger, vestibule-like structure and the lower section consists of three possible recognition sites (R1, R2, R3), and is able to discriminate between each base.&lt;ref name="anew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adescrim"/&gt;

Sequencing using αHL has been developed through basic study and structural mutations, moving towards the sequencing of very long reads. Protein mutation of αHL has improved the detection abilities of the pore.&lt;ref name="pmid19350039"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Clarke J|author2=  Wu HC|author3= Jayasinghe L|author4= Patel A|author5= Reid A|author6= Bayley H |title= Continuous base identification for single-molecule nanopore DNA sequencing |journal= Nature Nanotechnology|volume=4 |issue= 4 |pages=265–270 |date=2009 |pmid=19350039 |doi=10.1038/nnano.2009.12|url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v4/n4/full/nnano.2009.12.html|bibcode=  2009NatNa...4..265C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next proposed step is to bind an exonuclease onto the αHL pore. The enzyme would periodically cleave single bases, enabling the pore to identify successive bases. Coupling an exonuclease to the biological pore would slow the translocation of the DNA through the pore, and increase the accuracy of data acquisition.

Notably, theorists have shown that sequencing via exonuclease enzymes as described here is not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effects of diffusion on an exonuclease/nanopore-based DNA sequencing engine|journal = The Journal of Chemical Physics|date = 2012-12-07|pmc = 4108639|pmid = 23231259|page = 214903|volume = 137|issue = 21|doi = 10.1063/1.4766363|first = Joseph E.|last = Reiner|first2 = Arvind|last2 = Balijepalli|first3 = Joseph W. F.|last3 = Robertson|first4 = Bryon S.|last4 = Drown|first5 = Daniel L.|last5 = Burden|first6 = John J.|last6 = Kasianowicz|bibcode = 2012JChPh.137u4903R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly due to diffusion related effects imposing a limit on the capture probability of each nucleotide as it is cleaved. This results in a significant probability that a nucleotide is either not captured before it diffuses into the bulk or captured out of order, and therefore is not properly sequenced by the nanopore, leading to insertion and deletion errors. Therefore, major changes are needed to this method before it can be considered a viable strategy.

A recent study has pointed to the ability of αHL to detect nucleotides at two separate sites in the lower half of the pore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoddart | first1 = D | last2 = Maglia | first2 = G | last3 = Mikhailova | first3 = E | last4 = Heron | first4 = A | last5 = Bayley | first5 = H | date = 2010 | title = Multiple base-recognition sites in a biological nanopore: two heads are better than one | journal = Angew. Chem. | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 556–559 | doi=10.1002/anie.200905483 | pmid=20014084 | pmc=3128935}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R1 and R2 sites enable each base to be monitored twice as it moves through the pore, creating 16 different measurable ionic current values instead of 4.   This method improves upon the single read through the nanopore by doubling the sites that the sequence is read per nanopore.

====MspA====
[[MspA porin|Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A]] (MspA) is the second biological nanopore currently being investigated for DNA sequencing. The MspA pore has been identified as a potential improvement over αHL due to a more favorable structure.&lt;ref name="mnew"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manrao | first1 = E | last2 = Derrington | first2 = I | last3 = Pavlenok | first3 = M | last4 = Niederweis | first4 = M | last5 = Gundlach | first5 = J | date = 2011 | title = Nucleotide discrimination with DNA immobilized in the MspA nanopore | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | page = 10 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0025723| pmid = 21991340 | pmc = 3186796 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...625723M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pore is described as a goblet with a thick rim and a diameter of 1.2&amp;nbsp;nm at the bottom of the pore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faller | first1 = M | display-authors = etal   | date = 2004 | title = The structure of a mycobacterial outer-membrane channel | journal = Science | doi = 10.1126/science.1094114 | volume=303 | issue = 5661 | pages=1189–1192 | pmid=14976314| bibcode = 2004Sci...303.1189F }}&lt;/ref&gt; A natural MspA, while favorable for DNA sequencing because of shape and diameter, has a negative core that prohibited single stranded DNA(ssDNA) translocation. The natural nanopore was modified to improve translocation by replacing three negatively charged [[aspartic acid]]s with neutral asparagines.&lt;ref name="mold"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = TZ | last2 = Pavlenok | first2 = M | last3 = Derrington | first3 = I | last4 = Niederweis | first4 = M | last5 = Gundlach | first5 = J | date = 2008 | title = Single-molecule DNA detection with an engineered MspA protein nanopore | journal = Proc.

The electric current detection of nucleotides across the membrane has been shown to be tenfold more specific than αHL for identifying bases.&lt;ref name="mnew"/&gt;  Utilizing this improved specificity, a group at the University of Washington has proposed using [[DNA|double stranded DNA]] (dsDNA) between each single stranded molecule to hold the base in the reading section of the pore.&lt;ref name="mnew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mold"/&gt; The dsDNA would halt the base in the correct section of the pore and enable identification of the nucleotide. A recent grant has been awarded to a collaboration from UC Santa Cruz, the University of Washington, and Northeastern University to improve the base recognition of MspA using [[Φ29 DNA polymerase|phi29 polymerase]] in conjunction with the pore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/27545107|title=Advanced Sequencing Technology Awards 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solid state ===
Solid state nanopore sequencing approaches, unlike biological nanopore sequencing, do not incorporate proteins into their systems.  Instead, solid state nanopore technology uses various metal or metal alloy substrates with nanometer sized pores that allow DNA or RNA to pass through.  These substrates most often serve integral roles in the sequence recognition of nucleic acids as they translocate through the channels along the substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carson|first=Spencer|last2=Wanunu|first2=Meni|title=Challenges in DNA motion control and sequence readout using nanopore devices|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0957-4484/26/i=7/a=074004?key=crossref.008ad0e83f76419c6e79225e4f4075cd|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=26|issue=7|pages=074004|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/26/7/074004|pmc=4710574|pmid=25642629|year=2015|bibcode=2015Nanot..26g4004C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tunneling current====
[[File:Tunneling_Current_Method_in_Solid_State_Nanopore_Sequencing.svg|frame|Figure showing the theoretical movement of ssDNA through a tunneling current nanopore system.  Detection is made possible by the incorporation of electrodes along the nanopore channel walls- perpendicular to the ssDNA's velocity vector.]]
Measurement of electron tunneling through bases as ssDNA translocates through the nanopore is an improved solid state nanopore sequencing method. Most research has focused on proving bases could be determined using electron tunneling. These studies were conducted using a scanning probe microscope as the sensing electrode, and have proved that bases can be identified by specific tunneling currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = S | last2 = Huang | first2 = S | last3 = He | first3 = J | last4 = Liang | first4 = F | last5 = Zhang | first5 = P | last6 = Li | first6 = S | last7 = Chen | first7 = X | last8 = Sankey | first8 = O | last9 = Lindsay | first9 = S | date = 2010 | title = Electronic signatures of all four DNA nucleosides in a tunneling gap | journal = Nano Lett. | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 1070–1075 | doi=10.1021/nl1001185| pmid = 20141183 | pmc = 2836180 | bibcode = 2010NanoL..10.1070C }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the proof of principle research, a functional system must be created to couple the solid state pore and sensing devices. 
 
Researchers at the Harvard Nanopore group have engineered solid state pores with single walled carbon nanotubes across the diameter of the pore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sadki | first1 = ES | last2 = Garaj | first2 = S | last3 = Vlassarev | first3 = D | last4 = Golovchenko | first4 = JA | last5 = Branton | first5 = D | date = 2011 | title = Embedding a carbon nanotube across the diameter of a solid state nanopore | journal = J. Vac. Sci. Technol. | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | page = 5 | bibcode = 2011JVSTB..29e3001S | doi = 10.1116/1.3628602 | arxiv = 1308.1128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrays of pores are created and [[chemical vapor deposition]] is used to create nanotubes that grow across the array. Once a nanotube has grown across a pore, the diameter of the pore is adjusted to the desired size. Successful creation of a nanotube coupled with a pore is an important step towards identifying bases as the ssDNA translocates through the solid state pore.

Another method is the use of nanoelectrodes on either side of a pore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivanov | first1 = A | last2 = Instuli | first2 = E | last3 = McGilvery | first3 = C | last4 = Baldwin | first4 = G | last5 = McComb | first5 = D | last6 = Albrecht | first6 = T | last7 = Edel | first7 = J | date = 2011 | title = DNA tunneling detector embedded in a nanopore | journal = Nano Lett. | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 279–285 | doi=10.1021/nl103873a| pmid = 21133389 | pmc = 3020087 | bibcode = 2011NanoL..11..279I }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.upenn.edu/drndicgroup/dna-protein-analysis.html |title=Drndić Laboratory – University of Pennsylvania |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129020701/http://www.physics.upenn.edu/drndicgroup/dna-protein-analysis.html |archivedate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrodes are specifically created to enable a solid state nanopore's formation between the two electrodes. This technology could be used to not only sense the bases but to help control base translocation speed and orientation.

====Fluorescence====
An effective technique to determine a DNA sequence has been developed using solid state nanopores and [[fluorescence]].&lt;ref name="mmain"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNally | first1 = B | last2 = Singer | first2 = A | last3 = Yu | first3 = Z | last4 = Sun | first4 = Y | last5 = Weng | first5 = Z | last6 = Meller | first6 = A | date = 2010 | title = Optical recognition of converted DNA nucleotides for single molecule DNA sequencing using nanopore arrays | journal = Nano Lett. | volume = 10 | issue = 6| pages = 2237–2244 | doi=10.1021/nl1012147 | pmid=20459065 | pmc=2883017| bibcode = 2010NanoL..10.2237M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fluorescence sequencing method converts each base into a characteristic representation of multiple nucleotides which bind to a fluorescent probe strand-forming dsDNA. With the two color system proposed, each base is identified by two separate fluorescences, and will therefore be converted into two specific sequences. Probes consist of a [[fluorophore]] and quencher at the start and end of each sequence, respectively. Each fluorophore will be extinguished by the quencher at the end of the preceding sequence. When the dsDNA is translocating through a solid state nanopore, the probe strand will be stripped off, and the upstream fluorophore will fluoresce.&lt;ref name="mmain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Soni | first1 = G | last2 = Singer | first2 = A | last3 = Yu | first3 = Z | last4 = Sun | first4 = Y | last5 = McNally | first5 = B | last6 = Meller | first6 = A | date = 2010 | title = Synchronous optical and electrical detection of biomolecules traversing through solid-state nanopores | journal = Rev. Sci. Instrum. | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 014301–014301–7 | bibcode = 2010RScI...81a4301S | doi = 10.1063/1.3277116 | pmid = 20113116 | pmc = 2821415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sequencing method has a capacity of 50-250 bases per second per pore, and a four color fluorophore system (each base could be converted to one sequence instead of two), will sequence over 500 bases per second.&lt;ref name="mmain"/&gt; Advantages of this method are based on the clear sequencing readout—using a camera instead of noisy current methods. However, the method does require sample preparation to convert each base into an expanded binary code before sequencing. Instead of one base being identified as it translocates through the pore,  ~12 bases are required to find the sequence of one base.&lt;ref name="mmain"/&gt;

# &lt;small&gt;Dimensional Reproducibility:&amp;nbsp; The likelihood of a unit's pore to be made the proper size&lt;/small&gt;
# &lt;small&gt;Stress Tolerance: &amp;nbsp;The sensitivity of a unit to internal environmental conditions&lt;/small&gt;
# &lt;small&gt;Longevity: The length of time that a unit is expected to remain functioning&lt;/small&gt;
# &lt;small&gt;Ease of Fabrication:&amp;nbsp;The ability to produce a unit- usually in regards to mass-production&lt;/small&gt;

===  Biological: advantages and disadvantages ===
Biological nanopore sequencing systems have several fundamental characteristics that make them advantageous as compared with solid state systems- with each advantageous characteristic of this design approach stemming from the incorporation of proteins into their technology.  Uniform pore structure, the precise control of sample translocation through pore channels, and even the detection of individual nucleotides in samples can be facilitated by unique proteins from a variety of organism types.

The use of proteins in biological nanopore sequencing systems, despite the various benefits, also brings with it some negative characteristics.  The sensitivity of the proteins in these systems to local environmental stress has a large impact on the longevity of the units, overall.  One example is that a motor protein may only unzip samples with sufficient speed at a certain pH range while not operating fast enough outside of the range- this constraint impacts the functionality of the whole sequencing unit.  Another example is that a transmembrane porin may only operate reliably for a certain number of runs before it breaks down.  Both of these examples would have to be controlled for in the design of any viable biological nanopore system- something that may be difficult to achieve while keeping the costs of such a technology as low and as competitive, to other systems, as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zewen|last2=Wang|first2=Yifan|last3=Deng|first3=Tao|last4=Chen|first4=Qi|date=2016-05-30|title=Solid-State Nanopore-Based DNA Sequencing Technology|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2016/5284786/|journal=Journal of Nanomaterials|language=en|volume=2016|pages=1–13|doi=10.1155/2016/5284786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
One challenge for the 'strand sequencing' method was in refining the method to improve its resolution to be able to detect single bases. In the early papers methods, a nucleotide needed to be repeated in a sequence about 100 times successively in order to produce a measurable characteristic change. This low resolution is because the DNA strand moves rapidly at the rate of 1 to 5μs per base through the nanopore. This makes recording difficult and prone to background noise, failing in obtaining single-nucleotide resolution. The problem is being tackled by either improving the recording technology or by controlling the speed of DNA strand by various protein engineering strategies and Oxford Nanopore employs a 'kmer approach', analyzing more than one base at any one time so that stretches of DNA are subject to repeat interrogation as the strand moves through the nanopore one base at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bayley | first1 = Hagan | year = 2006 | title = Sequencing single molecules of DNA | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 6| pages = 628–637 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.10.040 | pmid = 17113816 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various techniques including algorithmic have been used to improve the performance of the MinION technology since it was first made available to users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loman|first=Nicholas J|last2=Watson|first2=Mick|date=2015|title=Successful test launch for nanopore sequencing|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3327|journal=Nature Methods|language=En|volume=12|issue=4|pages=303–304|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3327|pmid=25825834|issn=1548-7105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently effects of single bases due to secondary structure or released mononucleotides have been shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashkenas|first=N|author2=Sánchez-Quesada J |author3=Bayley H |author4=Ghadiri MR |title=Recognizing a single base in an individual DNA strand: a step toward DNA sequencing in nanopores|journal=Angew Chem Int ed Engl|date=2005-02-18|volume=44|issue=9|pages=1401–4|pmid=15666419|doi=10.1002/anie.200462114|pmc=1828035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winters-Hilt|first=S|author2=Vercoutere W |author3=DeGuzman VS |author4=Deamer D |author5=Akeson M |author6=Haussler D |title=Highly accurate classification of Watson-Crick basepairs on termini of single DNA molecules|journal=Biophys.

Professor Hagan Bayley proposed in 2010 that creating two recognition sites within an alpha hemolysin pore may confer advantages in base recognition.&lt;ref name="pmid=20014084"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stoddart D|author2=Maglia G|author3=Mikhailova E|author4=Heron A|author5=Bayley H |title= Multiple Base-Recognition Sites in a Biological Nanopore: Two Heads are Better than One |journal=Angew Chem Int ed Engl |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=556–9 |date=2010 |pmid=20014084 |doi=10.1002/anie.200905483|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123210758/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |pmc=3128935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One challenge for the 'exonuclease approach',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Astier|first=Y|author2=Braha O |author3=Bayley H |title=Toward single molecule DNA sequencing: direct identification of ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates by using an engineered protein nanopore equipped with a molecular adapter|journal=J Am Chem Soc|date=2006-02-08|volume=128|issue=5|pages=1705–10|pmid= 16448145|doi=10.1021/ja057123}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a processive enzyme feeds individual bases, in the correct order, into the nanopore, is to integrate the exonuclease and the nanopore detection systems. In particular,&lt;ref name="Rusk 244–245"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rusk|first=Nicole|title=Cheap Third-Generation Sequencing|journal=Nature Methods|date=2009-04-01|volume=6|issue=4|pages=244–245|doi=10.1038/nmeth0409-244a}}&lt;/ref&gt; the problem is that when an exonuclease hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in DNA, the subsequently released nucleotide is not necessarily guaranteed to directly move into, say, a nearby [[Hemolysin|alpha-hemolysin nanopore]]. One idea is to attach the exonuclease to the nanopore, perhaps through [[biotinylation]] to the [[beta barrel]] hemolysin.&lt;ref name="Rusk 244–245"/&gt; The central pore of the protein may be lined with charged residues arranged so that the positive and negative charges appear on opposite sides of the pore. However, this mechanism is primarily discriminatory and does not constitute a mechanism to guide nucleotides down some particular path.

==Commercialization==

[[Agilent| Agilent Laboratories]] was the first to license and develop nanopores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_May_21/ai_74803301|title=Agilent Laboratories, Harvard University Collaborate On Development of Breakthrough Technology for the Analysis of Nucleic Acids | work=Business Wire | date=2001-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not have any current disclosed research in the area.

[[File:Nora Stanton Blatch Barney 1921.jpg|thumb]]
'''Nora Stanton Blatch Barney''' (September 30, 1883 &amp;ndash; January 18, 1971) was an [[England|English]]-born [[United States|U.S.]] [[civil engineer]], [[architect]], and [[women's suffrage|suffragist]].  Barney was among the first women to graduate with an engineering degree in United States. She was the granddaughter of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life==
She was born Nora Stanton Blatch in [[Basingstoke]], [[Hampshire, England]] in 1883 to William Blatch and [[Harriot Eaton Stanton]], daughter of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]. She studied Latin and mathematics at the [[Horace Mann School]] in New York, beginning in 1897, returning to England in the summers. The family moved to the United States in 1902. Nora attended [[Cornell University]], graduating in 1905 with a degree in [[civil engineering]]. She was Cornell University's first female engineering graduate.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134386&amp;org=NSF] &lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE), and began work for the New York City Board of Water Supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nora Stanton Blatch Barney profile|author=Danuta Bois|work=Distinguished Women of Past and Present|url=http://www.distinguishedwomen.com/bio.php?womanid=1014|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Nora Stanton Blatch profile|work=IEEE Global History Network|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Nora_Stanton_Blatch|accessdate= 2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked for the [[American Bridge Company]] in 1905–06. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nora-Stanton-Blatch-Barney &lt;/ref&gt;

Following the examples set by her mother and grandmother, Nora also became active in the growing women's suffrage movement. She was the first female member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, where she was allowed to be a junior member only and denied advancement to associate member in 1916 solely because of her gender. At the time, women were only admitted as junior members. In 1916, she sued the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) for refusing to admit her as a full member, even though she met all requirements.  Blatch lost, and no woman became a full ASCE member for a decade. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134386&amp;org=NSF] &lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, she  was posthumously advanced to ASCE Fellow status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= ASCE Recognizes Stanton Blatch Barney; Pioneering Civil Engineer, Suffragist|work=ASCE News|url=http://blogs.asce.org/asce-recognizes-stanton-blatch-barney-pioneering-civil-engineer-suffragist|accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage to Lee De Forest==
In 1908, she married the inventor [[Lee de Forest]], and helped to manage some of the companies he had founded to promote his invention and the new technology of wireless (radio). The couple spent their honeymoon in Europe marketing radio equipment developed by de Forest. However, the couple separated only a year later, due largely to de Forest's insistence that Nora quit her profession and become a conventional housewife. Shortly afterward, in June 1909, Nora gave birth to their daughter, Harriot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harriet de Forest Engaged To Marry. Daughter Of Mrs. Morgan Barney Is Betrothed To Marshall C.

==Later life==
In 1919, Nora married Morgan Barney, a marine architect.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Their daughter, Rhoda Barney Jenkins, born July 12, 1920, in New York, was an [[architect]] and [[social activist]]. Nora continued to work for equal rights for women and world peace, and in 1944 authored ''World Peace Through a People's Parliament''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nora Stanton Blatch Barney profile|work=Distinguished Women of Past and Present|url=http://www.distinguishedwomen.com/bio.php?womanid=1014|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeep Odometer.jpg|thumb|right|An electronic odometer (below) with digital display]]
An '''odometer''' or '''odograph'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/256927?redirectedFrom=odograph# |title=Oxford English Dictionary (online):'&amp;#39;odograph'&amp;#39; |publisher=Oed.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/odograph |title=American Heritage Dictionary (online: Dictionary.com): '&amp;#39;odograph'&amp;#39; |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an instrument used for measuring the [[distance]] travelled by a vehicle, such as a bicycle or car. The device may be electronic, mechanical, or a combination of the two. The noun derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word οδόμετρο from ''odós'', οδός ("path" or "gateway") and ''métro'', μέτρο ("measure"). Early forms of the odometer existed in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]] as well as [[ancient China]]. In countries where [[Imperial units]] or [[US customary units]] are used, it is sometimes called a '''mileometer''' or '''milometer''', the former name especially being prevalent in the [[United Kingdom]] and members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]{{dubious|date=July 2017}}.

== History ==
{{for|a detailed list of the recorded distances by Alexander's bematists|Bematist}}
===Classical Era===
[[File:Hero's odometer, 1st century AD, Alexandria (reconstruction).jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero]]'s odometer, 1st century AD, Alexandria, [[Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum]]]]
Possibly the first evidence for the use of an odometer can be found in the works of the ancient Roman [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (NH 6. 61-62) and the ancient Greek [[Strabo]] (11.8.9). Both authors list the distances of routes traveled by [[Alexander the Great]] (r. 336-323 BC) as by his [[bematist]]s Diognetus and Baeton. However, the high accuracy of the bematists's measurements rather indicates the use of a mechanical device. For example, the section between the cities Hecatompylos and Alexandria Areion, which later became a part of the [[silk road]], was given by Alexander's bematists as 529 [[Mile|English miles]] long, that is with a deviation of 0.2% from the actual distance (531 English miles). From the nine surviving bematists' measurements in Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' eight show a deviation of less than 5% from the actual distance, three of them being within 1%. Since these minor discrepancies can be adequately explained by slight changes in the tracks of roads during the last 2300 years, the overall accuracy of the measurements implies that the bematists already must have used a sophisticated device for measuring distances, although there is no direct mention of such a device.

An odometer for measuring distance was first described by [[Vitruvius]] around 27 and 23 BC, although the actual inventor may have been [[Archimedes of Syracuse]] (c. 287 BC – c. 212 BC) during the [[First Punic War]]. [[Hero of Alexandria]] (10 AD - 70 AD) describes a similar device in chapter 34 of his ''[[Dioptra]]''. The machine was also used in the time of Roman Emperor [[Commodus]] (c. 192 AD), although after this point in time there seems to be a gap between its use in Roman times and that of the 15th century in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 285"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some researchers have speculated that the device might have included technology similar to that of the Greek [[Antikythera mechanism]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated188"&gt;Sleeswyk, Andre, ''Vitruvius' odometer'', Scientific American, vol. 252, no. 4, pages 188-200 (October 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The odometer of Vitruvius was based on chariot wheels of 4 feet (1.2 m) diameter turning 400 times in one Roman [[mile]] (about 1400 m). For each revolution a pin on the axle engaged a 400 tooth cogwheel thus turning it one complete revolution per mile. This engaged another gear with holes along the circumference, where pebbles (''[[calculus]]'') were located, that were to drop one by one into a box. The distance traveled would thus be given simply by counting the number of pebbles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated188" /&gt;  Whether this instrument was ever built at the time is disputed. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] later tried to build it himself according to the description, but failed.  However, in 1981 engineer Andre Sleeswyk built his own replica, replacing the square-toothed gear designs of da Vinci with the triangular, pointed teeth found in the ''Antikythera mechanism''.  With this modification, the Vitruvius odometer functioned perfectly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated188" /&gt;

===Imperial China===
[[File:Han dynasty odometer cart.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Han Dynasty]] stone rubbing of a horse-drawn odometer cart.]]
====Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms period====
The odometer was also independently invented in [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient China]], possibly by the prolific inventor and early scientist [[Zhang Heng]] (78 AD – 139 AD) of the [[Han Dynasty]]. By the 3rd century (during the [[Three Kingdoms]] Period), the Chinese had termed the device as the 'jì lĭ gŭ chē' (記里鼓車), or '[[li (unit)|li]]-recording drum carriage' (Note: the modern measurement of li = 500 m/1640&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 281"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese texts of the 3rd century tell of the mechanical carriage's functions, and as one li is traversed, a mechanical-driven wooden figure strikes a drum, and when ten li is traversed, another wooden figure would strike a gong or a bell with its mechanical-operated arm.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 281" /&gt;

Despite its association with Zhang Heng or even the later [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200&amp;ndash;265), there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered around the ''huang men'' court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) that would follow the musical procession of the royal 'drum-chariot'.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 283"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Joseph Needham]] asserts that it is no surprise this social group would have been responsible for such a device, since there is already other evidence of their craftsmenship with mechanical toys to delight the emperor and the court. There is speculation that some time in the 1st century BC (during the Western Han Dynasty), the beating of drums and gongs were mechanically-driven by working automatically off the rotation of the road-wheels.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 283" /&gt; This might have actually been the design of one Loxia Hong (c. 110 BC), yet by 125 AD the mechanical odometer carriage in China was already known (depicted in a mural of the [[Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine|Xiaotangshan Tomb]]).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 283" /&gt;

The odometer was used also in subsequent periods of Chinese history. In the historical text of the ''[[Book of Jin|Jin Shu]]'' (635 AD), the oldest part of the compiled text, the book known as the ''Cui Bao'' (c. 300 AD), recorded the use of the odometer, providing description (attributing it to the Western Han era, from 202 BC–9 AD).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 282"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage in the ''Jin Shu'' expanded upon this, explaining that it took a similar form to the mechanical device of the [[south-pointing chariot]] invented by [[Ma Jun]] (200–265, see also [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gear). As recorded in the ''[[History of Song|Song Shi]]'' of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), the odometer and south-pointing chariot were combined into one wheeled device by engineers of the 9th century, 11th century, and 12th century. The ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' (Master Sun's Mathematical Manual), dated from the 3rd century to 5th century, presented a mathematical problem for students involving the odometer. It involved a given distance between two cities, the small distance needed for one rotation of the carriage's wheel, and the posed question of how many rotations the wheels would have in all if the carriage was to travel between point A and B.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 282" /&gt;

====Song Dynasty====
The historical text of the ''[[History of Song|Song Shi]]'' (1345 AD), recording the people and events of the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), also mentioned the odometer used in that period. However, unlike written sources of earlier periods, it provided a much more thoroughly detailed description of the device that harkens back to its ancient form ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The odometer. [The mile-measuring carriage] is painted red, with pictures of flowers and birds on the four sides, and constructed in two storeys, handsomely adorned with carvings. At the completion of every li, the wooden figure of a man in the lower storey strikes a drum; at the completion of every ten li, the wooden figure in the upper storey strikes a bell. The carriage-pole ends in a phoenix-head, and the carriage is drawn by four horses. The escort was formerly of 18 men, but in the 4th year of the Yung-Hsi reign-period (987 AD) [[Emperor Taizong of Song|the emperor Thai Tsung]] increased it to 30. In the 5th year of the Thien-Sheng reign-period (1027 AD) the Chief Chamberlain Lu Tao-lung presented specifications for the construction of odometers as follows:&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 283" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What follows is a long dissertation made by the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong on the ranging measurements and sizes of wheels and gears, along with a concluding description at the end of how the device ultimately functions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vehicle should have a single pole and two wheels. On the body are two storeys, each containing a carved wooden figure holding a drumstick. The road-wheels are each 6 ft in diameter, and 18 ft in circumference, one evolution covering 3 paces. According to ancient standards the pace was equal to 6 ft and 300 paces to a li; but now the li is reckoned as 360 paces of 5 ft each.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 283" /&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[Note: the measurement of the Chinese-mile unit, the li, was changed over time, as the li in Song times differed from the length of a li in Han times.]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vehicle wheel (li lun) is attached to the left road-wheel; it has a diameter of 1.38 ft with a circumference of 4.14 ft, and has 18 cogs (chhih) 2.3 inches apart. There is also a lower horizontal wheel (hsia phing lun), of diameter 4.14 ft and circumference 12.42 ft, with 54 cogs, the same distance apart as those on the vertical wheel (2.3 inches). (This engages with the former.) &lt;ref name="needham volume 4 283" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Upon a vertical shaft turning with this wheel, there is fixed a bronze "turning-like-the-wind wheel" (hsuan feng lun) which has (only) 3 cogs, the distance between these being 1.2 inches. (This turns the following one.) In the middle is a horizontal wheel, 4 ft in diameter, and 12 ft circumference, with 100 cogs, the distance between these cogs being the same as on the "turning-like-the-wind wheel" (1.2 inches).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 284"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 284.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Next, there is fixed (on the same shaft) a small horizontal wheel (hsiao phing lun) 3.3 inches in diameter and 1 ft in circumference, having 10 cogs 1.5 inches apart. (Engaging with this) there is an upper horizontal wheel (shang phing lun) having a diameter of 3.3 ft and a circumference of 10 ft, with 100 cogs, the same distance apart as those of the small horizontal wheel (1.5 inches).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 284" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the middle horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 1 li and the wooden figure in the lower story will strike the drum. When the upper horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 10 li and the figure in the upper storey will strike the bell. The number of wheels used, great and small, is 8 inches in all, with a total of 285 teeth. Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain, the "dog-teeth" mutually engaging with each other, so that by due revolution everything comes back to its original starting point (ti hsiang kou so, chhuan ya hsiang chih, chou erh fu shih).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 284" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
[[File:Hubodometer on a wheel of a semitrailer.jpg|thumb|A [[Hubodometer]] on a wheel of a semitrailer]]
[[File:Smiths speedo.jpg|thumb|right|A Smiths speedometer from the 1920s showing odometer and trip meter.]]
Odometers were first developed in the 1600s for wagons and other horse-drawn vehicles in order to measure distances traveled.

[[Levinus Hulsius]] published the odometer in 1604 in his work ''Gründtliche Beschreibung deß Diensthafften und Nutzbahrn Instruments Viatorii oder Wegzählers, So zu Fuß, zu Pferdt unnd zu Fußen gebraucht werden kann, damit mit geringer mühe zu wissen, wie weit man gegangen, geritten, oder gefahren sey: als auch zu erfahren, ohne messen oder zehlen, wie weit von einem Orth zum andern. Daneben wird auch der grosse verborgene Wegweiser angezeiget und vermeldet''.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit. Vol. 2: Vom Compendium zum Einzelinstrument. Cologne, 2010. p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1645, the French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] invented the ''[[pascaline]]''. Though not an odometer, the ''pascaline'' utilized gears to compute measurements.  Each gear contained 10 teeth.  The first gear advanced the next gear one position when moved one complete revolution, the same principle employed on modern mechanical odometers.

Odometers were developed for ships in 1698 with the odometer invented by the Englishman [[Thomas Savery]].  [[Benjamin Franklin]], U.S. statesman and the first [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]], built a prototype odometer in 1775 that he attached to his carriage to help measure the [[Distance|mileage]] of postal routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learn.fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html|title=Benjamin Franklin and His Inventions|publisher=[[Franklin Institute]]|accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1847, [[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]], a Mormon pioneer, invented the ''Roadometer'', which he attached to a wagon used by American settlers heading west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mary bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_Odometer.htm |title=The History of the Odometer |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Roadometer'' recorded the distance traveled each day by the [[wagon trains]].   The Roadometer used two gears and was an early example of an odometer with pascaline-style gears in actual use.

In 1895, Curtis Hussey Veeder invented the ''Cyclometer''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Horseless Age'', New York: The Horseless Age Company, Volume 40, No. 1, (1917), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Cyclometer'' was a mechanical device that counted the number of rotations of a bicycle wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Veeder-Root, Inc., ''[http://www.veeder.com/page/vr_history Veeder Root History]''&lt;/ref&gt;  A flexible cable transmitted the number of rotations of the wheel to an analog odometer visible to the rider, which converted the wheel rotations into the number of miles traveled according to a predetermined formula.

In 1903 [[Arthur Pratt Warner|Arthur P.]] and Charles H. Warner, two brothers from Beloit, Wisconsin, introduced their patented ''Auto-meter''.  The ''Auto-Meter'' used a magnet attached to a rotating shaft to induce a magnetic pull upon a thin metal disk.  Measuring this pull provided accurate measurements of both distance and speed information to automobile drivers in a single instrument.  The Warners sold their company in 1912 to the Stewart &amp; Clark Company of Chicago.  The new firm was renamed the Stewart-Warner Corporation. By 1925, Stewart-Warner odometers and trip meters were standard equipment on the vast majority of automobiles and motorcycles manufactured in the United States.

By the early 2000s, mechanical odometers would be phased out on cars from major manufacturers. The [[Pontiac Grand Prix#Sixth generation .281997.E2.80.932003.29|Pontiac Grand Prix]] was the last GM car sold in the US to offer a mechanical odometer in 2003, the Canadian-built [[Ford Crown Victoria#Second generation .281998.E2.80.932012.29|Ford Crown Victoria]] and [[Mercury Grand Marquis#Fourth generation .282003.E2.80.932011.29|Mercury Grand Marquis]] were the very last Fords sold with one in 2005. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Whilst an odometer is used to record distance (units can vary, usually between miles and kilometres), a mileometer specifically records only in miles. The equivalent used to record kilometres is sometimes referred to as a "kilometreometer".

==Trip meters==
[[File:Odometer rollover.jpg|thumb|right|After reaching the maximum reading, an odometer or trip meter restarts from zero, called odometer rollover.  Digital odometers may not rollover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vorano|first1=Neil|title=How a Toronto-area Corolla is driven beyond 999,999 kilometres|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/how-a-toronto-area-corolla-is-driven-to-999999-kilometres/article23831205/|accessdate=10 April 2015|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Most modern cars include a '''trip meter''' ('''trip odometer'''). Unlike the odometer, a trip meter is reset at any point in a journey, making it possible to record the distance traveled in any particular journey or part of a journey. It was traditionally a purely mechanical device but, in most modern vehicles, it is now electronic. Luxury vehicles often have multiple trip meters. Most trip meters will show a maximum value of 999.9. The trip meter may be used to record the distance traveled on each tank of fuel, making it very easy to accurately track the energy efficiency of the vehicle; another common use is resetting it to zero at each instruction in a sequence of driving directions, to be sure when one has arrived at the next turn.

==Clocking/busting miles and legality==
{{main|Odometer fraud}}
A form of [[fraud]] is to tamper with the reading on an mileometer/odometer and presenting the incorrect number of miles/kilometers traveled to a prospective buyer; this is often referred to as "'''clocking'''" in the UK and "'''Busting miles'''" in the US. This is done to make a car appear to have been driven less than it really has been, and thus increase its apparent market value. Most &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/10782517/Car-clocking-on-the-increase.html|title=Car clocking on the increase|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; new cars sold today use [[Digital data|digital]] odometers that store the mileage in the vehicle's engine control module making it difficult (but not impossible) to manipulate the mileage electronically. With mechanical odometers, the [[speedometer]] can be removed from the car dashboard and the digits wound back, or the drive cable can be disconnected and connected to another odometer/speedometer pair while on the road. Older vehicles can be driven in reverse to subtract mileage, a property that provides the premise for a classic scene late in the comedy film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', but modern odometers add mileage driven in reverse to the total as if driven forward, thereby accurately reflecting the true total wear and tear on the vehicle.

The resale value of a vehicle is often strongly influenced by the total distance shown on the odometer, yet odometers are inherently insecure because they are under the control of their owners. Many jurisdictions have chosen to enact laws which penalize people who are found to commit [[odometer fraud]]. In the US (and many other countries), vehicle mechanics are also required to keep records of the odometer any time a vehicle is serviced. Companies such as [[Carfax (company)|Carfax]] then use these data to help potential car buyers detect whether odometer rollback has occurred.

===Prevalence===
Research by [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] vehicle check specialist [[Cartell]] found that 20% of vehicles imported to Ireland from [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]] had had their mileometers altered to show a lower mileage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/TRS/2010/06/16/00003.asp Road Traffic Bill 2009 debate, minutes of 16 June 2010 session]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accuracy ==
Most odometers work by counting wheel rotations and assume that the distance traveled is the number of wheel rotations times the tire circumference, which is a standard tire diameter times [[pi]] (3.1416).  If nonstandard or severely worn or underinflated tires are used then this will cause some error in the odometer.  The formula is (actual distance traveled) = ( (final odometer reading) - (initial odometer reading) ) * (actual tire diameter) / (standard tire diameter).  It is common for odometers to be off by several percent. {{citation needed|reason=a reliable source is needed to validate this claim.  also useful would be an indication of range of variation typically encountered.|date=July 2016}}  Odometer errors are typically proportional to [[Speedometer#Error|speedometer errors]].

[[File:Trondheim - monument 01.jpg|thumb|200 px|The statue of Olav Tryggvason]]

A '''statue of [[Olav Tryggvason]]'''  is located in [[Trondheim]], Norway. Sculpted by sculptor [[Wilhelm Rasmussen]], it honors King [[Olav Tryggvason]] who was the city's 's founder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitnorway.com/us/product/?pid=119266 ''Olav Tryggvason statue'' (visittrondheim.no)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18-metre (58-foot) high statue is  mounted on top of an obelisk. It stands at the center of the city square (''Torvet i Trondheim'')  at the intersection of the two main streets, Munkegata and Kongens gate.  The statue was unveiled in 1921. Around the statue base is a cobblestone mosaic, dating from 1930, which forms a gigantic [[sun dial]] . The sun dial is calibrated to [[UTC]]+1, meaning that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Trondheim_torv Knut A Rosvold: ''Trondheim torv'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3549">'''Operation Midnight Climax''' was an operation initially established by [[Sidney Gottlieb]] and placed under the direction of [[Federal Narcotics Bureau]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts with the officer [[George Hunter White]] under the [[pseudonym]] of Morgan Hall for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] as a sub-project of [[Project MKULTRA]], the CIA mind-control research program that began in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ornes|first=Stephen|title=Whatever Happened To... Mind Control?|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2008/aug/04-whatever-happened-to-mind-control|work=Discover Magazine|accessdate=2 February 2012|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the programs were shut down, hundreds of scientists would work on them.

==History==
The project consisted of a web of CIA-run [[safehouse]]s in [[San Francisco]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]], and [[New York City]]. It was established in order to study the effects of [[LSD]] on [[consent|unconsenting]] individuals. [[Prostitutes]] on the CIA payroll were instructed to lure clients back to the safehouses, where they were surreptitiously plied with a wide range of substances, including [[LSD]], and monitored behind [[one-way glass]]. Every one of these acts was blatantly illegal, but several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexual [[blackmail]], surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.&lt;ref name="Kamiya"&gt;Gary Kamiya, [http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/When-the-CIA-ran-a-LSD-sex-house-in-San-Francisco-7223346.php When the CIA ran a LSD sex-house in San Francisco], (April 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Operation Midnight Climax soon expanded and CIA operatives began dosing people in restaurants, bars and beaches.&lt;ref name="Kamiya" /&gt;

The safehouses were dramatically scaled back in 1963, following a report by CIA Inspector General John Earman that strongly recommended closing the facility. The [[San Francisco]] safehouses were closed in 1965, and the [[New York City]] safehouse soon followed in 1966.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 1974, the journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] exposed the CIA’s illegal spying on U.S. citizens and how the CIA had conducted non-consensual drug experiments. His report started the lengthy process of bringing long-suppressed details about MK-Ultra to light.&lt;ref name="Kamiya" /&gt; Project MKULTRA came to light in the spring of 1977 during a wide-ranging survey of the CIA's technical services division.

==History==
Computer art started in 1960s and by its nature is evolutionary since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible. The term ''pixel art'' was first published by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal, "ACM president's letter: Pixel Art", ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 25, Issue 12, Dec. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Systems]], founded in 1982, developed the Postscript language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"/&gt; [[Adobe Illustrator]], a vector drawing program based on the [[Bezier curve]], was introduced in 1987 and [[Adobe Photoshop]] followed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"&gt;Wands, Bruce. (2006) Art of the Digital Age, Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-23817-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Flash]], a popular set of [[multimedia]] software used to add [[animation]] and [[interactivity]] to web pages, was introduced in 1996.

In the 2000s, pixel artists have been employed increasingly in video games and, to a lesser extent in music videos. These artists have remained somewhat underground until the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="Art, One Click at a Time"&gt;{{cite web

In [[digital imaging]], a pixel (''pict''ure ''el''ement) is the smallest piece of information in an image.&lt;ref name="Modern Dictionary of Electronics"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Rudolf F.

[[Neuroplasticity]] is a key element of observing many pixel images.  While two individuals will observe the same photons reflecting off a photorealistic image and hitting their [[retina]]s, someone whose mind has been primed with the theory of pointillism may ''see'' a very different image as the image is interpreted in the [[visual cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Techniques==
[[File:Plaque rue du Cirque à Paris.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Pixel art outside the virtual domain using mosaic tiles by [[Invader (artist)|Invader]]]]
[[File:ReconstructionsFromPixels.png|right|frame|A pixel does not need to be rendered as a small square.  This image shows alternative ways of reconstructing an image from a set of pixel values, using dots, lines, or smooth filtering.]]

The total number of pixels (''[[image resolution]]''), and the amount of information in each pixel (often called ''[[color depth]]'') determine the quality of an image.  For example, an image that stores 24 bits of color-information per pixel (the standard for computer displays since around 1995) can represent smoother degrees of shading than one that only stores 16 bits per pixel, but not as smooth as one that stores 48 bits.  Likewise, an image [[sample (graphics)|sample]]d at 640 x 480 pixels (and therefore containing 307,200 pixels) will look rough and blocky compared to one sampled at 1280 x 1024 (1,310,720 pixels). Because it takes a large amount of data to store a high-quality image, computer software often uses [[data compression]] techniques to reduce this size for images stored on disk. Some techniques sacrifice information, and therefore image quality, in order to achieve a smaller file-size. Computer scientists refer to [[image compression|compression techniques]] that lose information as [[lossy compression]].

Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 [[pixels per inch]] (PPI), and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 [[dots per inch]] (DPI) or more; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties, since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor.  Typically, a resolution of 150 to 300 pixel per inch works well for 4-color process ([[CMYK]]) printing.
Drawings usually start with what is called the [[line art]], which is the basic line that defines the item the artist intends to create. Line arts can be either traced over [[image scanner|scanned]] drawings or hand drawn on the computer itself by the use of a [[Computer mouse|mouse]] or a [[graphics tablet]] and are often shared among other pixel artists in diverse websites in order to receive some feedback. Other techniques, some resembling [[painting]], also exist, such as knowledge of the [[color theory]]. The limited palette often implemented into [[pixel art]] usually promotes the use of [[dithering]] in order to achieve different shades and colors (when necessary); hand-made [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] is also used for smoother purposes. A pixel artist will exponentially increase the zoom of whatever they are working on to make adjustments as needed and then view the results until desired changes are achieved.&lt;ref name="Flash Enabled: Fl"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">The '''Real-time Neutron Monitor Database''' (or NMDB) is a worldwide network of standardized neutron monitors, used to record variations of the primary [[cosmic ray]]s. The measurements complement space-based cosmic ray measurements.

Unlike data from satellite experiments,  neutron monitor data has never been available in high resolution from many stations in real-time. The data is often only available from the individual stations website, in varying formats, and not in real-time. To overcome this deficit, the [[European Commission]] is supporting the Real-time Neutron Monitor Database (NMDB) as an e-Infrastructures project in the [[Seventh Framework Programme]] in the Capacities section. Stations that do not have 1-minute resolution will be supported by the development of an affordable standard registration system that will submit the measurements to the database via the internet in real-time. This resolves the problem of different data formats and for the first time allows to use real-time cosmic ray measurements for space weather predictions ([[Steigies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steigies |first=C. |year=2009 |title=NMDB: towards a global neutron monitor database |journal=[[American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting]] |bibcode = 2009AGUFMSH51B1280S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klein et al.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=K.

Besides creating a database and developing applications working with this data, a part of the project is dedicated to create a public outreach website to inform about cosmic rays and possible effects on humans, technological systems, and the environment ([[Mavromichalaki et al.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mavromichalaki |first=H. | year=2011 |title=Applications and usage of the real-time Neutron Monitor Database |journal=[[Advances in Space Research]] | doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2010.02.019 | bibcode = 2011AdSpR..47.2210M }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

, [[Finland]]. His inventions had over 50 patents.

==History==
Sakari Pinomäki's first company, PIKA Forest Machines, is credited with designing the first self-propelled tree length timber processor, the PIKA Model 60, in 1968, and the first fully mobile timber "[[Harvester (forestry)|harvester]]", the PIKA Model 75, in 1974. These machines differed significantly from other "retro-fitted" forestry machines in that they were designed from inception to be timber harvesting and processing equipment, and were not conventional farming or earth moving equipment with additional apparatus welded onto them to allow timber processing work to be possible. Pinomäki coined the term "harvester" to describe his Model 75 machine, which differs from a tree length processor in that a harvester grips, fells, de-limbs and sections the tree on site, while a processor simply de-limbs a tree that has been felled by chain saws and dragged to the delimbing equipment. His designs and innovations have been subsequently copied by at least five other major manufacturers of heavy timber equipment, including [[Timberjack]], [[Valmet]] and [[Ponsse]], and were instrumental in developing the "[[Scandinavia]]n" system of timber harvesting, which is far more sustainable and nature conserving than the methods employed up till the mid-20th century. The two machine harvester-forwarder system consequently became the worldwide standard for sustainable forestry.

One of the most significant of PIKA's inventions has been the Paralcon [[Hydraulic]] valve system that can be used on any twin boom extending-retracting [[Crane (machine)|crane]]. This valve uses return oil flow pressure to power the extension piston, and flow oil pressure to power the retraction movement of the crane, as opposed to standard configurations that use additional pumps to power these crane movements. The result is that far less motor [[torque]] is necessary to operate the crane, which consumes far less fuel; this in turn saves operators money and reduces [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions for the machinery in use.

Additionally, S. Pinomäki Ky PIKA was first to market in the early 21st century with the world's first production "Combination" machine, a single machine that can function in both harvester and forwarder roles.  This 50 percent reduction in machinery to perform the same harvesting work means far less environmental pollution from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and terrain damage from machinery operation, and has again be co-opted by every major manufacturer of heavy timber processing equipment.

Sakari died on July 29, 2011 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He is survived by his two daughters and three grandchildren.

[[File:Making Shaker brooms.jpg|thumb|Making Shaker brooms]]

The '''Shaker broom vise''' is a specialized production [[vise]] that made the normally round [[broom]] flat to make it more efficient for cleaning purposes.  The [[Shakers]]' invention revolutionized the production and form of brooms; in the process creating a whole new industry in [[New England]].

== Background ==

Shaker brooms built upon the 1797 contribution of [[Levi Dickenson]] of [[Hadley, Massachusetts]] who used tassels of [[sorghum]] (Sorghum vulgare), known as [[broom corn]], to make a better grade of broom.  Brooms were essential to [[kitchen]] and [[hearth]] cleanliness.{{sfn|Olney}}  The manufacture and selling of brooms was the most widespread of all the Shaker industries. The first sorghum brooms were made by the [[Watervliet Shaker Historic District|Shakers at Watervliet]].{{sfn|Andrews|Andrews|1974|page=87}} This colony is credited with being the first to grow broom corn, which was around 1800 when they first grew it on an island in the [[Mohawk River]] that was near their community.{{sfn|Miller|2007|page=132}}

== Invention of the vise ==
Theodore Bates (1762–1846) of the Watervliet Shaker community is credited with the innovation of the "flat broom" in 1798, as all brooms and brushes prior were round.{{sfn|Andrews|Andrews|1974|page=87}}{{sfn|Snodgrass|2004|page=889}} He invented a unique wooden vise that pressed the round bristles flat.{{sfn|Miller|2007|page=132}} This allowed heavy twine to be sewed through the flattened broom to permanently hold that shape.{{sfn|Miller|2007|page=132}}  

Bates' vise idea to make flat brooms and brushes was a leap in technology since it produced products that worked much more efficiently. An industry developed to sell these to the outside world. Soon the [[New Lebanon, New York|New Lebanon]] community ramped up to make these flat brooms. This flattening technology worked well with their woodworking technology of lathe-turned wood handles.  The vise was used as part of the Shaker broom making process.{{sfn|Miller|2007|page=132}}

Most of the Shaker villages were involved in making these flat brooms and flat brushes.{{sfn|Andrews|Andrews|1974|page=87}} The flat brooms were produced by the tens of thousands.{{sfn|Miller|2007|page=132}} Only a few of the original Shaker flat brooms made in the nineteenth century have survived into the twenty-first century. These were made under the auspices of a [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society|Mount Lebanon Shaker]] Trustee named Robert Valentine (1822–1910).{{sfn|Miller|2007|page=132}}

The Shakers were the pioneering inventors of the broom vise, which made today's flat broom possible.  According to {{harvtxt|Lowder|2012}} this was “the only major update to the broom since the introduction of the broom machine” and permitted flattening and sewing, instead of mere lashing to a round handle. This design innovation is evidenced in modern brooms (assuming they are not synthetic).{{sfn|Lowder|2012}}{{sfn|Haydenville|2015}}

The brooms were respected and given care – such as hanging on the wall when not in use and sometimes covered with cotton hoods to keep them clean.{{sfn|Snodgrass|2004|page=889}} The covered flat brooms were used to dry-polish hard wood floors and clean the last traces of dust off hard surfaces.{{sfn|Andrews|Andrews|1974|page=87}}

The flat broom led to a boom of broom making in the United States.  In 1850, more than a million brooms were built in Massachusetts alone, resulting in a large export trade extending to South America.{{sfn|Lowder|2012}}{{efn-ua|The Shakers also created the smaller [[whisk broom]].{{sfn|Lowder|2012}} }}

== Description of the vise ==
The vise consists of two upright planks, one rigidly fixed to the base and the other hinged via a pair of short distance pieces.  This can be clearly seen in the small vise on the left of the illustration "Making Shaker brooms".  The handle of the broom can pass between the distance pieces, the length of the handle imposing a minimum size on the fixed upright.  Larger vises may have the movable jaw hinged at the base and do away with the distance pieces, see the illustration "Shaker broom vises".

Illustrations on {{harvtxt|Haydenville|2015}} show that there are two sets of jaws affixed to the planks.  The lower set are level with the top of the planks and are circular when closed to firmly grip the head of the broom.  Metal plates rising from the planks carry the upper set which are flat and force the broom corn flat.  The jaws are closed by a toggle mechanism operating on horizontal links from the fixed jaw and vertical hanger links from the floor.  The toggle is provided with a long wooden handle which the operator can pull down to secure the broom in the vise.{{sfn|Haydenville|2015}}

A smart battery charger is mainly a [[Switched-mode power supply|switch mode power supply]] (also known as high frequency charger) that has the ability to communicate with a [[smart battery pack]]'s [[battery management system]] (BMS) in order to control and monitor the charging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-smart-battery-charger.htm | title = wisegeek.com: What Is a Smart Battery Charger? | quote="...the smart batteries contain special microchips that are programmed to communicate with a smart battery charger of the same brand..." | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140418091928/http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-smart-battery-charger.htm | archivedate = 2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This communication may be by a standard bus such as [[CAN bus]] in automobiles or [[System Management Bus]] (SMBus) in computers. The charge process is controlled by the BMS and not by the charger, thus increasing security in the system. Not all chargers have this type of communication which is commonly used for lithium batteries. 

Besides the usual plus (positive) and minus (negative) terminals, a smart battery charger also has multiple terminals to connect to the smart battery pack's BMS. The [[Smart Battery System]] standard is commonly used to define this connection, which includes the [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] and the communications protocol between the charger and battery. There are other ''ad-hoc'' specifications also used.

Smart battery controller [[integrated circuits]] are available.

It was a commitment that for new technical [[innovation]] in the industry, that innovation should also include improvements in the [[Natural environment|environment]], [[health]], and [[social issues]] that follow.  It is an electronic [[sustainability]] commitment that technical improvements should correspond to environmental and health improvements.

'''Solids control''' is a technique used in a drilling rig to separate the solids in the drilling fluids that are crushed by the drill bits and carried out of the well surface. Normally, a solid control system contains five stages: the mud tank, shale shaker, vacuum degasser, desander, desilter, and centrifuge. The shale shaker is used to separate big solids with diameter above 75μm, the [http://www.aipusolidcontrol.com/html/products/desander.html desander] addresses solids from 45-74μm, and the desilter segregates solids between 15-44μm. Sometimes the desander and  desilter are combined as one high efficiency mud cleaner. When air enters the drilling fluids, a vacuum degasser is used to separate the air. When there is no air in the mud, the degasser works as a big agitator. All these stages are mounted on the top of the mud tank. After separating the solids, the clean mud can be pumped into the borehole again.

Actually, we call mud system as 4 phases solids control process or the 5 phase purification system. From shale shaker, vacuum degasser, to Desander cone, Desilter cone, and the decanting centrifuge. Different working principle, different separation point. Every well drilling request such a system to process drilling mud. However, per different well depth, different drilling condition we'll get different configuration and different result. 

Recent advances in solids control include the creation of a closed loop system which allows for increased environmental control and reduction in the potential for spills of drilling fluids.  Several US states have either passed or are considering the implementation of closed loop systems, particularly for hydro-fracturing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/localnews/Oil-and-gas-rules--revisited|title=State regulators consider revisions to oil, gas rules|publisher=[[Santa Fe New Mexican]]|date=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{original research|date=May 2012}}
A '''technology evangelist''' is a person who builds a [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] of support for a given technology, and then establishes it as a [[technical standard]] in a market that is subject to [[network effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology Evangelists: A Leadership Survey|url=https://www.gri.co/pub/res/pdf/TechEvangelist.pdf|publisher=Growth Resources, Inc.|accessdate=22 May 2012|author=Frederic Lucas-Conwell|date=December 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''evangelism'' is taken from the context of [[evangelism|religious evangelism]] due to the similarity of relaying information about a particular set of beliefs with the intention of converting the recipient. There is some element of this although some would argue it's more of showcasing the potential of a technology to lead someone to want to adopt it for themselves. 

==Target areas==
[[Platform evangelism]] is one target of technology evangelism, in which the vendor of a [[Two-sided market|two-sided platform]] attempts to accelerate the production of [[complementary goods]] by independent developers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invisible Engines: How Software Platforms Drive Innovation and Transform Industries|last=Evans|first=David|last2=Hagiu|first2=Andrei|last3=Schmalensee|first3=Richard|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=0262050854|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''e.g.'', [[Facebook]] encourages developers to create games or develop mobile apps that can enhance users' experiences with Facebook.).

Professional technology evangelists are often employed by firms seeking to establish their technologies as [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standards]]. Their work could also entail the training of personnel, including top managers so that they acquire skills and competencies necessary to adopt new technology or new technological initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Adoption and Social Issues: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|last=Information Resources management Association|first=|publisher=IGI Global|year=2018|isbn=9781522552017|location=Hershey, PA|pages=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are even instances when technology evangelism becomes an aspect of a managerial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=BIM and Integrated Design: Strategies for Architectural Practice|last=Deutsch|first=Randy|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781118086445|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Open-source evangelist]]s, on the other hand, operate independently. Evangelists also participate in defining [[open standards]]. Non-professional technology evangelists may act out of [[altruism]] or self-interest (''e.g.'', to gain the benefits of [[Early adopter|early adoption]] or  network effect).

==History of term==
The term "software evangelist" was coined by Mike Murray of [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Macintosh computer]] division.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Kawasaki]], ''[[The Macintosh Way]]'', p2.&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of Apple's drive to compete with [[IBM]] and it specifically described the initiative to win over third-party developers rhetorically to persuade them to develop software and applications for the [[Macintosh]] platform.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Software Evangelism and the Rhetoric of Morality: Coding Justice in a Digital Democracy|last=Maher|first=Jennifer Helene|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780415704243|location=New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first so-identified technology evangelist was [[Mike Boich]] — who promoted the Macintosh computer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Kawasaki]], ''[[The Macintosh Way]]'', p100.&lt;/ref&gt; The job is often closely related to both sales and training but requires specific technology marketing skills. For example, convincing a potential buyer or user to change from older methods to new ones. There is also the case of adopting new products such as [[Green computing|green IT]]. The marketing aspect involved in technology evangelism was strongly influenced by [[Geoffrey Moore]] and his books concerning the [[technology adoption lifecycle]]. One of his positions maintain that the role of the evangelist becomes critical when addressing what he identified as the "chasm" that exists between early and mainstream adoption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering the Hype Cycle: How to Choose the Right Innovation at the Right Time|last=Fenn|first=Jackie|last2=Raskino|first2=Mark|publisher=Harvard Business Press|year=2008|isbn=9781422121108|location=Boston, MA|pages=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Technology evangelism is sometimes associated with an internal employee assigned to encourage new practices within an organization. Methods of evangelism available include a modified STREET process (scope, track, rank, evaluate, evangelize, transfer) and the process that takes advantage of the hype cycle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Evangelism can also assume the form of a learning process and employ tools such as the [[Learning management system|Learning Management Systems]] (LMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Web-Based Education: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools and Applications, volume 1|last=Information Resources Management Association|first=|publisher=IGI Global|year=2010|isbn=9781615209637|location=Hershey, PA|pages=681}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Notable technology evangelists==
Notable technology evangelists{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} in the commercial arena include [[Steve Jobs]] (Apple Inc.), [[Vint Cerf]] ([[Internet]]), [[Don Box]], [[Guy Kawasaki]], [[Alex St. John]], [[Myriam Joire]] ([[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]]), Mudasser Zaheer ([[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]]) and Dan Martin ([[MasterCard]]).

Microsoft|''de facto'' standard PC operating system]]. Kawasaki, on the other hand, was credited for the remarkable growth of the software developed for the Macintosh, jumping from a few dozen products to more than 600 in less than a year of spreading the so-called Macintosh gospel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Electronics|electronic]] [[instrumentation]] and [[signal processing]], a '''time to digital converter''' (abbreviated '''TDC''') is a device for recognizing events and providing a digital representation of the [[time]] they occurred. For example, a TDC might output the time of arrival for each incoming pulse. Some applications wish to measure the time interval between two events rather than some notion of an absolute time.

In [[electronics]] '''time-to-digital converters''' (TDCs) or '''time digitizers''' are devices commonly used to measure a time interval and convert it into digital (binary) output. In some cases &lt;ref name=Kalisz&gt;{{Citation |title=Review of methods for time interval measurements with picosecond resolution |first=Józef |last=Kalisz |journal=Metrologia |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages= 17–32 |date=February 2004 |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/41/1/004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Interpolation|interpolating]] TDCs are also called '''time counters''' (TCs).

TDCs are used in many different applications, where the time interval between two signal pulses (start and stop pulse) should be determined. Measurement is started and stopped, when either the rising or the falling edge of a signal pulse crosses a set threshold. These requirements are fulfilled in many physical experiments, like [[time-of-flight]] and lifetime measurements in [[atomic physics|atomic]] and [[particle physics|high energy physics]], experiments that involve [[laser rangefinder|laser ranging]] and electronic research involving the testing of [[integrated circuits]] and high-speed data transfer.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt;

==Application==
TDCs are used in applications where measurement events happen infrequently, such as [[high energy physics]] [[experiment]]s, where the sheer number of data [[channel (communications)|channels]] in most detectors ensures that each channel will be excited only infrequently by particles such as electrons, photons, and ions.

==Coarse measurement==
[[File:CMOS TW OSC 000.png|thumb|right|A CMOS (rotary) traveling wave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] or [[Digital delay line|delay line]] or [[distributed amplifier]] runs at a flip-flop compatible frequency, but has sharper edges and sub-edge resolution]]

If the required time resolution is not high, then counters can be used to make the conversion.

===Basic counter===
&lt;!-- this is a straight time measurement; capture count; no start signal --&gt;

In its simplest implementation, a TDC is simply a high-[[frequency]] [[Counter (digital)|counter]] that increments every clock cycle. The current contents of the counter represents the current time. When an event occurs, the counter's value is captured in an output register.

In that approach, the measurement is an integer number of clock cycles, so the measurement is quantized to a clock period. To get finer resolution, a faster clock is needed. The accuracy of the measurement depends upon the stability of the clock frequency.

Typically a TDC uses a [[crystal oscillator]] reference frequency for good long term stability. High stability crystal oscillators are usually relative low frequency such as 10&amp;nbsp;MHz (or 100&amp;nbsp;ns resolution).&lt;ref&gt;For example, a Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) 10811 crystal oven oscillator; http://www.hparchive.com/Manuals/HP-10811AB-Manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To get better resolution, a [[phase-locked loop]] frequency multiplier can be used to generate a faster clock. One might, for example, multiply the crystal reference oscillator by 100 to get a clock rate of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz (1&amp;nbsp;ns resolution).

====Counter technology====
High clock rates impose additional design constraints on the counter: if the clock period is short, it is difficult to update the count. Binary counters, for example, need a fast carry architecture because they essentially add one to the previous counter value. A solution is using a hybrid counter architecture. A [[Ring counter|Johnson counter]], for example, is a fast non-binary counter. It can be used to count very quickly the low order count; a more conventional binary counter can be used to accumulate the high order count. The fast counter is sometime called a [[prescaler]].

The speed of counters fabricated in [[CMOS]]-technology is limited by the capacitance between the gate and the channel and by the resistance of the channel and the signal traces. The product of both is the cut-off-frequency. Modern chip technology allows multiple metal layers and therefore coils with a large number of windings to be inserted into the chip.
This allows designers to peak the device for a specific [[frequency]], which may lie above the cut-off-frequency of the original transistor.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A peaked variant of the Johnson counter is the [[distributed amplifier|traveling-wave]] counter which also achieves sub-cycle resolution. Other methods to achieve sub-cycle resolution include [[analog-to-digital converter]]s and [[Vernier scale|vernier]] [[Counter (digital)|Johnson counters]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====Measuring a time interval====
[[File:CoarseCounting.png|thumb|sketch of the coarse counting method in TDCs: showing measurements of T in various relations to the clock pulses]]

In most situations, the user does not want to just capture an arbitrary time that an event occurs, but wants to measure a time interval, the time between a start event and a stop event.

That can be done by measuring an arbitrary time both the start and stop events and subtracting. The measurement can be off by two counts.

The subtraction can be avoided if the counter is held at zero until the start event, counts during the interval, and then stops counting after the stop event.

'''Coarse counters''' base on a [[clock signal|reference clock]] with signals generated at a stable [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt; When the start signal is detected the [[Counter (digital)|counter]] starts counting clock signals and terminates counting after the stop signal is detected. The time interval &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; between start and stop is then

:&lt;math&gt; T = n\cdot T_0 &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the number of counts and &lt;math&gt;T_0 = 1/f_0&lt;/math&gt;, the period of the [[clock signal|reference clock]].

===Statistical counter===
Since start, stop and [[clock signal]] are asynchronous, there is a uniform [[probability distribution]] of the start and stop signal-times between two subsequent clock pulses. This detuning of the start and stop signal from the clock pulses is called [[quantization error]].

For a series of measurements on the same constant and asynchronous time interval one measures two different numbers of counted clock pulses &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; (see picture). These occur with [[probabilities]]

:&lt;math&gt; p(n_1) = 1 - c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q(n_2) = c&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;c = Frc(T/T_0)&lt;/math&gt; the [[fractional part]] of &lt;math&gt;T/T_0&lt;/math&gt;. The value for the time interval is then obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;T = (p\cdot n_1 + q\cdot n_2)\cdot T_0&lt;/math&gt;

Measuring a time interval using a coarse counter with the averaging method described above is relatively time consuming because of the many repetitions that are needed to determine the probabilities &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. In comparison to the other methods described later on, a coarse counter has a very limited resolution (1ns in case of a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz [[clock signal|reference clock]]), but satisfies with its theoretically unlimited measuring range.

==Fine measurement==

In contrast to the coarse counter in the previous section, fine measurement methods with much better accuracy but far smaller measuring range are presented here.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt; [[analog signal|Analogue]] methods like time interval stretching or double conversion as well as [[Digital data|digital]] methods like tapped delay lines and the Vernier method are under examination. Though the [[analog signal|analogue]] methods still obtain better accuracies, [[Digital data|digital]] time interval measurement is often preferred due to its flexibility in [[integrated circuit]] technology and its robustness against external perturbations like temperature changes.

The counter implementation's accuracy is limited by the clock frequency. If time is measured by whole counts, then the resolution is limited to the clock period. For example, a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz clock has a resolution of 100&amp;nbsp;ns. To get resolution finer than a clock period, there are time interpolation circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Time and Frequency from A to Z |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |year= |url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-ti.htm |quote=For example, multiplying the time base frequency to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz makes 10&amp;nbsp;ns resolution possible, and 1&amp;nbsp;ns counters have even been built using a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz time base. However, a more common way to increase resolution is to detect parts of a time base cycle through interpolation and not be limited by the number of whole cycles. Interpolation has made 1&amp;nbsp;ns TICs commonplace, and even 20&amp;nbsp;picosecond TICs are available. |doi= }}, entry for ''time interval counter''.&lt;/ref&gt; These circuits measure the fraction of a clock period: that is, the time between a clock event and the event being measured. The interpolation circuits often require a significant amount of time to perform their function; consequently, the TDC needs a quiet interval before the next measurement.

===Ramp interpolator===

When counting is not feasible because the clock rate would be too high, analog methods can be used. Analog methods are often used to measure intervals that are between 10 and 200&amp;nbsp;ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kalisz|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods often use a capacitor that is charged during the interval being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Reeser |first=Gilbert A. |title=An Electronic Counter for the 1970's |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |date=May 1969 |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=9&amp;ndash;12 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1969-05.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sasaki"&gt;{{Citation |first=Gary D. |last=Sasaki |first2=Ronald C. |last2=Jensen |title=Automatic Measurements with a High Performance Universal Counter |date=September 1980 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1980-09.pdf |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=21&amp;ndash;31 |issn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Rush |first=Kenneth |last2=Oldfield |first2=Danny J. |title=A Data Acquisition System for a 1-GHz Digitizing Oscilloscope |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |date=April 1986 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=4&amp;ndash;11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Eskeldson |first=David D. |last2=Kellum |first2=Reginald |last3=Whiteman |first3=Donald A. |title=A Digitizing Oscilloscope Time Base and Trigger System Optimized for Throughput and Low Jitter |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |date=October 1993 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=21&amp;ndash;30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the capacitor is discharged to zero volts. When the start event occurs, the capacitor is charged with a constant current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; the constant current causes the voltage ''v'' on the capacitor to increase linearly with time. The rising voltage is called the fast ramp. When the stop event occurs, the charging current is stopped. The voltage on the capacitor ''v'' is directly proportional to the time interval ''T'' and can be measured with an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC). The resolution of such a system is in the range of 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;ps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalisz|2004|p=20}}. Kalisz states that the [[Stanford Research Systems]] SR620 uses this method.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a separate ADC can be used, the ADC step is often integrated into the interpolator. A second constant current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used to discharge the capacitor at a constant but much slower rate (the slow ramp). The slow ramp might be 1/1000 of the fast ramp. This discharge effectively "stretches" the time interval;&lt;ref name="Esk p27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eskeldson|Kellum|Whiteman|1993|p=27}} stating, "Effectively, the interpolator magnifies the interpolation or uncertainty interval by the ratio of the charge and discharge currents."&lt;/ref&gt; it will take 1000 times as long for the capacitor to discharge to zero volts. The stretched interval can be measured with a counter. The measurement is similar to a [[Integrating ADC|dual-slope analog converter]].

The dual-slope conversion can take a long time: a thousand or so clock ticks in the scheme described above. That limits how often a measurement can be made (dead time). Resolution of 1&amp;nbsp;ps with a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz (10&amp;nbsp;ns) clock requires a stretch ratio of 10,000 and implies a conversion time of 150&amp;nbsp;&amp;mu;s.&lt;ref name="Esk p27"/&gt; To decrease the conversion time, the interpolator circuit can be used twice in a '''residual interpolator technique'''.&lt;ref name="Esk p27"/&gt; The fast ramp is used initially as above to determine the time. The slow ramp is only at 1/100. The slow ramp will cross zero at some time during the clock period. When the ramp crosses zero, the fast ramp is turned on again to measure the crossing time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;residual&lt;/sub&gt;). Consequently, the time can be determined to 1 part in 10,000.

Interpolators are often used with a stable system clock. The start event is asynchronous, but the stop event is a following clock.&lt;ref name="Sasaki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"/&gt;  For convenience, imagine that the fast ramp rises exactly 1&amp;nbsp;volt during a 100 ns clock period. Assume the start event occurs at 67.3&amp;nbsp;ns after a clock pulse; the fast ramp integrator is triggered and starts rising. The asynchronous start event is also routed through a synchronizer that takes at least two clock pulses. By the next clock pulse, the ramp has risen to .327&amp;nbsp;V. By the second clock pulse, the ramp has risen to 1.327&amp;nbsp;V and the synchronizer reports the start event has been seen. The fast ramp is stopped and the slow ramp starts. The synchronizer output can be used to capture system time from a counter. After 1327 clocks, the slow ramp returns to its starting point, and interpolator knows that the event occurred 132.7&amp;nbsp;ns before the synchronizer reported.

The interpolator is actually more involved because there are synchronizer issues and current switching is not instantaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eskeldson|Kellum|Whiteman|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the interpolator must calibrate the height of the ramp to a clock period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sasaki|Jensen|1980|p=23}} stating, "In practice, the current sources and other circuitry used to build the interpolators are subject to operational variations over temperature and time. The 5360A's interpolators were in a special insulated cavity and had several adjustments. The 5335A uses a self-calibration technique that is not affected by temperature and needs no adjustments."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vernier===
&lt;!-- these need to be merged --&gt;

====Vernier interpolator====
The vernier method is more involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chu |first1=David C. |last2=Allen |first2=Mark S. |last3=Foster |first3=Allen S. |title=Universal Counter Resolves Picoseconds in Time Interval Measurements |date=August 1978 |journal=HP Journal |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=2&amp;ndash;11 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-08.pdf |issn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method involves a triggerable oscillator&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chu |first1=David C. |title=The Triggered Phase-Locked Oscillator |date=August 1978 |journal=HP Journal |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=8&amp;ndash;9 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-08.pdf |issn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a coincidence circuit. At the event, the integer clock count is stored and the oscillator is started. The triggered oscillator has a slightly different frequency than the clock oscillator. For sake of argument, say the triggered oscillator has a period that is 1&amp;nbsp;ns faster than the clock. If the event happened 67&amp;nbsp;ns after the last clock, then the triggered oscillator transition will slide by &amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;ns after each subsequent clock pulse. The triggered oscillator will be at 66&amp;nbsp;ns after the next clock, at 65&amp;nbsp;ns after the second clock, and so forth. A coincidence detector looks for when the triggered oscillator and the clock transition at the same time, and that indicates the fraction time that needs to be added.

The interpolator design is more involved. The triggerable clock must be calibrated to clock. It must also start quickly and cleanly.

====Vernier method====
&lt;!-- this uses two startable oscillators; most implementations will use a stable clock and a startable oscillator --&gt;

The '''Vernier method''' is a [[Digital data|digital]] version of the time stretching method. Two only slightly detuned [[oscillation|oscillators]] (with [[frequencies]] &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;) start their signals with the arrival of the start and the stop signal. As soon as the leading edges of the [[oscillation|oscillator]] signals coincide the measurement ends and the number of periods of the oscillators (&lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively) lead to the original time interval &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{n_1-1}{f_1} - \frac{n_2-1}{f_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Since highly reliable [[oscillation|oscillators]] with stable and accurate [[frequency]] are still quite a challenge one also realizes the vernier method via two tapped delay lines using two slightly different cell delay times &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. This setting is called '''differential delay line''' or '''vernier delay line'''.

In the example presented here the first delay line affiliated with the start signal contains cells of D-[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s with delay &lt;math&gt;\tau_L&lt;/math&gt; which are initially set to transparent. During the transition of the start signal through one of those cells, the signal is delayed by &lt;math&gt;\tau_L&lt;/math&gt; and the state of the flip-flop is sampled as transparent. The second delay line belonging to the stop signal is composed of a series of [[operational amplifier#Applications|non-inverting buffers]] with delay &lt;math&gt;\tau_B &lt; \tau_L&lt;/math&gt;. Propagating through its channel the stop signal latches the flip-flops of the start signal's delay line. As soon as the stop signal passes the start signal, the latter is stopped and all leftover flip-flops are sampled opaque. Analogous to the above case of the oscillators the wanted time interval &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;T = n\cdot (\tau_1 - \tau_2)&lt;/math&gt;

with n the number of cells marked as transparent.

===Tapped delay line===
[[File:TapDelayLine.png|thumb|circuit diagram of a tapped delay line]]

In general a '''tapped delay line''' contains a number of cells with well defined delay times &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Propagating through this line the start signal is delayed. The state of the line is sampled at the time of the arrival of the stop signal.
This can be realized for example with a line of D-flip-flop cells with a delay time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The start signal propagates through this line of transparent [[flip-flops]] and is delayed by a certain number of them. The output of each flip-flop is sampled on the fly. The stop signal latches all [[flip-flops]] while propagating through its channel undelayed and the start signal cannot propagate further. Now the time interval between start and stop signal is proportional to the number of [[flip-flops]] that were sampled as transparent.

==Hybrid measurement==
[[File:Nutt.png|thumb|Sketch of the Nutt interpolation method]]
&lt;!-- terminology clash: interpolation (used above) and interpolator = synchronizer and fine method --&gt;

Counters can measure long intervals but have limited resolution. Interpolators have high resolution but they cannot measure long intervals. A hybrid approach can achieve both long intervals and high resolution.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt;  The long interval can be measured with a counter. The counter information is supplemented with two time interpolators: one interpolator measures the (short) interval between the start event and a following clock event, and the second interpolator measure the interval between the stop event and a following clock event. The basic idea has some complications: the start and stop events are asynchronous, and one or both might happen close to a clock pulse. The counter and interpolators must agree on matching the start and end clock events. To accomplish that goal, synchronizers are used.

The common hybrid approach is the '''Nutt method'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kalisz |first=J. |last2=Pawlowski |first2=M. |last3=Pelka |first3=R. |year=1987 |title=Error analysis and design of the Nutt time-interval digitiser with picosecond resolution |publisher= |journal=J. Phys. E: Sci. Instrum. |volume=20 |issue= |pages=1330&amp;ndash;1341 |issn= |doi= 10.1088/0022-3735/20/11/005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example the fine measurement circuit measures the time between start and stop pulse and the respective second nearest clock pulse of the coarse counter (''T''&lt;sub&gt;start&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;stop&lt;/sub&gt;), detected by the synchronizer (see figure). Thus the wanted time interval is

:&lt;math&gt;T = n T_0 + T_{\mathrm{start}} - T_{\mathrm{stop}}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''n'' the number of counter clock pulses and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the period of the coarse counter.

==History==

Time measurement has played a crucial role in the understanding of nature from the earliest times. Starting with sun, sand or water driven [[clocks]] we are able to use clocks today, based on the most precise [[caesium]] resonators.

The first direct predecessor of a TDC was invented in the year 1942 by [[Bruno Rossi]] for the measurement of [[muon]] lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;"Bruno Benedetto Rossi", George W. Clark, National Academic Press, Washington D.C. 1998, S.13&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed as a '''time-to-amplitude-converter''', constantly charging a [[capacitor]] during the measured time interval. The corresponding [[voltage]] is directly proportional to the time interval under examination.

While the basic concepts (like Vernier methods ([[Pierre Vernier]] 1584-1638) and time stretching) of dividing time into measurable intervals are still up-to-date, the implementation changed a lot during the past 50 years. Starting with [[vacuum tubes]] and [[transformer types#RF transformers|ferrite pot-core transformers]] those ideas are implemented in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ([[CMOS]]) design today.&lt;ref&gt;"Noise Shaping Techniques for Analog and Time to Digital Converters Using Voltage Controlled Oscillators", Matthew A.Z. Straayer, Phd-Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Errors==
:&lt;small&gt;Some information from &lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
Regarding even the fine measuring methods presented, there are still errors one may wish remove or at least to consider. Non-linearities of the time-to-digital conversion for example can be identified by taking a large number of measurements of a [[poissonian]] distributed source (statistical code density test).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Pelka |first=R. |last2=Kalisz |first2=J. |last3=Szplet |first3=R. |year=1997 |title=Nonlinearity correction of the integrated time-to-digital converter with direct coding |journal=IEEE Trans. Instrumentation and Measurement |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=449–452 |doi=10.1109/19.571882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small deviations from the uniform distribution reveal the non-linearities.
Inconveniently the statistical code density method is quite sensitive to external temperature changes. Thus stabilizing [[delay-locked loop|delay]] or [[phase-locked loop]] (DLL or PLL) circuits are recommended.

In a similar way, offset errors (non-zero readouts at ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) can be removed.

For long time intervals, the error due to instabilities in the [[clock signal|reference clock]] ([[jitter]]) plays a major role. Thus clocks of superior quality are needed for such TDCs.

Furthermore, external noise sources can be eliminated in postprocessing by [[robust statistic|robust estimation methods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kalisz |first=J. |last2=Pawlowski |first2=M. |last3=Pelka |first3=R. |date=March 1994 |title=Precision time counter for laser ranging to satellites |journal=Rev. Sci. Instrum. |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=736–741 |doi=10.1063/1.1145094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Configurations==

TDCs are currently built as stand-alone measuring devices in physical experiments or as system components like PCI cards. They can be made up of either discrete or integrated circuits.

Circuit design changes with the purpose of the TDC, which can either be a very good solution for single-shot TDCs with long dead times or some trade-off between dead-time and resolution for multi-shot TDCs.

==Delay generator==
[[File:TDC DTC 000.png|thumb|right|Similarity between a '''TDC''' (bottom) and a '''Delay Generator''' (top, but needs bottom for trigger). The strobe is gated by the oscillator to avoid a race with the carry bit]]
{{main|Digital delay generator}}

The time-to-digital converter measures the time between a start event and a stop event. There is also a '''digital-to-time converter''' or '''delay generator'''. The delay generator converts a number to a time delay. When the delay generator gets a start pulse at its input, then it outputs a stop pulse after the specified delay. The architectures for TDC and delay generators are similar. Both use counters for long, stable, delays. Both must consider the problem of clock quantization errors.

For example, the [[Tektronix]] 7D11 Digital Delay uses a counter architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Tektronix 7D11 Digital Delay Service Instruction Manual |publisher=Tektronix |location=Beaverton, OR |id=070-1377-01 |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital delay may be set from 100&amp;nbsp;ns to 1&amp;nbsp;s in 100&amp;nbsp;ns increments. An analog circuit provides an additional fine delay of 0 to 100&amp;nbsp;ns. A 5&amp;nbsp;MHz reference clock drives a [[phase-locked loop]] to produce a stable 500&amp;nbsp;MHz clock. It is this fast clock that is gated by the (fine-delayed) start event and determines the main quantization error. The fast clock is divided down to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz and fed to main counter.&lt;ref&gt;Ten megahertz is a frequency that TTL logic in 1971 could handle. The high frequency divisions were handled with different technologies because high speed digital counters were uncommon in 1971. The first (500&amp;nbsp;MHz) divider stage is a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz synchronized [[multivibrator]] to effect a divide by 5 circuit. The second (100&amp;nbsp;MHz) stage is a divide by 5 ring counter made from discrete emitter-coupled transistors. The last stage is a flip-flop.&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument quantization error depends primarily on the 500&amp;nbsp;MHz clock (2&amp;nbsp;ns steps), but other errors also enter; the instrument is specified to have 2.2&amp;nbsp;ns of [[jitter]]. The recycle time is 575&amp;nbsp;ns.

Just as a TDC may use interpolation to get finer than one clock period resolution, a delay generator may use similar techniques. The [[Hewlett-Packard]] 5359A High Resolution Time Synthesizer provides delays of 0 to 160&amp;nbsp;ms, has an accuracy of 1&amp;nbsp;ns, and achieves a typical jitter of 100&amp;nbsp;ps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Time Synthesizer Generates Precise Pulse Widths and Time Delays for Critical Timing Applications |first1=Keith M. |last1=Ferguson |first2=Leonard R. |last2=Dickstein |journal=HP Journal |volume=29 |issue=12 |date=August 1978 |pages=12–19 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design uses a triggered phase-locked oscillator that runs at 200&amp;nbsp;MHz. Interpolation is done with a ramp, an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter, and a comparator. The resolution is about 45&amp;nbsp;ps.

&lt;!-- stuff from earlier version --&gt;
When the start pulse is received, then [[Counter (digital)|count]]s down and outputs a stop pulse. For low [[jitter]] the [[Counter (digital)|synchronous counter]] has to feed a [[Status register|zero flag]] from the [[most significant bit]] down to the [[least significant bit]] and then combine it with the output from the Johnson counter.

A [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) could be used to achieve sub-cycle resolution, but it is easier to either use vernier Johnson counters or traveling-wave Johnson counters.

The delay generator can be used for [[pulse width modulation]], e.g. to drive a [[MOSFET]] to load a [[Pockels cell]] within 8 ns with a specific charge.

The output of a delay generator can gate a digital-to-analog converter and so pulses of a variable height can be generated. This allows matching to low levels needed by analog electronics, higher levels for [[Emitter-coupled logic|ECL]] and even higher levels for [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]]. If a series of DACs is gated in sequence, variable pulse shapes can be generated to account for any transfer function.

[[File:The Royal Navy in the Interwar Period Q70606.jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Nelson|28|6}} was the first treaty battleship]]{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:HMS Nelson (1925).jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Nelson|28|6}}, the first Treaty battleship]] --&gt;
A '''treaty battleship''' was a [[battleship]] built in the 1920s or 1930s under the terms of one of a number of international [[treaty|treaties]] governing [[warship]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;Sumrall, p.25-8&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these ships played an active role in the [[Second World War]], but few survived long after it.

In the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, the world's five naval powers agreed to abide by strict restrictions on the construction of battleships and [[battlecruiser]]s, in order to prevent an [[arms race]] in naval construction such as preceded the [[Great War]]. The Treaty limited the number of capital ships possessed by each signatory, and also the total [[Displacement (ship)|tonnage]] of each navy's battleships. New ships could only be constructed to replace the surviving ships as they retired after 20 years' service. Furthermore, any new ship would be limited to guns of 16-inch caliber and a displacement of 35,000 tons.

The Washington Treaty limits were extended and modified by the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930 and the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] of 1936. During the 1930s, however, the effectiveness of these agreements broke down, as some signatory powers (in particular Japan) withdrew from the treaty arrangements and others only paid lip service to them. By 1938, Britain and the USA had both invoked an 'escalator clause' in the Second London Treaty which allowed battleships of up to 45,000 tons displacement, and the Treaty was effectively defunct.

The strict limits on displacement forced the designers of battleships to make compromises which they might have wished to avoid given the choice. The 1920s and 1930s saw a number of innovations in battleship design, particularly in engines, underwater protection, and aircraft.

==Washington Treaty and the 1920s==

The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] was signed in 1922 by [[United Kingdom|Britain]], France, the United States, Japan and Italy, as the five powers which had any significant numbers of modern [[dreadnought]] battleships and battlecruisers. The Treaty was aimed at preventing an expensive arms race, principally between Britain, the USA and Japan. The Treaty established a definition of a [[capital ship]], which was any ship with a displacement of 10,000 tons or more, or with guns above 8 in (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  calibre, apart from an [[aircraft carrier]]. Carriers were specifically constrained from having guns above 8&amp;nbsp;in calibre, in order to prevent confusion between the two types. Each signatory agreed to limit its total number of capital ships, and its total tonnage of capital ships. These measures meant that several classes of battleships and battlecruisers which were planned, or had even been begun, were scrapped or cancelled.

In addition, each new ship was limited in size to 35,000 tons displacement, and to guns of {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre. Only one vessel already finished, the British battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}, exceeded these limits; however, many of the new ships planned or being built were significantly larger.  The Treaty permitted the improvement of existing warships, but limited the resulting increase in displacement at 3,000 tons.

The Treaty also introduced a 'building holiday'. In general, a new ship could only be begun if one of the ships allowed by the Treaty had been in service for 20 years. This meant that for most signatory powers, no new ships could be begun until the 1930s. An exception was made for Britain; the Royal Navy had no existing ships with 16-inch guns, while both the U.S. Navy and Japan had 16-inch ships already in commission which would be allowed to continue under the terms of the Treaty.

These first British treaty battleships became the {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship|4}}, which were begun in 1922 and launched in 1925. The ''Nelson'' class solved the problem posed by the new weight restriction by placing all the heavy guns forward of the superstructure in three triple turrets, hence saving weight on the armour around them.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

==London Treaties==

These limits were reiterated by the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930, and the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] of 1936 further limited guns to 14-inch calibre.  The Second London Treaty contained a clause which allowed construction of battleships with 16-inch guns if any of the signatories of the Washington Treaty failed to ratify the new one.  It contained an additional clause which allowed displacement restrictions to be relaxed if non-signatories built vessels more powerful than the treaty allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.71-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-089_London_Treaty_1936.htm Second London Naval Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all battleships built subsequently obeyed the treaty limits. The Washington Naval Treaty was signed by the USA, UK, Japan, France and Italy - all the principal naval powers. At various stages Italy and France opted out of further negotiations; however, their economic resources did not permit the development of super-battleships. Germany, while not permitted any battleships by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], developed one in the 1930s; this was legitimised by the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which placed Germany under the same legal limits as Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; Only Japan, which opted out of the Treaty system in 1934,{{Efn|Partially influenced by the passage of the [[Vinson-Trammell Act]] in 1934, and the [[National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933]], in 1934, Japan announced that they planned to leave the treaty system in two years. At the Second London conference, Japan showed willingness to negotiate, but left the conference in January, 1936.&lt;ref name="Kuehn2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNgM1XB9zgUC&amp;pg=PA64|title=Agents of Innovation: The General Board and the Design of the Fleet that Defeated the Japanese Navy|author=John T. Kuehn|date=10 July 2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-405-5|pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} actually built mammoth treaty-busting battleships - the {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|4}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sumrall, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of the treaty system led to the wartime construction of "post-treaty" battleships which exceeded the limitations: the German {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship|4}}, the U.S. {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|4}} and the British {{HMS|Vanguard|1946|6}} and (never completed) {{sclass-|Lion|battleship|4}}. A number of designs, never finished, shattered the treaty limits; the German [[H-class battleship proposals|H-class]] were scrapped on the outbreak of war, while the U.S. {{sclass-|Montana|battleship|4}} were canceled before being laid down.

==Technical change==

Treaty battleships were technically superior to their predecessors. Naval technology developed in the 1920s and 1930s provided improved steel, better guns, more efficient engines, and more effective protection against torpedoes. The displacement limit also encouraged naval designers to think creatively about minimising displacement, meaning that the treaty battleships significantly increased their performance.

The '''VIA pc-1 Initiative''' is a project of [[VIA Technologies]], established in January 2005, to help bridge the [[digital divide]] by developing [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) systems to benefit those who currently do not have [[computer]]s or [[Internet access]].

==Aims==

The project sought to increase individual PC and Internet access for those who could afford it, and community access for those who couldn't, via community access deployments in schools, offices, libraries, Internet cafes, village kiosks, and telecenters. The project also sought to enable PC and Internet access in remote regions. &lt;ref name="mumbai"&gt;{{Cite news |title= New VIA Technology Innovation Center in Mumbai to Develop Power Saving PHD Computing &amp; Connectivity Appliances for Global Markets |work= News release |date= January 23, 2006 |publisher= VIA Technologies |url= http://www.via.com.tw/en/resources/pressroom/2006_archive/pr060123IndiaInnovCtr-PHD.jsp |accessdate= October 16, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2006 a development center was opened in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name="mumbai"/&gt;

==Design Concepts==

The system platform architecture includes processors built by [[IBM]] using a 90-nanometer [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI) process with a VIA digital media chipset. 

==Systems==

VIA provides reference designs, but vendors use different brand names. Examples include iDot pc-1 systems in Taiwan, Longmeng pc-1 systems in [[China]], Geniac pc-1 systems in [[Nigeria]], Sico pc-1 systems in [[Egypt]], and Alaska pc-1 systems in [[Mexico]].

The pc1000 and pc1500 platforms were described in 2006, using the [[VIA C3]] processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= VIA pc-1 System Platform Architecture: Making Intrepid Computing a Reality |date= March 29, 2006 |work= White paper |publisher= VIA Technologies |url= http://www.viatech.com/en/downloads/whitepapers/initiatives/empowered/WP060327pc-1_SPA.zip |format= PDF |accessdate= October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= VIA's pc-1: Move Over AMD 50x15: Insiders reveal new CPUs, new platforms, new VIA |date=June 16, 2006 |author= Kristopher Kubicki |work= Daily Tech |url= http://www.dailytech.com/VIAs+pc1+Move+Over+AMD+50x15/article2892.htm |accessdate= October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pc3500 was introduced in August 2007 using the [[VIA C7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= VIA Introduces New pc3500 Mainboard |date=August 21, 2007 |author= Marco Chiappetta |work= Hot Hardware |url=http://hothardware.com/News/VIA-Introduces-New-pc3500-Mainboard/ |accessdate= October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
As a part of the pc-1 Initiative, VIA became involved in digital inclusion projects. These include working alongside the [[Geekcorps]] in [[Mali]] to design a computer for hot dusty conditions, as well as donating low-powered computers for use in Mali desert radio stations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

VIA worked with the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) Digital Opportunity Center (ADOC) to bridge the digital divide in emerging markets within [[Pacific Rim]] countries. One project includes donating 20 systems for use in the VIA pc-1 ICT Center at the [[Thailand|Thai]] Nguyen University of Agriculture and Forestry (TUAF) in the Northern Mountainous Area (NMA) of [[Vietnam]]. VIA worked with ADOC and the Institute for Information Industry (Taiwan) on an affordable computing advocacy project.

VIA works with the Samoan Ministry of ICT to establish [[Samoa]]'s first solar powered information center, arranging for solar cells and computers to be provided.

In [[South Africa]], VIA worked with Ikamvayouth in several projects - most recently{{when|date=October 2011}} providing computers and thin clients for a tuXlab IT center at the Nazeema Isaacs Library in [[Khayelitsha]].

'''Victor Mikhailovich Glushkov''' ({{lang-ru|Ви́ктор Миха́йлович Глушко́в||p= 'vʲiktər mʲi'xajləvʲɪt͡ɕ ɡlʊʂ'kof|a=Ru-Victor Mikhailovich Glushkov.ogg}}; August 24, 1923 &amp;ndash; January 30, 1982) was a Soviet mathematician&lt;ref&gt;[https://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/79889/Глушков Victor Glushkov in [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]]&lt;/ref&gt;, the founding father of [[information technology]] in the [[Soviet Union]], and one of the founders of [[Cybernetics]].
He was born in [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Russian SFSR]], in the family of a mining engineer. Glushkov graduated from [[Rostov State University]] in 1948, and in 1952 proposed solutions to [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] and defended his thesis in [[Moscow State University]].

In 1956 he began working with computers and worked in [[Kiev]] as a Director of the Computational Center of the [[Academy of Science of Ukraine]]. In 1958 he became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].

He made contributions to the [[theory of automata]]. He and his followers (Kapitonova, Letichevskiy and other) successfully applied that theory to enhance construction of computers. His book on that topic "Synthesis of Digital Automata" became well known. For that work, he was awarded the [[Lenin Prize]] in 1964 and elected as a Member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Science of USSR]].

He greatly influenced many other fields of theoretical computer science (including the theory of programming and artificial intelligence) as well as its applications in the [[USSR]]. He published nearly 800 printed works.

One of his great practical goals was the creation of a National Automatized System of Administration of Economy ([[OGAS]]), which included the establishment of a network of computers to manage the allocation of resources and information among organizations in the national economy, which would represent a higher form of [[Socialism|socialist planning]] than the extant Stalinist command economy. This ambitious project was ahead of its time, first being proposed and modeled in 1962. It received opposition from many senior Communist Party leaders who felt the system threatened Party control of the economy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} By the early 1970s official interest in this system ended.

Glushkov founded a Kiev-based Chair of Theoretical Cybernetics and Methods of Optimal [[Control theory|Control]] at the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] in 1967&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mipt.ru/institute/fizteh_ua/history.html The history of the MIPT Division in Kiev] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814090142/http://www.mipt.ru/institute/fizteh_ua/history.html |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Chair of Theoretical Cybernetics at [[Kiev State University]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''Welsh dresser''' ([[British English]]) or a '''china hutch''' ([[American English]]), sometimes known as a '''kitchen dresser''' or '''pewter cupboard''', is a piece of wooden furniture consisting of drawers and [[cupboards]] in the lower part, with shelves and perhaps a [[sideboard]] on top. Traditionally, it is a utilitarian piece of furniture used to store and display [[crockery]], [[Tableware|silverware]] and [[pewter]]-ware, but is also used to display general ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/Welsh-dresser Welsh dresser] Longman dictionary of contemporary English, Accessed 22 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/Welsh%20dresser Welsh dresser] Free dictionary cites: the English Collins Dictionary - English Definition &amp; Thesaurus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Percy W.

Originally, a dresser was located in the kitchen and was a utilitarian piece of furniture where meat and other food was dressed or prepared, while prepared food was placed on sideboards in the dining room ready to be served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis|first=Karen|year=2001|title=More than a meal: the turkey in history, myth, ritual, and reality |edition=illustrated |publisher=Lantern Books |isbn=1-930051-88-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NxHN2RKmI3gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 58] |quote='dresser' meaning the table on which meat and other foods were prepare}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightpricefurniture.co.uk/furniture/nd40-ns40-devonshire-new-solid-oak-4ft-6in-dresser-complete.aspx |title=2601 Dressers and Sideboards A brief History|publisher=RightPriceFurniture|accessdate=19 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They could be modified to suit local needs; for example, dressers in the Scottish Highlands may have a "porridge drawer"&amp;mdash;a tin lined drawer into which freshly made [[porridge]] was emptied and left to cool. When cold, slices of the porridge could be cut out and taken out of the house for later consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BBC staff|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7665854.stm |title=Secret weapon wins porridge title|date=12 October 2008 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually the purely utilitarian function of the dresser was supplemented with other functions, such as a means of displaying the best crockery in a farmhouse. Once it became a means of display the dresser could also be found in dining rooms where it served as sideboard and a place to store and display dinner ware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary Ellen |last=Snodgrass |year=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of kitchen history|edition=2, illustrated|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=1-57958-380-6 |page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7IhN7lempUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century various different styles of ceramics would evolve to fill the plate racks of the Welsh dressers of [[Wales]] and to meet the needs of the Welsh market. Furthermore, many local traditions of what constitutes the proper care and display of the items on a Welsh dresser would come to assume an important role in the culture of North Wales in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dai Davies|url=http://Welshdresser.org.uk/ |title=History of the Welsh Dresser|date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
